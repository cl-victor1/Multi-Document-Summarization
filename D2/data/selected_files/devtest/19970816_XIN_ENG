<HEADLINE> UK's Defense Projects Face Costly Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Substantial cost increases and
further delays in completing key defense projects ranging from the
Challenger 2 tank to the Eurofighter are disclosed in a report
presented to the British parliament today.
</P>
<P>
The cost of completing 23 of the most important programs has
risen by more than 2.19 billion US dollars or almost 9 percent. On
22 of the projects average delays have increased by five months to
40 months.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on the procurement projects, the National
Audit Office (NAO) revealed that cost over-runs and delays were
getting worse, despite repeated assurances from the Ministry of
Defense that it was taking a tighter grip on the program.
</P>
<P>
The NAO also revealed that procurement was so badly behind
schedule that Britain's defenses were being put at risk, and that
outdated ships, tanks and aircraft were being patched up at a cost
of 640 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that delays in replacing the assault ships
Fearless and Intrepid have left the Royal Navy facing difficulties
in launching an amphibious assault.
</P>
<P>
Six projects have been pushed back by 12 months or more in the
past year alone while in seven cases delays are now stretching to
five years.
</P>
<P>
The NAO complained that the Ministry of Defense failed to build
sufficient guarantees on reliability into the original contract.
"There are clear lessons to be learned from Challenger 2 on
contracting for reliability in other projects," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Defense said, "There is room for
improvement and the secretary of state is committed to
improvement." "We are doing so in some areas already -- we want to
build on best practice," it added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Delegation Returns From Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A 42-member Israeli Arab
delegation returned home today from a controversial visit to
Syria, saying that Damascus still wants to make peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which also included several lawmakers from the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties, paid a week-long visit to
Syria, during which they held talks with Syrian President Hafez
Assad and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon their return at the Ben-Gurion
Airport, Labor lawmaker Salah Tarif said that Syria is still
interested in making peace with Israel, though it believes the
policies of Israeli government are not conducive to concluding
peace.
</P>
<P>
Tarif denied criticism by some parliamentary members that he
presented a letter from Labor leader Ehud Barak to Assad.
</P>
<P>
Assad reportedly said that he could talk peace with Barak, if
the talks would be continued from the point where they broke off
last year under Israel's previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations have been frozen since March
last year following a wave of suicide bombing attacks launched by
Islamic extremists against Israel, and tension between the two
countries has been brewing after the hardline Likud government
came to power in Israel in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called for unconditional resumption of
the peace talks, while Syria insists that the negotiations should
restart from the point where they broke off: Israel's promise to
total withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
When receiving the Israeli delegation on Tuesday, Assad said
he is still committed to peace but keeping all options open at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being
an "enemy of peace," stressing that the talks should be
reconvened from where they broke off under the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile visit by the Israeli Arab delegation to Syria
caused a political uproar inside Israel. Lawmakers from the
rightist coalition strongly denounced the opposition members of
the delegation for acting like "traitors" by calling a return of
Palestinian refugees in Syria.
</P>
<P>
They also attacked Barak for sending a message to Assad in
which Barak called for the resumption of direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, Chairman of Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, said Barak was not acting like a political
leader with national duty and making a mistake by sending the
message to Assad.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Military to Purchase New Copters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Defense Minister Arthur
Eggleton will announce the winner of the bid to supply 16
search-and-rescue helicopters next month, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The minister also hopes to proceed quickly with the purchase of
ship-based helicopters, Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and
Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to be able to make a decision in September," Eggleton
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some bidders are hoping that the 430 million U.S. dollars'
search-and rescue deal will lead to the 1 billion dollars'
contract to supply the Navy with 35 maritime helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said he wants to move quickly to replace the
accident-prone, ship-borne Sea Kings helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Though the Canadian government has promised to replace the
copters, the cabinet has not yet approved the spending, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the (maritime purchase) is too far away,"
Eggleton noted.
</P>
<P>
After its election victory in 1993, the Liberal government led
by Jean Chretien canceled a 3.5 billion-dollar contract for 48
EH-101 helicopters, which were to serve both the search-and-rescue
operation and the ship-borne maritime defense.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Israel eased slightly the blockade it set up two weeks ago
around the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, allowing
Palestinians living in those areas to leave for the first time
since a suicide bombing in Jerusalem. But Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said the measures were inadequate and gave a speech in
Ramallah saying Israel's continued refusal to let Palestinian
workers into the country indicated that its government was not
prepared to pursue the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government said it would end cash disability
benefits for at least 95,180 children, mostly suffering from
mental disorders, representing more than half of all those whose
cases have been reviewed under strict new standards established by
the 1996 welfare law, Federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Two cosmonauts returned safely to Earth Thursday, ending a
troubled six-month voyage aboard the Mir space station, whose
frequent breakdowns threaten to cripple Russia's space program.
</P>
<P>
-- Footprints left on the sandy shore of a South African
lagoon after a violent rainstorm some 117,000 years ago, and
amazingly preserved, have been identified as the oldest fossilized
tracks of an anatomically modern human ever found.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- UPS and Teamsters resumed contract talks, and continued what
they called a "substantive and detailed" meeting into the night.
Neither side was willing to predict when the union's 12-day-old
strike might end.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-Fighters Picket Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans
protesting delays in releasing compensation funds, today picketed
offices of President Robert Mugabe, demanding to see him.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans sang revolutionary songs, danced and
disrupted the free-flow of traffic in the busy Samora Machel
Avenue just outside the main gate to the president's Munhumutapa
offices.
</P>
<P>
They then marched towards Compensation House just a street
away, which houses the office of Minister of Public Service,
Labour and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro, who froze the war
victims compensation cheques in March, this year after
discovering that the funds had been looted.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants staged demonstrations in the past few weeks
which often turned violent. Today They wanted to secure an
audience with Mugabe who is patron of the Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans Association.
</P>
<P>
''We are now going to have a fully-fledged demonstration. What
we want is to be given our money and that is all,'' said the war
veterans spokesman Mike Moyo.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants had spent most of the morning and part of
the afternoon outside the Ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
(PF) Harare provincial headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans began to converge on these offices on Thursday.
They vowed not to return to their homes until they had either been
addressed by Mugabe, or they had been given their cheques.
</P>
<P>
The money is to compensate them for injuries sustained in the
war that ushered in Zimbabwe's independence from British colonial
rule in 1980.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Four Hong Kong residents
drowned and three were missing in a sightseeing boat accident on
Manila Bay today, according to the Commissioner's Office of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines to the
Office said that a group of 45 HK tourists arrived at Manila this
morning and they went sightseeing on Manila Bay at 4:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, the boat, buffeted by strong winds and heavy
waves, capsized at a site not far from the headquarters of the
Philippine Navy, and all the Hong Kong tourists and a local guide
abroad fell into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine navy immediately dispatched vessels to their
rescue.
A total of 38 HK tourists survived, four (three females, one male)
drowned, and three (two females and one male) were missing. And
the rescue operation was still going on.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Embassy in Manila sent officials to the accident
scene, the hospital and the headquarters of the Philippine Navy.
The Chinese officials conveyed regards to the victims and bought
clothes and food to them.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks to Be Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Burundian government and main Hutu rebels will be held August 25
in the northern Tanzanian town Arusha in a bid to end four years
of civil war in the tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Burundian Minister of External Relations and
Cooperation Luc Rukingama confirmed here today that Burundian
President Pierre Buyoya will meet leaders of the Hutu-led
National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD) there.
</P>
<P>
"The political dialogue remains primarily the responsibility
of Burundi which will go to Arusha in conformity with her
commitments," the minister said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Arusha is the headquarters of the East Africa Cooperation
comprising Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and also the venue of an
U.N. tribunal on the 1994 genocide in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The expected talks mark that "Burundi enters into an important
stage of the peace process which started a year ago," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bloodshed conflicts reportedly broke out last month between
the CNDD and the rival Party for the Liberation of the Hutu
People (Palipehutu) which is said furious at the CNDD for
agreeing to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rukingama hailed Kenya's decision earlier this month to lift
its air travel ban on Burundi, urging other countries in the
Great Lakes Region to follow the suit.
</P>
<P>
Burundi experienced "a very hard time" due to the economic
embargo slapped by the Great Lakes countries last year when
Buyoya took power from the civilian government of former
president Sylvester Ntibantunganya in a military coup, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in Burundi is negative now, compared
with around three percent in 1993 when the civil war broke out,
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, following a regional summit on the Burundi conflict
on April 16 in Arusha, sanctions on the country were eased on
food, education, medicine, agricultural inputs and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
Rukingama arrived here for visit to Kenya earlier this week.
He has held discussioins with senior political and business
leaders of Kenya over bilateral relations and ways to ease the
sanctions on Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Watch Out for Revival of Japanese Militarism in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- As people in many Asian countries
marked the 52nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II
today, the evil spirits of Japanese class-A war criminals started
wriggling in the controversial Yasukuni Shrine where the farce of
prayers was being performed.
</P>
<P>
The shrine, which houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals including Japan's wartime prime minister, Hideki Tojo,
and other Japanese military personnel, is a symbol of militarism
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In continuous rain early this morning, a number of Japanese
right-wingers who dream of reviving militarism in the country
started their poor performances at the shrine by distributing
books which called for reversing the historical verdict on Japan's
invasion during World War II.
</P>
<P>
These maniacs termed Japan's invasion of other countries "a
self-defense war," aimed at liberating those Asian countries.
This is a sheer distortion of history.
</P>
<P>
In a hue and cry, they also made a claim that despite the loss,
Japan gained honor from its war against the whole world because it
struck terror into countries like the United States, Britain, the
former Soviet Union, France and China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they tried to seek testimony to deny the fact that
the Japanese invasion troops had forced women from many Asian
countries into sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
The farce at the shrine went on with an absurd march launched
by a group of elderly men in Imperial Army uniforms, carrying the
former World War II army flag.
</P>
<P>
A 71-year-old veteran, who joined the Japanese Imperial Army in
1942, told reporters that he paid respect to the "martyrs" every
year. There was absolutely no remorse in his words for his wartime
acts.
</P>
<P>
The shrine also saw 11 intellectuals standing erect in the rain
and reading in one voice a statement which called for the
Japanese prime minister to formally visit the Yasukuni shrine.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had already
formally announced he would not visit the shrine on August 15. Hashimoto
expressed deep remorse for Japan's role in World War II and
expressed deep condolences to war victims at another ceremony held in
Tokyo today.
</P>
<P>
"The last war caused tremendous pain and sorrow not only to our
country but also to people in many countries, particularly those
in neighboring Asian nations," he told the annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito, who presided over the ceremony, offered
condolences to the lives that were lost in the war and prayed for
world peace.
</P>
<P>
But in the Yasukuni shrine, a picture exhibition which lauded
the fighting spirit was held. However, few were deeply moved or
wept before those picture.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the shrine, some right-wingers were trying
hard to sell their writings, including a title, "The Rape of
Nanjing is a Fabrication" -- another sheer distortion of
history. But few people bought those books.
</P>
<P>
The farce went to a high when eight Japanese ministers,
including Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
International Trade and Industry Minister Shinji Sato, Transport
Minister Makoto Koga and Labor Minister Yutaka Okano visited the
shrine.
</P>
<P>
However, these ministers who were heavily escorted by police
paid very brief respect at the shrine, and left the scene as soon
as they finished praying.
</P>
<P>
It is worth mentioning that Japanese cabinet ministers' visits
to the shrine are controversial because Japan's postwar
Constitution stipulates separation of religion and the state.
</P>
<P>
The farce at the shrine ended in the evening and the rain
stopped. Although it was a farce, it reminded peace-loving people
to be on guard against a possible revival of militarism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
History cannot be distorted. Those people who seek to revive
militarism should remember an old Chinese saying: "A mantis trying
to obstruct a chariot has its body smashed to pieces."

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government Troops, Rebels Prepared for New Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Rebel Colonel Makhmud
Khudoiberdyev's brigade has set up a circular defense in the
stronghold of Kurgan Tyube, preparing for an imminent attack from
approaching government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Khudoiberdyev as saying
government forces had advanced to the outskirts of Kurgan Tyube, a
town 110 kilometers south of the capital Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Khudoiberdyev and deputy commander of the
Russian-led CIS peacekeeping force had failed. The agency said the
talks near Khudoiberdyev's headquarters in Kurgan Tyube lasted
only five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Reports said fighting renewed earlier today about 12 kilometers
southeast of Kurgan Tyube and the rebel colonel accused the
government of not withdrawing from Kurgan Tyube as agreed in
Wednesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
He warned of "new spiral of the armed stand-off with
unpredictable consequences" if government troops failed to
withdraw immediately.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted between two warlords in Dushanbe last weekend,
only weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with Islamic
opposition guerrillas aimed at ending four years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas were not involved in the latest clashes, but
Khudoiberdyev joined the fray, moving his brigade towards the
capital last Saturday. The motive for his latest mutiny -- his
third in two years -- remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev, a motorized rifle brigade commander, was
dismissed from his post by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov on
Wednesday for leading the mutiny. He is believed to be the most
powerful military leader in the remote central Asian country.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Help Great Lakes Countries Improve Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) signed a protocol today with the five countries of the
African Great Lakes region in a bid to intensify regional
cooperation for the improvement of health.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda will create inter-nation contingency
stocks of drugs and vaccines and establish an inter-nation
technical support team, WHO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The five Great Lakes countries are to standardize case
management protocols, carry out joint operational research on
health problems of common interest, and hold regular meetings of
health officers.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to cooperate in epidemic prevention and the
control of infectious diseases with high epidemic potential, such
as cholera, epidemic meningitis, bacillary dysentery, measles,
viral hemorrhagic fevers, epidemic typhus, epidemic malaria,
plague, poliomyelitis and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The WHO believes that cooperation between these countries can
help eradicate poliomyelitis in the region, while standardization
of treatment protocols of diseases, such as tuberculosis, will
permit refugees and other returnees to continue treatment in spite
of their migration.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to exchange information and create a pool of
experts that would be available immediately if needed. They also
agreed to set up an inter-nation contingency stock of drugs,
vaccines and other medical supplies that will permit rapid
response to epidemics.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 10 percent of the population of these countries are
refugees or internally displaced people", WHO said. So diseases
linked to overcrowding, such as cholera, epidemic typhus,
bacillary dysentery and malaria, were easily spread.
</P>
<P>
"Partnership development and inter-agency cooperation is needed
more than ever," WHO African Regional Director Dr Ebrahim Samba
said at the signing ceremony in Kigali, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is too vast...No single agency can effectively
control epidemics alone. It is not through the differences in
mandates, but through common interests that collaboration can be
expanded", said Samba.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Foreign
Affairs Stan Mudenge today urged Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries to make double efforts for peace and
stability so as to achieve economic prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge told a one-day meeting of the SADC organ on politics,
defense and security here that economic perosperity in the region
could only be achieved if the 12 nations in the grouping remained
united.

"The SADC organ's objectives are vital for the well-being of
our people, aiming to ensure the flourishing of peace, security
and stability in our region, (which are) conditions for economic
development among our countries and peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the SADC organ and adoption of a protocol on
peace, security and conflict resolution were part of the process
to deepen the bonds of brotherhood and enhance the sense of
togetherness in souther Africa, Mudenge noted.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, delegates from all SADC member countries
held discussions on the draft protocol.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to deliberate on specific issues such
as the troubled Congo (Brazzaville), the Comoros and the fragile
peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The SADC organ on politics, defense and security was launched
at a SADC summit held last year in Gaborone, Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Burundians Facing Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of displaced
Burundians living in camps in the tiny central African country
are suffering from prolonged food shortage and malnutrition and
other diseases, the World Food Program (WFP) warned in a news
release received here today.
</P>
<P>
"In many camps, people have had restricted access to their
land and crops... They have missed two or three harvests. As a
result, nutritional problems are on the rise," said the news
release, quoting Benoit Thiry, Head of WFP Programming in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600,000 Burundians live away from their homes in
some 250 camp settlements throughout the country mainly due to
fighting in their villages. Many camps have inadequate sources of
clean water, poor sanitation facilities and little medical help.
</P>
<P>
Clinical signs of malnutrition with physical traits such as
wasting of body fat, swelling of the feet and lightness in hair
color -- have become prevalent in the camps over the last few
months, said the document.
</P>
<P>
"Generations of people could end up permanently blind, stunted
mentally or in extreme cases, dying of treatable diseases" in
Burundi due to long-term undernutrition, said Thiry.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition rates are believed to be most acute in the
provinces of Karuzi, Bubanza and Kayanza of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
WFP has doubled its food aid assistance to the country for the
next five months with 21,000 tons of food to 280,000 of the most
vulnerable of the displaced Burundians, expecting to ease the
situation obviously.
</P>
<P>
The WFP food aid to Burundi will total 31 million U.S. Dollars
this year. The main donor countries are the United States and the
European Union members, the WFP Regional Information Office in
Nairobi told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference here today, the visiting
Burundian Minister of External Relations and Cooperation Luc
Bukingama said that Burundi had experienced "a very hard time"
due to the economic sanctions by the Great Lakes countries.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in Burundi is negative now, compared
with around three percent in 1993 when the civil war broke out,
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, following a regional summit on the Burundi conflict
on April 16 in Arusha, sanctions on the country were dramatically
eased on food, medicine, agricultural inputs and construction
materials.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Wins, China Loses in Women's Volleyball GP HK Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Cuba won the
opening match while Olympic runner-up China lost to Italy on
Friday at the Hong Kong leg of this year's World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Cuba had no difficulties to beat Japan 14-3, 15-4, 15-6. It was
a sweet revenge over the Japanese who defeated Cuba 3-2 in the
earlier Seoul leg of the Grand Prix series.
</P>
<P>
China, ranked third after two earlier Grand Prix legs and had
won over Italy in the Macao leg last week, could not build a solid
defense and thus lost to the Italians 15-11, 15-10, 6-15, 4-15,
18-16.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said that her team defeat due to
the fact that the players failed to play to their form.
</P>
<P>
"The Italians, on the other hand, did a good job by jumpig high
and launching powerful spikes," Lang said. "They have long been
familiar with our style."
</P>
<P>
Speakng of Saturday's action against Japan, Lang said that the
Chinese had not faced the Japanese side ever since the Olympic
Games last summer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We will play as we have planned," she said, declining to give
the details.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban team here includes only six players of its Olympians,
spearheaded by former captain Mireya Luiz.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the match today. You could see the
improvement from the gap of the scores between the two teams, from
3-2 in Seoul down to 3-0 here," said Antonio Perdomo, coach of the
Cuban team.
</P>
<P>
The team still needed to improve in the combination of setting
and attacking in the future, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Forseeing the team's clash against Italy Saturday, Perdomo said
that his team would win.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban team had won three out of its four matches against
the Italian in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Luiz said that she had enjoyed a six-month-long vocation after
the Atlanta Olympics, so she did not take long training before the
Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The veteran said she would not go for the Olympic Games in
Sydney in 2000. "No, I don't think I'll go," she said. "I am too
old and there are so many jump players in the team that some even
can stand in my position now."
</P>
<P>
She also firmly denied the possibility of becoming a coach
after her retirement. But she declined to say what she would do in
that case. "I don't know," she just said.
</P>
<P>
On the tournament's second day on Saturday, Cuba takes on Italy
and China meets Japan.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Vittel Cup event here is one of the five legs for
the preliminary stages for this year's Grand Prix series.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Bolstering of Indigenous Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today challenged the country's financial institutions and
local authorities to work to ensure that interest rates are not
inhibitive to the development of indigenous businesses.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a supermarket in Harare's Highfield high
density suburb, Mugabe said rigid policies by banks and local
authorities stifled entry into the mainstream economy by upcoming
black business people, most of whom lacked collateral security
and business premises.
</P>
<P>
"The banks should constantly review interest rates to ensure
they don't burden the indigenous people, and we urge the Harare
City Council to ensure its rates are not inhibitive to the
development of black-owned businesses," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were still areas in major cities including
Harare's central business district which remained the domain of
white-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe reiterated that the government would press
ahead with the land redistribution program which seeks to
resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said, the government was consulting traditional chiefs in
all provinces trying to identify land for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a white farmer who has built a dam or has made
other developments on the land, we will pay for those. But we
will not pay them for the land which they never paid,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses to Lift Closure on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
declared today that Israel will continue its open-ended "total
closure" imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip after Jerusalem
market bombing on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told the state-run Israel Radio
that Israel will only ease the closure when the Palestinian
National Authority honors the Oslo Accords by clamping down on
terror.
</P>
<P>
The twin suicide bombings in Jewish west Jerusalem killed 15
people and wounded some 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Naveh claimed that meetings themselves are not enough and only
will have results when Israel considers to put an end to the
closure. He was apparently referring to the just-concluded shuttle
diplomacy by U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ross wrapped up his four days of round-the-clock mediation
mission Wednesday with a Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA)-supervised mechanism in place to bolster Israel's internal
security by preventing terrorist operations from being launched
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly, at this point, have a beginning," he said, after
fifth and final meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that the achievement "makes it possible to do what is
essential -- settle the political differences."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright commented in
Washington that Ross' mission made headway on security issues and
she would come to the Middle East in the coming days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Naveh's statement implied that Israel does not share
the U.S. assessment. Neither do Palestinian officials. Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath
responded that Ross had brought to the PNA nothing new and the
Palestinians would continue to suffer from the total closure.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities dropped the internal closure
on the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron Thursday, leaving
only Bethlehem closed, while it opened a checkpoint in Gaza for
the export of goods.
</P>
<P>
The choice to keep Bethlehem closed is partly due to the
discovery of a bomb factory in nearby Beit Sahur a few weeks ago,
as well as the town's proximity to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu and Arafat Thursday continued to trade
accusations each other on terror issue. The Israeli prime minister
charged that the PNA is not fighting terror, which is a
condition for the continuation of the peace process. Arafat
responded by saying that Netanyahu was actually encouraging
terror.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down, London Sheds 2.5 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock markets in London and
Frankfurt both sustained Thursday's decline and suffered heavy
losses today, with London shedding 125.5 points at close, the
biggest one day drop since October 1992.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares lost more than 120
points as weak futures and Wall Street blues took it below the
4,900-level.
</P>
<P>
Almost 22 billion pounds (35.2 billion US dollars) was wiped
off the value of top shares in the biggest one-day fall since
October 1992 when Britain pulled out of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts stressed that this was due to technical
factors and was not the start of a long-awaited correction.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed sharply lower in response to
the weak dollar and fears of an interest rate hike at next week's
Bundesbank meeting.
</P>
<P>
The major DAX-30 index finished the session 78.57 points lower
at 4,152.86.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse was closed for Assumption Day holiday. The
CAC-40 index ended 2.20 points down at 2,921.84 Thursday, a drop
of 74.43 points on last week.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President Sacks Customs Committee Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
today signed a decree dismissing Yakub Salimov from his post of
chairman of the customs committee, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported from Dushanbe, the Tajik capital.
</P>
<P>
Salimov was one of the organizers of the recent armed conflict
in the Tajik capital. The reason for the dismissal was not
specified in the decree, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ismoil Davlyatov, former nature protection minister
of Tajikistan, was appointed chairman of the customs committee.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Salimov started mobilizing his supporters,
since the situation in the southeast of Dushanbe is tending
towards tension.
</P>
<P>
In the area of the Vakhsh, 20 kilometers to the south of the
city of Kurgan-Tyube, there are up to 500 armed militants loyal to
Salimov who is prepared to back the rapid reaction brigade
commander Mahmud Khudoiberdiyev.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdiyev was relieved by the Tajik president from his
post of commander of a presidential rapid reaction brigade
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to another report from Kurgan-Tyube, talks between
Deputy Commander of collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan
Major-General Pavel Lipskyand and Colonel Makhmud Khudoiberdyev
ended to no avail today after being held for five minutes only.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev had arrived at the request of the Tajik president
who asked him to render assistance to the state commission in
charge of surrender and handover of weapons and property of the
rapid deployment force brigade.

<HEADLINE> U.N.Security Council Considering Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said today that the Security Council is right now
seriously considering sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement at a press conference today
in Helsinki, without giving further details, the Angolan News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Annan also noted that he is making efforts to bring Angolan
President Eduardo Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, Chairman of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) back to
the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Santos expressed his willingness to meet
Savimbi on the condition that the venue should be on the Angolan
territory, and its capital to be exact.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the meeting must be focused on the
suspending issues of peace process, instead of those settled in
accordance with the Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi, on his part, argued that issues which have obstructed
the normal development of the peace process should top the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Peace Process is currently tied in a stalemate.
UNITA, the country's former rebel movement, had, under the
requirement of United Nations No. 1118 resolution reached on June
30, tabled two reports to the U.N. observation mission in Angola
before the organization's next session on Angola. But the result
is "unsatisfactory".
</P>
<P>
Annan noted today that it is still early to comment on UNITA"s
final plan.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attacks EU for Sending Letter to Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- In a move apparently aimed at
cold-shouldering the European Union, Israel has publicly lashed
out at the European position regarding the current
Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio today quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as describing as unacceptable EU's criticism of the
total closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the
Jerusalem suicide bombing on July 30.
</P>
<P>
The statement implied that the EU's ability to act as an
honest broker between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is questioned, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
The new crisis between Israel and the EU was triggered by a
letter sent by the multinational body's current president,
Luxembourg's Jacques Poos, to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a sour tone that "Poos refrained
from demanding that Arafat take practical steps against the
terrorist infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the U.S. stance, the EU president commented
that "Israel cannot expect the PNA to act against terrorism
because of its refusal to transfer tax revenues to the PNA even
though there is no basis for this in view of precedent."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry released the EU letter Thursday, a
move taken after U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross
concluded his four-day shuttle diplomacy, which focused on
pressuring the Palestinians to accept Israel's request for
security cooperation before resumption of peace talks. Ross's
pro-Israeli attitude was strongly slammed by Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The EU letter also termed the measures enforced on the
Palestinians as "excessive." "The measures severely affect the
hardship of the Palestinian population although its responsibility
for the attack are not established," it added.
</P>
<P>
The message further stated: "The EU has decided to ask its
representatives in Tel Aviv to make a demarche upon Foreign
Minister (David) Levy to make our concern known."

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Sizeable UN Presence in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended further postponement of the
withdrawal of the U.N. military units from Angola and retainment
in the country of up to 2,650 military personnel until the end of
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said, "The peace
process in Angola was experiencing some of the most serious
difficulties since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol. The
progress achieved during the previous two and a half years is
being severely undermined by persisting tensions throughout the
country. Everything possible should be done to reverse this
ominous trend."
</P>
<P>
"Both parties bear a heavy responsibility for the future of the
peace process and must refrain from any action that leads to
renewed fighting. It is obvious that the current state of affairs
is mainly the result of delays by the National Union for the Total
independence of Angola (UNITA) in implementing its obligations
under the Lusaka Protocol," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The complete demilitarization of UNITA, the restoration of
state administration throughout the country, the transformation of
radio VORGAN into a non-partisan station and the true
transformation of UNITA into a political party are imperatives for
the implementation of the peace process," Annan stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the Security Council would continue to
exercise its authority and take all necessary steps to ensure full
compliance with its decisions and last-minute half-hearted
concessions by UNITA, under pressure and on the eve of Security
Council deliberations were no longer acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the parties, in particular UNITA, to respect the
safety and the security of personnel of the United Nations, its
programs and agencies, as well as the staff of other international
organizations who had been helping the Angolan people to achieve a
long-awaited peace, national reconciliation and economic
rehabilitation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges SADC to Remove Border Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice President Godfrey
Miyanda urged here today the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) states to remove border barriers while
maintaining law and order, to enhance regional intergration.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a SADC meeting on the free movement of
persons in the region, Miyanda said that while the region has
made recommendable strides towards the attainment of
intergration, the objective of achieving sustainable economic
growth and development will not be fully realized if people can
not move freely within the region.
</P>
<P>
These obstacles should be reduced to their minimum, if not
fully eliminated, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Miyanda advised the member countries to maintain
simple regulatory measures to maintain law and order because
leaving the borders too open to free movement of people will lead
to anarch.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the importance of creating an economic community
in the region, Miyanda said that if the region's small markets
remain fragmented, SADC will lose out in the new world economic
order.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Secret Documents on Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A leader of Israeli opposition
Labor party has unveiled two documents on the establishment of
Palestinian state reached a year ago between the party and the
Palestinians, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar organized by the Palestinian Research Center
Thursday, Yossi Beilin unveiled the documents as suggested
solution to the Palestinian crisis, MENA quoted Palestinian
newspapers published in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
The documents were reached during secret negotiations between
Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) Mahamoud Abbas and the then ruling Labor
party.
</P>
<P>
The documents stipulated the setting up of the Palestinian
state on the Gaza Strip and the West bank, Beilin said, adding
that according to the documents, only five percent of the West
Bank would be annexed to Israel.
</P>
<P>
This five percent of the West Bank would accommodate some
100,000 Jewish settlers, said Beilin.
</P>
<P>
The documents also stipulated that the capital of the
Palestinian state would lie outside the present border of
Jerusalem municipality, suggesting it to be in Abu Rudeis at the
outskirts of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Al Aqsa mosque would be placed under the Palestinian
sovereignty and the future status of Jerusalem would be discussed
later, on condition that the Palestinians recognize west Jerusalem
as the capital of Israel, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
Beilin quoted PLO Secretary-General Abu Mazen as having said
that if such an agreement was reached the two parties would be
able to start final negotiations within one month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has come to a stalemate
since the hard-line Likud group took power in May last year to
nullify the Labor's basic peace principles, especially the
land-for-peace formula.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Co-Defendant's Trial to Stay in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Richard
Matsch today turned down the request to move the trial of Oklahoma
City bombing defendant Terry Nichols from Denver, Colorado, to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page opinion, Matsch rejected arguments from
Nichols' attorneys that cite publicity surrounding the trial of
co-defendant Timothy McVeigh, 29, who was formally sentenced to
death by lethal injection Thursday, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Nichols is scheduled to go on trial on September 29 for bombing
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995, which
killed 168 people and injured more than 500 people. Nichols faces
the same charges as McVeigh and could also face a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Nichols' attorneys had suggested San Francisco for the trial,
contending media coverage of Timothy McVeigh's trial precluded
Nichols from finding an unbiased jury here.
</P>
<P>
Matsch, however, ruled they "failed to show a sufficient basis
for presuming such community prejudice as to require the requested
transfer to a different district."
</P>
<P>
Matsch said he had little trouble choosing a jury for McVeigh
and expects the jury selection process to go just as smoothly for
Nichols.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Home Resales Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's home resale market
pulled out of a lull in July, showing a month-over-month rise for
the first time since April, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Real Estate Association reported 19,011 existing
homes were sold in July, 3.5 percent more than in June, and 9.2
percent more than in July last year.
</P>
<P>
In May and June, resale numbers were lower than the previous
month, although they were higher than the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Sales are on a strong footing going into the second half of
the year," said Pierre Beauchamp, the association's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
Full-time job growth and low mortgage rates will keep the sales
trend "on the rise" during the second half of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even if mortgage rates do creep up slightly between now and
the end of the year, they are likely to stay within a half a
percentage point of current levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That small an increase will do little to dampen activity," he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
"With jobs, consumer confidence and spending on the rise, sales
will be brisk over the autumn months," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Sankoh May Go to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's former rebel
leader Foday Sankoh might be involved in talks to settle the
crisis in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
The news came after a two-day meeting of West African foreign
ministers which ended today in Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi as saying that Sankoh would possibly be included in a four
party negotiation for full settlement of the crisis in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting discussed Sankoh, who had been in
detention in Nigeria since March this year, and his Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) which fought successive governments in Sierra
Leone since 1991. Sankoh was invited to the capital Freetown by
the junta shortly after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Although Ikimi did not give any details, he said he "could not
rule out the possibility of Sankoh's being released and being
part of some final settlement along with the RUF".
</P>
<P>
The junta leader, self-appointed Head of State Major Johnny
Paul Koroma has named Sankoh as his deputy while keeping asking
Nigeria to release him.
</P>
<P>
Except Sankoh, said the report, foreign ministers from
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire decided nothing new at
the meeting but to pursue the reinstatement of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The other outcome of the meeting is they have prepared details
for the sanctions and embargo on Sierra Leone, which they will
submit to the summit of the the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, representing the ECOWAS committee of four to
deal with the Sierra Leonean crisis, have so far held two rounds
of talks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, with Koroma's delegation, in
an effort to persuade the junta to step down.
</P>
<P>
The first ended in mid-July with a ceasefire agreement between
ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ecomog and soldiers loyal to
the junta. The second collapsed in session at the end of last
month when the junta said it would stay in power until the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
The junta's four-year transition plan also invited full-scale
sanctions from ECOWAS, which has announced a combination of
measures, dialogue, sanctions and use of force, to restore
Kabbah's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
However, ECOMOG's limited military intervention, dialogue and
reinforced sanctions have failed to lead to the resolution of the
issue despite the fact that the measures do have created
tremendous difficulties to the junta.
</P>
<P>
Since thet crisis in Sierra Leone is regarded as posing threat
to peace and stability in the sub-region, people are waiting for
the coming ECOWAS summit to come out with solutions, may they be
peaceful campaign or military action.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Postponement of War Games With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today denied the report
that a controversial Turkish-Israeli joint military exercise
scheduled to be held in the eastern Mediterranean in summer has
been postponed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman
Sermet Atacanli was rejecting a report by Egypt's MENA news agency
on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's comments of the war games.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of students in the northern Egyptian
province of Alexandria Wednesday, Mubarak said the Turkish-Israeli
maneouvre "gave the impression that Syria and Lebanon were meant."
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak conveyed to Turkish President (Suleyman)
Demirel the fears and anxiety felt in the Arab nation. Turkey
decided to postpone the maneouvre," the MENA report said.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli's statement also pointed out that Turkey attaches
great importance to its ties with Egypt and supports development
in every field of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents are expected to discuss bilateral relations
and regional issues when Demirel pays an official visit to Cairo
on September 16, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel announced earlier in May that they will
hold a joint military exercise in summer under the framework of
a cooperation agreement they signed in February 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Currency Left to Defend Itself: CBK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior bank official today
said that the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) will leave the Kenyan
currency of shilling to defend itself in the local financial
market.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, CBK Governor Micah Cheserem
noted that the bank had refused to intervene to boost the weak
shilling.
</P>
<P>
The shilling remained weak on Friday after marginal gains to
close at 69.75 from 69.97, depreciating by 18.2 percent during
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to exporters to bring in their export proceeds
promptly, not to expect that the shilling may depreciate further.
</P>
<P>
"Importers should not delay payment in the hope that the
shilling may appreciate in the coming weeks," he added.
</P>
<P>
His appeal was made following a dismal performance of Kenya's
treasury bill on Thursday due to the decision of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend its Enhanced
Structural Adjustment facility to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The CBK only managed to auction 50 percent of the 200 million
U.S. Dollars worth of treasury bills offered at the stock market
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem noted, "the shortfall is attributed to foreign
investors who have decided to liquidate their investments"
because of the recent lapse of the financial arrangement with the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The latest results of the treasury bill auction indicate that
some foreign investors have decided to liquidate their
investments and repatriate the proceeds," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The bank chief stressed that "despite the current challenges,
Kenya is still an attractive location for investment" as the
current interest rate is very lucrative.
</P>
<P>
"It will become even more attractive once the current
outstanding economic challenges are resolved," Cheserem added.

<HEADLINE> Second Round Cypriot Bi-Communal Talks Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The second round of
U.N.-sponsored direct talks on Cyprus issue between President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash ended
in Montreux, Switzerland, today in deadlock, according to Cyprus
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Denktash was quoted as saying at a press conference after the
talks that the second round negotiations, which took place at the
Gighi Vaudois Hotel in Glion-sur-Montreux, ended in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Denktash accused the European Union (EU) of having thrown a
"bomb" into the peace process by deciding to open accession
negotiations next year with Cypriot government, which is
internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader said talks on Cyprus' bid for EU
membership must be canceled for the U.N. mediation to continue.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said in his statements that "at the end of
this week we are exactly where we were when we came here."
</P>
<P>
He rejected Denktash's accusation on the EU, saying that "not
only do I have no intention to delay the process but if there is
any interference in the process I will not be negotiating."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference later, U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Advisor for the Cyprus problem, Diego Cordovez, who
chaired the five-day talks between the two leaders of the two
Cypriot communities, said "they had useful discussion even when we
faced difficulties here in Glion."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the Secretary-General intends to
continue his good offices mission on Cyprus and said he does not
entirely share the view that "we are back to where we were when we
started."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez said he will submit his conclusions on this round of
talks to the U.N. Security Council next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first round of direct talks, the first meeting between the
two leaders since October 1994, was held between July 9 and 12 at
Troutbeck rural retreat, north of New York.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Switzerland for second round talks, the two
leaders had two meetings in Cyprus, at the residence of the
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel, situated in the
U.N.-controlled Nicosia airport area, and reached an agreement on
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this island
nation as bi-communal, bi-zonal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Defense of Mailbomb Terrorist Suspect Seeks Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for UNABOMber suspect
Theodore Kaczynski are asking for special measures to find
northern California jurors who aren't biased against him by news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is
suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who
killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his
arrest last year. The UNABOMber was so named because his early
targets were universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke have asked that
prospective jurors for the November 12 trial in Sacramento,
California, be picked from within the Eastern District, which
includes Sacramento and 22 other counties, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Their 1,600-page motion also asks the pool to be taken from
licensed drivers rather than voter registration lists typically
used in federal trials.
</P>
<P>
Denvir and Clarke want prospective jurors to complete detailed
questionnaires about their knowledge of the case and their
feelings about the death penalty, which the government is seeking
against Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys say the 17-year case has prompted more news
coverage than any other in history, including 341 New York Times
articles between June 1993 and May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of 16 bombings,
which killed two men and wounded two others. He is charged with a
third death in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say they expect to take up to four weeks to present
evidence showing that Kaczynski is the UNABOMber.

CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of the
Pan-African News Agency (PANA) today agreed to revive the
money-strapped institution by turning it into a privately-owned
press company.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the PANA, which wound up its
extraordinary session here today, decided to allow national news
agencies of its member states to subscribe to PANA's capital, the

</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to transform the real estate of the

The Dakar-based PANA is an inter-governmental institution of
news service which is affiliated to the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and comprises news agencies of the OAU members.

<P>
The board of directors also accepted the membership of Libya,
South Africa, Kenya and Cote D'iviore today.
</P>
<P>
The plan for restructuring the regional news agency has been

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Pilgrims Visit Monastery in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Greek Cypriot
pilgrims visited the monastery of Apostolos Andreas on the tip of
the Turkish-controlled Karpass peninsula today to hold mass on one
of the holiest days on the Greek Orthodox calendar.
</P>
<P>
Around 620 Greek Cypriots, among them 47 are United Nations
employees, made the 150 kilometer, three-hour trek on
approximately 14 buses provided by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.
</P>
<P>
When they returned to the Ledra Palace check point in Nicosia
this evening, the pilgrims, many of whom come from the
Turkish-controlled areas, said they were very excited to see
their villages after 23 years.
</P>
<P>
They said they received warm welcome from Turkish Cypriots, who
expressed sincere desire for re-unification of the island.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Cypriots wish for re-unification of Cyprus. They
offered us olive branches and flowers and were asking about their
own villages in the south," a Greek Cypriot pilgrim said, while
others stressed the need for rapprochement and more bicommunal
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 Turkish Cypriots were allowed last week to cross over
the U.N.-controlled ceasefire line to visit the Turkish Cypriot
enclave of Kokkina in the northeastern part of the island, about
five kilometers west of the Turkish occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits was agreed by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during their
recent meetings in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had two meetings in Nicosia last month, under
auspices of U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, and reached an agreement on humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
Last April some 450 Turkish Cypriots crossed to southern
government-controlled areas for a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke
mosque in Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
in and took over the northern third of the island following
a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
People from the two sides have been prohibited to cross the
180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates
the island into two parts.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Sues B.C. over Testing Range Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal government has
filed a lawsuit aimed at preventing British Columbia (B.C.)
province from shutting down a torpedo testing range, reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
If the B.C. government acts on its threat, the U.S. navy would
be forced out of the Nanoose Bay torpedo-testing range off
Vancouver Island next month.
</P>
<P>
B.C. Premier Glen Clark has said he will end the lease next
Friday unless the Canada-U.S. salmon quota dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of B.C., Ottawa argued
that the province has no right to make the move under a 1989
agreement with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows B.C. to terminate the lease after a 90-day
written notice. But cancellation can only take place if the
province requires the land for its own use.
</P>
<P>
"The province has failed to act reasonably and in good faith,"
the federal Justice Department said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown will "frustrate the federal government's
fulfillment of its responsibilities in critical areas such as
national defense and international relations."
</P>
<P>
But Premier Glen Clark said he will not back down.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Canada has done a great disservice to British
Columbia and our ability to be successful on the salmon issue," he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It sends the wrong message to the Americans," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yet, some expert viewed the court action as a neutral way of
avoiding the lease cancellation while saving face for both sides.
</P>
<P>
"At first blush, it looks like it's turning up the heat, but
it's probably really putting it on the back burner," said
Professor Richard Paisley of the University of British Colombia.
</P>
<P>
That's because a court case could take years and both sides
could refuse to discuss it while it winds through the courts, he
said.

WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The United States increased its lead as the world's No. 1
weapons merchant, according to an annual arms survey published by
the Congressional Research Service. The American share of the
world's growing arms bazaar grew by nearly 23 percent last year,
to 11.3 billion U.S. dollars of the world's 31.8 billion U.S.
dollars market.
</P>
<P>
-- Researchers studying specimens from 3,000 people have
confirmed a genetic mutation that inhibits disease progression in
people infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Researchers
said that by pinpointing how these altered gens fight HIV, it
may be possible to develop treatments that help people delay the
on-set of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. involvement with Rwanda's military has been far more
extensive than previously disclosed, including psychological
operations and tactical Special Forces exercises that occurred a
few weeks before the start of last fall's Rwanda-led insurgency in
neighboring Congo, an internal Defense Department chronology
shows.
</P>
<P>
-- The three-member crew aboard the Russian space station got
off to a smooth start today on their mission to repair the
troubled craft. Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Pavel Vinogradov
along with U.S. astronaut Michael Foale circled Mir in a Soyuz
space capsule to inspect and videotape the station's damaged
exterior for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Dow Jones industrials plummeted almost 250 points
yesterday in a late wave of skittish selling that marked the worst
one-day point drop since the 1987 crash. The sell-off capped a
dizzying seven-day decline of 565 points, or almost 7 percent, from

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The mortgage war warmed up after
the Halifax, Nationwide and Woolwich, which together provide
mortgages for more than a third of Britain's borrowers, announced
0.25 percent increases in rates.
</P>
<P>
Halifax's new rate is 8.45 percent and takes immediate effect
for its new borrowers and from September 1 for its 2.5 million
existing borrowers.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth rate rise since the election, in line with
the 0.25 point rise in base rate announced last week, the highest
mortgage rate charged by the Halifax for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
Halifax's announcement spurred its rivals Nationwide and
Woolwich to increase their mortgage rates, meaning that all the
major mortgage lenders have now put their rates up.
</P>
<P>
The rises also mean that a Halifax borrower with a 50,000 pound
(80,000 US dollar) interest-only loan will now pay 320 pounds (512
US dollars) a month, an increase of 9.48 pounds (15.17 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
While a borrower with an identical mortgage from Nationwide
will pay 307 pounds (491 US dollars) a month, an annual saving
over the Halifax of 156 pounds (250 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nationwide is offering lower mortgage rates than its main
rivals as part of a 200 million pound (320 million US dollar) bid
to promote mutuality.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax said house price inflation remained on target for 7
percent by the close of the year, and was expected to climb by a
similar amount next year.
</P>
<P>
Rising house prices are one of the inflation danger signs
warned by the Bank of England, along with rising retail sales,
lower unemployment and the impact of the 36 billion pound (57.6
billion US dollar) building society conversion windfalls.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tops List in Arms Sales to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States regained
the lead in selling arms to the developing world in 1996, almost
doubling the sales made by second-ranked Russia.
</P>
<P>
An annual report issued today by the U.S. Congressional
Research Service said the American share of the weapons market
rose by nearly 23 percent last year, to 11.3 billion U.S. dollars
in orders.
</P>
<P>
Total sales of American arms increased at a far more dramatic
pace to 31.8 billion dollars last year, up about 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. made 7.3 billion dollars in new weapons sales
contracts in 1996, representing 37.6 percent of all arms sales to
developing nations that year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has dominated the arms market in the developing world
over the past eight years. The nation has won 88.8 billion dollars
in new contracts, based on constant 1996 dollars adjusted for
inflation, from 1989 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked Russia fell from its position as top seller in
1995 to second place in 1996, booking 3.9 billion dollars in new
sales.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which ranked fifth in 1995, boosted its ranking to
third in 1996 with contracts valued as 1.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
France ranked fourth in 1996 with 1.3 billion dollars worth of
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Exports from Subic Bay Freeport Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Exports from the Subic Bay
Freeport in the northern Philippines hit 263 million U.S. dollars
during the first semester this year, a 66-percent increase over
the 158 million dollars recorded a year ago, a senior official
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Fidel Ramos, Richard Gordon, chairman
of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), said he was
confident that total exports from the freeport this year will
exceed 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that the steady increase in exports from the
freeport was a reflection of its stable economic condition and
investors' confidence not only in Subic but also in the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that he expects the export earnings to double in
the coming years when more companies in the freeport will start
opening.
</P>
<P>
Exports for June alone amounted to 56 million dollars,
representing an 80-percent increase from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Gordon also reported that the SBMA has finalized a
69-million-dollar loan agreement with the World Bank (WB) and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) to finance the expansion
of the Freeport.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to finance the construction of additional
infrastructure projects in the Freeport to accommodate more
businesses which have signified their intention to locate there,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said today that the government will always pay great attention to
the poverty alleviation program under the presidential instruction
for the promotion of least-developed villages (IDT) program.
</P>
<P>
In his state address before the plenary session of the
parliament to mark the 52nd anniversary of the country's
independence on August 17, the president that the IDT program, now
entering its fourth year, is one of the country's high priority
programs.
</P>
<P>
He said the program has resulted to the lower number of people
living below the poverty line between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 national survey, the number of poor has
declined to around 22 million or about 11 percent of Indonesia's
population in 1996. In 1993, the poor people accounted for 14
percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also said that the government has reinforced the IDT
program with a number of additional activities, such as the
supplementary food program for school children where priority is
given to villages covered by the IDT program, and the development
of rural infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the poverty alleviation program was
intensified through the community welfare saving/credit program
which is concentrated in the non-IDT villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the poverty alleviation program is not the
only program for equitable distribution. What is also important is
the effort to promote small enterprises and cooperatives to become
strong and self-supporting businesses.

<HEADLINE> China More Sophisticated in Market Circulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China has had some progress in
reforming its distribution system, giving goods greater
accessibility to the market, especially in the five years since
the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
There were more than a thousand production materials and daily
necessities that were under State control, but the number has
dropped to about 30 now, and more than 85 percent of the country's
production of goods are based on market demand.
</P>
<P>
A multi-channel distribution system is taking shape, with
different forms of ownership competing. Last year, state and
collective enterprises accounted for less than 50 percent of
retail consumer sales, but for 95 percent of the means of
production.
</P>
<P>
A market pricing system has been formed, with 90-95 percent of
the prices under market regulation. China has more than 100,000
commodity markets, as well as auctions, second-hand goods markets,
leasing markets, and used vehicles markets.
</P>
<P>
A control system is also taking shape for major goods and
distribution puts equal value on the law of demand and State
controls, and keeps reserves of important commodities.
</P>
<P>
Governors are held accountable for the "rice bag", while mayors
assume responsibility for the "shopping baskets", to balance
supply and demand. As a consequence, the retail price index for
vegetables was 18.4 percent in 1996, relatively low, while that
for meat, poultry, and related products was 4.5 percent, a drop of
21.9 percentage points from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
New forms of distribution are emerging to give consumers more
conveniences. In 1995, China had some 150 chain-store businesses,
but the number was more than 1,700 at the end of last year,
accounting for more than three percent of consumer retail sales, a
new area of economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Orders Probe of Sea Tragedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
ordered a thorough investigation into Friday's two separate sea
tragedies in Manila Bay and a central Philippine strait which led
to the death of at least 19 people.
</P>
<P>
In a hand written memorandum, Ramos directed Transportation and
Communications Secretary Arturo Enrile to conduct a thorough probe
into the two sea accidents, one in Manila Bay and the other in
Biliran Strait in the central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Enrile was asked to determine if the two vessels involved in
the two mishaps -- a small pleasure boat and an inter-land
passenger ferry -- violated the law on the safety of life at sea.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told Enrile to punish violators and submit a progress
report no later than August 19.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that both boats capsized due to strong
winds and big waves.
</P>
<P>
The passenger ferry overturned and sank in rough waters between
Maripipi Island and Kawayan, Biliran province, around 2:30 a.m.
Friday while the sight-seeing boat capsized off Manila Bay late
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard officer based in central Cebu city told Xinhua
tonight by telephone that 103 people have so far been rescued, 12
bodies recovered and 22 others remain missing or unaccounted for
in the Biliran sea accident.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Commander Crisolito Agustin, head of the Operation Division
of the regional coast guard based in Cebu, said the authorities
planned to stop the rescue operation by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Agustin said he thought there is no more possible survivors due
to the strong winds and high waves on the mishap site.
</P>
<P>
In the Manila Bay tragedy, seven Hong Kong tourists were killed
and three Filipino crew members remain missing.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, the two vessels did not have enough life vests and
the passenger ship was overloaded. Initial investigation showed
that the sight-seeing boat left on a cruise around Manila Bay
despite rough weather.
</P>
<P>
As the winds grew stronger, reports said, some passengers
demanded that the ferry return to port, but the boat capsized
before the crew could react.

<HEADLINE> Somali Soccer Tournament Torn Apart by Armed Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- It is uncertain how the 29th
soccer tournament of Mogadishu would be concluded as the
semifinal matches were fired upon by jubilant football fans on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three people were wounded after the armed football fans
supporting Gorgor Team used rocket propelled grenades and assault
rifles to attacked Mogadishu's main football stadium where a
soccer match was taking place on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
When Benadir Telecom and Midnimo teams were competing for the
fourth post of the semifinals, the shooting occurred between the
stadium guardsmen and the Gorgor Team supporters annoyed by a
decision taken by the Somali Football Federation (SFF).
</P>
<P>
As the soccer tournament of Mogadishu's 12 first class
football teams is close to its final stage, Gorgor Team opposed
the decision by the SFF which gave 3 forfeit points to its
opponent team, Interglobe.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the supporters of Gorgor Team have distributed
leaflets to the Somali Olympic Committee, the SFF, the fans as
well as to the press, warning that no further matches could take
place in either of the two football stadiums in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded leaflet two days ago, the Gorgor
administration said they won't shoulder the consequences if their
warning is defied and declared that violence will erupt if any
match is held at any of Mogadishu or Benadir stadiums in south
and north Mogadishu respectively.
</P>
<P>
Gorgor Team has also accused the SFF for partiality in its
decision favoring Interglobe.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a shooting has taken place in Mogadishu
Stadium since the unification of Somalia's Olympic Committee
which was affected by the long-standing anarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a large congress held in North Mogadishu at the end of last
month, Somalia's Olympic Committee and its sports federations
were restructured with the approval of both faction leaders Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes Cambodia to Join ASEAN This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- President Soeharto today said
Indonesia hoped Cambodia could join the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year.
</P>
<P>
In his address to parliament in commemoration of the 52nd
anniversary of the country's independence, Soeharto said
Indonesia, along with other members of the association, is ready
to help Cambodia solve its problem.
</P>
<P>
"Without intending to interfere in the domestic affairs of
other countries, Indonesia together with other ASEAN member
countries stand ready to help if it is requested by the
conflicting parties in that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership in the association, scheduled to be
accepted together with that of Laos and Myanmar last month, has
been postponed indefinitely following the political crisis in that
country marked by the ousting of first prime minister Ranariddh.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mir's three-man crew left the
space station Friday to videotape the damaged exterior which was
punctured in a space collision seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for a vital repair job, the two Russian
cosmonauts and their American colleague spent about 45 minutes
traveling round the orbiting station in a Soyuz spacecraft,
getting their first look at the damaged Spektr module, Itar-Tass
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The United States astronaut, Michael Foale, manned a video
camera and took photographs of the hull of the Spektr with a 500
millimeter zoom lens.
</P>
<P>
Space officials said they hoped the footage, filmed as the
Soyuz slowly sailed at a distance of 50 to 70 meters from the
module, would allow them to find the damage, which occurred in
June in a collision with a cargo vessel.
</P>
<P>
The crew plans to transmit the footage to Earth on Monday, and
technicians will spend several days analyzing it, said Mission
Control chief Vladimir Solovyov.
</P>
<P>
The cargo ship collision was the worst in a long series of
misfortunes to beset the Mir. Others included a fire, breakdowns
in the oxygen and cooling systems, and a severe power reduction.

with the permission from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region government, issued travel permits to 10 survivors who lost
their passports in the mishap. The travel permits will be used as

difficulties, including translating the report on the accident
from Chinese into English, seeking help in preserving the bodies
of the dead and identifying the fatalities.

<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A hall to commemorate Li
Dazhao, one of the founders of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
opened in Laoting county in north China's Hebei province today.
</P>
<P>
The inscription for the hall was written by Jiang Zemin,

Hu said at the opening ceremony that Li Dazhao was one of the
pioneers of China's Communist movement and a great Marxist whose
revolutionary undertakings were immortal.
</P>

the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and rally closely around the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Currency to Extend Fall against Greenback: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- With unfavorable regional
sentiments, Malaysia's currency of ringgit is expected to stay
weak against the U.S. dollar next week, dealers forecast.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the local unit dropped to 2.8210 against
the U.S. dollar, its lowest in history since it was floated in
1973, on speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, the ringgit recovered to close at 2.7830/50 on profit
taking against last week's close at 2.6500/30.
</P>
<P>
This week, the ringgit opened weak against the U.S. dollar and
continued the trend for three days. It recovered slightly on
Thursday, but the free float of the Indonesian currency of rupiah
caused it to fall against the U.S. dollar on Friday, along with
other regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said some foreign funds were talking about the
possibility that the ringgit may fall to the 3.00 level if
speculative attacks on the currency continued.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the Malaysian Central Bank would intervene to
stop the attack is subject to speculation, the dealers said,
noting that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said that Malaysia
will let market force to decide the ringgit/U.S. dollar level.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah free float is expected to continue to have adverse
impact on regional currencies, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
"There is also the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and
this will not favor the ringgit's recovery," another dealer said.

ZHENGZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Shunshun, a female giant
panda, died of skin cancer in a zoo in Zhengzhou, the capital of
Henan Province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old animal was the only panda raised in central
China's Henan province and was the pet of all the city's citizens.
</P>
<P>
Last year, doctors found a tumour on her back and performed
surgery to remove it, but the cancer later spread. Doctors tried
various methods to save her life but ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
Several days before Shunshun's death, a few primary school
students came to offer comfort to the animal.
</P>
<P>
A panda's life expectancy is about 30 years, so Shunshun could
be said to be in middle age.

ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said today that his country fully supports the
Untied Nations' efforts in seeking a peaceful settlement of the
Afghan issue, Foreign Office officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gohar made the remarks when he met the U.N. Secretary General's
special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, who arrived here
Friday on a two-week mission to assess the Afghan situation.
</P>

Pakistan's recent intensified contacts with the Afghan groups
were just aimed at supplementing the UN' own efforts towards a
durable settlement of the Afghan problem, Gohar was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials termed the talks between Pakistani Foreign
Minister and the UN envoy were "constructive" but they declined to
go into the details.

<P>
Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, who was appointed by UN

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to raise three
warships that were sunk by the Japanese navy in 1895 in the Yellow
Sea, by October of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ships were sunk during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in a
war with Japan, which left the Dynasty's entire fleet in ruins and
led to the signing of unequal treaties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An official from the office overseeing the salvage work said
that after three months' efforts, salvage workers have spotted the
exact locations of the three warships near an island off Liaoning
province.
</P>
<P>
The salvage work will start next year, he said, as part of the
activities to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Qing Dynasty's defeat in the sea battle one century ago is
regarded as a national humiliation.
</P>

China successfully raised a cruiser sunk by Japanese warplanes
in 1938 in the Yangtze River earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Alerts on S. Leone Troops in ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has announced the
military junta in Sierra Leone is kitting its soldiers in the
uniforms of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) so as to
begin wanton destruction of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters of Nigeria disclosed the plot on
Friday, two weeks ahead of a summit of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) reported to take place on 28-29 of
this month.
</P>
<P>
An official statement described it as a ploy to blame the
sub-regional army for the destruction so as to whip up sentiments
and support from the international community against the ECOMOG,
which is in Sierra Leone for possible military action to restore
the civilian government toppled in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Leonean coupists had provided some segments of
their troops and rebel allies with ECOMOG troops uniforms
specifically to commence maximum wanton destruction of important
facilities, lives, properties and other nefarious activities," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"This action is aimed at generating condemnation of ECOMOG and
whipping up sentiments and support from the international
community and their relevant agencies," noted the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also unvealed plans by the junta to poison the
ECOMOG's major source of water supply.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's discoveries came barely 24 hours after the Defense
Headquarters accused the junta of violating a ceasefire agreement
by attacking some ECOMOG positions in the troubled country and
assured the public of ECOMOG's capacity to continue to defend
itself.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu, reaffirming
Wednesday night's attack, said "We are not an occupation force
but we have a responsibility to protect our soldiers".
</P>
<P>
The junta also accused ECOMOG troops of attacking government
positions in Freetown's Lungi international airport on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, the exchange of accusations may be
interpreted as moves taken by both sides to gain bargaining
counters for the coming ECOWAS summit, which is believed to focus
on a breakthrough of the impasse in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Halt Funding Missile Program Worrying Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli authorities have
expressed their concern over a U.S. Congressional proposal to
halt funding for Israel's development of a ballistic missile
interceptor.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the pro-government newspaper The
Jerusalem Post, unnamed Israeli defense sources expressed worry
and lobbyists in Washington are hoping to convince a joint
House-Senate conference committee to overturn the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House Appropriations Committee recently recommended
that funding for the Israeli-U.S. Boost Phase Intercept (BPI)
program be diverted to a far more ambitious U.S. Air Force program
called Air Borne Laser. BPI is a major component of Israel's
emerging anti-missile defense system.

of the development," a source said. " Now, all we could do is
feasibility (study), if the Senate proposal is accepted."
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study is being done by the Israel Aircraft
Industries and Rafael Israel Armament Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
The BPI program has been funded to the tune of 20 million
U.S. dollars over the last two years. Earlier this year, it was
agreed that the Clinton Administration would ask Congress for 34
million dollars, enough to complete the feasibility study and
begin work on a prototype.
</P>
<P>
BPI is a concept whereby unnamed air vehicles fly over enemy
territory and search for ballistic missile batteries. When a
missile is fired, a small high-velocity rocket is sent to destroy
the enemy projectile during the initial boost phase of launch.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force wants funding for a program in which a
Boeing 747 spots the enemy missile launch and fires a
high-powered laser to destroy it. U.S. officials said that the
program is still in the pre-feasibility stage and that it will
take up to 2006 until production begins.

<HEADLINE> Removing Illegal Posters From Chinese Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to get rid of illegal
posters and grafitti on walls was begun today in 100 Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern city of Harbin, thousands of young
volunteers worked along 1,486 streets to tear down illegal posters
and wash away large characters with the help of local residents.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Zhengzhou, some 2,000 youngsters got
involved in the activity, helping residents put up boards where
they can post notices legally and erased illegal advertisements in
public places.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 streets in east China's Nanjing city will be built into
"courtesy streets" according to an agreement reached between young
volunteers and local residents today.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the campaign is to improve people's morale and
lifestyle, just one of the series of activities for the opening of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Build Satellites Launching Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will build a
satellite launching center in Overberg in Western Cape Province,
a local daily Saturday Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Province is set to become the "Cape Canaveral", a
U.S. aerospace base, in the Southern hemisphere, earning the
region upward of 106 million U.S. Dollars a year and creating
hundreds of hi-tech aerospace jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Houwteq, an aerospace division of South African commercial
giant Denel, is involved in negotiations with a major
international aerospace group which is keen to have its
satellites integrated and launched at the Houwteq site,,
Houwteq's divisional manager Ian Farr said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are well advanced and we are confident that a
deal will be signed before the end of the year," Farr said. He
declined to identify the name of the aerospace group.
</P>
<P>
Houwteq had the capability to integrate, test and get an
average of 10 satellites ready for launch a year, according to
Farr.
</P>
<P>
"We will test, integrate and get the satellite and launch
vehicle ready for orbit at our site," Farr said.
</P>
<P>
Houwteq will run its satellite-launching facility in joint
ventures with other countries that will supply rockets from
sources such as Russia, which has many surplus launch vehicles
after its post-Cold War disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Several international satellite groups recently visited the
Houwteq site and the Overberg launch facility, the report said,
adding that British Aerospace, Sweden and the Czech Republic had
already used the facility for aviation and other tests.
</P>
<P>
South Africa developed an advanced space program in the early
1990s, successfully launching three rockets into space during the
test phase.
</P>
<P>
However, pressure from the United States and the escalating
cost of the 1.06 billion Dollar space project forced the country
to scrap its rocket development program.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Condemns Lopsided Pressure on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has called on the United States to put pressure on Israel rather
than the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) only, saying that it
is unfair to show severity to PNA President Yasser Arafat alone.
</P>
<P>
In an interview front-paged in today's Al-Ahram, a leading
Egyptian daily, Mubarak, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian
cause, warned against negative consequences of weakening the
position of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"If Arafat is gone, inter-Palestinian acute problems will erupt
and a state of anarchy will ensue, dealing a death blow to the
peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said progress in the Arab-Israeli negotiating process
is the way to stop violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Security coordination, highlighted by Israel, is not
everything," he added in the interview.
</P>
<P>
After the July 30 suicide bombings in Jerusalem which killed 15
Israeli civilians, Israel clamped a series of security measures
including travel ban and economic sanctions on the Palestinians
and demanded a firmer Palestinian hand on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He told the Arabic daily that closure of Palestinian self-rule
areas and Israel's anti-Palestinian mass punishment measures might
cause more violence than before.
</P>
<P>
Describing the stand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as "unbalanced," Mubarak said the Likud leader has to
abide by his peace commitments to encourage the Palestinians to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has urged Israel to ease the sanctions against the
Palestinians but apparently accepted Israel's insistence on seeing
the Palestinians give evidence of renewed security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president also showed caution to a proposed summit bringing
him with Arafat, Netanyahu and Jordan's King Hussein together,
which will possibly be sponsored by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright during her upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of good preparation and, consequently, failure of such a
summit, would lead to negative results and fuel frustration," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had failed to mediate an end to the Palestinian-Israeli
crisis before an intense four-day shuttle diplomacy of U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross helped re-establish security talks between
intelligence officials of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Albright had announced she planned to make her first trip to
the region, probably in September to push across a major U.S.
peace initiative that will focus on accelerated talks on a final
peace settlement and implementation of the existing
Israeli-Palestinian agreements.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinians Given Life Sentence for Murdering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- In a speedy trial, the
Palestinian court in Jericho today sentenced two Palestinians to
life imprisonment for murdering an Israeli taxi driver Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another 17-year-old Palestinian was sentenced to 15 years in
jail for his part in the murder. The three confessed killing the
taxi driver, 45-year-old Ben Baruch from Jerusalem, in an attempt
to steal his money and his white Mercedes-Benz car.
</P>
<P>
Today's trial came only hours after Baruch's body was found in
a well near Jericho according to the confession of the murders.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian police cooperated in the search for
Baruch after he disappeared Thursday on his way to Jericho with a
passenger. Baruch's car was late found abandoned in a refugee camp
south of Jericho, which led the arrest the suspects by Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police immediately notified their Israeli
counterparts, who recovered Baruch's body from where it was hidden.
</P>
<P>
Israel praised the cooperation of the Palestinian police in
the rapid conclusion of the murder case.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani confirmed the full
cooperation from the Palestinian police, but he noted that the
joint efforts in fighting car theft were much easier than in the
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani expressed the wish that cooperation between Israeli
and Palestinian security forces would continue in all levels to
the benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Despite both sides agreed to resume full security cooperation
in fighting terrorism as a result of the mediation by U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross in the past week, Israel said it is still
waiting to see concrete steps taken by the other side to fight
extremist Islamic organizations and their infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Not to Increase Oil Output: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has denied it
threatened to increase oil output in retaliation for Latin
American oil exporter Venezuela's violation of its quota within
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"Threatening or warning is not how we operate," said Prince
Abdelaziz Bin Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz, Saudi petroleum
undersecretary, quoted by Riyadh-based Arabic daily Okaz today.
</P>
<P>
The prince was commenting on an article in the U.S. Wall Street
Journal Friday claiming Saudi Arabia sounded the threat during a
meeting between him and the head of a Venezuelan oil firm on the
sidelines of OPEC ministerial conference in Vienna last June.
</P>
<P>
The prince said that during that meeting they examined the
launching of joint investment ventures between the two countries,
including in the field of oil refining.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, one of OPEC's 11 members, now produces 3 million
barrels of crude per day (bpd), exceeding its quota of 2.29
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and exporter, pumps
out slightly more than 8 million bpd. It has about one fourth of
the world's total proven oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's oil production ceiling stands at 25.03 million bpd. But
as member countries increased yield starting last November, its
daily output reached 27.05 million barrels in April this year,
about 2 million barrels above the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
This 8 percent surplus of production, however, forced oil
prices in the world markets to decline by 20 percent in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's oil ministers formally endorsed in Vienna June 26 a
quickly-concluded accord including a roll-over until the year end
of the notional production ceiling of 25.03 million barrels a day,
intending to tell the world oil markets they are serious about
cutting back oversupply to reverse a downtrend in crude
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A flame to ignite torches for
the upcoming Eight Chinese National Games arrived here on
Saturday, just hours after being lit in Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
The fire, kept in a specially-made box, was burned out of the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, where the handover
ceremony of the Hong Kong's return to China was held in midnight
of last June 30.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and Wei Jizhong, vice chairman of the
Eighth National Games Organizing Committee, attended the
fire-burning ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The rain paused when we lit the fire, but it had been raining
before the ceremony and kept raining after. We are really in good
luck, " said vice president of Shanghai Physical Culture and
Sports Commission Li Yuyi, who accompanied the fire back to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This was the first of two fires used to light torches for the
Eight Naitonal Games, which is scheduled to open in Shanghai on
October 12.
</P>
<P>
The other flame will be lit in Shanghai on August 23 at the
site of the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC),
which was held in 1921 and announced the founding of CPC.
</P>
<P>
Torches will be burned with the two fires by a Chinese leader
in a spectacular ceremony in Tiananmen Square and be relayed
across China.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Not Happy with Continued Decline in Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today expressed his unhappiness with the
continued decline in the value of the country's currency ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit, together with Indonesia's rupiah, the Thai baht
and the Philippine peso, fell sharply against the U.S. dollar in
recent weeks due to strong currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is discussing with other members of ASEAN faced with
the same problem to seek ways to deal with the matter, Mahathir
told reporters here after opening the 26th delegates conference of
Gerakan, a component party of the ruling National Front led by
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
He said the central banks in the region, including Malaysia's
Central Bank, have been in "some communication" with each other.
</P>
<P>
On whether the central banks in the region would get together
to fight the decline in the value of several ASEAN currencies, he
said "We see what we can do... We have some communication."
</P>
<P>
To a question on if he was still happy with the level of the
ringgit, Mahathir said "of course, I am not happy. I want the
ringgit to go back to an acceptable level."
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian leader said his country will come out of
this some how. "We have got confidence we can manage our economy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said due to the so-called "open economy", the rich
countries today have found a way of subverting the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is in their favor. They have the money (and) they
can subvert us. We work for 14 years trying to build up the
economy and these people come and rob poor people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), Mahathir said that
local investors and fund managers must protect the KLSE and
maintain the prices of the counters or "otherwise they will lose".
</P>
<P>
"We already lost more than 200 billion ringgit (about 74
billion U.S. dollars) which is equivalent to about four years of
our national budget and this is because the robbers come and
undermine our economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Reiterates Liberalization Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral today reiterated his government's determination to
continue liberalization policy pursued in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national conference of "50 years of Indian
industry -- the challenges for the future", organized by the
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here, Gujral said that
after 50 years of political independence, the country should work
for economic independence.
</P>
<P>
There would be no turning back from the policies of
liberalization. The reform in India did not hang in air, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his government's commitment to investment oriented
policies, particularly in the infrastructure sector, the prime
minister said that it was time for private investors to
participate in the core sector.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Outsiders (foreign investors) are welcome, but will
not be allowed to drown us. They are welcome but will not be
allowed to takeover. They will invest in sectors where we need
them."
</P>
<P>
He said this in an obvious bid to allay the Indian industry's
fears of multinationals swamping them.
</P>
<P>
He warned against any complacency on the economic growth front,
saying "without growth we are doomed. Growing population and
increasing unemployment have to be looked in totality."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange were lower this week.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Composite Index, which tracked 100 quality
stocks, sagged to a low of 885.22 before recovering to a high of
929.50. It ended the week 22.18 points lower than 910.18 last
week.
</P>
<P>
The all main board share Emas Index lost 8.0 points to 261.99
and the Industrial Index lost 15.01 points to 1,865.56.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the local currency ringgit hit a
historical low of 2.8250 against the U.S. dollar since it was
officially floated in 1973, on speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
To check against the impact of a weaker ringgit and correct the
country's external account imbalance, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim's announcement that the government may
consider deferring national projects which are not considered
"critical," and try to boost exports through budgetary measures
are most welcome by economists, analysts and the business people.
</P>
<P>
However, it failed to boost confidence in the stock market
badly battered by liquidation by foreign players.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Friday called upon
local investors to dominate the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Three counters were listed on the second board this week, with
PPB Oil Palms, whose initial share offer price was 2.80 ringgit,
ending the week at 2.87 ringgit, General Soil whose initial share
offer price was 2.70 ringgit, settling the week at 7.25 ringgit
and Ocean Capital whose initial share offer was 3.00 ringgit,
closing at 5.80 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover rose to 1.243 billion
shares worth 5.624 billion ringgit from 1.065 billion shares

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.
</P>
<P>
Demands for palm oil improved this week as the ringgit
continued its bearish note, which closed at 2.7830/50 a U.S.
dollar against 2.6500/30 last week.
</P>
<P>
August South sharply increased by 47.50 ringgit to 1,295
ringgit (about 470 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Players expect CPO physicals to move up next week, adjusting to
the ringgit factor. Analysts felt that the local unit would
continue to remain weak in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) also closed higher at 14.65
ringgit (5.4 dollars) per kg against 14.52 ringgit (5.3 dollars)
per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
"Demands for the local tin improved on the ringgit's weakness
as it was considered cheap for overseas buyers," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
Players ignored the weak movement on the London Metal Exchange
(LME), which witnessed a sharp fall since early in the week, as
the local market was dominated by the currency factors.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover of the week narrowed to 743 tons against
914 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM price differential to that of the LME stood at a
discount of 15 dollars per ton against a discount of 5 dollars
last week.
</P>
<P>
Trader said the value of the ringgit to the U.S. dollar will
determine the prospects of demand for local tin next week, but
further uptrend is likely as the local currency seemed to retreat
further.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market during the week, Malaysian
rubber showed some signs of price recovery on the weakening of the
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The rubber price which once hit its low of 228.00 sen (84 U.S.
cents) per kg for the RSS grade in mid-July, in dull trading,
closed at 250.50 sen (92 U.S. cents) per kg compared to 247.50 sen
(91 U.S. cents) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, demands also improved, especially for the
nearby month which adjusted to the currency factor.
</P>
<P>
Steadier movement on the Tokyo market also spurred the bullish
sentiments in the market this week, despite surplus production in
Indonesia and Thailand, which still sell their rubber below the
market price.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Addressing Challenges in Open World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKAKTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on the people to be ready to address challenges and
seize new opportunities in an open global economy and free trade
era.
</P>
<P>
In his state address at the parliament here today to mark the
52nd anniversary of the country's independence, the president said
the world seems to become a huge economic entity.
</P>
<P>
"We live in a fast-changing world. Quite often what takes place
in a country or region will immediately have an impact on anther
country or region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The main challenge remains to be how these fundamental on-going
changes can be transformed into the establishment of a new world
order which is more peaceful, equitable and prosperous for all, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the current changes in the world can bring a
beneficial but also an adverse impact on economy and development,
especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do is to capitalize on the beneficial
influences, on the one hand, and to minimize as little as possible
whatever damaging influences to our national development,"
stressed the president.
</P>
<P>
He held that the recent upheavals affecting the currencies of
several countries in the Southeast Asian region have been a
concrete evidence of the adverse impact of an open global economy.
</P>
<P>
Currencies of some Southeast Asian countries including
Indonesia have depreciated against the U.S. dollar since early
July.
</P>
<P>
He said, the speculative actions by certain individuals have
worsened the situation and raised the market sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
"The recent experience has taught us a valuable lesson that in
a situation full of uncertainties and upheavals, the economic
fundamentals conditions is very important and decisive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of closer relations amongst
nations to face regional and international monetary upheavals.
'Not a single country is immune to them. Not a single country will
be able to brave these global waves."

<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- One year after the arrest of pedophile Marc Doutroux who was
accused of killing two little girls and abducting two others, the
Belgians have lost confidence in their government's capability of
bringing to the daylight of a pedophile criminal network in the
country, as the parliamentary commission in charge of
investigating the case has made no breakthrough so far.
</P>
<P>
-- Twenty years after his death, the legendary King Elvis
Presley is still serving as fresh air to exhale the perfume of
liberty to tens of thousands of fans, although for most Americans,
he is above all the incarnation of insolence, desanctification of
sex, and the desire to reject the archaic models of a world fallen
with the 2nd World War.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Only fewer than 50,000 people paraded in the streets of New
Delhi Friday as India began to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of its independence. No euphoria was given by the government on
the occasion, which is aware of the enormous challenge it is faced
with 50 years after India had its "rendezvous with destiny" and
awoke to the ringing of freedom bells.
</P>
<P>
-- The Congo Republic has plunged deeper into civil war despite
the ceasefire agreement signed by the belligerent parties on July
13. Fighting between the Cobras militias supporting General Sassou
Nguesso and the troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba
intensified their fighting with heavy weapons along the railway
track dividing Brazzaville into eastern and western parts.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Growth Reaches 7.98 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said today that his country's economic growth in 1996 reached 7.98
percent, higher than the earlier provisional estimate of 7.82
percent.
</P>
<P>
In his state address on the occasion of the 52nd anniversary of
Indonesia' independence before the parliament here today, the
president said with such an economic growth and the population
growth rate of 1.58 percent, Indonesia's per capita income has
reached 1,155 U.S. dollars, 16 times higher compared to the figure
of 1969.
</P>
<P>
Until the third year of the current Sixth Five-Year Development
Plan (1994-1999), Indonesia's economy has grown with an average of
7.9 percent annually, he said, adding that it is quite high
compared to the average goal of 7.1 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
The high economic growth was spurred by the great enthusiasm in
investment. In the past 1996-97 fiscal year, the approved domestic
investment reached more than 105 trillion rupiah (42 billion U.S.
dollars), an increase of 20 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of approved foreign investments continues to be
high, totalling 26.6 billion dollars, although not as high as the
previous year with 39 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the industrialization process, Soeharto said that
the share of the agricultural sector in the national product is
expected to continue to decline. However, its share in the economy
remains extremely vital, as a source of foodstuffs, as basic
materials for industry and also as a source of income for millions
of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the non-oil/gas industry has
grown at an average of 12.8 percent annually during the three
years of the current five-year plan, making the industry the motor
of development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the country's economic stability is
demonstrated by, among other things, the controlled inflation rate
and the foreign exchange reserves that are maintained within a
safe limit.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Indonesia's inflation rate was still 9.2 percent. It
was lowered to 8.6 percent in 1995 and 6.5 percent in 1996. It is
expected to reduce to 5.2 percent in 1997, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Although the current account deficit is expanding, Soeharto
said, the balance of payments remains safe as a result of the
substantial inflow of capital.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the country's current account
deficit will reach 9.8 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's foreign exchange reserves is estimated
at 21 billion dollars. The potential of foreign exchange reserves
to finance import has increased from 4.6 months at the end of
1995-96 to 5.5 month last July, said the president.

<HEADLINE> 10 Italian Abducted Tourists Set Free in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- All the 10 Italian tourists
kidnaped by armed tribesmen Thursday in Yemen have been set free,
according to Yemeni security sources.
</P>
<P>
The four Italian tourists who were kidnaped Thursday in the
city of Amran, 45 kilometers north of Sanaa were released Friday,
a security source said here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that the other six Italian tourists who were abducted
Thursday in Abyan province, 490 kilometers south of Sanaa, were
also freed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers aim to malign Yemen's relations with some
friendly nations that have strong economic ties with the country,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that such shameful acts are internationally
incriminated and will not affect the stable ties between Yemen
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
No details were available about the kidnapers' identities or
whether the two abductions were linked.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen in Yemen sometimes kidnap foreigners to press for
money or government funds for projects, and the hostages are
later freed unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Revamp Policies to Face Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew hold that the government should revamp its policies in
major economic sectors to face the keener global competition and
the result of breakthroughs in technology, especially information
technology, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a local National Day celebration dinner Friday
night, the minister said that for the last one year, the
government has been doing a stock-taking and an audit of
Singapore's position in the context of regional and international
developments.
</P>
<P>
"Global competition is keener, and our competitiveness is under
challenge," Lee said, "One result of this re-examination of our
challenge is the need for a better and differently trained
workforce, one able to respond to the changes in information
technology."
</P>
<P>
"Education and training are the decisive factors," he stressed,
"it is the software we put into our people."
</P>
<P>
Taking the financial market in Singapore as an example, Lee
said that in order to compete with other financial centers like
Hong Kong, Singapore must "try to be a bigger business center for
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) businessmen, for
the top ASEAN companies, just like Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"We have to be a cosmopolitan Asian city for all peoples from
the world over, Americans, Europeans, Arabs, and Asians," he
urged.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister also called on the Singapore Airlines to
become "globally competitive" and warned that if it failed to do
so, "it will decline."

</P>
<P>
Mandela told a mass media conference here Friday that winning
the Olympic bid would have far reaching implications to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"About 92,000 jobs will be created and over a 1,000 low-cost

<HEADLINE> Kenya Ready to Negotiate with IMF Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
willing and ready to resume "tough negotiations" with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the lapsed key loan,
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Micah Cheserem has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is considering re-opening talks with IMF for the
remaining two-year arrangement of the 215-million-U.S.-Dollar
three-year loan offered under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), he was quoted by today's Kenya Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has implemented far-reaching economic
reforms in the last four years, said Cheserem, pleading foreign
investors not to "abandon Kenya in view of the current problems."
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF suspended on August 1 its key loan to
Kenya, citing high-level corruption as a key reason.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loan suspension immediately created panic at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange and the Shilling has continuously taken a
downward spiral, although the CBK has so far pumped in some 100
million Dollars sold to commercial banks to stabilize the shock,
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said on Friday his bank would leave the shilling at
the mercy of the market forces and would only move in to cushion
dramatic changes.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling remained weak on Friday after marginal gains to
close at 69.75 from 69.97 against U.S. Dollar, depreciating by
18.2 percent during the past two weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China today set up a fund that
will provide financial support for poor university students, as a
part of a national program in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The "Cross-Century Development Fund for Chinese University
Student", with a donation of 10 million yuan (some 1.2 million US
dollars) from a company in east China's Fujian Province, will help
poor students complete their study on campuses.
</P>
<P>
The idea of raising money for poor students was produced by the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the
All-China Students Federation early last year.
</P>
<P>
Survey shows that some 10 percent of the students in a few key
Beijing-based universities find it difficult to pay tuition
fees. Many of the students come from families of farmers and urban
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 poor students have received financial support
since last year, according to the students federation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Penetration Upsets S. African Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's diamond
giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd has announced that it will
move to prevent foreign diamond mining companies from snapping up
mining properties it had sold to black South Africans.
</P>
<P>
"We were a little disappointed that one, maybe more of the
property that we sold have in fact been on-sold to Canadian
companies," local daily "The Citizen" quoted De Beers diamond
consultant Gareth Penny as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
This had created unwelcome competition and De Beers was now
considering introducing a buy-back clause on property sold, Penny
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Penny, De Beers had earlier this year reviewed
all its mining properties and identified 50 that were suitable
for small black-owned mining companies.
</P>
<P>
"We put those out for sale earlier this year and we were very
pleased that we managed to sell 44," Penny said.
</P>
<P>
South African Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna
recently criticized large mining groups for monopolizing mineral
rights and sitting on properties rather than developing them.
</P>
<P>
Maduna hinted that he might change the present system of
mineral rights to ensure that more black groups became involved
in mining.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Consumer Council
warned that a chemical used to dye clothes might cause skin
cancer, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Azo dyes, which contain banned chemical benzidine, were found
on four T-shirt samples out of 44 bought from outlets in Hong
Kong, today's South China Morning Post quoted the Council as
saying.
</P>
<P>
All four samples were bought from street hawkers and had no
labels, making it impossible to trace their origin, while the rest
of the samples, all purchased from department stores, were judged
safe.
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting the use and sale of azo dyes, which
can be made from alternative safer chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Consumer Council said that there was no
scientific consensus on the health-status of azo dyes. A new study
in the Netherlands warned of possible danger in the use of azo
dyes, while a U.S. test in 1983 said azo dyes posed no health
risk.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic's Decision on Parliament Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic's decision early last month to dissolve the parliament was
challenged today by the constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
The court in Pale, capital of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, announced its ruling after days of deliberations
beginning from Tuesday, said a Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
The ruling held that Plavsic's decision on July 3 to dissolve
the parliament and hold a new parliamentary election on September
1 did not conform to the constitution of the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, in a televised speech tonight, Plavsic declined to
comment on the court's ruling and said she was yet to receive an
official statement from the constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic has recently run into serious disputes with the
parliament on some important issues, and her decision to dissolve
the legislative body is seen as a move to dump the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In its response, the Bosnian Serb government, which has been on
the parliament's side in the disputes with Plavsic, sued the
president at the constitutional court on July 7.

FUZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A maritime public security alarm
system in China's Fujian province has begun work, the second
coastal area in China, after Hainan province, to use it, according
to Colonel Wang Changtai, vice commander of the Fujian Provincial
Frontier Guards.
</P>
<P>
Favorable natural conditions and a vast offshore area with a
3,300-km coastline, and 1,400 islands and 2,120 ports provide a
great boost to the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, they also provide a good place for marine crime,
which is on the increase, everything from blockade running,
smuggling, and plundering to murder.
</P>
<P>
Taking a tip from the model police forces in Zhangzhou city,
the Fujian maritime frontier guards decided to set up a maritime
public security system.
</P>
<P>
The alarm system is expected to help control violent crime,
maintain maritime public security, and assist other departments
with marine incidents, Colonel Wang explained, adding that the
system will be first used by the First Maritime Armed Police
Detachment, and then expanded next year to two other
detachments.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Wenjie, who became the
foster mother of a year-old orphan in Guilin in China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region is one of 30 people who have volunteered
to care for abandoned children in this scenic tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
World Vision, the international charitable organization, has
worked with local social welfare institutes to develop this
program, providing financial support for the foster mothers, who
must have sufficient living space, a healthy family life, and
hygienic conditions for the adopted orphans.
</P>
<P>
They must also prove that they and their family members have no
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
The head of World Vision visited Zhu and her new daughter
recently, and the 45-year-old foster mother said, "When I saw the
advertisement of the social welfare institute, the idea of
adopting an orphan came to my mind," explaining that she felt very
lonely after her retirement.
</P>
<P>
"I have deeply loved children since I was very young," she
said, and her own children are grown and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption in March, the Guilin Social Welfare
Institute has checked monthly on the conditions of the 30 orphans.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, the program will be expanded to other
cities and counties in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holds Off Military Ally Status for Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today held off granting Argentina the status of
an ally outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting here with visiting
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Albright said she and
her Argentine counterpart would discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of decision that requires consultation with
Congress," she added. "There is no announcement being made."
</P>
<P>
However, the top U.S. diplomat noted that Argentina is "one of
the closest friends and partners the United States has in this
hemisphere and around the world."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Albright said the United States is planning to
grant the status to Argentina. "The announcement has not yet been
made but we do wish to recognize Argentina role," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. president
has the right to designate close military allies, a status that
does not require U.S. help in case of attacks, but allows the
allies to buy excess weapons from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Countries already designated as close non-NATO U.S. allies are
Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the granting of the status to Argentina is
expected to be announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton when he
visits Argentina in October.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration last week lifted a ban on the sale
of high-tech arms to Latin America. The ban was imposed in the
1970s when most countries in the region was under military rule.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the moves by Washington in Latin America are
designed to compete with France, Russia and other European
countries for the arms market in the region.

COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's port Authority today
said it has improved the Colombo Port's performance by handling
one million containers by August 15, equivalent to the total
containers for the whole of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to port authority sources, the one-million-container
mark was reached by late October in 1996 while the total number
stood at 1,001,526 containers by August 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this feat had been possible due to increased
economic activities in the country as well as the services newly
provided for ships carrying larger volumes in the Colombo Port.

<P>
Colombo Port handled 1.3 million containers in 1996, an
increase of 29 percent over 1995.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Bars Foreign Trading Houses From Retail Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
likely to give conditional approval for foreign trading houses to
set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in certain specific sectors, but
will not allow them to enter into the retail business, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting here, the Foreign Investment Promotion
Board (FIPB) decided to permit wholly-owned subsidiaries of
foreign trading houses to undertake exports and imports in line
with export-import policy specifications.
</P>
<P>
But the board agreed to bar trading houses with 100 percent
foreign equity from the retail business due to opposition from the
domestic industry, especially the small sector. Many corporations
said this would result in such companies importing consumer goods
from the principles abroad and selling them in the retail market.
</P>
<P>
The FIPB has put on hold for the past four months a dozen
proposals by Japanese and American multinationals to establish
trading houses here.

OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A woman and a man were killed
by a black bear in a remote northern park in Canada's British
Columbia (B.C.) province, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The woman's 13-year-old son and a man were also attacked and
suffered injuries.

<P>
The black bear was shot and killed by a tourist who rushed to
get a gun, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Govt Ready to Help Carpet Industry: Nepali PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The government is ready for
discussions with the carpet industry to further promote its
development, Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said.
</P>
<P>
The carpet industry which is Nepal's top exporter has been
making a significant contribution to the economy by earning
foreign exchange and providing jobs, Chand said Friday when
inaugurating the annual general meeting of the Central Carpet
Industry Association (CCIA).
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of last fiscal year which ended on
July 14, Nepal produced about 2.7 million square meters of carpet
and earned some 150 million U.S. dollars, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Nepalese depend on the industry for livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The number of carpet enterprises affiliated to the CCIA has
reached 844.
</P>
<P>
Although false publicity had brought about some slump in the
carpet industry in the past, there now seems to be a turnaround,
Chand said, adding that what the industry needs is improvement in
quality and market diversity.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is referring to the alleged involvement of
child labor in the carpet industry, which has led to a decline in
export.
</P>
<P>
Besides, low quality and use of the hazardous azo dyes are also
among the main problems facing Nepalese carpet industry.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government recorded a
budget surplus of 1.08 billion U.S. dollars in June, the Finance
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Canada's federal government has posted
consecutive monthly budgetary surpluses since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The latest monthly surplus was due to lower spending and rising
revenues from taxes, the government said.
</P>
<P>
In May, the budget surplus was 980 million dollars, compared
with a deficit of 420 million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Over the first three months of the current fiscal year, the
deficit was reported at 360 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Exports From Philippine Economic Zones Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Exports from the Philippines'
dozens of economic zones soared 132.7 percent to 6.40 billion U.S.
dollars in the first half of the year from 2.75 billion dollars a
year ago, according to a government report published here today.
</P>
<P>
Exports from the four government-run economic zones expanded by
more than 23 percent to reach 2.18 billion dollars during the
first semester, said the report issued by the Philippine Economic
Zone Authority (PEZA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments from private economic zones increased by
331 percent to 4.2 billion dollars from the 978 billion dollars
recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shipments from the economic zones accounted for more than half
of the Philippines' 11-billion-dollar exports during the same
period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For the month of June alone, shipments from the state and
private industrial estates amounted to 2.5 billion dollars, a
135-percent jump from May.
</P>
<P>
PEZA Director General Lilia de Lima attributed the robust
growth to the increased number of locators in the special economic
zones as well as the recovery of the global electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far established 54 economic zones, of which
only four were run by the government. The economic zones have
become a major foreign exchange earner for the Philippines during
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The economic zones earned the Philippines 6.5 billion dollars
in export receipts in 1996, accounting for 32 percent of the
country's total export earnings that year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Arresting Karadzic With Senior Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today discussed with top foreign policy officials the necessity of
apprehending former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who is
indicted by Washington and its allies as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Clinton met with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and U.S. envoy to Bosnia Richard Holbrooke, White House
spokesman Michael McCurry stressed the importance of putting
Karadzic on trial.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for all the parties to make good the
commitment specifically expressed in the Dayton accords, that he
and other indicted war criminals are to play no role in the
political life of Bosnia-Herzegovina or the Republic of Srpska,"
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that Clinton made no decisions at
the meeting, saying "It was a review of decisions that he already
has taken."
</P>
<P>
McCurry warned that Karadzic should be "concerned that the
international community is growing increasingly impatient with the
inability of the war crimes tribunal to try the case that he as
been indicted for."
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have said that the United States is mapping out
a plan to arrest Karadzic, who has a group of guards at his
headquarters in Pale near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic is believed by the West to be the top war criminal in
Bosnia and the major obstacle on the road to peace there.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Booms in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Jijiashan, a leading breeding
township in central China's Henan Province, reported a 3,600 ton
egg output in 1996, a level surpassing the grain output by 890
tons. The per capita income earned from eggs accounted for two
thirds of the total income of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Henan has adopted a series of measures in recent years to boost
the development of animal husbandry as a major part of the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Henan's 1996 meat output hit 4.1 million tons, up 23 percent on
the previous year, with the egg output rising by 21.4 percent to
1.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the province has attached special emphasis on using
its rich wheat stock resource to breed herbivores. The current
ratio of pork dropped 80 percent to 62 percent of total meat
output.
</P>
<P>
The province supports development of large-scale breeding
farms, and is currently home to 8,000 large chicken farms and 300
pig farms with more than 1000 pigs each.
</P>
<P>
The development of animal husbandry has also accelerated the
production of other industries such as fodder and livestock
processing and veterinary medicine.
</P>
<P>
The province has over 400 feed factories with a combined annual
output value of two billion yuan, and some 140-odd veterinary
medicine plants, up 71.4 percent on 1991.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Falls Again, Share Prices Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian rupiah plunged
again Friday to a new record low against the U.S. dollar and
Jakarta share prices followed suit, falling by almost four
percent, analysts here said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said spot rupiah stabilized in Friday
afternoon trading at 2,900 against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
They said the market lost direction following the floating of
the rupiah Thursday. The trading spread widened from five points
before the float to 40 points Friday, exacerbating the fall.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah slumped to 2,960 in midday trading, from an opening
of 2,770/2910 and stabilized in afternoon trading to close at
2,880/2,910.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Mohammad announced on Thursday that
Indonesia abandoned its policy of protecting the currency within
a set trading band which the central bank could intervene to
defend the rupiah from attacks.
</P>
<P>
The float means that the rupiah appreciation against the U.S.
dollar will depend on market mechanism and it will have an impact,
directly or indirectly, on the real sector and business circle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fall in the rupiah dragged share prices on the
Jakarta Stock Exchange, with composite index tumbling by 25.30
points or nearly 4 percent to close at 617.70.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 386.77 million shares on the regular market,
worth 185.44 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most stock brokers said Friday's steep intraday fall was
triggered by panic selling by investors as a result of the rupiah
plunge.
</P>
<P>
State minister of National Development Planning Ginandjar
Karatasasmita assured the market Friday that Indonesia's economy
could withstand the float of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"We just follow market economic principles. Our economy is
strong enough to face that (the floating of the rupiah)," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 12 in Ship Wreck in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a ship wreck
in the central Philippines has risen to 12 as rescuers continued
to search survivors at the rough Biliran Strait where the ship
sank early Friday morning, a Coast Guard officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Crisolito Augustin, head of the Operation Division of the
Second Coast Guard District based in central Cebu city, told
Xinhua by telephone that so far 12 bodies, all passengers, have
been recovered after a day-and-night rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report sent to him from the Coast Guard in Biliran
Province this morning, Augustin said 103 people, including 27 crew
members, have been rescued and 16 others are still listed as
missing.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 fatalities, there were 10 women, one child and one
man, Augustin said, adding that the death toll was feared to go up
due to the bad weather condition on the sea.
</P>
<P>
"The weather forecast said the weather there today is bad, such
as strong winds and big waves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three naval patrol boats, three helicopters and some civilian
volunteers' vessels were involved in the operation to rake the sea
for survivors Friday. Augustin said the rescue operation is still
on-going.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard participating in the rescue operation has
established the exact number of passengers and crew members on
board the 485.5-ton ferry. Augustin said that according to
survivors, the ship carried 88 passengers and 43 crew members.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 52 passengers and 35 crew members were on
board the ship, which capsized and sank at 2 a.m. near Maripipi
Islet, Biliran Province, after being battered by strong winds and
big waves.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old ferry, which has a legal capacity of 449
passengers, was traveling from Cebu city to Tacloban city.

on a higher level, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Klaus made the remarks in meeting with visiting Chinese

<P>
Klause said the Czech Republic is watching closely the rapid
growth of China and that his government is holding a positive
attitude toward the development of the Sino-Czech relations.
</P>

with other countries including China, Klause said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Kuhni
held talks with Shi, and both sides agreed to further strengthen
their cooperation in various fields, particularly in the power

<P>
Shi noted that the Chinese and Czech people have no
fundamental conflict of interests and that China is willing to
develop economic and trade cooperation with the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has approved the second-phase
project for building the Second Power Plant in Shentou, Shanxi
Province.

issues including the equipment import and loans for two complete

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Jump 8 percent in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices in
Colombia will increase eight percent, the country's Mines Ministry
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Starting today, gasoline will cost 1,175 pesos (almost 1.1
U.S. dollars) a gallon, gasoline extra 1,600 pesos, and diesel
1,175, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second fuel price hikes since February 24 this
year when fuel prices rose 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in sales revenue will help offset costs of
operation of the Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol, which have
risen more than 20 percent because of damage to oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The damage was caused by the country's anti-government
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
The price of gasoline has increased 22 percent so far this
year, four percent above the inflationary target proposed by the
Bank of the Republic.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Improves Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region to develop education in recent years have
paid off, as the area now has a primary school enrollment rate of
98.6 percent for the school age children.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi spent 17.9 billion yuan (2.2 billion US dollars) on its
education program from 1990 to 1995, with an annual increase of
25.5 percent. The government also worked out policies to raise the
salary of teachers and improve their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate has risen to 95 percent among young and
middle-aged people.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of students from minority ethnic groups in
school is higher than the proportion of minority people in the
total population of the region, due to the preferential education
policies for the minority groups.
</P>
<P>
And more people in the region are going to college; over 23
colleges and universities enrolled a total of 63,500 people, a 68
percent rise from 1990. Some 23 colleges specifically for adult
students took in 55,300, up 82 percent from the figure of 1990.

<HEADLINE> New Housing For 600,000 Beijing Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- There has been some progress in
building residential housing and renovating rundown houses in
Beijing's "Comfortable Housing" Project in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Some 600,000 Beijing residents have moved into new housing in
the past five years, according to the Municipal Urban and Rural
Construction Committee. This meant an additional 33 million
sq.m. of housing, raising per capita floor space from 8.31 sq.m. in
1992 to 9.33 sq.m. last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, work on about two
million sq.m. began and a fourth of that has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, about 2.9 million sq.m. of old housing has been
torn down and 4.9 million sq.m. renovated.
</P>
<P>
The "Comfortable Housing" Project, which was intended to help
families living in cramped quarters get more space, has provided
1.88 million sq.m. of housing for 21,000 such families.
</P>
<P>
With its help, about 10,000 families with per capita floor
space of less than four sq.m. will move into new housing by the
end of this year.

WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi was beaten by
Mark Woodforde in the quarterfinals of the one-million US dollars
RCA Championships tennis tournament in Indianapolis on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 16th-seeded American failed to enlarge his comeback winning
streak from three matches, acknowledging the defeat 6-3, 5-7, 6-3
in two hours and 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, Agassi, the former world No. 1 who currently ranked
74th in the world, was far from displeased.
</P>
<P>
"I got more than I expected this week," said the 27-year-old
Agassi, "my desire and competitiveness are still there, they are
what will help me win more matches."
</P>
<P>
Australian Woodforde broke Agassi for 4-2 to take the first
before Agassi battled in the swirling conditions to level the set
at one each.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, Agassi was broken twice, the second time
after saving a match point.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Jonas Bjorkman from Sweden needed three sets and
more than two hours to oust American qualifier Tommy Ho.

<HEADLINE> China Unifies Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China has decided to establish a
unified nationwide basic pension insurance system to replace the
current flexible pilot programmes by the end of 1998, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Li Boyong, Minister of Labour, as saying at a
national working meeting on social insurance yesterday that the
ministry has won the approval of the State Council to unify the
pension insurance system and to collect pension insurance funds in
the rest of the provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the transition to the unified system
should be accomplished by the end of the next year in principle,
but certain areas may be given an extension of one year with the
State Council's consent.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Li asked local governments and labour
departments to promote combining unemployment insurance with the
"re-employment project" and to establish medical care, child birth
and industrial injury insurance.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasised the importance of properly managing the pension
insurance fund, "which must not be used for any form of investment
except the purchase of State treasury bonds."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that about 88 million Chinese
people, 23 million of whom are retirees, have joined the pension
insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
However, one-fifth of the country's urban employees remain
outside it. Most of them are workers in overseas-funded or private
enterprises, self-employed business people or rural labourers
working in cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
recalled 1.2 million pounds of ground beef produced by an Arkansas
company because of new evidence of possible contamination by E.
coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman urged those who has
purchased frozen ground-beef patties since June 4 to check their
freezers to determine if any of the Hudson Foods Co. products are
there. If so, they should be returned to the point of purchase.
</P>
<P>
The suspect ground beef was produced at Hudson's Nebraska plant
in Columbus, Nebraska on June 4, June 5 and June 9. Government
officials are trying to determine if other contaminated products
were produced there.
</P>
<P>
"USDA is conducting a thorough investigation at the plant to
ensure that no unsafe product is being allowed to go into
commerce," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
Although Hudson voluntarily recalled some 40,000 pounds of
hamburger earlier this week after health officials in Colorado
traced the illnesses of about 20 people to hamburger patties they
ate in early June.
</P>
<P>
E. coli bacteria can cause severe diarrhea, cramps and
dehydration and can be fatal. The young, elderly and people with
weak immune systems are most susceptible.

WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Department on
Friday denied allegations in the Israeli press that the United
States was disappointed with the extent to which Israel had eased
sanctions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz claimed earlier today that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu betrayed promises he had
made to U.S. mediator Dennis Ross regarding the extent to which
sanctions were to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, including the closure of Israeli-Palestinian
borders and withholding of tax revenues, were imposed in the
aftermath of a suicide bombing on July 30, which killed 16 people
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"It is understandable that they would undergo a certain degree
of intensified security measures in order to try to deter and
prevent any new terrorist acts of the kind that so traumatized the
nation a couple of weeks ago," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he also said: "We believe that the decision to withhold
funds from the Palestinian Authority and some of the closure with
respect to humanitarian goods and movement of peoples were
counter-productive and unwise."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- As the year 2000 is drawing
near, U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday announced a series of
events to usher in a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In the hallowed halls of the U.S. Archives building, Clinton
outlined a multi-year list of goals, projects and celebrations,
and urged Americans to use the White House site on the Internet to
suggest even more.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "With the millennium, we must now decide how to
think about our commitment to the future."
</P>
<P>
However, much of his list consisted of previously announced
activities, and White House officials acknowledged they had not
developed any single blockbuster idea.
</P>
<P>
Ellen McCulloch-Lovell, director of the White House Millennium
Program, said, "We're looking for ideas," adding "I think that
people understand that this is a milestone in human history. And
if there were a big thing that would mark it, we'd certainly be
receptive to that."
</P>
<P>
The events announced by Clinton include:
</P>
<P>
-- a White House lecture series;
</P>
<P>
-- the president's longstanding campaign goal of connecting
schools to the Internet;
</P>
<P>
-- a series of television advertisements known as "Millennium
Minutes;" and
</P>
<P>
-- the dispatching of teams of photographers nationwide "to
capture their visions of America at the turn of the 21st century."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces Begins Build-up in Bosnia for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
started to rotate its troops deployed in Bosnia, increasing the
number to between 11,000 and 12,000 during the forthcoming
elections, Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Campbell said an
advance party from the Second Armoured Cavalry Regiment, now in
Tazar, Hungary went to Tuzla in Bosnia to prepare for the arrival
of troops starting next week.
</P>
<P>
The troops they will replace, from 3rd Brigade of the 1st
Infantry Division, will not leave Bosnia until about two weeks
after the Bosnian elections in September.
</P>
<P>
"It's an increase, it's a planned increase, and it's done for a
reason," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The in-and-out move, which will take place over a series of
weeks, allows for an overlap to occur just as Bosnia plans its
mid-September municipal elections, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"We did this before with the national elections (in Bosnia)...
It's temporary. We've been clear and public about this for
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 8,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia, a part
of more than 30,000 multinational forces which help enforce the
Bosnia peace accords signed in Dayton, the U.S., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The troops are due to leave Bosnia by the deadline of June
next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stops Illegal Asian Immigrants off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- the United States would not
allow illegal Asian immigrants on board a vessel to enter the
country, the State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin was referring to a vessel Lapas Number 3,
which was intercepted last Tuesday by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy was to prevent illegal immigrants coming to the
country and Washington wanted to make clear to "alien smugglers"
that they "would be wise not to try to send their illegal cargo,"
Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was intercepted by a crew from the Coast Guard after
it was spotted by aircraft, and was boarded on Wednesday by four
officers of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
INS and Coast Guard officials said the passengers were
undocumented Asian migrants. The ship reportedly was flying a
Mexican flag but its registry was not clear.
