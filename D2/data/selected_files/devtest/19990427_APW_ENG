<HEADLINE> Two Rangers Shot at Oregon St. Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANZANITA, Ore. (AP) -- A ranger at Oswald West State Park was  
shot to death today and another was wounded. The gunman fled in the 
rangers' vehicle, and a suspect was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was taken into custody at a roadblock some 30 miles  
from the oceanfront park after leading police on a high-speed 
chase, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slain ranger, who name was not officially released, was  
found a quarter of a mile up a dirt trail leading to the beach, 
according to state police. 
</P>
<P>
	The second ranger, 51-year-old John I. Kerwin, was shot in the  
face and was in stable condition at Columbia Memorial Hospital in 
Astoria. Police say he was able to hike out of the park and flag 
down a motorist. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are in shock, as you can imagine,'' Jean Thompson,  
spokeswoman for Oregon State Parks. ``This is a very close-knit 
organization.'' She knew of no other slayings of a ranger in the 
history of the state park system. 
</P>
<P>
	The rangers, who are unarmed, are responsible for general  
maintenance, collecting fees and issuing citations for infractions 
such as parking violations, she said. She had no information on a 
possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
	The small park, popular with surfers, is 65 miles west of  
Portland. It has overnight camping and huts on the beach with 
scenic views of the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Civilian Imaging Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A civilian satellite that can take the kind  
of detailed photos that previously only spy satellites could 
produce disappeared shortly after it was launched Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An Athena II rocket carrying the Ikonos 1 satellite roared off a  
Vandenberg Air Force Base launch pad at 11:22 a.m., bound for an 
orbit 400 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications with the spacecraft ended about eight minutes  
after liftoff, as planned, but it failed to re-establish contact as 
expected later in the flight. Officials could not say whether it 
remained in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 1,600-pound satellite fell out of orbit, there was little  
if any risk they could survive re-entry and hit the ground, said 
Evan McCollum, spokesman for Lockheed Martin Astronautics. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Imaging, the Denver company that planned to operate the  
satellite, has already built a spare one. John Copple, the chief 
executive officer, said he expects it will be launched before the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1, named after the Greek word for ``image,'' has a camera  
capable of resolving objects one meter square -- about 10 square 
feet. That means the satellite would be able to distinguish between 
a car and truck, according to Space Imaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, only military satellites have been able to photograph  
Earth in such detail. Some experts said they worried that images 
from Ikonos 1 could be used by terrorists or enemy governments to 
plan attacks or spot mobilizing troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government approved the satellite in 1994. Space  
Imaging, a privately held company, said it expects its clients to 
use the images for urban planning, environmental monitoring, 
mapping, assessing the scope of natural disasters, oil and gas 
exploration, monitoring farmland and planning communication 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pike, an authority on space reconnaissance with the private  
Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C., pointed out 
that the government will not allow images of some places to be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dilemma that you've got, though, is how do you make sure  
that Serbia doesn't know where American troops are while making 
sure that American news media is able to cover the war,'' Pike 
said. ``And we're obviously going to have a hard time drawing that 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was built by Lockheed Martin Commercial Space  
Systems. Raytheon built the communications, image processing and 
other elements of the system. Eastman Kodak built the digital 
camera system.

<HEADLINE> McLachlan Sees End to Lilith Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah McLachlan says it's time to raise a family  
and end Lilith Fair -- perhaps forever -- after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all well into our 30s now and we decided we wanted to  
have babies,'' the 31-year-old singer said Tuesday, announcing the 
lineup for the all-woman show's 40-date summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
	McLachlan said she has always considered the tour a three-year  
plan, but she may organize a short Australian tour this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the last year for a good, long while,'' she said.  
``It could be three years, it could be 10 years, it could be 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't considered letting someone else take over to keep  
Lilith Fair running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a bit of a control freak,'' McLachlan said. ``I think it  
would be difficult for me to give it up because my name is so 
associated with it.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Create Port Security Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton created the Interagency  
Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports on Tuesday to 
study threats along the nation's docks. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, similar to one the administration created to  
study airport security, was the brainchild of Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla. It will suggest improvements for the nation's ports. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of America's seaports are vulnerable to be misused for  
criminal purposes,'' Graham said. The panel will have a year to 
submit recommendations to the president and to Congress, and ``I 
would hope that we would start to see the positive effect of the 
work of this committee over the next three to five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American ports currently handle 95 percent of the nation's  
trade. Over the next 15 to 20 years, cargo and passenger trade is 
expected to triple. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, concerned that seaports are becoming a nexus for drugs,  
auto and cargo theft as well as illegal immigration, raised the 
idea of the commission with Clinton two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which will include up to 25 members, will be  
headed by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Upset Over Strike Zone Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires' union head Richie Phillips is upset  
over major league baseball's new directive asking teams to chart 
pitches and file a report about strike zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nonsensical when you look at it,'' Phillips told  
the New York Post. ``It's juvenile. It's just another case of Big 
Brother watching over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The directive, baseball's latest effort to regulate and monitor  
the strike zone, has angered umpires, who perceive this as another 
attempt to undermine their authority, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president of the Office of  
the Commissioner, sent a letter to all teams earlier this month, 
asking that a high-ranking front-office official chart pitches and 
then file a report at the end of each homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson's memo '' said the directive's ``purpose is to stay on  
top of trends and provide as much feedback as possible to the 
league presidents and umpire supervisors.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Senators Oppose Nichols Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- All 10 state senators from Oklahoma County  
want the Legislature to cut off funding for Terry Nichols' state 
murder trial, saying the case will unnecessarily open old wounds 
and soak up money that could be used elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Stratton Taylor, the Senate's president pro  
tempore, the senators pointed out that Nichols already is serving a 
life term for his role in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and is 
unlikely to ever be free again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee of a death sentence in a state trial,''  
the senators said in the letter, which was dated April 19 and 
released Tuesday. ``For that reason and others, we believe it would 
be a mistake to undertake a second prosecution of Mr. Nichols and 
incur the expenses, both financial and human, related to a lengthy 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy charged Nichols on  
March 29 with 160 counts of first-degree murder and said he would 
seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover the cost of the trial, the Legislature has appropriated  
more than $800,000 to Macy's office and $1 million for Nichols' 
defense. And officials say other expenses from Nichols' state trial 
will amount to between $3 million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	He has also promised a state trial for bomber Timothy McVeigh,  
but he has said he would wait to see how McVeigh fares on his 
appeal of his federal death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Set Sights on Bigger Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A day after becoming the first NBA team to  
clinch a division title this season, the Portland Trail Blazers 
went back to work. There are bigger goals ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, we've just climbed one step in a flight of stairs,''  
power forward Brian Grant said after Tuesday's practice. ``And 
there's a lot more steps to be climbed. Our focus is the big 
picture, which is a championship. In order to get to the big 
picture, we've got to walk up a bunch of steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Los Angeles Lakers' loss Monday night, the Blazers had  
won their first Pacific Division title since 1992 before they took 
the floor at home against Denver. Even after a 93-77 victory that 
was Portland's 17th in the last 18 against the Nuggets, there was 
no celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	Players and coaches smiled and joked during Tuesday's light  
workout, but remained focused on trying to edge Utah for the best 
record in the league and homecourt advantage throughout the 
playoffs. The Jazz (34-11) are just a half-game ahead of the 
Blazers (33-11). Should the teams finish tied, Utah would get 
homecourt advantage by taking the season series 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot at stake right now, and we understand that,''  
point guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``A loss right now, as far as 
the best record is concerned, would really hurt us. We've got to 
run the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire was pulled into controversy over the weekend when his  
agent, Aaron Goodwin, complained publicly that his client wasn't 
playing enough late in games. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin's comments appeared in The Sunday Oregonian after  
Stoudamire played just nine minutes in the second half -- and none 
in the fourth quarter -- of Portland's 96-85 loss at Utah on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is unacceptable,'' Goodwin said. ``Damon didn't re-sign  
with the Blazers to sit on the bench during the fourth quarters of 
big games. It's becoming increasingly frustrating to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, who negotiated a seven-year, $81 million deal for  
Stoudamire after the lockout ended, even hinted that his client 
might consider leaving his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not the person they want to run their offense, to  
start and finish the game, certainly there is another roster in the 
league where he can go and play a significant role,'' Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Stoudamire tried to distance himself somewhat from  
his agent's comments, saying he would like to play more but that he 
respected coach Mike Dunleavy's decisions. Stoudamire wouldn't 
discuss the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's dead, man,'' he said. ``That's a dead issue.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said that he was trying to rest Stoudamire, who had  
bruised a shoulder against the Jazz, and that he would have put him 
back in had Portland gotten within a few points in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire, who has struggled offensively for much of the  
season, starts the first and third quarters, with backup Greg 
Anthony playing point guard in the other two periods. The coach 
usually brings Stoudamire back late in the fourth quarter, but 
sometimes leaves Anthony in for his defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire has played 223 minutes in the fourth quarter and  
overtimes this season, while Anthony has played 335. In the last 24 
games, Anthony has a 220-99 edge in fourth-quarter minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said he knew before the season that the Blazers were  
capable of winning the division, but ``that would have been 
stepping out on the plank. It just wouldn't have been reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland cruised to the title after the Lakers and Seattle  
SuperSonics faltered badly. Now, Dunleavy said the Blazers are 
looking at advancing past the opening round of the playoffs for the 
first time in seven years, when Clyde Drexler led the Blazers into 
the finals against the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like if we can win our first-round series, that  
our confidence level will go way up,'' Dunleavy said. ``That's when 
I think we become really dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Seeks AL Win Streak Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- With a victory tonight, Roger Clemens  
would set an AL record with his 18th straight win. The Texas 
Rangers can only wish the milestone was being approached for them 
instead of against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens nearly was traded to Texas from Toronto in February. The  
Rangers were so close to landing him that they were arranging with 
management of the Dallas Stars, the NHL team owned by Rangers owner 
Tom Hicks, for Clemens to be introduced on the ice during their 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
	But before Clemens could lace up any skates, the New York  
Yankees trumped Texas' offer and brought him to the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing the two-time defending Cy Young Award winner join the  
defending world champions was tough enough for AL teams to swallow. 
It was even tougher for Texas considering Clemens, a Houston-area 
native, had said he wanted to return to his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, Clemens hasn't done much toward winning the  
sixth Cy Young of his career. Although he's 2-0, his ERA is 4.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Clemens has pitched well enough to extend his string of  
consecutive victories to 17, tying the AL record set by Cleveland's 
Johnny Allen in 1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 
1968-69. Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants set the major league 
record of 24 in 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who hasn't lost since last May 29 to Seattle, tied the  
mark last Thursday against Texas at Yankee Stadium. He gave up four 
hits and three walks in 7 1-3 innings of a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	That win was New York's 13th in 16 games against Texas. The  
Yankees, who eliminated the Rangers from the postseason in 1996 and 
1998, have won five of their last six games at The Ballpark heading 
into the three-game series that begins tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a do-or-die situation, but I think it's important  
that we beat the Yankees,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``I 
think it's important to our ball club because, No. 1, we need to 
let the Yankees know we can beat them, and, No. 2, we need to let 
our club know we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing Clemens for the Rangers will be their most consistent  
starter thus far, Aaron Sele (3-1, 3.22). Sele lost his only 
regular-season start to New York in 1998 and also lost the third 
and final playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitching matchups are Orlando Hernandez vs. Mark  
Clark on Wednesday night and Ramiro Mendoza against Mike Morgan on 
Thursday. Andy Pettitte was to have started Thursday, but didn't 
bounce back well after throwing 108 pitches Saturday against 
Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Case Against Microsoft Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives from the nation's fifth-largest  
computer maker complain in newly disclosed testimony about 
restrictions they face from industry-giant Microsoft Corp., which 
the government contends limits choices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a surprising admission, one of those executives from  
Packard Bell NEC Inc. also complained that Microsoft refused to let 
Packard Bell impose its own limits on which Internet providers 
customers could easily use. 
</P>
<P>
	The frank exchange was included in 270 pages of transcripts  
released Monday, and came during a deposition last fall with 
lawyers preparing for the Microsoft antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is currently in a lengthy recess and is not expected  
to resume before the middle of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange twist to government claims that Microsoft restricts  
consumer choice, Mark Donahue told lawyers that Packard Bell NEC 
over the summer had asked to remove the software giant's list of 
Internet providers within Windows and substitute its own. Microsoft 
balked. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies, listed within a special ``Online Services''  
folder, allow consumers to open subscription accounts easily and 
begin using the Internet within minutes of turning on a new 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Karma Giulianelli, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Donahue  
how Microsoft's decision affected Packard Bell NEC's ability to 
make lucrative sales deals, called ``bounties,'' for itself with 
Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose it allows for multiple choices for the end user,  
whereas Packard Bell NEC would like to limit the choices to the end 
user for the purpose of signing up for an online service,'' said 
Donahue, a senior product manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that his company's request to Microsoft was motivated  
by ``financial reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giulianelli appeared so surprised by Donahue's candor that she  
said abruptly: ``I have no further questions right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three interviews with Packard Bell NEC officials,  
Donahue's was by far the most favorable toward Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior executive for the computer maker, Mal Ransom,  
complained that Microsoft can afford to impose tight restrictions 
because Windows is ``the only viable choice'' among computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, Jon Kies, told lawyers that previous requests  
for Microsoft to be more flexible, such as allowing tailored 
installations of Windows for some customers, are met with the 
question: ``What is the benefit to Microsoft?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cannot find or provide a solid benefit to Microsoft,  
then there's not much likelihood that the request is going to be 
granted,'' complained Kies, a senior product manager. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally wields its influence as the manufacturer of 
Windows, the software that runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It complains, for example, that Microsoft forces computer makers  
who buy Windows also to include its Web software, discouraging them 
from distributing rival Internet software, such as Netscape's 
popular browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransom, a senior vice president of marketing, said it makes no  
sense for computer makers to offer both Internet products because 
they're so similar: ``It's kind of like which brand of water do you 
want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts from those interviews were among the first to be  
released of more than 90 taken in preparation for the trial. The 
others, including those of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, were 
expected to be made public later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled this year that an obscure 1913 law  
allows the public to read the transcripts from those depositions, 
which come from some of the high-tech industry's most powerful 
players.

</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire has played 223 minutes in the fourth quarter and  
overtimes this season, while Anthony has played 335. In the last 24 
games, Anthony has a 220-99 edge in fourth-quarter minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said he knew before the season that the Blazers were  
capable of winning the division, but ``that would have been 
stepping out on the plank. It just wouldn't have been reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland cruised to the title after the Lakers and Seattle  
SuperSonics faltered badly. Now, Dunleavy said the Blazers are 
looking at advancing past the opening round of the playoffs for the 
first time in seven years, when Clyde Drexler led the Blazers into 
the finals against the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like if we can win our first-round series, that  
our confidence level will go way up,'' Dunleavy said. ``That's when 
I think we become really dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Idaho Nuclear Waste Heads to N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- A truckload of nuclear waste left at  
dawn today for the nation's first permanent dump, 11 years after 
Idaho stared down the Energy Department and closed its borders to 
radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers from about 100 elected officials went up in the  
semidarkness as the truck's horn sounded and began its 32-hour trip 
to the $2 billion Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in southeastern New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, there's a new day dawning in Idaho,'' Gov.  
Dirk Kempthorne declared. ``It's the day when we begin to see the 
nuclear waste leave this great state of ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kempthorne, a first-term Republican, was joined by ex-Govs.  
Cecil Andrus, a Democrat, and Phil Batt, a Republican. In 1988, 
Andrus unilaterally closed Idaho's borders to any additional waste 
shipments after the Energy Department failed to make good on 
promises to begin removing waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The border was reopened a few months later. In 1995, Batt  
negotiated a settlement requiring the first shipment to leave the 
state by the end of April 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department spokesman Brad Bugger said so far there is no  
schedule for additional shipments. But the settlement requires the 
agency to have all nuclear waste out by 2036. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until the New Mexico dump was finished, the United States had  
no permanent resting place for weapons-related plutonium waste. 
After 25 years of lawsuits, studies and protests, the dump carved 
out of the salt beds a half-mile deep beneath the desert finally 
began receiving shipments last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During the years of delay, the waste piled up at 23 weapons  
installations around the country such as Rocky Flats near Denver 
and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, 
where it is kept mostly in 55-gallon drums on aboveground concrete 
pads, underneath bubble structures or in earthen mounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Mexico dump will eventually house up to 6.2 million  
cubic feet of waste, from rags contaminated with radioactivity to 
the graphite molds used to cast plutonium pits.

<HEADLINE> Ford Enters Auto Recycling Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- While Ford Motor Co. works to take market  
share from rivals General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG, it 
is also aiming at a much less lofty, but perhaps equally 
challenging, goal: to become the global leader in recycled car and 
truck parts. 
</P>
<P>
	What Ford envisions is a global chain of auto parts recycling  
centers that generates $1 billion in revenue within a few years. 
The move could spur rapid consolidation of the largely family-owned 
auto junkyard business. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker expects the technology and economies  
of scale that it will bring to the business will lower the 
wholesale cost of used parts for the primary customers: insurers 
and repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives said Monday that they already have bought one  
auto recycling center in Tampa, Fla., and are in talks to acquire 
many others across North America in the coming weeks. The 
still-unnamed business will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to revolutionize the industry, to create a Fortune  
1000 company from scratch to become a global, environmentally 
focused powerhouse,'' said William Li, the 29-year-old chief 
operating officer of the new enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's move also is part of its campaign to be seen as the  
world's most environmentally sensitive automaker. Li said Ford 
wants to increase the amount of a junked car that is recycled to 95 
percent from the current average of 80 percent, thereby reducing 
the amount of scrap that goes into dumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The move fits into new president Jac Nasser's strategy to expand  
Ford's role into businesses that bring in revenue throughout a 
car's life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He zealously believes in the focus on the customer and the  
total life cycle of the car, and he's really supporting it with 
this kind of investment,'' said David Cole, an industry expert at 
the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also operates Visteon Automotive Systems, its parts-making  
unit; Ford Credit; and the global Hertz rental-car operation. 
Earlier this month it bought Europe's largest independent auto 
repair chain, Kwik-Fit, for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The move goes against the strategy of some other automakers,  
namely General Motors, to divest related businesses and focus on 
manufacturing. The history of U.S. automakers' investments in 
outside businesses is littered with failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The used parts business today consists of about 10,000 mostly  
small, family-run operations. They range from traditional auto 
junkyards -- where do-it-yourselfers and repair shops go to hunt for 
parts amid rows of rusting wrecks -- to clean, highly organized 
automotive recycling plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's investment will lean toward the latter. Part of the new  
business will be built through acquisitions. The first purchase, in 
March, was Copher Brothers Auto Parts in Tampa, Fla., a 
state-of-the-art recycling operation that serves central Florida. 
Ford plans to expand the operation and eventually use it to recycle 
parts from Ford plants as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said the used parts business, while fragmented, has become  
highly sophisticated with large regional operations and profit 
margins well above those in auto manufacturing. There's no shortage 
of business: about 11 million vehicles are scrapped annually in the 
United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting a player like Ford in, that's a big-time change,''  
Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to set up a nationwide, computerized parts inventory  
and shipping system that it expects will significantly reduce the 
time it takes a repair shop to get a used part. That will help 
dealers and Ford's primary customers: those who own Ford cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also said its recycling centers will have retail stores to  
serve the do-it-yourself mechanic, even though that's a dwindling 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary is likely to be the insurance industry,  
which will have a big, new customer for wrecked vehicles and a new 
source from which to buy replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said other big companies also are looking at getting into the  
business, which could lead to more rapid consolidation. He declined 
to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	William Steinkuller, executive vice president of the Automotive  
Recyclers Association, said an investment group in Chicago has been 
buying up auto recyclers over the past year, but that Ford's 
investment is the first of its kind by an automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford so far has declined to discuss its plans with his group,  
which has about 2,000 members in 19 countries, he said. 
``Obviously, consolidation in the auto recycling industry is a 
significant issue with us. We're anxious to talk to Ford about what 
their plans are.''

<HEADLINE>  Valhol Owner Sues Over Ark. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- The owner of Arkansas Derby winner Valhol has  
sued the Arkansas Racing Commission to get the winner's share of 
the $500,000 purse and some assurance that the horse can enter the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	James D. Jackson of Rockport, Texas, sued the commission Monday.  
A hearing was set for Tuesday before Pulaski County Circuit Judge 
John Plegge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson says ``irreparable harm'' might result to him if the  
court does not order the commission to distribute the $300,000 set 
aside for the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The petitioner will, in all probability, be denied a starting  
position for Valhol in the Kentucky Derby, the single most 
important and prestigious thoroughbred race in the world, thereby 
depriving Valhol of its once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to run in 
said race,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said in the lawsuit that the commission was required by  
state law to distribute the purse within 96 hours of the race, 
Sundays excluded. The Arkansas Derby was held Saturday, April 10, 
at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, the commission ordered the distribution be  
delayed while it addressed concerns that jockey Billy Patin may 
have carried an illegal electrical device. Oaklawn stewards have 
set a hearing for May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also said in his lawsuit that he should have been given  
notice of a decision to postpone the hearing from May 1 to May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson wants to enter Valhol in this Saturday's Kentucky Derby  
at Louisville, but Valhol likely will not qualify without the 
$300,000. Entry day is Wednesday, and Jackson wants the purse 
distributed before then. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs won't recognize Valhol as the Arkansas Derby  
winner until the money is officially awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs allows up to 20 horses to enter the Kentucky  
Derby. If more than 20 enter, it takes the top 20 earners in graded 
stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Byron Freeland, an attorney for the racing  
commission, said Monday he was preparing for Tuesday morning's 
hearing and was trying to get it moved to a later time the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Byrum Hurst of Hot Springs, a lawyer for Valhol trainer  
Dallas Keen, said last week that he also wanted the commission to 
release the money and probably would take action if it did not do 
so by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst said the horse, its owner and trainer should not be  
penalized for something the rider was suspected of doing. He said 
he planned to attend Tuesday's hearing.

<HEADLINE> Trumpet Player Al Hirt Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Al Hirt, whose power and technique made him  
``The King of the Trumpet'' in the 1960s when he won a Grammy for 
his hit ``Java,'' died Tuesday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of his family said he died at home, where he has been in  
failing health since leaving a hospital a week ago. Cause of death 
was given as liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt's virtuosity led him to 21 Grammy nominations in a career  
spanning more than 50 years. In 1964, he won a Grammy for best 
non-jazz instrumental for ``Java.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his peak in the 1960s, he played for John Kennedy's  
inauguration, starred at Carnegie Hall, and headlined numerous 
television variety shows, including his own ``Fanfare'' program on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he recorded more than 50 albums -- four gold and one  
platinum. ``Honey in the Horn'' reached No. 3 on Billboard's 
Popular Music Album Chart in 1963; ``Sugar Lips'' won Billboard's 
favorite instrumentalist of 1965. In 1962 he was named `best 
trumpeter' in the Playboy jazz poll, a prize he won for 15 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best trumpet players all around the world,''  
said clarinetist Pete Fountain, a longtime friend who also kept his 
home in the Crescent City. ``He had everything -- technique, 
stamina, education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt and Fountain started out together with day jobs as  
exterminators, killing rats and roaches by day and playing music at 
night. In those days, whoever landed the job would be called leader 
and wore a bow-tie on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	They played together off and on for more than 50 years, and in  
recent years their bands, along with the Preservation Hall Band, 
toured as a package in the summers. Hirt missed the trip in 1998 
because of bad health. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Alois Maxwell Hirt in New Orleans in 1922, he got his first  
trumpet when he was 6. Clasically trained at the Cincinnati 
Conservatory of Music, he spent three years in the U.S. Army as a 
company bugler, then began his professional career in 1946 as a 
member of Benny Goodman's Orchestra. He later worked with other big 
bands, including the Dorsey Brothers and Ray McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
	His first big break came in 1950, when he won second place in  
Horace Heidt's National Youth Opportuntiy Contest and was named 
solo trumpet in Heidt's band. 
</P>
<P>
	Real national fame came in 1960 when Hirt's Dixieland Six booked  
into a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. As much a showman as a musician, 
the 6-foot-2, 300-pounder's joyous music caught the attention of 
Dinah Shore and he became an instant success on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt didn't call it jazz, although he said he was influenced by  
Louis Armstrong, Harry James and Frank Sinatra. His driving power, 
packed with dazzling virtuosity, seemed to blow the curtains at the 
back of the auditorium, but when the tempo slowed the honey-toned 
melodies flowed with a style all his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a pop commercial musician, and I've got a successful  
format,'' Hirt once said. ``If you have the ability to perform your 
musical idea, you become a good jazz player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A real homebody, Hirt tried to arrange his career into short  
tours so he could stay put in New Orleans with his wife and eight 
kids, near good fishing grounds for sea trout. His base became his 
club on Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career he mostly toured and performed on  
television, with occasional local appearances at ``Jellyroll's'' in 
the French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered one of his most important performances the 1987  
solo of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope John Paul II during the 
pontiff's visit to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt's death coincided with the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage  
Festival, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary. Quint Davis, 
festival producer, said a special commemoration will be added on 
the closing Sunday in memory of Hirt and other musicians who died 
this year.

</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators said Tuesday they are  
focusing on three camouflaged teen-agers detained shortly after the 
Columbine High School massacre as possible co-conspirators who may 
have planned to join the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in combat fatigues. They said they heard it on the  
radio. Well, it wasn't on the radio at that time,'' Jefferson 
County Sheriff John P. Stone told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Stone laid out the timeline for the attack  
and also disclosed that a school surveillance camera captured the 
attack in the cafeteria. Stone's department is leading the 
investigation into the April 20 shootings in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone declined to name the teens, who have been questioned but  
not formally named as suspects. While the drama unfolded on 
national television, the three young men in dark jackets were 
stopped by deputies. They were frisked and taken off for 
interrogation. The men carried no weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the school, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
killed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men, who Stone said knew the gunmen and had  
previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' have 
maintained their innocence. Investigators tested them for gun 
residue after the shootings and found no evidence that they had 
fired guns. 
</P>
<P>
	All three teens claimed to have heard of the massacre on the  
radio -- and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had 
been released, Stone said. One of them had been expelled from 
Columbine High School, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three men who were  
questioned as Matthew Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just three punks with a lot of curiosity,''  
Christianson said in Monday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered a call Tuesday night to Akard's home, told  
the AP she had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	All three wore black jackets with combat-style boots when they  
were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the scaredest I've ever been,'' Christianson said. He  
said they didn't know Klebold and Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said the two gunmen initially tried to escape through  
three separate exits, and killed themselves only after being turned 
back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a diary seized at 
the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen planned to fly 
to Mexico or another country if they could escape, and kill 
themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a sheaf 
of papers investigators have characterized as a diary. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said a school surveillance camera captured ``the entire  
carnage'' in the cafeteria, where Klebold and Harris hurled 
homemade bombs and opened fire on terrified students. Authorities 
have sent the tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously have not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a celebratory peal to remind everybody that there is  
life after death,'' said Barry Bowman of St. John's Episcopal 
Cathedral in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were held. The 
Velasquez services drew 800 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, questioned Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and 
Harris. Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns 
were to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an employee of a local hardware store said he saw  
Harris purchase several barbecue containers of propane and bags of 
nails, screws and wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Four guns were found in the school. On Tuesday, authorities said  
they had discovered 50 bombs, ranging from small pipe bombs to at 
least one large incendiary device rigged with barbecue propane 
tank. If they had been detonated, investigators say they might have 
blown up the school, killing hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Robyn K. Anderson bought at least two of the  
weapons -- a rifle and a semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun -- at a 
Denver-area gun show in the fall. Miss Anderson has not been 
arrested, and authorities stopped short of describing her as a 
suspect. She has retained a lawyer and is said to be cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, it is illegal to give a minor a pistol, and illegal  
to give anyone a gun with the knowledge that it will be used in a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine teachers returned to work Tuesday -- not at the heavily  
damaged high school, but a few miles away at Chatfield High. 
Columbine students will return to classes on Monday -- also at 
Chatfield.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. has hired a government food safety

goods after the company's meat products were linked to several 
deaths late last year. 
</P>

	Ann Marie McNamara will become vice president of food safety and  
technology after formal appointment by the board of directors, the 
company said Tuesday. She is leaving a position as director of the 
microbiology division of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Office 
of Public Health and Science.

<P>
	Sara Lee issued a recall of about 15 million pounds of its meat  
products in December and temporarily closed its Bil Mar Foods 
processing plant in Zeeland, Mich. A listeriosis bacteria 
contamination of hot dogs and deli meats at the plant was linked to 
15 deaths, six miscarriages and scores of illnesses, according to 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sara Lee has defended its food safety techniques, the  
Chicago-based maker of Ball Park franks, Mr. Turkey meats and Coach 
leather goods said in a statement that it is undertaking several 
steps to strengthen its processing and testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include testing equipment and products for possible  
contamination and providing more controlled environments for 
producing and packaging meat. The company also is contributing $1 
million for food safety research at Georgetown University's Center 
for Food and Nutrition Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee executives warned last week that fiscal results would  
fall at least 3 cents a share below analysts' expectations because 
of the Bil Mar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it anticipated spending more on marketing  
products affected by the recall after the Bil Mar plant reopens 
later this year.

<HEADLINE> GAO: Assisted Living Care Varies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Assisted living homes, increasingly popular  
housing alternatives for the elderly, aren't always upfront with 
consumers about the level of care they provide, government auditors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providers do not always give consumers information sufficient  
to determine whether a particular assisted living facility can meet 
their needs, for how long and under what circumstances,'' said a 
report released Monday by the General Accounting Office, an 
investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate's Special  
Committee on Aging said he would notify the nation's governors of 
the GAO's findings and ask them to look into the adequacy of state 
oversight of the assisted living industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted living has become the hottest new housing option for  
older people by promising to provide a happy medium between their 
homes and a full nursing facility. By early next century, experts 
predict assisted living homes will care for more frail, elderly 
Americans than nursing homes do. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike nursing homes, which are subject to national standards,  
assisted living homes are overseen by the states, which have widely 
varying regulations. Fewer than half of states require assisted 
living homes to be licensed, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO auditors found that assisted living homes that meet  
regulations in four sample states -- California, Florida, Ohio and 
Oregon -- ranged from small residences providing little more than 
meals and housekeeping to large complexes that offer specialized 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the wide variation in what is labeled assisted living,  
consumer shopping for an appropriate facility must rely primarily 
on providers for information,'' the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when auditors examined sales materials, such as  
brochures, used by 60 assisted living homes in the four states, 
they found that about a third of the home's materials ``contain 
language that is unclear or potentially misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most common problem: inadequate disclosure of the  
circumstances under which a resident can be required to leave an 
assisted living home, such as if they become too sick or too 
dependent on others for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing materials for one Florida home -- cited but not  
identified in the GAO report -- said residents ``can be assured if 
health changes occur, we can meet your needs. And you won't have to 
deal with the hassles of moving again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same home's contract, however, lists criteria for discharge  
including ``changes in (the resident's) physical or mental 
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also reviewed state records on 753 homes in the four  
states and found that 27 percent were cited for consumer protection 
problems in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, assisted living industry and consumer groups joined  
in an effort to press states to put some minimum standards for the 
homes into law. The industry is also fighting to keep some 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of assisted living's greatest strengths is its ability to  
mold and shape itself to fit the needs of the individual 
consumer,'' said Robert Lohr of the National Center for Assisted 
Living.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas State Senator Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The man considered the most powerful  
member of the Arkansas Senate was indicted Tuesday on charges that 
he netted $1.3 million through fraudulent contracts and kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal racketeering indictment named state Sen. Nick Wilson  
and nine other people on charges of mail fraud, obstruction of 
justice and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Paula Casey said the scheme involved the  
``corruption of the Arkansas General Assembly with Wilson as the 
leader and primary decision-maker and planner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Wilson benefited from a $3 million  
grant program he helped set up in 1997. The grants pay for legal 
work performed on behalf of children caught in the middle of 
custody cases and for attempts to enforce payment of child support 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that Wilson submitted bills under that  
program for work he never performed, and directed attorneys to pay 
him kickbacks for work they performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was halted soon after it began, when news reports  
raised questions about its propriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walmsley, an attorney for Wilson, said he expected the  
senator to plead innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time that you have a citizen Legislature such as Arkansas  
has, where those legislators basically make their living with work 
outside of their legislative duties, there always are fine lines,'' 
Walmsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a Democrat, is considered one of the state Senate's most  
powerful members because of his 28 years in office and his skills 
as a power broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were state Sen. Michael R. Bearden and former  
senators Steve Bell and Michael Todd. Todd and Bell worked on the 
grant program legislation with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Others named in the indictment were lawyers Murrey L. Grider --  
Wilson's former law partner -- and his son M. Joseph Grider. Two 
others named, Tommy Venters and Burton Elliott, are former 
directors of the state Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the others did not return calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits False Anthrax Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An accountant who delayed his bankruptcy  
hearing by calling in an anthrax threat to a courthouse was 
convicted Tuesday of making a threat to use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Craig Spelkin, 53, faces as much as life in prison at his  
July 26 sentencing. He remains free on $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelkin admitted making the December phone call, saying  
``There's a possibility there may be anthrax in the air 
conditioning system,'' federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Woodland Hills courthouse was evacuated and 90 people were  
quarantined in the parking lot for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Phil Israels denied that Spelkin made an actual  
threat. ``It was more like he was providing 'information,''' 
Israels said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 113.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed Tuesday, as the Dow Jones  
industrials moved to record highs amid a return to manufacturing 
and basic materials stocks, but the Nasdaq composite sank on 
profit-taking in some technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 113.12 to 10,831.71, breaking 10,800 for the  
first time and topping its previous record, set last Thursday, of 
10,727.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 2.76 to 1,362.80, enough  
to beat Monday's record close and reach its second consecutive new 
high. But the Nasdaq composite index, which climbed to a new high 
on Monday, lost 49.64 to 2,602.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said DuPont's earnings, released early Tuesday, helped  
encourage investors to replay last week's move into the 
economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks on the belief that the 
world economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``DuPont's earnings and some positive comments from them helped  
the whole cyclical case here,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chief 
investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors believe in the bull story and they're looking for  
growth at a reasonable price, and for the time being, they can find 
it in cyclical issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, meanwhile, were subjected to ``a little  
light, uninformed profit-taking,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market 
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``There is no fundamental 
news in that area, it's just that the prices got to such a raucous 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., said the  
Nasdaq was slowing down after hitting a new closing high Monday and 
ahead of some key earnings releases. He said investors were 
``waiting on bated breath'' for earnings from Internet companies 
America Online and Amazon.com., due out later Tuesday and 
Wednesday, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL shares skidded 9 points to 153 on the Big Board, despite a  
growing consensus that the company's earnings, scheduled for 
release after the close of trading Tuesday, would beat expectations 
of 9 cents. The online service provider did surpass analysts' 
forecasts, reporting third-quarter earnings of 11 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Amazon.com, meanwhile, fell 1 5/16 to 205 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was boosted early in the day by earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, a Dow component, reported earnings from continuing  
operations of 66 cents a share, down from 68 cents a year earlier 
but soundly beating analysts' expected 60 cents. DuPont rose 2 3/8 to 
69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's strong results encouraged investors to buy other  
industrial shares, including other Dow stocks -- Alcoa was up 2 1/8 to 
55 3/8, Caterpillar gained 1 9/16 to 63 9/16, Union Carbide rose 1 3/8 to 
49 5/8, and United Technologies was up 4 11/16 to 143 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's first-quarter profit came to 61 cents per share, beating  
analysts' expected 57 cents, as revenues from cellular and 
corporate services offset a downturn in long-distance business. 
AT&AMP;T rose as high as 55 5/8, up 2 3/4, in morning trading, but was up 
only 1/16 at 53 at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney skidded 2 1/2 to 32 1/2. The entertainment company's  
second-quarter profit results released Tuesday met expectations of 
13 cents a share, but Disney called the results disappointing and 
said it will assess where it can cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood on Wall Street was helped by a report from the  
Conference Board that its index of consumer confidence rose for the 
sixth straight month in April, to 134.9 from a revised 134 in 
March. The index is a key indicator of future economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	An index designed to measure consumer expectations for the next  
six to nine months had an even bigger increase, indicating the 
current economic boom is not likely to end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow 7-to-6 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 
1.09 billion shares, up from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.44 to 643.27, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.47 to 774.07. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.19 to 435.16. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo edged 0.23  
higher. Stock markets in London and Paris both climbed to record 
highs in response to Monday's runup on Wall Street. The FT-SE 100 
index in London climbed 1.38 percent, while the CAC in Paris 
advanced 2.49 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX index rose 1.74 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Fundraiser Heads to Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The corridors of Olympic finance will no longer  
reverberate to the dulcet tones of JK. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise move, John Krimsky resigned Monday as the top  
marketing and fundraising official of the U.S. Olympic Committee to 
return to private business. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky, at the center of Olympic efforts to bounce back from  
the scandal of Salt Lake City, was replaced by Dave Ogrean, the 
executive director of USA Hockey and touted as a potential USOC 
executive director in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The change officially occurs June 4, although a transition  
period began immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky, whose baritone voice was known wherever Olympic  
athletes, officials and sponsors gathered, insisted that the 
scandal and its chilling effect on fundraising had no impact on his 
decision. He will join Relationship Management Programs Inc., 
management arm of United Airlines' senior frequent-flier program, 
as president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beyond the scandal,'' he said. ``This doesn't mean there  
are problems with the USOC. It says we're open for business. We 
have a strong property. Clearly it has been burned by the scandal, 
but it has come out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky, who helped raise $2 billion for U.S. Olympic programs,  
noted that his contract was due to expire next year and that the 
new offer would have been gone by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``My leaving is at the right time and Dave Ogrean can come in  
and take it for the long term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean, who helped negotiate the agreement with the NHL that  
brought the sport's top stars to the Winter Olympics for the first 
time last year, said the scandal created marketing problems, but 
none that were insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a relief pitcher coming in with a couple of men on  
base,'' Ogrean said. ``But the apparatus in place gives me a great 
deal of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's departure continues a major shakeup at the highest  
ranks of the worldwide Olympic community, which has become a 
billion-dollar business in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have been expelled or resigned in the wake of  
the scandal, the largest purge in the committee's 105 years. 
Romney's appointment as SLOC CEO followed the ouster of the two top 
officials of the city's Olympic committee, Tom Welch and Dave 
Johnson, and the resignation of Welch's successor as president, 
Frank Joklik. 
</P>
<P>
	More changes are expected once a reform commission, IOC 2000,  
recommends new membership and structure rules late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogrean has built a growing reputation in the USOC, including  
heading the campaign that elected Bill Hybl president in 1996, but 
he must emerge from a dominating shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of an MGM studio producer and a former vice president of  
Pan American World Airways, Krimsky built a reputation for shrewd 
dealing, such as getting the USOC as much from IOC sponsorships as 
the rest of the world combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tough,'' said Dick Pound, an IOC vice president and  
marketing chief who repeatedly faced Krimsky across the bargaining 
table. ``He often negotiates on a basis that suggests he's not as 
flexible as he really is. But his aim is clearly to make a deal. To 
not bring home a deal is a failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the Olympics would miss Krimsky's knowledge of  
marketing -- and his personality, one that has won him the nickname 
of ``The Tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's gruff,'' Pound said. ``The dulcet tones of JK will be  
absent. Personally, he's entertaining.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Can't Agree on Currency Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund failed Tuesday  
to find agreement on how to prevent or at least better manage 
future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance ministers and central bankers from the seven major  
industrial countries couldn't even agree on measures for ending the 
recession being experienced by a third of the world because of 
steep currency devaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 182-nation IMF's policy-setting interim committee  
issued a 10-page final communique at the conclusion of its spring 
meeting pledging to continue efforts to resolve competing proposals 
put forward by the United States and other industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It hailed as its one major achievement the creation of new  
contingent credit lines that could provide billions of dollars for 
warding off financial panic to countries pursuing sound economic 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But agreements could not be reached on involving the private  
sector in sharing the cost of future bailouts or policing the 
borrowing practices of emerging countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,  
favored a more market-oriented, case-by-case approach for private 
sector involvement. Britain and other nations preferred specific 
rules defining the obligations of investors if their bets on 
emerging markets went bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues left on the table included ways to better manage  
wild swings in currency values both in developing countries and 
industrial nations. Japan and Germany pushed for more coordinated 
efforts among countries to manage currency levels; the United 
States objected. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in areas where there was widespread agreement, such as the  
need to provide greater debt relief for the poorest countries, the 
IMF could not resolve how much of its gold reserves should be sold 
to help finance the process, or how much money wealthy nations 
would be willing to contribute to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Amgott, Washington representative for Oxfam, a humanitarian  
relief organization, expressed disappointment that more progress 
was not made on the debt issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have shown repeatedly that they are good at producing  
rhetoric on debt relief. It is an open question whether we will get 
the resources and if there is the political will,'' Amgott said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told reporters  
at a news conference late Tuesday night that the debt relief issue, 
which has been debated since 1996, would be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief was also expected to be taken up when President  
Clinton and other leaders of the world's seven largest economies 
hold their annual economic summit in mid-June in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the current economic problems, Japan and Europe  
rejected U.S. suggestions that they needed to do more to stimulate 
growth, prompting a blunt response from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech Tuesday to the IMF directors, Rubin noted that  
America's trade deficit has soared to record levels, resulting in 
the loss of more than 300,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, as a result 
of the nearly two years of global turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus was increasing and Europe's trade balance  
was remaining essentially unchanged during this time, he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has borne the bulk of the burden of the  
global current-account adjustment in response to the Asian 
crisis,'' Rubin said. ``This situation cannot continue 
indefinitely. Japan and Europe must boost domestic demand-led 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's unusually frank message reflected U.S. frustration at  
failing to win greater commitments by Japan and Europe to spur 
their domestic economies to take pressure off America's huge trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank presidents  
had pledged after talks Monday to strive for greater cooperation to 
promote global growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But their comments Tuesday underscored that there was no  
agreement on just what that vague promise meant. Both Japanese and 
European officials rejected U.S. suggestions they need to do more 
to promote growth. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that the new European Central Bank, which handles  
monetary affairs for the 11 countries switching to the new common 
euro currency, recently cut interest rates by a half percentage 
point, and Japan has reduced its rates to virtually zero while also 
implementing a massive government spending program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has been forcefully implementing'' the stimulus package,  
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel expressed worries about the  
U.S. economy and the impact on the high-flying American stock 
market and dollar if growth slows too abruptly later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interests of the United States and the world economy,  
it will be important to avoid an excessively sharp adjustment with 
setbacks in the financial and foreign exchange markets,'' Eichel 
said.

<HEADLINE> Briton Pays $100M for Ride on Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A British businessman has agreed to pay $100  
million for a week-long ride on Russia's Mir space station, giving 
the aging outpost a new lease on life, Russian officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for the nation's top space authority expressed  
doubts, saying the deal may collapse like many previous attempts to 
raise private funds to keep the Mir aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Llewelyn, 51, signed an agreement for the August flight  
with the state-controlled RKK Energia company, which runs the Mir, 
said Energia's spokesman Sergei Gromov. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agreement had been signed over the weekend and the  
money would be transferred to Energia soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gromov said Llewelyn lives in the United States, is married and  
has two children, but would not give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Llewelyn will fly to the Mir in a Soyuz rocket accompanied by  
two Russian cosmonauts. After a week in space, he will return to 
Earth with the Mir's current crew, Gromov said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal works, it would be a big relief for Russian space  
officials and cosmonauts, who are eager to extend the lifetime of 
the Mir -- the last symbol of the nation's fading space glory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has said it would only pay for the Mir  
through the end of August. It would then abandon the station unless 
private investors come up with new money. Space officials have 
repeatedly claimed that they had found unidentified investors, but 
the deals have crumbled each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Llewelyn's contribution would cover about half of the Mir's  
annual maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sergei Gorbunov, a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency,  
threw cold water on Energia's enthusiasm, pointing at previously 
announced deals that have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us will be very happy if they find an enthusiast eager  
to finance the Mir, but I think it's too early yet to celebrate,'' 
he said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir, launched in February 1986, has operated far longer than  
any other space station. It endured a long series of breakdowns and 
accidents in 1997 but has been running relatively trouble-free 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. space agency NASA has long pushed Russia to abandon the  
Mir and commit its scarce resources to a new international space 
station, which is more than a year behind schedule because of 
Energia's failure to build a key segment. Energia has blamed delays 
in government funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians' reluctance to abandon Mir also stems from their  
feeling that without a space station of their own, they will be 
left playing a secondary role to Americans in the new project. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two components of the new station were launched last  
November and December. 
</P>

	Energia on Monday announced the completion of the station's next

<HEADLINE>  Judge: Let Autistic Girl Play Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An 18-year-old autistic girl who ``dreams  
of earning an athletic letter'' must be allowed to play softball 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Garr M. King means that  
Anna Inskip can take the field today for the Astoria High School 
junior varsity game against St. Helens High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the judge's ruling is only a preliminary injunction,  
school officials said they might accept the judge's order 
permanently. ``I think we have enough guidance from the court to 
move ahead,'' school Superintendent Larry McMacken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Inskip, a junior, tried out for the junior varsity team  
this spring. She was not cut and officials let her practice, but 
they would not allow her to play in scrimmages or games for fear 
that her autism might cause her to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	She has participated in basketball, swimming and horseback  
riding in the Special Olympics. Her mother, Mary Young, said in a 
compliant filed April 16 that her daughter ``dreams of earning an 
athletic letter.''

<HEADLINE> Landing Gear Blamed in F-16 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- A landing gear malfunction caused the  
latest crash of an F-16 military jet at Luke Air Force Base, the 
nation's largest training ground for F-16 fighter pilots, officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash on Monday was the sixth at Luke in six months,  
prompting officials there to order inspections of about 100 planes 
equipped with similar landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspections ordered Tuesday will be the second mass  
inspection ordered at Luke as a result of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first found hairline cracks in the engines of at least 17 of  
the 190 F-16s at Luke equipped with Pratt &AMP; Whitney 220 engines. 
Four of five crashes have been linked to engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's crash, instructor pilot Maj. Kevin Grove, 36, and  
Capt. Stephan Kleinheyer, 31, a German pilot training at Luke, had 
reported a problem with the jet's landing gear after a routine 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	With the plane was running low on fuel and unable to land  
safely, the instructor decided to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a gutsy decision,'' said Brig. General John Barry,  
Luke's commanding officer. ``That's why we have two walking, 
talking pilots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $20 million jet crashed in the White Tank Mountain range, a  
remote area northwest of Luke.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Report Cloning Goats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts researchers say they have cloned  
three goats that are genetically altered to produce a protein in 
their milk that might be used to treat heart attack and stroke 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The cloning could mean faster and less expensive production of  
the protein, Antithrombin III, which has the potential to treat 
heart attacks and strokes and prevent blood clots. It is now being 
tested on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The cloned goats were born last fall on a farm in Charlton, the  
Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and Genzyme 
Transgenics Corp. of Framingham said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results could revolutionize the biopharmaceutical  
industry,'' said Eric Overstrom, a developmental biologist at the 
Tufts veterinary school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a method that is a faster, reliable and more  
cost-effective way to produce complex pharmaceuticals for humans 
and animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, methods of producing human proteins for drugs include  
growing them in yeast and taking them from pooled human blood -- 
expensive, risky and low-yield methods, Overstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is reported in the May 1 issue of Nature Biotechnology.  
</P>
<P>
	Transgenics is the process of implanting genes from one species  
into the DNA of another. It is used to put human genes into animals 
so they will develop human diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also came up with a way to use fewer eggs to  
produce a cloned animal. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 140 eggs to produce the first cloned goat, using an  
older method. But the two other cloned goats, twins, were created 
with only 92 eggs by using ``activated'' eggs that were tricked 
into thinking they had been fertilized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Layering the cloning on top of the transgenics (gene-altering)  
work is important in getting the therapeutic proteins to the 
patients in the most efficient manner possible,'' said Sandra 
Nusinoff Lehrman, president and chief executive officer of Genzyme. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cloning allows you, once you've got the cell line, to much  
more efficiently develop your herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She believes there is a $200 million-a-year market for  
Antithrombin III in Europe, where it is used more than in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The cloning produces female goats, and goats have a gestation  
period of only five months and produce plenty of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The first cloned animal was a sheep born in Scotland in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hurt Texaco's Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texaco Inc., joining other oil companies whose  
results have been hurt by depressed prices for crude, reported its 
first-quarter earnings fell nearly 60 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-biggest oil said Tuesday it had earnings from  
continuing operations of $105 million, or 18 cents a share, 
compared with $259 million, or 46 cents a share, in the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the steep earnings decline, Texaco beat the expectations  
of Wall Street analysts who predicted it would earn 17 cents per 
share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's net income for the quarter was $199 million, or 35  
cents a share, compared with $234 million, or 42 cents a share, a 
year ago. The 1999 results include a gain of $94 million for 
inventory adjustment and production tax refunds. Last year's 
results include a gain of $25 million for an accounting adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 11 percent to $7.19 billion from $8.15 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's stock rose $2.12 1/2 to $60.62 1/2 a share in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Major oil companies have watched a slump in oil prices eat away  
at their earnings. Lower demand around the world due to poor 
economic conditions has forced oil companies to lower the prices 
they charge their customers, reducing their revenues and profits 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said it sold oil in the United States at an average price  
of $9.11 a barrel, down 23 percent from a year ago. Natural gas 
prices fell by 16 percent to $1.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's results were also hurt by some operational problems in  
the North Sea, which reduced production capabilities by about 
30,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's exploration and producing division had $18 million  
in 1999 first-quarter earnings compared with a $156 million a year 
earlier. Its marketing and refining division earning rose to $283 
million from $229 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco chairman and chief executive Peter Bijur said he expects  
the results to improve in the coming months due to the recent rise 
in oil prices and a resumption of normal production in the North 
Sea during April.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Executes Man Who Killed Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A 61-year-old man who killed his estranged  
wife was executed by injection early Wednesday, the oldest Missouri 
inmate put to death since capital punishment was reinstated in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Davis was convicted of killing his wife, Susan, in part on  
the strength of DNA evidence. The body of the 35-year-old woman was 
never found. 
</P>
<P>
	His last words, in a written statement, were to his son and  
daughter-in-law: ``My body is gone but my spirit is with you. I'm 
just going to sleep. Love you. Dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis disappeared in 1986 after leaving her job at  
Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Columbia. Three weeks earlier, she 
had filed assault charges against her husband. She claimed he was 
abusive and had once held a gun to her head. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day she vanished, prosecutors said, Davis bought a  
.12-gauge shotgun from a sporting goods store. Davis told police he 
didn't know what had become of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators lacked solid evidence until 1988, when they found  
the woman's car in Davis' storage locker near Jefferson City. 
Shotgun pellets had blasted through the driver's side window. Bone 
fragments, blood and human tissue were found inside. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical examiner determined there was so much blood it could  
only have resulted from a fatal wound. DNA evidence showed that 
Mrs. Davis was the victim.

<HEADLINE> eBay To Acquire Auction House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online auctioneer eBay Inc. announced an  
agreement to acquire Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield Auctioneers Corp., a 
privately held auction house, for $260 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret C. Whitman, chief executive of eBay, said Monday the  
move will help the company expand from small items to items priced 
from $500 to $5,000. eBay offers many items for under $20 such as 
Beanie Babies and sports memorabilia. Butterfield auctions European 
paintings and Asian art and handles estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
	eBay officials also said they would benefit from Butterfield  
experts' ability to appraise and authenticate valuable items. 
Currently, eBay relies mostly on sellers' descriptions of items, 
but users have expressed concerns about the potential for fraud as 
they bid on higher-priced items. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield President John Gallo told The Wall Street Journal  
that his experts would enable ``users to safely trade unique, 
high-end items.'' Butterfield experts will review photographs or 
inspect items brought to their offices to provide authentification. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield, based in San Francisco, had been set to go public  
this week at $14 to $16 a share. eBay has offered to pay nearly $50 
a share. Butterfield said it canceled the offering as a result of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., reported yesterday that it  
earned $5.9 million, or 5 cents a share, in the first quarter. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call had estimated eBay would earn 2 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, eBay earned $148,000 or less than 1 cent  
per share.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Up Reservists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon announced Tuesday it will call  
33,102 reservists to active military duty, bringing the Kosovo 
conflict close to communities from coast to coast. The call-up will 
begin immediately with 2,116 members of the Air Force Reserve and 
Air National Guard to assist in aerial refueling of NATO warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reservists to get the call are from units based in  
Alabama, Arizona, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They will serve on active duty for as 
long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more reservists will be pulled from their civilian  
jobs in the weeks ahead as NATO expands its air campaign, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said in announcing that his mobilization 
would affect reservists in all branches of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonvoluntary call-up is the first since NATO began its air  
campaign to win autonomy for Kosovo on March 24 and the largest 
since 240,000 served in the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War. About 
1,000 reservists have been serving as volunteers for NATO, but 
Cohen's call-up means they will be relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must go beyond the limits of volunteerism,'' Air Force Maj.  
Gen. Michael Kudlacz told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon did not have a precise breakdown of the 33,102  
reservists to be called, by service. But it said about 25,000 will 
be Air Force, 6,100 Army, and 1,000 each from the Marine Corps and 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman publicly reminded employers  
that reservists' civilian jobs are protected by law, and Sen. John 
Kerry, D-Mass., said he would introduce legislation that would 
offer financial assistance to reservists who are small business 
owners and are included in the call-up for Kosovo duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Air Force Maj. Gen. Susan Pamerleau  
said the Air Force has been authorized to prevent active duty 
members in certain job specialties from leaving the service during 
the Kosovo conflict. She said it had not been determined yet how 
many departures would be stopped or in which jobs, but it is the 
first time this ``stop loss'' authority has been used since the 
Gulf War, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  
Talbott concluded talks in Moscow with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian mediator for the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of the United States, he laid out very clearly the  
objectives NATO has set forth in its communiques and the importance 
we attach to achieving those objectives,'' State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly objects to NATO's bombing campaign and to the  
idea of a NATO-led peacekeeping force being sent to Kosovo in the 
event of a settlement to ensure safe return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians did not indicate any major changes in their  
position,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks at a Pentagon news conference, Cohen indicated little  
interest in the idea of putting a peacekeeping force under the 
command of the United Nations -- a formulation that might be 
acceptable to Yugoslavia but at any rate is on hold as long as NATO 
keeps up its bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be an international peacekeeping force that is  
NATO-led and, at the core, NATO must be involved in its 
management,'' Cohen said. He seemed to leave room for maneuver, 
however, by adding later that ``we believe it should be led by 
NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart used a similar  
approach, saying the force ``would be one with NATO at its core.'' 
Yugoslavia has insisted that it not include any NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were encouraged that representatives of  
the International Committee of the Red Cross had a second, more 
substantive visit with the three U.S. soldiers being held as 
prisoners of war in Belgrade. The three were examined by a doctor 
but the results were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite discouragement from the White House, a delegation of  
U.S. religious leaders led by Jesse Jackson said it will travel to 
Yugoslavia Wednesday to meet with three captive Americans and try 
to secure their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation plans to give Bibles to the soldiers, deliver  
letters and tapes from their families and take back messages from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans, meanwhile, readied legislation  
that would provide around $13 billion in emergency funds to pay for 
the Balkans conflict and other defense needs. That is double 
President Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the reserve call-up will enable NATO to accelerate  
the pace of its airstrikes by keeping planes in the air longer and 
to expand the attacks by fueling a larger fleet of strike aircraft. 
U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, has asked the 
Pentagon to dispatch 300 more planes -- one-third of which are to be 
refueling planes. The first 30 extra refuelers are among the planes 
to be flown by the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve members 
that Cohen called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Pentagon briefing on the latest round of NATO airstrikes,  
Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said bad weather had again 
hampered operations but strikes were carried out against a range of 
targets in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia. He showed gun camera 
footage of U.S. bombs hitting a radio relay tower near Belgrade, a 
Yugoslav army barracks in northern Kosovo and paramilitary forces 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own briefing at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,  
Clark assessed the air campaign as it enters its fifth week. He 
acknowledged that President Slobodan Milosevic has proven he is 
willing to let his military and economic systems absorb tremendous 
punishment but insisted NATO is winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The noose around Yugoslavia, as it continues its inhumane  
policies in Kosovo, is tightening,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, officials of the International Monetary Fund and  
the World Bank were holding an emergency meeting to speed financial 
assistance to Balkan countries whose economies have been disrupted 
by NATO's air war and the flood of more than 700,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters that his  
organization would offer $40 million in financial assistance for 
Macedonia and $30 million for Albania with immediate support also 
expected from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Big on Citizen Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has little enthusiasm for  
unauthorized diplomacy by American citizens such as the mission to 
Belgrade planned by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Unless, of course, it 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration would rejoice if Jackson and his  
delegation of religious leaders could win the release of three 
captive American soldiers being held in the Yugoslav capital. 
Meanwhile, it doesn't want its fingerprints anywhere near the risky 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous administrations have voiced the same ambivalence toward  
citizen diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are not in a position, nor will we be in a position  
any time in the foreseeable future, to guarantee the safety of a 
private citizen,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jackson hoped to head for the region today. ``We think it  
is in everyone's interest ... to stop the violence in Kosovo,'' the 
civil rights leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and State Department were taken by surprise last  
week when a lone Republican congressman, James Saxton of New 
Jersey, suddenly turned up in Belgrade, even as NATO bombs rained 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Saxton spent three days in the city, part of it attempting to  
win the release of the three captured servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his invitation to visit Yugoslavia came through contacts  
he has made as chairman of a House task force on international 
terrorism. ``The Yugoslav government essentially invited me to come 
for the purpose of understanding their side of the story,'' Saxton 
said. He rejected advice by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, the administration was able to discourage a  
trip to Belgrade by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Steny Hoyer, 
D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration refused a solid opportunity,'' Weldon  
complained, saying they planned to make the trip with several 
Russian legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians do want to move to a negotiated settlement,''  
Weldon said on Tuesday. Weldon maintains close contact with members 
of the Russian Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, freelance diplomacy is illegal.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the so-called Logan Act of 1799, U.S. citizens are  
prohibited from ``directly or indirectly'' undertaking diplomatic 
negotiations with foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	George Logan, a legislator from Pennsylvania, had gone to France  
the year before to try to improve relations. That got him in big 
trouble back home. 
</P>
<P>
	But the law seldom has been enforced.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration often invites citizens to go to  
trouble spots to help nudge along diplomacy, such as sending 1996 
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole to the region earlier 
this year to persuade ethnic Albanians to agree to a proposed peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	That's different from unauthorized trips.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings  
Institution and professor at Columbia University, said sometimes 
private missions can succeed. He cited former President Carter's 
trip several years ago paving the way for an agreement by North 
Korea to cut back its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
	Freelance missions to Belgrade ``don't make a lot of sense right  
now,'' particularly since escalating hostilities could quickly 
result in more prisoners of war, O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, when Ronald Reagan was president, Jackson went to Syria  
and won the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr., whose jet 
bomber was shot down during a raid over Syrian anti-aircraft 
positions in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later, he worked out arrangements with Cuba for  
the release of 48 American and Cuban political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he helped win the release from Iraq of more than 700  
foreign women and children who had been detained for use as human 
shields against an American military attack after Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson recalled he also encountered resistance from the White  
House before those missions. But, he said, ``At some point we had 
to exercise our rights of conscience as private citizens and take 
some reasonable risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the president's National Security  
Council, said the administration did not tell Jackson or other 
citizens determined to go to Yugoslavia to stay out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But going to Belgrade is a dangerous undertaking,'' he said.  
``It's not a particularly safe environment right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the White House official said, ``If private citizens do  
go, we stress that it is our hope that in any meetings with Serb 
officials they might make clear NATO's conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Minister Blesses Same-Sex Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- A United Methodist minister dismissed  
from one church for blessing the union of two women has officiated 
over another same-sex ceremony and risks being defrocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jimmy Creech of Raleigh officiated Saturday at a union  
ceremony for two men, Jim Raymer and Larry Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a tough decision at all,'' Creech said Monday. ``I  
was honored that they asked me and very glad to do it. I realize 
that the church right now is in a very legalistic and moralistic 
frame of mind. It has taken a position that I think has 
institutionalized bigotry. It was not difficult at all for me to 
take a stand against that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creech was narrowly acquitted in a United Methodist Church trial  
last year after officiating at a ceremony for two women at the 
First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Neb. He was later dismissed 
from the local church. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech is on a voluntary leave of absence from the United  
Methodist Church but remains under the church's authority, 
particularly Nebraska Bishop Joel Martinez. Creech has said he told 
Martinez last month of his plans to perform the latest ceremony and 
the bishop warned him against it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Creech's trial, the denomination's ban on  
performing same-sex commitment ceremonies was only a guideline. 
Since then, however, the ban has been made into church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers can be tried and kicked out of the clergy if they  
officiate at a homosexual union. 
</P>
<P>
	Although last weekend's service took place in North Carolina,  
any complaint will be handled by the Nebraska Conference, said 
North Carolina Bishop Marion Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that there's been a definite confirmation that Jimmy  
Creech has conducted another ceremony, the Nebraska Conference will 
proceed according to the Book of Discipline with a judicial 
complaint,'' Martinez said Tuesday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A church official said any United Methodist member may file a  
complaint with the Nebraska conference accusing Creech of violating 
church law. Martinez would likely assign the complaint to an 
investigating committee to determine if formal charges and a trial 
were warranted, said Tim Tanton, a spokesman for the United 
Methodist Church in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech said last week that he was undaunted by the threat of  
being kicked out of the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's important to give my blessing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another United Methodist pastor was suspended  
indefinitely by the denomination's Northern Illinois Conference 
after he was found guilty of breaking church law for blessing the 
union of two men. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9.5 million-member United Methodist Church is the nation's  
second-largest Protestant denomination after the Southern Baptists.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed, 4 Hurt in Ohio Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT STERLING, Ohio (AP) -- A car packed with seven teen-agers  
skipping school crashed into a pickup truck, killing three and 
critically injuring a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 Honda Accord traveling at speeds of more than 100 mph  
went airborne and hit the truck about 20 miles southwest of 
Columbus on Monday, Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the teen-agers was wearing seat belts, he said. They had  
decided to skip school for a picnic and to fish at nearby Deer 
Creek Lake, Stanforth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Yin, 17, and Mongkol Choeun, 16, and Teresa Heang, 13, were  
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition today.  
The driver, 18, and a 17-year-old passenger were in serious 
condition, while a 15-year-old girl was treated and released. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Advised To Try E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Newspapers must help local retailers sell goods  
over the Internet in order to preserve their communities, a 
newspaper technology director told publishers at the Newspaper 
Association of American annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid growth of large, nationally recognized Internet sites  
such as Yahoo! and America Online could devastate local economies 
if people buy from national retailers online instead of from local 
stores, warned Bob Cauthorn, technology director at Starnet and The 
Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a lawnmower coming for the garden,'' said Cauthorn,  
who joined two electronic retailers and an e-commerce consultant 
speaking at convention on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! and AOL are portals, starting points on the Internet that  
lead users to a variety of services such as news, shopping, 
community information and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic retailers now receive half of their customers from  
AOL, said Lauren Freedman, president of The E-tailing Group, a 
Chicago-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Starnet has launched ``e-shop Tucson,'' a site for local  
merchants, and has turned away national retail advertising from the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The business promises customers home delivery of locally sold  
goods within an hour, Cauthorn said. Newspapers have a moral 
imperative to preserve local economies, and will fold if they 
don't, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	But newspapers also can find new ad revenue in national  
e-commerce, the retailers said. OfficeDepot is using newspaper and 
outdoor advertising to build its brand as an online retailer, said 
Keith Butler, executive director of marketing at OfficeDepot.com in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's online sales totaled about $68 million in 1998,  
and grew to more than $50 million in just the first quarter of 
1999, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the other panelists agreed that newspaper advertisements  
effectively direct readers to Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Seiff, CEO of Bluefly.com, a new online fashion retailer,  
said e-commerce companies look to purchase advertising that drives 
consumers to their site and also helps to build brand names. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggested newspapers invest in online businesses by  
trading blocks of advertising space for equity in successful online 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections on the growth of Internet retailing vary wildly, but  
Freedman said some studies show e-commerce will grow from about $8 
billion a year now to $20 billion in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Belle Markets Own Cereal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Get ready for Albert Belle Slugger Cereal.  
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles hitter's brand of cereal -- an 18-ounce box  
of corn flakes -- is headed to area supermarkets in the first week 
of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's cereal is coming out less than a month after Orioles  
great Cal Ripken Jr.'s face began showing up on boxes of Cal's 
Classic Os. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle promoter Grant Dinner, president of Global Sports &AMP;  
Promotion, insisted that Belle and Ripken aren't competing. He said 
Belle's cereal already was being taste-tested when Famous Fixins 
introduced the Ripken cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert knows Cal is the hometown guy,'' Dinner said. ``Anyone  
who would try to compete with Cal would have his hands full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for Belle's cereal came from the success of Buffalo  
Bills quarterback Doug Flutie's Flutie Flakes, the promoter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Ripken's breakfast food, Belle's cereal will be found  
exclusively on the shelves of supermarkets in the 
Baltimore-Washington region. It's possible some boxes will also be 
shipped to Shreveport, La., Belle's home when not in Baltimore. The 
corn flakes are made by Grist Mill of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	A dollar from the sale of each package of Belle's cereal will go  
to the Shirley Howard Children's Cancer Foundation, headquartered 
in Baltimore, officials with the charity said.

<HEADLINE> Women-Owned Businesses Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To get ahead in the fuel procurement market,  
entrepreneur Kristen Schaffner-Irvin computerized her clients' 
tanks so she could check inventory from her laptop. Her rivals were 
still using wooden dipsticks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the kind of creative edge that is driving women-owned  
businesses toward spectacular growth these days. Not only are they 
burgeoning in number, but their sales and work forces are booming. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest sign of their economic weight, the collective  
revenues of Working Woman's Top 500 women-owned businesses grew 12 
percent to $80.7 billion in 1998. The second annual list, released 
to The Associated Press on Tuesday, will be published in the 
magazine's June issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're thriving,'' said Sharon Hadary, executive director of  
the National Foundation for Women Business Owners. ``These 
businesses are becoming more significant players in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of women-owned businesses leaped nearly 90 percent in  
the decade ending in 1997, according to the Foundation. Today, they 
number 8.5 million -- more than a third of all U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses are still small when compared to the country's  
largest companies. General Motors, for example, had $161.3 billion 
in revenues in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the growing clout of women-owned businesses is increasingly  
evident. Between 1987 and 1997, their total sales grew 161 percent 
and their work forces grew 262 percent, according to the 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, women are displaying the talents that put them on  
the cutting edge of business world, with technological savvy first 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this: 23 percent of women-owned firms have Web sites,  
compared with 16 percent of firms owned by men. Nearly half of 
women business owners have Internet access, compared with 41 
percent of men. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Mrs. Irvin became one of the first fuel  
procurers to equip customer fuel tanks with computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Huntington Beach, Calif., company, Team Petroleum, now  
monitors fuel consumption, pricing and even leaks by computer, then 
arranges with suppliers to refuel customers. The company ranks No. 
315 on the Working Woman list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure all the male-dominated petroleum companies will  
figure it out eventually, but by then we'll be on to the next 
thing,'' she laughed, adding that women ``think out of the box a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of her customers says that seeing such expertise in a woman  
still surprises many men. Larry Kuyper, who handles purchasing for 
Disney operations, said that when Mrs. Irvin ``starts talking about 
passive and impassive tank monitors, these guys figure out pretty 
quickly she knows more than they ever know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antoinette Allocca's Stamford, Conn.-based technical writing and  
consulting firm grew rapidly after she creatively solved a key 
problem at her firm: she couldn't afford to hire top salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
	After she began hiring older people who had been downsized,  
offering them low salaries and high commissions, revenues grew from 
$1 million in 1996 to $20 million last year at her company, 
Essential Data. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give people a chance who are overlooked,'' said Ms. Allocca,  
whose company is No. 461 on the Working Woman list. ``I've 
attracted a work force that's very experienced but still very 
motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working Woman ranks the companies on its list by revenue.  
Companies qualify if women are the largest individual shareholders, 
holding at least 5 percent of stock in a public company and 10 
percent in private firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Many, including Ms. Allocca and Mrs. Irvin, were inspired to go  
into business for themselves because they sought greater 
flexibility in their lives. Others hit glass ceilings in Corporate 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chance for her to dream her dreams, fulfill them and  
keep control of her destiny,'' said Judy George, chief executive 
officer and founder of Domain, a Norwood, Mass., furniture company 
that ranked No. 220 on the Working Woman list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know, I was president of a company. I was making a fortune.  
... But I had my own dreams,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Considers Gambling Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton administration effort to protect  
compulsive gamblers from the lure of some casinos and games of 
chance ran into rigorous Supreme Court questioning today. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices wondered aloud about the legitimacy of a  
government ban on television and radio ads promoting privately 
owned casinos while such advertising is allowed for casinos owned 
by Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why doesn't Indian casino advertising have the same effect as  
private casino gambling with respect to the compulsive gambler?'' 
Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Justice Department lawyer Barbara 
Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the ban might deter only  
casual gamblers. ``The true drunk is going to find the bottle,'' 
she said, equating tribe-owned casinos with that bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising ban is being challenged by broadcasters as a  
violation of free-speech rights. The ban is in effect in only some 
parts of the nation because some federal appeals courts have ruled 
it unconstitutional while others have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' decision is expected by late June.  
</P>
<P>
	``The federal scheme is so riddled with exceptions that it  
cannot advance the government's asserted interests'' in protecting 
compulsive gamblers, argued Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer 
representing New Orleans-area broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Underwood, the government's lawyer, emphasized ``the  
devastating social costs that are inflicted'' on an estimated 3 
million compulsive gamblers, and said Congress is free to address 
the largest part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	She said privately owned casinos account for 40 percent of the  
revenues from all types of gambling nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing federal law bans broadcast advertising for ``any  
lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But over the 
past 20 years, Congress has amended the anti-broadcast law to allow 
ads for casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any 
gambling sponsored by nonprofit promoters for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia sponsor and  
aggressively advertise lotteries, and more than two-thirds of the 
states are home to Indian-owned casinos. Non-Indian casinos are 
legal in 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.  
Kennedy and David H. Souter also asked questions that seemed 
skeptical of the government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speech is different,'' Souter told Underwood at one point.  
</P>
<P>
	But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin  
Scalia appeared far more sympathetic to the government's defense of 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters are supported in friend-of-the-court briefs  
submitted by, among others, the American Advertising Federation, 
American Civil Liberties Union, Newspaper Association of America 
and American Gaming Association. No friend-of-the-court briefs 
support the government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Supreme Court rulings appear to cut against such an  
advertising ban. The court last year barred states from banning 
advertising that refers to liquor prices in efforts to promote 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association vs.  
U.S., 98-387.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Addresses AP Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says security  
has been improved at U.S. nuclear facilities and should prevent any 
more classified information about nuclear weapons from reaching the 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was  
the featured luncheon speaker at The Associated Press' annual 
meeting Monday. The AP meeting and luncheon were the opening events 
of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper Association of 
America's convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson acknowledged that security had been lax at U.S.  
nuclear facilities over the past few years, despite a presidential 
directive to tighten it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secrets were compromised,'' said Richardson, who became energy  
secretary last August. ``They were compromised and accelerated 
China's nuclear development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that kind of information theft ``will not happen  
again.'' Scientists who work on sensitive weapons now undergo 
polygraph tests; the counter-intelligence budget has tripled over 
the past few years, and background checks are required on 
scientists from sensitive countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Richardson said, he ordered a shutdown of DOE  
computers linked to nuclear weapons information so that their 
security could be measured and upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	He said calls in Congress, as a result of the Chinese spying  
issue, for a moratorium on scientists visiting from other countries 
``are politically popular and may get votes in the Congress, but 
they hurt our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to deal with China is not to isolate,'' he said. ``The  
way to deal with China is to debate with them, to include them in 
the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Russia's declining economy -- more than 120 million  
Russians currently live in poverty -- threatens the United States 
because Russia has the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the world 
and up to 20,000 nuclear scientists face unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The least thing we want is a terrorist or some sort of  
degrading of a Russian nuclear city,'' he said. ``All it takes is a 
softball of plutonium -- a theft of that softball on the black 
market -- to cause America and the West grave national security 
threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States is involved in cooperative agreements  
with Russia, totaling $1 billion over several years, to safeguard 
nuclear facilities and make sure scientists are paid or working. 
Otherwise, they may be tempted by offers from Korea or Iraq to 
defect with their secrets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When taking questions from the audience, Richardson was asked  
whether he would consider a bid for vice president on Al Gore's 
ticket, but he refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to duck that question,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Returns to No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The sci-fi thriller ``The Matrix,'' still  
cruising while movie theaters await the summer's blockbuster 
releases, returned for a third time to top the North American box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Most films in theaters now represent the lull before the release  
of the ``Star Wars'' prequel, the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, the 
Will Smith action movie ``Wild, Wild West,'' and Stanley Kubrick's 
last movie ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $66 million in weekend ticket sales by the Top 10 movies was  
down 28 percent from a week earlier but about even with this time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' returned to No. 1 with a $12.6 million take and  
the Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison comedy ``Life'' fell to 
second place with $11.3 million in receipts, a 45 percent drop from 
its previous weekend debut, according to industry figures released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed'' was  
a bright spot in the box office lineup, placing third with $6 
million. It has earned $31 million in three weeks.

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio simply causes a riot  
wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	His bodyguards were questioned by Taiwanese police after  
photographers angling for a picture Monday in Taipei's airport 
complained that they shoved and insulted them, Taiwanese television 
and newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed after the bodyguards, reported to number  
three or five, admitted inappropriate behavior and apologized to 
reporters, according to the mass circulation China Times, the 
entertainment paper Min Sheng Daily and the TVBS entertainment 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures showed DiCaprio smiling behind sunglasses, a pulled  
down baseball cap and plastic shopping bag partially hiding his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Titanic'' star stayed in the China Airlines VIP departure  
lounge for two hours Monday until his flight left, the reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanned, slim DiCaprio was on his way to Los Angeles from  
Bangkok after completing shooting of ``The Beach'' on Thailand's 
Phi Phi Island in the Andaman Sea last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Security assigned to other visiting celebrities, including  
singer Michael Jackson, have also had run-ins with Taiwan's

<HEADLINE> Scoonie Penn To Stay at Ohio State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Scoonie Penn wasn't sure where he would go  
in the NBA draft, so he decided to stay at Ohio State for three 
sure things: a good team, good times and a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically feel like if I was to make the decision to go out,  
I think I could make it'' in the NBA, Penn said Tuesday, announcing 
he'd be back with the Buckeyes for his senior season. ``I'm 
confident enough that, yes, I can play. But I don't have to worry 
about that. My main focus is working hard in the offseason and 
worrying about this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the Big Ten's co-player of the year, had been considering  
his options since Ohio State's surprising trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-team All-American said he kept his eyes and his mind  
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you want to focus on is your dream, your goal, of becoming  
a professional athlete,'' he said. ``It was hard to see anything 
else because that's all I wanted. I still want it. But I realize 
there's other things in life besides becoming a professional 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he didn't know how high he might have gone in the  
draft because it was difficult to factor in the underclassmen who 
almost daily add their names to the list of seniors available. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State head coach Jim O'Brien was vacationing in Florida,  
but associate head coach Rick Boyages said there was a glut of 
quality point guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's somewhere in the pack,'' Boyages said. ``The obvious  
names that come to mind besides Scoonie are Andre Miller at Utah, 
Steve Francis at Maryland, Jason Terry at Arizona, William Avery at 
Duke. ... There are probably eight or 10 point guards and Scoonie's 
right in there in the top five or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The squat, 5-foot-10 shooting guard from Salem, Mass., became a  
crowd favorite of Ohio State's fans, who had been beaten down by 
five consecutive losing seasons. Before last season even began, 
Penn brashly predicted the Buckeyes would make it to the NCAA 
tournament -- despite going 8-22 overall and 1-15 in the Big Ten 
while Penn sat out a transfer year from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Penn averaging 16.9 points, 4.3 assists, 2 steals and 4  
rebounds a game, Ohio State posted one of the biggest turnarounds 
in NCAA history. The Buckeyes finished 27-9, were second in the Big 
Ten at 12-4 and were the surprise team of the NCAA tournament 
before losing to eventual champion Connecticut 64-58 in the 
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Songs about Penn were played on local radio stations, and kids  
chanted his name and begged for autographs after games. His uniform 
No. 12 became so popular that someone stole it out of the team's 
dressing room shortly before the start of the UConn game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to a situation like that, I know a lot of players  
say this might be the best time to leave, while your name's out 
there and you're on top,'' Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ohio State returns much of last year's team, in addition to  
several top prospects including 7-foot-3 junior-college standout 
Aleksandar Radojevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he wasn't worried about a disappointing season.  
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, I do feel it was a Cinderella season. We had a  
terrific run and personally I had a great year,'' he said. ``But I 
feel with the type of team we have coming back and the same 
coaching staff, I feel we can only get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to another run at the NCAA tournament -- Penn has  
never missed in two years at BC and one season at Ohio State -- he 
also said he was on schedule to graduate in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important things to my family would be to see  
me walk across that stage and receive my degree,'' he said. 
``That's all I need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, who would become the first member of his family to  
graduate from college, said he told O'Brien of his decision last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he said to me was, 'Are you sure this is what you  
want?' I said, 'Yes, it's my decision. I've been thinking about it 
and this is exactly what I want,''' Penn said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Discussion on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders today  
called for a national conference on youth and culture in response 
to last week's high school shootings in Colorado, at the same time 
the White House is proposing new gun-control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This conference should examine important issues facing  
students and society, including video games, drugs in school, 
Hollywood, prayer in schools, parental involvement and local 
control of schools,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in 
a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Hastert nor Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
offered further details in a joint appearance called to highlight 
passage of education legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to ask ourselves are we doing enough, can we do  
more?'' to address problems like those that led to last week's 
shootings, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation on its way to President Clinton is designed to  
loosen strings on federal education aid to the states. Hastert said 
it would give local school officials greater latitude in dealing 
with disciplinary problems in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's office pointed out that the just-passed bill also  
funds programs promoting community mentors, peer mediation and 
crisis counseling and strengthens the ability of schools to 
discipline and expel students who bring guns to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve students and one teacher were gunned down by two students  
last week at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The killings 
ended when the two armed students killed themselves, and appear to 
be reigniting a debate about gun control that has been relatively 
dormant in Congress for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a White House ceremony today to propose legislation  
that would require background checks on sales of explosives and 
hold parents liable when their children commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is counting on outrage over the shootings to help push  
the bill through Congress. ``The prospects are good,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, 
oftentimes it takes tragic events to catalyze work here in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seem eager to try to focus the debate on other  
issues, including violence prevalent in television and the movies, 
as well as material widely available on the Internet, according to 
GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens provided a preview of the Republican  
response on Saturday, when he said, ``Events like this one warn us 
there is a virus loose within our culture. Too many of our young 
people are susceptible to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the formal GOP response to Clinton's weekly radio address,  
Owens urged parents to play more active roles in their children's 
lives, particularly to pay more attention to what their children 
may be watching on television, what video games they play, what 
World Wide Web sites they log onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know if your child has a home page?'' Owens asked. ``Do  
you know what is on your child's home page, or whom they talk with 
on the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, please find out.''

<HEADLINE>  IAAF Strips Medal From Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney is approaching the bell lap in  
full stride. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest U.S. distance runner in track history, stripped of  
her silver medal from the 1997 world championships, is going ahead 
with a lawsuit against the sport's world governing body despite 
Monday's ruling by an arbitration panel that she failed a drug test 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they are protected over there, safe in their little  
cocoon,'' Slaney said, referring to the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation headquarters in Monte Carlo. ``They can take 
away whatever rights the athletes had. This has to be addressed, 
fought and changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer said he doubts the suit ever will go to trial because  
the IAAF would prefer a settlement rather than make public what he 
called a ``sham'' test for female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take the veil from over how they've been  
operating their doping program. We're going to find out what 
athletes they've investigated, which athletes they've let off and 
why, to show the whole thing is a sham,'' attorney Jim Coleman 
said. ``It's fraudulent, and we're going to prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and also names the U.S.  
Olympic Committee, which administered the test Slaney failed during 
the 1996 Olympic Trials. It was filed in U.S. District Court in 
Indianapolis, the home of USA Track &AMP; Field, the sport's national 
governing body, although USATF was not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
(testosterone-epitestosterone) test was attributable to 
pathological or physiological conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, claimed the indication of a high level of  
testosterone was due to birth control pills she was taking. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF executive director Craig Masback called the IAAF decision  
``a tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, she's one of the great athletes in the sport and a  
pioneer,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``T-E testing for women is not supported by scientific evidence  
... never mind for her particular test. I think it's unfortunate 
that the IAAF decided to pursue this case after we exonerated her. 
They should come up with a legal test, not pursue someone who is 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio normally is about 1-to-1, but a routine urine test  
showed Slaney had more than a 6-1 ratio, which the IAAF regarded as 
proof of doping. Testosterone is a natural hormone that increases 
muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was suspended from competition in 1997, then later  
reinstated by USATF. The IAAF, however, referred the case to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that this was where this was headed,'' Coleman  
said of the panel's ruling. ``They weren't interested in whether 
the test was valid. They were simply trying to find a way to get 
out of this mess they got themselves into. They decided the way to 
get out of it is to simply dump on Mary and try to save their 
tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Slaney, the runner's husband, added, ``According to the  
IAAF, you're guilty until you prove your innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters,  
is free to compete since the IAAF said she had retroactively 
completed her two-year ban in June 1998. But she loses the medal 
she won in 1997 at Paris in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them come and try to get the $20,000 (in prize money) that  
she won in Paris,'' Coleman said. ``They don't say they're going to 
ask for it back, but the order suggested they might. ... They'll 
never see the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney now joins other prominent names in track found guilty by  
the IAAF: Ben Johnson, Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe. Another 
high-profile case is pending. U.S. sprinter Dennis Mitchell is 
going to arbitration after testing positive for high testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said IAAF now will likely challenge the Indianapolis  
court's jurisdiction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we establish the court has jurisdiction, then basically  
they're going to be left out there exposed, and I think they will 
try to find a way to bring it to an end,'' Coleman said. ``And I 
think that one thing that will happen is that they will not use 
this test against women in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, they will have wasted all this time, when what  
they should have been doing is trying to find a way to prove when a 
female athlete has used testosterone,'' he said. ``Rather than 
doing that, they've been trying to find a way to save a test that 
doesn't work. And now ... it's probably going to call into question 
anything they come up with.''

<HEADLINE> Nafzger Back in Derby After 9 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The nine years he's been away from the  
Kentucky Derby seem like nothing to trainer Carl Nafzger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got back quicker than I got here the first time,'' said the  
57-year-old Louisville resident, who trains Florida Derby winner 
Vicar. ``It took 20 years the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time was in 1990 when Nafzger won with Unbridled and  
was seen on national television standing next to 92-year-old 
Frances Genter, the colt's owner, shouting, ``He's gonna win. He's 
a winner. He's a winner, Mrs. Genter. You've won the Kentucky 
Derby, Mrs. Genter. I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Nafzger said, ``I've had some horses that started  
out on the (Derby) trail, but they weren't good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, a $260,000 purchase by James Tafel at the 1997 Keeneland  
July Select yearling sale, ranks as one of the top contenders in 
what looks to be a full 20-horse field for the 125th Kentucky Derby 
on Saturday. Entries will be taken and post positions drawn 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger sent Vicar through his final workout Tuesday -- an  
excellent 59 4-5 seconds for five-eighths of a mile on a sloppy 
track at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, who won two of three starts as a 2-year-old, opened his  
3-year-old campaign with a fifth-place finish in the 1 1-16-mile 
Holy Bull on Jan. 16 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He then won the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 20 and the Florida  
Derby on March 13 at Gulfstream Park before coming in third in the 
Blue Grass Stakes on April 11 at Keeneland. He finished 1 3/4 lengths 
behind winner Menifee and a half length behind Cat Thief. Menifee 
and Cat Thief are in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got the (No. 1) post position we were dead,'' Nafzger  
said. ``The key to that day was not to be inside. We didn't get 
banged around, but you are scared about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered about Nafzger working Vicar three times in eight  
days before the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horses tell you when they want to work,'' Nafzger said Monday.  
``I don't work horses on a set schedule.'' He also said he was 
worried about the black colt being too fresh for the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first workout after the Blue Grass, Vicar, who will be  
ridden by Shane Sellers, worked five-eighths of a mile last 
Wednesday in 1:01 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger feels Vicar proved his quality beyond question in the  
Florida Derby, and suspects that race might provide a clue for the 
1 1/4-mile Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got to go with the Florida Derby horses,'' he  
said. ``That horse that was sixth in the Florida Derby (Adonis) won 
the Wood Memorial. The horse that was fourth (Certain) was second 
in the Arkansas Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief finished third in the Florida Derby. Runner-up  
Wondertross developed a breathing problem while finishing sixth in 
the Blue Grass. Then he got colic and is out of training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also think Prime Timber will step up,'' Nafzger said. Prime  
Timber finished second behind General Challenge in the Santa Anita 
Derby. Both colts are trained by Bob Baffert, winner of the last 
two Derbies with Silver Charm (1997) and Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge worked five-eighths of mile Tuesday in 1:00,  
while Prime Timber, working in company with another horse, was 
timed in 1:00 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Other leading contenders include Stephen Got Even, winner of the  
Gallery Furniture.com stakes and a Nick Zito-trained stablemate of 
Adonis, and the D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief and Charismatic, 
winner of the Lexington at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis worked five-eighths in 1:02 2-5.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every year there are eight to 10 legitimate horses,'' Nafzger  
said. ``The rest are well-wishers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Derby winner Valhol scored a victory in court Tuesday  
when an Arkansas judge awarded owner James Jackson the $300,000 
first-prize money from the April 10 race. The decision means Valhol 
now has enough money to enter the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's share had been put on hold while stewards  
investigate whether jockey Billy Patin used an electrical device to 
make Valhol run faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the gelding not been credited with the money, he could have  
been kept out of the Derby field if the 20-horse rule is invoked. 
The Derby is limited to 20 starters based on money earned in graded 
stakes.

<HEADLINE> Park Place To Buy Caesars' Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- One of the most famous names in the  
hotel-casino industry is changing ownership, ending months of high 
stakes negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place Entertainment Corp. announced Tuesday it plans to  
purchase Caesars resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Lake Tahoe 
from Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide, Inc. for $3 billion in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the cream asset in gaming,'' Arthur Goldberg,  
president and chief executive officer of Park Place, said in a 
telephone news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale does not include the Desert Inn hotel-casino here, part  
of the Caesars World Inc. empire that has been on the market for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ends a 10-figure financial tug-of-war between two  
gambling titans -- Park Place and Mirage Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Park Place shares soared nearly 25 percent, while  
Starwood and Mirage lost ground on New York Stock Exchange. Park 
Place rose $2.25 to close at $11.37 1/2 a share, Starwood was off 68 3/4 
cents at $34.31 1/4 and Mirage was down 25 cents at $23.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase has been approved by the boards of both companies  
and is expected to be completed by year's end. It would give Park 
Place interests in 29 gambling properties with 28,000 rooms 
worldwide, 12,000 of them in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to owning one out of every 10 hotel rooms in Las  
Vegas, the purchase would give Park Place ownership of three of the 
four major hotels on the busiest intersection of the Las Vegas 
Strip -- the Flamingo Hilton, Bally's Las Vegas and Caesars. Park 
Place also plans to open French-themed Paris-Las Vegas, a 
2,900-room hotel next to Bally's in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase also would give Park Place prime land for future  
development on the Las Vegas Strip and the Atlantic City Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place owns two Atlantic City hotel casinos.  
</P>
<P>
	Its New Jersey flagship is the 1,263-room Bally's Park Place  
Casino Hotel, located at the famous intersection of Boardwalk and 
Park Place. Bally's Park Place is consistently the city's most 
profitable casino property. The Atlantic City Hilton has 805 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, which added a 620-room hotel  
tower last year, has 1,114 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said the sale provides ``significant benefits for both  
companies.'' He said Park Place obtains ``an internationally 
recognized brand name and a portfolio of premier gaming assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, Goldberg said, ``provides strategic assets, it should  
be accretive to earnings in the first year, and it has potential 
for future growth opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood Chairman Barry Sternlicht has made no secret of the  
fact he was uncomfortable with the volatility of the gambling 
industry. He orchestrated Starwood's purchase of ITT Corporation in 
February 1998. ITT's assets included the Caesars properties, one of 
the premier names in the gambling industry. Hilton lost out to 
Starwood in that bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said there is a possibility that Las Vegas-based Park  
Place might change its name, or the name of some of its other 
properties, to take advantage of the Caesars marque. 
</P>
<P>
	``By acquiring the Caesars' brand name and related customer  
database, we plan to heavily cross-market between our destination 
resorts,'' said Goldberg. ``This will boost revenues and expand the 
markets where we operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Caesars source who requested anonymity said Goldberg had  
indicated Park Place would provide an infusion of cash for projects 
including expansion of the Forum Shops at Caesars, an elegant 
shopping complex, and renovation of the front of the flagship 
Caesars Palace. There were also indications Park Place might 
proceed with a 700-room tower that was part of ITT's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The opulent Caesars Palace opened in August 1966, adding a new  
level of luxury on the fledgling Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternlicht had been negotiating the sale of the Caesars  
properties for months, concerned about the volatility of the 
high-stakes gambling for which the resorts are famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Dexter Wood, hospitality and leisure consultant for  
PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York, said the sale would allow 
Sternlicht to pay down debt taken on in the ITT purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also allow Starwood to focus on its hotel business,  
which includes the Sheraton, Westin and St. Regis/Luxury Collection 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said the recent entry of Mirage into the Caesars selloff  
played a role in pushing the Park Place deal to completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mirage helped bring it to a close a little quicker,'' Wood  
said. ``Mirage came in and there was more of a threat of a bidding 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirage may have quickened the pace and pushed the price a little  
higher, Wood said.

<HEADLINE> Carl Eller Says Sex Was Consensual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings star defensive end  
Carl Eller said he had consensual sex with the woman who later told 
police he had assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was someone I knew for about a year,'' Eller was quoted as  
saying in today's Star Tribune. ``I thought it was an amicable 
situation. It had been in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman called police about 2 a.m. Wednesday and said she had  
been sexually assaulted by Eller in his North Mankato motel room. 
Eller had been in the area talking to groups about substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller is on paid administrative leave from his job with the  
state Department of Human Services pending the outcome of the 
investigation, said deputy commissioner Tom Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an attack on my reputation,'' said Eller. ``It is  
harmful and hurtful, and it's painful for my kids and my family. I 
spent a long time building my reputation, and that's what's 
important to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eller was a key figure of the Vikings' ``Purple People Eaters,''  
the front four that helped Minnesota to four Super Bowl appearances 
in the 1970s. Eller made six Pro Bowl appearances and was among 15 
finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year, though he 
did not get in. 
</P>
<P>
	North Mankato Police Captain Wayne Hoffman said Eller has not  
yet talked to police about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said he hopes to have his report to the county attorney  
by next week. If any charges are filed, they could be third-degree 
criminal sexual conduct alleging coerced penetration, but without 
the use of a weapon, he said.

<HEADLINE> Disney, Ex-Boss Argue Over Royalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Walt Disney Co. lawyer accused former  
studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg Tuesday of trying to bilk the 
company of royalties he does not deserve for everything from 
Internet use of characters to gift shop sales at Club Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	In the damage phase of Katzenberg's $250 million  
breach-of-contract lawsuit, Disney general counsel Louis Meisinger 
said Disney believed Katzenberg's 1988 contract and a 1997 
liability settlement in the case clearly spelled out Katzenberg's 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers Tuesday led Katzenberg through questions about his  
contract discussions beginning when he was asked to join Disney by 
CEO Michael Eisner and the late Frank Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg said they offered him a success-based deal that  
included a percentage of the profits from products for which he 
would be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer included a post-term deal, under which Disney would  
estimate the value of Katzenberg's products, project how much they 
would make ``forever,'' and pay him a 2 percent bonus in a lump sum 
two years after he left Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus was supposed to consist of several payments and  
finally the lump sum, which Katzenberg said was ``99 percent of the 
value'' of the clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg joined Disney in 1984. In 1988, he signed a  
re-negotiated contract, extending it to 1996. The new contract 
included an early-out option that would allow him to leave in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner claimed Katzenberg agreed to forfeit his incentive bonus  
if he left in 1994 or if Disney let him go. Katzenberg denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg left in 1994, when Eisner reportedly refused to make  
him the company's No. 2 man after Wells was killed in a helicopter 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Katzenberg, studio income rose from $2.3 million in 1984  
to $856.1 million in 1994, when he left the company. 
</P>
<P>
	His breach-of-contract suit was partially settled in 1997, but  
Breckenridge is now determining whether Disney committed fraud in 
its contract dealings with Katzenberg, and how much compensation, 
if any, he should receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg said he felt the incentive bonus was so important  
that he refused to give it up in his 1988 contract renewal 
negotiations even though he was offered a half million shares of 
Disney stock and other lucrative benefits in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the annuity for my children,'' Katzenberg said.  
``That was the most valuable part of that deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg demands that calculations of his bonus include sales  
of characters from the 700 movies, including ``Beauty and the 
Beast'' and ``The Lion King,'' TV shows and other projects produced 
during his 10 years at Disney -- even if Disney made no profit on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney already agreed to pay for licensed merchandise, but  
Katzenberg wants money from unlicensed Disney-produced items, as 
well as music royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants a piece of a licensed fee every time a song from an  
eligible product is heard ... frankly, your honor, it's 
over-reaching,'' Meisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg said he believed he was entitled to royalties from  
merchandise that other Disney divisions sold that were based on 
characters from films or shows Disney made while he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Meisinger scoffed at Katzenberg's demand for bonus money for  
merchandising sales at Club Disney and Disney Quest in Florida, 
which Katzenberg described as ``educational centers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are theme parks to which Katzenberg has no claim, Meisinger  
said.

<HEADLINE> Existing Home Sales Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing single-family homes rose to  
a record high in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Realtors said today that Americans  
purchased existing homes at an annual rate of 5.05 million units in 
March, 0.6 percent higher than February's 5.02 million rate and 
breaking the previous record of 5.04 million set in January. The 
figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
	The record sales pace at the outset of 1999 follows an  
unprecedented year of 4.78 million existing home sales in 1998. 
March was the fourth consecutive month that the sales rate topped 5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability  
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping 
the market incredibly strong,'' said Sharon A. Millett, president 
of the real estate group. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment near a 29-year low, rising incomes, low mortgage  
rates, and solid stock market gains are driving the brisk home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Millett said agents are seeing more nontraditional home buyers,  
such as single people. 
</P>
<P>
	The home-buying boom and American consumers' related purchases --  
of new furniture and appliances, for example -- have helped keep the 
U.S. economy growing during a time of economic hardship in most 
other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally, March sales of existing homes were strongest in the  
West, rising 2.8 percent to a rate of 1.1 million units. In the 
Midwest, sales rose 0.9 percent to 1.19 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing-home sales were unchanged in the South for March,  
holding at a rate of 2.05 million units. In the Northeast sales 
were weakest, falling 2.7 percent in March, to a rate of 710,000 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median price of an existing single-family home,  
meaning half sold for more and half for less, was $132,7000 in 
March, up 4.4 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Law Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week to the day after the Colorado school  
shooting, President Clinton proposed gun-control legislation today 
to raise the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21 and 
hold negligent parents liable when their children commit crimes 
with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of explosives would also be subject to the same Brady law  
background checks as gun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is criminal how easy it is for children in America to  
obtain guns,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said at a White House 
ceremony, where she led her husband and an assembly of lawmakers in 
a moment of silence for the community of Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said his proposals would amount to no more than  
minor delays and minor hassles for sportsmen and legal gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a hassle for them. It's worth it. It's worth  
it. We're sorry -- it's worth it,'' Clinton said. ``People's lives 
are at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In extensive remarks preceding the president, Mrs. Clinton said  
she doubted the administration's ability to ``create a perfect set 
of solutions that, if followed, would have prevented what happened 
at Columbine High School.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``That does not mean that we are either hopeless  
or helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's omnibus crime package, which the White House  
trumpeted as ``the most comprehensive gun legislation any 
administration has put forward in 30 years,'' also proposes banning 
juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles, halting 
imports of all high-capacity ammunition clips and limiting an 
individual's handgun purchases to one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton renewed measures that died in the last  
Congress. He suggested he was counting on outrage over the Colorado 
shooting to push them through this year over objections of the gun 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the culture of violence that has to change. It's  
the culture of hunting and sport shooting that has to stop 
financing efforts to frighten their members,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a  
supporter who scoffed at critics saying school violence is a 
cultural problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about schools ... this is about this distorted  
interpretation of the Constitution that convinces otherwise 
rational citizens that it is their inalienable right to be armed to 
the teeth,'' Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives provision, which aims to treat the sale of  
explosives the same way gun sales are treated under the Brady law, 
would cover dynamite, blasting caps and the like, not materials 
that can be blended into an explosive mixture. In Littleton, Colo., 
the student killers used homemade hand grenades and pipe bombs in 
their rampage through Columbine High School. In Oklahoma City, two 
tons of explosive made from common fertilizer were used to blow up 
the federal building in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--Extension of an existing ban on juvenile possession of handguns  
to include semiautomatic assault rifles; also a ban on importation 
of all ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, an 
extension of current law banning imports of those made since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with an  
additional two days if law officers need them to complete their 
investigation. Until last year, the Brady Act provided five days 
for police to conduct background checks on buyers if they needed 
that much time. Now, it limits them to three days, but most checks 
are instantaneous. Never before has there been a minimum, mandatory 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory prison sentences of three to 10 years and $10,000  
fines for adults, including parents, who allow children access to 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to 
occur,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He added that the 
legislation's standard of reckless conduct would be ``a difficult 
standard to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this provision long before the Littleton  
shootings and it is not meant to suggest that those killers' 
parents should be blamed, Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, who represents South  
Dakota, where guns are popular among ranchers and sportsmen, was 
skeptical about passing any new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that gun legislation is what we need,'' Daschle  
told reporters Monday. He suggested the school shootings were a 
societal problem stemming from parental and teacher neglect and 
violence in the media and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things we better be looking at,''  
Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of  
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.''

<HEADLINE> More Arrests Predicted in N.M. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A lawyer for a woman who  
along with her father is accused of taking part in the rape and 
torture of women said Tuesday he expects more arrests in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Jean ``Jesse'' Ray was arrested Monday at her father's  
mobile home and charged with kidnapping, criminal sexual 
penetration and assault. An innocent plea was entered on her behalf 
Tuesday and she was being held on $1 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have filed an identical dozen charges against her  
father, David Parker Ray, bringing the number of charges against 
him to 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ray, 31, and her father, are accused of abducting a woman  
who told police she was sexually assaulted with objects for at 
least three days in June 1996. The woman was the third to accuse 
Ray of sexual torture. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Ms. Ray, Billy Blackburn, said his client  
``vehemently, adamantly denies'' she teamed up with her father to 
kidnap and sexually assault the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others have been charged in the case, but more are coming,  
Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public defender's office is well aware of the fact that  
numerous individuals are going to be arrested on matters down in 
Truth or Consequences so they have contacted attorneys in 
preparation for that,'' Blackburn said. ``I was called a couple of 
weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said the sex-torture case against Ray, 59,  
his daughter, and his girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, are 
connected to the accusations against Dennis Roy Yancy but they have 
not said how the cases are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	Yancy, 27, is charged with murder in the death of a woman who  
disappeared from a bar two years ago. Her body has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said they have not ruled out the possibility  
of more victims or arrests in the case, which began March 22 when a 
bloody woman fled Ray's mobile home wearing only a padlocked 
collar.

<HEADLINE> Boy Sues School for Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *By Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The father of an eighth-grader suspended  
from school for writing a story about a fictional planet named 
``Poland Jewpiter'' filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday claiming his 
son's free speech rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	The mythical planet 14-year-old Brad Herman described had air  
that smelled like sausages and people wearing ``funny hats'' who 
listened and danced to bar mitzvah music, the lawsuit filed in U.S. 
District Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the food tasted good. But he ended his paper with  
the words, ``I hope to never go to this planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and administrative at the school did not return  
telephone calls Tuesday to explain why the story resulted in the 
boy's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Brad and other students at Brandywine  
Heights Middle School in Topton were given an assignment in English 
class to make up a story about a planet, name it, and describe its 
traits that relate to the five senses. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad, who is not of Jewish or Polish origin, said he got the  
idea for the fake planet from his Polish friend and from an MTV 
program that showed a bar mitzvah, said his attorney Daylin Leach. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had no idea anyone would be offended, Leach said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote an innocuous story. It contains no insults,'' Leach  
said. ``But even if it did offend people, you can't suspend a 
student because of the content of his story. Students have First 
Amendment rights, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said the student had first received a ``good grade'' on  
the story. But on April 19, Brad was suspended for a week from 
school after his teacher asked him to read his paper out loud in 
class and an administrator later chastised and berated Brad in the 
halls in front of other children, court documents stated.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks finished higher Tuesday, largely  
supported by an overnight advance on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar 
edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 38.76  
points, or 0.23 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,957.27. On 
Monday, it lost 4.74 points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.38 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.52 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
119.26 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks posted a moderate advance on buying  
of high-tech issues on the back of a rally in technology-related 
stocks in New York on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But players remained reluctant to take aggressive positions  
ahead of a string of national holidays in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealers are lessening the positions they take ahead of the  
holidays,'' said Hidenori Karaki, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's ``Golden Week'' holidays start April 29 and last through  
next week. Tokyo financial markets will be closed on April 29 and 
May 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said share prices were little affected by Monday's  
meeting of top finance officials from the world's major economies 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement from the Group of Seven industrialized

<HEADLINE> Fla. Moves Toward School Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida is about to enact the nation's  
first statewide school voucher plan -- a program that would give tax 
money to students at the worst public schools to get a private or 
parochial education. 
</P>
<P>
	Each voucher would be worth at least $4,000 per year toward  
tuition for many of Florida's 2 million public school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush and legislative leaders reached agreement on the  
plan on Tuesday, despite fears that it would cripple public 
education and violate the constitutional separation of church and 
state. The Legislature is expected to approve the plan on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will sign that bill with a smile on my face,'' said the  
Republican governor, who campaigned passionately for the program 
last fall while opponents derided it as a favor to Bush's wealthy 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents said it would give public schools an incentive to  
improve and let students stuck in bad schools get a better 
education. They said the vouchers wouldn't cost taxpayers anything 
extra because the money would be taken from the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for kids,'' said Jeanne Allen, president of the  
Center for Education Reform in Washington, a nonprofit group. ``You 
have, first and foremost, a law that puts public schools on notice 
that they have to fish or cut bait, and you have a bill that helps 
children that are most in need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine and Vermont have narrow voucher programs to help students  
in rural areas where there is no public school nearby, while 
Milwaukee and Cleveland have citywide plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's program would be open to students at any public school  
that gets a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, public school students in grades three  
through 10 would be tested annually and the results would be used 
to grade all schools. By some estimates, as many as 169 of 
Florida's 3,000 schools could get a failing grade under the state's 
new, tougher standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush calls the vouchers ``opportunity scholarships'' and sees  
them as part of a plan to improve education in a state that 
annually is near the bottom of many school rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the program will hurt public schools.  
</P>
<P>
	``More and more high school students will be ill-prepared to  
enter college,'' said Pat Tornillo, president of the Florida 
Education Association/United, one of the state's biggest teachers 
unions. It represents 70,000 school employees. Tornillo said 
voucher schools would be able to use uncertified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Anderson, a spokeswoman with the National Education  
Association in Washington, said: ``It may well help some students, 
but at the expense of the majority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal action is also likely.  
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as a clear violation of the Constitution,'' said  
Joe Conn, spokesman for the Washington-based Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State. ``You cannot force taxpayers to pay 
for private religious schools, and that's what this program does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to vouchers, expanded student testing and grading of  
schools, the pending legislation would also toughen teacher 
training and crack down on truancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have true accountability,'' Bush said.

	Gun Store Owner Denied HS Gunman  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- One of the gunmen in the deadly high  
school shooting was reportedly denied in an attempt to buy a 
machine gun and other weapons from a gun store last month. Mel 
Bernstein, owner of Dragon Arms, told investigators that four 
teen-age boys dressed in trench coats -- including Eric Harris -- and 
a young woman came to his store in early March. They tried to buy 
an M-60 machine gun and a pistol equipped with a silencer. He said 
he declined to sell the guns to Harris because he was too young. 
Bernstein said the incident was captured on a surveillance 
videotape that he turned over to federal authorities.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Senate Republican said today he is  
drafting a bill that would double President Clinton's $6.05 billion 
request to pay for the fighting with Yugoslavia and the resultant 
refugees. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who chairs the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, said his measure would provide more than 
Clinton wants for the conflict, plus additional money to improve 
military benefits and beef up U.S. readiness worldwide. The 
Republican plans position them as outdoing Clinton and 
congressional Democrats on defense spending. Democrats criticized 
the GOP for expanding the measure and accused the GOP of 
politicizing the issue.

today. WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland said it did not

investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. The court 
ruled unanimously that people cannot be convicted of giving an 
illegal gratuity unless prosecutors prove the gift was linked to an 
official act. It is not enough to show that someone wanted to curry 
favor because an official was in a position to help them, the court 
said. Espy was acquitted last December of all 30 corruption charges 
involving gifts he accepted from Sun-Diamond Growers of California 
and others.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 113.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed Tuesday, as the Dow Jones  
industrials moved to record highs amid a return to manufacturing 
and basic materials stocks, but the Nasdaq composite sank on 
profit-taking in some technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 113.12 to 10,831.71, breaking 10,800 for the  
first time and topping its previous record, set last Thursday, of 
10,727.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index added 2.76 to 1,362.80, enough  
to beat Monday's record close and reach its second consecutive new 
high. But the Nasdaq composite index, which climbed to a new high 
on Monday, lost 49.64 to 2,602.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said DuPont's earnings, released early Tuesday, helped  
encourage investors to replay last week's move into the 
economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks on the belief that the 
world economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``DuPont's earnings and some positive comments from them helped  
the whole cyclical case here,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chief 
investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors believe in the bull story and they're looking for  
growth at a reasonable price, and for the time being, they can find 
it in cyclical issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, meanwhile, were subjected to ``a little  
light, uninformed profit-taking,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market 
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``There is no fundamental 
news in that area, it's just that the prices got to such a raucous 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., said the  
Nasdaq was slowing down after hitting a new closing high Monday and 
ahead of some key earnings releases. He said investors were 
``waiting on bated breath'' for earnings from Internet companies 
America Online and Amazon.com., due out later Tuesday and 
Wednesday, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL shares skidded 9 points to 153 on the Big Board, despite a  
growing consensus that the company's earnings, scheduled for 
release after the close of trading Tuesday, would beat expectations 
of 9 cents. The online service provider did surpass analysts' 
forecasts, reporting third-quarter earnings of 11 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Amazon.com, meanwhile, fell 1 5/16 to 205 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was boosted early in the day by earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, a Dow component, reported earnings from continuing  
operations of 66 cents a share, down from 68 cents a year earlier 
but soundly beating analysts' expected 60 cents. DuPont rose 2 3/8 to 
69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's strong results encouraged investors to buy other  
industrial shares, including other Dow stocks -- Alcoa was up 2 1/8 to 
55 3/8, Caterpillar gained 1 9/16 to 63 9/16, Union Carbide rose 1 3/8 to 
49 5/8, and United Technologies was up 4 11/16 to 143 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's first-quarter profit came to 61 cents per share, beating  
analysts' expected 57 cents, as revenues from cellular and 
corporate services offset a downturn in long-distance business. 
AT&AMP;T rose as high as 55 5/8, up 2 3/4, in morning trading, but was up 
only 1/16 at 53 at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney skidded 2 1/2 to 32 1/2. The entertainment company's  
second-quarter profit results released Tuesday met expectations of 
13 cents a share, but Disney called the results disappointing and 
said it will assess where it can cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood on Wall Street was helped by a report from the  
Conference Board that its index of consumer confidence rose for the 
sixth straight month in April, to 134.9 from a revised 134 in 
March. The index is a key indicator of future economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	An index designed to measure consumer expectations for the next  
six to nine months had an even bigger increase, indicating the 
current economic boom is not likely to end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow 7-to-6 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 
1.09 billion shares, up from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.44 to 643.27, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.47 to 774.07. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.19 to 435.16. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo edged 0.23  
higher. Stock markets in London and Paris both climbed to record 
highs in response to Monday's runup on Wall Street. The FT-SE 100 
index in London climbed 1.38 percent, while the CAC in Paris 
advanced 2.49 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX index rose 1.74 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Royals fans To Protest at Yanks Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Wearing T-shirts that read ``share the  
wealth'' and turning their backs every time the visitors bat, 
baseball fans are planning a protest Friday when the rich New York 
Yankees play cash-strapped Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized by radio station KCTE, the protest is aimed at  
bringing attention to the growing disparity throughout major league 
baseball between small- and big-market teams and urging owners to 
agree to revenue-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Kietzman, sports director for the station, said about  
3,000 people had picked up their T-shirts by Tuesday morning and 
promised to take part. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan to fill up the entire left-field general admission  
section,'' said Kietzman, who got the idea from people who call in 
to his daily sports-talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparity between small- and large-market teams has become  
acute in Kansas City since the death in 1993 of Ewing Kauffman, the 
billionaire who founded the team and lavished money on it. The 
Royals, whose payroll is down to around $24 million, were 0-10 last 
season against a Yankees team with a payroll of more than $65 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kietzman said the Yankees will make around $500,000 in radio and  
television rights fees for Friday's game while the Royals get 
around $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not there to bash the Yankees,'' said Kietzman. ``These  
people are passionate about baseball. They want to protect 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group plans to wave dollar bills at the Yankees players as  
they walk into the stadium, then line up early to buy seats in the 
left field general admission section. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful we'll have left field all to ourselves,''  
Kietzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-shirts will have ``We love the Royals'' on the front and  
``Share the wealth'' on the back. Every time the Yankees come to 
bat, group members will turn their backs to the field. After the 
third inning, they'll all get up and tape skeletons to their seats 
with signs that say, ``Small markets are dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then they'll all walk out of the stadium, cross Interstate 70 to  
the Adams Mark Hotel and watch the rest of the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals are not involved in the protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is we're not endorsing it and we're not against  
it,'' said Mike Levy, vice president for marketing and 
communications. ``We just want to make sure everyone is safe. We'll 
be prepared for additional people in that general admissions 
area.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Workers Protest Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Chanting protests and waving banners  
denouncing the International Monetary Fund, nearly 5,000 employees 
of state-run companies demonstrated Tuesday against the Thai 
government's IMF-sponsored privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't sell out the nation to foreign investors'' and ``Stop  
being a slave to the IMF'' read banners carried by the protesters, 
who wore red headbands and gathered at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Protest leaders, exhorting the crowd from a makeshift stage,  
warned that selling off state businesses would cost the workers 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand is grappling with its worst economic crisis in modern  
times. The IMF, which is leading a $17.2 billion bailout of the 
economy, has urged the government to speed up privatization of 
state-run companies, which it considers wasteful and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said they planned to sell them off  
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's protest included contingents from such state-owned  
businesses as Thai Airways, the Communications Authority of 
Thailand, the Port Authority of Thailand and the Provincial Water 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	It was led by employees of the Electricity Generating Authority  
of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Morissette, Amos To Put Songs on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Music upstart MP3.com will sponsor a summer  
concert tour featuring Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos, signaling a 
growing acceptance by mainstream artists, record companies and the 
retail industry of Internet audio technologies as a tool for 
selling music and concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will be able to buy tickets through the site and will be  
able to see pictures and post-concert interviews with the artists 
and their fans. The site will be linked to a site operated by Best 
Buy, a retailer and co-sponsor, where fans can buy CDs by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential here is enormous. We've got to seize the  
opportunity,'' said Michael Robertson, chairman, chief executive 
and founder of MP3.Com, which takes its name from the technology 
that allows Web surfers to download CD-quality music into their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal won't allow fans to download songs by Morrissette  
and Amos, however. It will use a different technology that allows 
for listening only. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has blamed the MP3 technology for the  
distribution of pirated songs because it allows for music to be 
easily transferred from CDs into a computer and then over the 
Internet. But increasingly, the industry has been looking for ways 
to incorporate the Internet into its regular businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact marks a breakthrough for MP3.Com, a San Diego-based  
company that made a name for itself by allowing unknown artists to 
market music directly to consumers through its popular Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour will begin Aug. 8 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and  
conclude in Irvine, Ca., on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-promotions may also include live concert broadcasts into  
Best Buy stores, said Gary Arnold, senior vice president of 
merchandising for Best Buy. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has the blessing of Time Warner, a partner in Miss  
Morissette's Maverick record label, and Atlantic Records, Miss 
Amos' distributor, although neither company is ready to move into 
online distribution or marketing on a large scale, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt this was an opportunity to embrace the Internet,''  
said Scott Welch, a partner in Atlas/Third Rail Management, which 
manages Miss Morissette. ``All of us are in uncharted territory. I 
think we all are trying to find a way to increase the relationships 
the artists have with their fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Amos' manager, Arthur Spivak of Spivak Entertainment said  
Miss Amos has been pressing him to make use of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last eight years or so I've had my artist calling up  
talking about getting involved in the Internet. What comes back to 
me is Internet, Internet, Internet. ... This is how her fans 
communicate. This is how they talk to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither singer appeared at the news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has been struggling to come to terms with  
the Internet and companies such as MP3.Com, which enable both 
artists and consumers to bypass traditional recording companies and 
retailers with direct-to-consumer marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.Com did not develop the MP3 technology that allows  
high-quality downloads of recordings. The company, however, has 
used it to legally distribute thousands of recordings on its Web 
site of the same name. The company uses the site to market the 
songs of any artist on the condition that one song be made 
available for free download. Artists set the price for the rest and 
split the revenue with MP3.Com. 
</P>
<P>
	The music exists in digital files in MP3.Com's servers linked to  
CD-cutting equipment. When a customer orders music, the sound 
automatically is transferred from the digital file to a CD and 
shipped to the buyer.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Media File Court Appeal </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Eleven news organizations filed an  
emergency appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court on Tuesday in 
another attempt to keep their unpublished photos and video of a 
campus riot from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the state's Court of Appeals refused to overturn a  
lower court order requiring that the media outlets give the 
materials to prosecutors by that day. Prosecutors want the 
materials to help them identify people involved in the March 27-28 
riot at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Herschel Fink, a lawyer for one of the 11 organizations, the  
Detroit Free Press, said the appeal filed Tuesday requests 
immediate consideration of the issue and an extension of the order 
to turn over photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said he received a video Tuesday  
from a television station, but has not received any other 
materials. Dunnings said he will ask a judge Friday to hold the 
media outlets in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The media outlets contend that turning over unpublished photos  
and video would compromise their newsgathering ability and place 
reporters in jeopardy by forcing them to act as agents of the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	The riot began in the final moments of the NCAA semifinal game  
in which Michigan State lost to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Detroit Free Press, the media outlets are, the  
Lansing State Journal, The State News -- Michigan State's student 
newspaper -- and television stations WJBK, WKBD and WXYZ in Detroit, 
WJRT in Flint, WILX in Onandaga outside Lansing, WLNS in Lansing, 
WWMT in Kalamazoo and WZZM in Grand Rapids.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Global Economic Risks Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One day after the United States failed to  
achieve solid commitments from Europe and Japan to boost growth, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin used his bluntest language yet to 
warn that the world could face severe risks if major countries do 
not carry out their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin noted that America's trade deficit has soared to record  
levels as a result of nearly two years of global turmoil while 
Japan's trade surplus has actually increased and Europe's trade 
balance has been essentially unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has borne the bulk of the burden of the  
global current-account adjustment in response to the Asian 
crisis,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation cannot continue indefinitely. Japan and Europe  
must boost domestic demand-led growth,'' Rubin said in a speech at 
the opening of discussions among world finance ministers who sit on 
the steering committee for the 182-nation International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the regular discussions on the global economy,  
the IMF and the World Bank were holding an emergency meeting today 
designed to speed financial assistance to Balkan countries whose 
economies have been disrupted by NATO's air war in Serbia and the 
flood of refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters that his  
organization would offer $40 million in financial assistance for 
Macedonia and $30 million for Albania with immediate support also 
expected from the IMF. He said he hoped wealthy nations would put 
forth support pledges as well and he predicted that the World Bank 
and the 15-nation European Union would take the lead in 
coordinating emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bomb the hell out of the Yugoslavia, the impact is  
something we really have to get a handle on,'' Wolfensohn told 
reporters, stressing the urgency of providing help for the 500,000 
refugees and also to the economies of the neighboring Balkan 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, in his speech, noted that economic growth has flagged in  
Europe in recent months. ``It is important that Europe redouble its 
efforts to increase domestic demand-led growth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And for Japan, which is mired in its worst recession in 50  
years, Rubin was even more blunt, saying that growth prospects and 
the threat of deflation ``remain a source for concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the United States the only region of the world exhibiting  
strong growth, Rubin said, ``The balance of risks for the global 
economy remain on the downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's comments highlighted growing unease within the  
administration about the need for America's major allies to do much 
more to boost growth to serve as an alternative market for exports 
by crisis-stricken countries. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy is doing well with unemployment  
at a three-decade low, America's trade deficit hit a record $169 
billion last year, and is projected to rise even further in 1999. 
More than 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost and American 
farmers, who export one-third of their production, are suffering 
their worst times in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	After several hours of closed-door discussions Monday, the  
world's seven richest countries -- the United States, Japan, 
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued an eight-page 
statement pledging to pursue a growth strategy that will reduce 
growing trade imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
	They also pledged to bolster recoveries from recessions in  
countries whose economies have been leveled by the currency crisis, 
but they notably did not specify how they will achieve these goals 
of greater growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin expressed concerns, saying  
that the global recovery remains too fragile to provide ``any 
grounds for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But underscoring the private disagreements among the major  
powers, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime 
minister of Japan, immediately sought to play down expectations 
that the G-7 statement signaled that Japan was willing to do any 
more than it already has to jump-start its ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the statement referred to Japan ``using all available  
tools to support strong domestic demand-led growth,'' Miyazawa said 
that meant only that Japan should ``do its best,'' not that Japan 
should ``do something new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-page G-7 communique touched on a number of issues  
facing the global economy, including the need for countries 
devastated by a steep plunge in currency values and ensuing 
recessions to continue efforts to overhaul weak banking systems and 
deal with other economic problems, all topics that were being 
reviewed today in the broader IMF meetings.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but  
fell against the euro and other key currencies Tuesday as the 
world's top financial officials continued talks in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.40  
Japanese yen, up from 119.26 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar fell against the euro, the currency of 11  
European nations which rose to $1.0660 from $1.0582 late Monday. It 
also fell against the Swiss franc and the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen came as Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin exhorted Japan and Europe to do more to stimulate 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has borne the bulk of the burden of the  
global current-account adjustment in response to the Asian crisis'' 
he told world finance ministers who sit in the steering committee 
for for the 182-nation International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation cannot continue indefinitely. Japan and Europe  
must boost domestic demand-led growth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks came a day after Rubin met with Japanese Finance  
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa who later indicated he saw no need for 
supplemental Japanese spending to stimulate its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillermo Estebanez, currency strategist for Bank of America in  
San Francisco, said despite Miyazawa's failure to outline new 
economic actions, traders expect Japan eventually will have to do 
something. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market expects a fiscal package from Japan,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other traders said the approach of the Golden Week holidays in  
Japan prompted some dollar buying by professionals in advance of 
the long holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the euro, after rising against the  
currency in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Estebanez cited ``a more consistent effort on the part of the  
Europeans to talk up the euro'' between meetings in Washington as 
part of the reason for its rise. He also said speculation persisted 
about a chance for a peaceful settlement that would end the NATO 
bombing in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5074 Swiss francs, down from 1.5140,  
and 1.4793 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4753 late Monday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6179, up from $1.6119. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8349 German 
marks, down from 1.8481; 6.1538 French francs, down from 6.1996, 
and 1,814.88 Italian lire, down from 1,828.15.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Electrical Workers Leader Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles H. Pillard, president of the  
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers during the years of 
its greatest membership, died Monday in a Buffalo, N.Y., hospital 
from a heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillard was the IBEW's president from 1968 to 1986. During that  
period the union successfully challenged President Nixon's federal 
wage controls as penalizing the working poor and won a case forcing 
Westinghouse to disclose information about its treatment of female 
and minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IBEW also faced several challenges during Pillard's  
tenure, including a strike against AT&AMP;T in 1983, allegations of 
price-fixing over fees it charged trainees and charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillard started his union career as an electrician in Buffalo,  
During his tenure as IBEW president, the union reached a peak 
membership of 1 million workers, now down to about 750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillard lived in Washington during his union presidency, when he  
also was a vice president and executive council member of the 
AFL-CIO. He retired to a home in Orchard Park, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Profits Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. managed to beat Wall Street  
expectations for first-quarter profits despite another decline in 
its flagship long-distance service, providing timely evidence to 
Wall Street that its intense drive into nontraditional businesses 
is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said Tuesday its profit rose 39 percent in the quarter,  
excluding one-time charges but including the impact of its 
acquisition of the Tele-Communications Inc. cable TV company, which 
was completed March 9, three weeks before the quarter's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income of $1.72 billion, or 61 cents a share, was up from  
$1.24 billion, or 46 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected AT&AMP;T to earn 57  
cents a share. AT&AMP;T stock retreated from earlier gains in afternoon 
trading to close up 6 cents a share at $53 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T posted a 6.1 percent revenue increase in the quarter, as  
sharply higher sales of cellular phone, corporate 
telecommunications and other budding services more than offset a 
3.4 percent decline in its huge long-distance phone business. The 
sales results excluded AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial results came as AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong  
stepped up an already scorching pace for global deals as he 
reshapes Ma Bell, the nation's largest long-distance company, into 
a diversified telecommunications conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T sparked a takeover battle last week for MediaOne, offering  
$58 billion for the fourth-largest U.S. cable TV operator in an 
effort to thwart an existing acquisition agreement by Comcast. 
Together with TCI, AT&AMP;T plans to use cable systems to deliver local 
and long-distance phone service, high-speed Internet access and 
interactive entertainment to millions of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Tuesday a partnership with Nippon  
Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's dominant telephone company, to 
manage communications networks for multinational companies. And 
AT&AMP;T is joining with British Telecommunications in buying a 
combined 30 percent stake in Japan Telecom Co., Japan's 
third-largest carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisitions are fed by AT&AMP;T's ambition to compete globally  
in promising new businesses at a time when its long-distance 
consumer service is under attack by established and upstart rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong stressed in a teleconference Tuesday that the company  
has yet to target deals in Asia and Latin America. ``I don't think 
anyone will accuse us of going to slow in this company, but I hope 
they will also accuse us of going thoughtfully,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's quarterly revenue benefited from a 69 percent increase in  
sales of networking management services to corporations, a 
fast-growing operation that will be further buoyed by the company's 
purchase of IBM's global network business, to be completed by 
summer. Sales from its cellular phone service grew 40 percent and 
business phone service grew 7.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its revenue, including the TCI acquisition,  
rose 9.9 percent to $14.10 billion from $12.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T benefited from lower costs resulting from a reduction of  
18,000 jobs last year and lower network connection costs. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T chief financial officer Dan Somers said that the company  
expects to post similar sales growth in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Grant Promotes Savarese Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shortly after Michael Grant makes history, he  
might be history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be fighting long,'' said the 26-year-old NABF  
heavyweight champion, who hopes to retire as an undefeated 
titleholder. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd better grab me now and take each experience because by  
age 30, it's over and done,'' Grant said Tuesday at a news 
conference to promote his 12-round fight against Lou Savarese at 
Madison Square Garden June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sport dominated by trash talkers and self-promoters, Grant  
(29-0, 21 KOs) is not like his peers. He is quiet and humble, plays 
the piano and sings in the church choir. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 250-pounder had little desire to enter the ring --  
and even less of a yearning to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the people in boxing,'' Grant said. ``You have to  
fight so much even before you get into the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant wanted to play pro football or basketball, but that dream  
ended when he partied his way out of Cal-State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
	He met boxing referee Richard Steele at a blackjack table in Las  
Vegas in 1992 when he was in town to watch the Evander 
Holyfield-Riddick Bowe fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele persuaded him to give boxing a try and now it's his job.  
But he's all business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fight every fight as if it is a championship fight,'' Grant  
said. ``Lou is going to give the greatest performance of his 
career. ... I don't belittle anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savarese (39-2, 32 KOs) is a 33-year-old native of the Bronx,  
N.Y. who knows that a win over Grant could land him the title fight 
which has eluded him throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to try not to be stubborn and exploit his  
inexperience,'' Savarese said. ``I have a habit of going right at 
the guy, but I have to be smart with Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other bout on the program to be televised on HBO's ``Boxing  
After Dark'' series is a 10-round heavyweight fight between Jeremy 
Williams and Hasim Rahman. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams (34-2, 31 KOs) has knocked out his last eight  
opponents. Rahman is 31-1 with 26 KOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rahman's only defeat was a controversial 10th round knockout by  
David Tua in December when Tua punched Rahman after the bell had 
sounded.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Talks to Russian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A U.S. envoy held talks with Russian officials  
today on Moscow's efforts to broker a peaceful solution to the 
Yugoslav crisis, but there appeared to be little hope of a 
diplomatic breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of closed-door meetings, U.S. Deputy Secretary of  
State Strobe Talbott was trying to determine if Moscow had made any 
progress on getting the Yugoslav government to agree to NATO 
demands or relax its position in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking briefly to reporters, Talbott said the talks went well  
and there might be more meetings, but he gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consultations between Moscow and Washington on the situation  
around Yugoslavia will be continued,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is heading Russia's  
peace efforts, reiterated Moscow's position that NATO must halt its 
airstrikes on Yugoslavia to clear the way for talks, a condition 
rejected repeatedly by the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was necessary to stop ``maybe even for a specified time the  
missile and bomb attacks on Yugoslavia'' so that negotiations could 
be resumed, Chernomyrdin told reporters before meeting Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
	The West is hopeful that Moscow could play a key role in  
negotiating a compromise with Belgrade. However, Moscow appears to 
have less influence with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic than 
it thought and several Russian diplomatic missions to Belgrade have 
failed to make any progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian diplomatic sources, who declined to be named, said after  
Talbott met Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that they did not expect 
the U.S. envoy's mission to produce a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin and President Boris Yeltsin said after talks today  
that Moscow would continue efforts to find a solution. Moscow 
strongly opposes the NATO airstrikes, but has said it will not be 
dragged into the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin may visit Belgrade in the next few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Without giving any details, Chernomyrdin said he spoke Monday  
night by telephone with Vice President Al Gore on the Yugoslav 
situation and they had agreed to have regular contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott and Chernomyrdin also reportedly discussed NATO calls  
for an oil embargo on Yugoslavia. Russia, which is a leading 
supplier of oil to Belgrade, has said it would not honor such a 
blockade, while also saying it has suspended oil deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's state natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, said today it was  
continuing deliveries to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong job market and a surge in wages unseen  
in a generation boosted consumer confidence for the sixth straight 
month in April, as Americans shrugged off the war in Kosovo, rising 
gas prices and concerns that stocks are too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, life is going on in spite of those things. I  
think it's that simple,'' said Mona Doyle, president of Consumer 
Network Inc., a Philadelphia research group that studies consumer 
issues. ``People have so much to do, if there's a Zeitgeist of 
today it's `whatever works.' ... They don't see doom around the 
corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business research group,  
reported its consumer confidence index rose nearly a full point to 
134.9 from a revised 134 in March, a stronger performance than 
economists had expected. An index designed to measure consumer 
expectations for the next six to nine months had an even bigger 
increase, rising to 108 from 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is an important economic indicator because consumer  
spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The driving force behind the current bullishness has been the  
lift provided by a labor market where jobs are more plentiful than 
any time in recent memory and, as a result, starting wages for 
skilled workers are on the rise, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've moved into this wonderful labor market situation where  
if you really hate your job, you feel you can go get another job 
... You don't do it, but it makes you feel good,'' said James 
Annable, chief economist at BankOne Corp. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's steady growth has created the rare combination of  
low unemployment and low inflation, giving people greater ability 
to spend. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that average 
income last year was $26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, 
significantly outpacing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're generating real wage growth faster than we've seen in a  
generation,'' said Annable. ``Nothing makes people feel better than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, real wages grew by  
a paltry half percent a year, Annable said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, economists had anticipated the consumer confidence  
figure would remain flat in April. Instead it continued a steady 
rise that began last fall, in tandem with a rebound in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell below 7,500 in  
early October of last year, but on Tuesday it registered another in 
a series of all-time highs and marked its first close above 10,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many analysts fear that the stock market's lofty levels  
make it ripe for a fall, there are few signs of trouble. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list also reached a new high Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising stock market has been more of a boon than a bane,  
said Sandra Shaber, an economist at WEFA, a Philadelphia economic 
forecasting and consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the stock market has gone through a rebound ...  
makes people feel good and richer and willing to buy stuff,'' said 
Shaber, who specializes in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	While some shoppers interviewed Tuesday around the country  
agreed with the economists' assessment of the nation's general 
mood, they were skeptical that fatter wallets were the underlying 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not faced with any kind of unbearable situations these  
days,'' said the Rev. Clarence Pemberton, who was shopping for 
computer software for his Philadelphia Baptist church. ``So 
everyone feels better about day-to-day life and with how they spend 
their money,'' he said. ``They're in better moods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic strength, the National Association  
of Realtors reported Tuesday that sales of existing single-family 
homes rose to a record high in March. The annual rate of 5.05 
million units in March, up from February's 5.02 million rate, broke 
the previous high of 5.04 million set in January. The figures are 
adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
	The record sales pace at the outset of 1999 follows an  
unprecedented year of 4.78 million existing home sales in 1998. 
March was the fourth consecutive month that the sales rate topped 5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability  
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping 
the market incredibly strong,'' said Sharon A. Millett, president 
of the real estate group. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA signed a preliminary agreement  
Tuesday to sell 65 percent of its pay-TV unit Stream to three 
buyers who plan to invest about $1.1 billion in the service. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Teaching Hospitals Facing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's finest teaching hospitals say  
they are on financial life-support and the rest could soon face 
threats to their survival, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very accurate to call it an absolute crisis,'' said Neil  
Rudenstine, president of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Low HMO reimbursements and government budget cuts have led to  
thousands of layoffs, operating losses and projected deficits, and 
could lead the hospitals to abandon their teaching and research 
missions, the institutions say. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's five major teaching hospitals, for example, have  
deficits totaling $150 million this year. Detroit's ailing 
hospitals have eliminated 4,500 jobs since January. The University 
of Texas medical branch at Galveston projects a $110 million 
deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the nation's 400 major teaching hospitals are on the same  
downward slope, Rudenstine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three more years like this and you would have some  
institutions either going out of business or turning from their 
current mission to turning to for-profit,'' Rudenstine said. ``They 
wouldn't do teaching and they wouldn't do research because you 
can't have a for-profit that does that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and train  
75 percent of the nation's doctors, provide 44 percent of care for 
the poor and perform the vast majority of clinical research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burn units, trauma units, cardiac care units -- those are  
unique services you're more likely to find at a major teaching 
hospital,'' said John Parker, spokesman for the Association of 
American Medical Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching hospitals in regions where managed care dominates the  
market are feeling the pain earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, for example,  
has laid off workers under a strict cost-control plan. The center 
suffered a loss of $62.4 million last year on revenue that was 
essentially flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hospitals have been further hit by state Medicaid cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Welfare reform in Pennsylvania, which lowered payments for  
Medicaid patients, contributed to big losses at Philadelphia's 
teaching hospitals: In 1998, the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System lost $90 million on operations; the Temple University Health 
System lost $24.7 million; and the Jefferson Health System lost 
$30.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest looming problem, however, is the deepening cutbacks  
in Medicare, the single biggest source of revenue for teaching 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1998 to 2003, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ratchets down  
Medicare payments to hospitals, with the biggest hits coming in 
later years. So far, only 10 percent of the $9 billion in scheduled 
cuts have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Balanced Budget Act alone will cost Massachusetts teaching  
hospitals $900 million over five years, according to the Conference 
of Boston Teaching Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an extraordinarily painful and difficult issue,'' said  
Peter Van Etten, president and chief executive of UCSF Stanford 
Health in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have accused us of crying wolf in the past,'' he  
said. ``Given what we're going through with these reductions, 
that's not the case now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCSF Stanford recently announced plans to eliminate 2,000  
positions, or 15 percent of its workforce, because of the Balanced 
Budget Act, state cuts in Medicaid and managed care. If the cuts 
continue, ``we would be unable to care for as many acutely ill 
patients as we do now,'' Van Etten said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Association of American Medical Colleges will  
call on Congress to restore the money cut from medical education 
and charity care.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Law Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buyers of explosives would be subject to the  
same Brady law background checks as gun purchasers under 
gun-control legislation President Clinton was proposing today. 
Negligent parents could also be held liable when their children 
commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his omnibus crime package, which the White House  
trumpeted as ``the most comprehensive gun legislation any 
administration has put forward in 30 years,'' Clinton wants to 
raise the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21, ban 
juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles, halt imports 
of all high-capacity ammunition clips and limit an individual's 
handgun purchases to one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest sources of crime guns is straw purchasers  
who make multiple purchases in one state and transfer those guns to 
another state where they flood the streets,'' White House domestic 
policy adviser Bruce Reed said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton is renewing measures that died in the last  
Congress and is counting on outrage over the Colorado school 
shooting to push them through this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospects are good,'' White House press secretary Joe  
Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, oftentimes it takes tragic 
events to catalyze work here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives provision, which aims to treat the sale of  
explosives the same way gun sales are treated under the Brady law, 
would cover dynamite, blasting caps and the like, not materials 
that can be blended into an explosive mixture. In Littleton, Colo., 
the student killers used homemade hand grenades and pipe bombs in 
their rampage through Columbine High School. In Oklahoma City, two 
tons of explosive made from common fertilizer were used to blow up 
the federal building in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., praised Clinton's initiative  
cracking down on explosives but wondered if it was a problem too 
loosely defined to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about propane gas tanks and agricultural  
chemicals, I'm anxious to see how they define the component parts 
of this,'' Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, aides said, also is proposing:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--Extension of an existing ban on juvenile possession of handguns  
to include semiautomatic assault rifles; also a ban on importation 
of all ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, an 
extension of current law banning imports of those made since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with an  
additional two days if law officers need them to complete their 
investigation. Until last year, the Brady Act provided five days 
for police to conduct background checks on buyers if they needed 
that much time. Now, it limits them to three days, but most checks 
are instantaneous. Never before has there been a minimum, mandatory 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory prison sentences of three to 10 years and $10,000  
fines for adults, including parents, who allow children access to 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to 
occur,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He added that the 
legislation's standard of reckless conduct would be ``a difficult 
standard to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this provision long before the Littleton  
shootings and it is not meant to suggest that those killers' 
parents should be blamed, Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, who represents South  
Dakota, where guns are popular among ranchers and sportsmen, was 
skeptical about passing any new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that gun legislation is what we need,'' Daschle  
told reporters Monday. He suggested the school shootings were a 
societal problem stemming from parental and teacher neglect and 
violence in the media and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things we better be looking at,''  
Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democratic senator, Charles Schumer of New York, said he  
wants to plug an Internet loophole that allows gun buyers to 
circumvent the Brady law. ``The firepower that can be acquired 
simply by going online is chilling,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of  
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody doesn't decide to walk into a school and murder  
several people because of lack of a gun lock or something,'' he 
said. ``It's a horrible, profound, moral issue.''

	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Two back-country skiers were killed in an  
avalanche near Juneau on Tuesday, bringing to 11 the number of 
people killed in snowslides in Alaska in the past five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Winchell, 32, and Matthew Brakel, 33, died of injuries  
they suffered on Mt. McGinnis near the Mendenhall Glacier.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Fat-Blocking Diet Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The menu at Pink's is a dietitian's  
nightmare: hot dogs, hamburgers and french fries augmented with 
healthy doses -- so to speak -- of chili, cheese, sauerkraut or 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	For the adventurous -- or indecisive -- there's the $3.90 pastrami  
burrito dog. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the dieters, how about a chaser of Xenical?  
</P>
<P>
	The highly anticipated diet pill, which earned government  
approval Monday, sounds like a Pink's patron's dream. It blocks the 
body from absorbing 30 percent of the fat a person eats. 
</P>
<P>
	But medical experts warned the drug -- the first that works in  
the gut instead of targeting the brain to suppress appetite -- is 
only for obese people on strict diets and can cause unpleasant side 
effects, especially if someone pops a pill just before indulging in 
a greasy burger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always looking for the next magic drug, but there's no  
pill people can take that'll make you close the refrigerator 
door,'' said Dr. David Heber, director of the Center for Human 
Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pink's, which has served up its cuisine since 1939 in Los  
Angeles' Miracle Mile district, customers said they would stick 
with exercise and better eating habits, considering the drug's 
potential downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer a more natural way of losing weight if I had a  
choice,'' said Jaime Parker, as he waited in line for his chili 
cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical, known chemically as orlistat, blocks intestinal  
enzymes. So instead of being stored on people's hips, 30 percent of 
the fat eaten passes straight to the colon for excretion. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies, adding Xenical to a diet let people lose about 7 1/2  
pounds more in a year than diet alone, the Food and Drug 
Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way it works, Xenical can also cause intestinal  
cramping, oily spotting, gas, fecal urgency, and oily or loose 
stools. Some 27 percent of Xenical users had at least one episode, 
although the side effects tend to wane the longer people take the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the more fat eaten, the more side effects -- thus, the FDA  
recommended that Xenical users get no more than 30 percent of their 
daily calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the side effects will keep many dieters from the  
kind of haphazard use that plagued Redux and the fenfluramine half 
of ``fen-phen,'' which were banned for causing heart damage. Both 
were very popular and sometimes bought on the Internet without 
consultation with a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical ``is not a drug for people who want to eat whatever they  
want,'' said Heber, whose center treats thousands a year. ``Those 
gastrointestinal side effects will be enough to turn a lot of those 
people off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Xenical to do any good, dieters have to eat fewer overall  
calories, not just watch fat, said Dr. Richard Atkinson of the 
University of Wisconsin, president of the American Obesity 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	As for people who ``eat the pizza and milkshake and take this  
drug and think it's going to absolve them of all their sins, 
they're going to be in for a surprise,'' Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical also decreases absorption of the important fat-soluble  
vitamins A, D, E and K, so users should take vitamin supplements 
two hours before -- or after -- swallowing Xenical. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieters take one Xenical capsule with each main meal, up to  
three daily. Manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche said the 
prescription-only drug would be available within two weeks, at a 
wholesale price of $1.10 per pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other prescription weight-loss drugs are sold in the  
country. Doctors expect many dieters will begin taking Xenical with 
those appetite suppressants to shed even more pounds. But the FDA 
warned no one has studied the safety of mixing the drugs, and Roche 
has no plans to do so.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Open Your Eyes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's difficult to decide whether to scream at the screen or sing  
the praises of Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar after watching 
his latest film, ``Open Your Eyes'' (``Abre Los Ojos''). But then, 
everything about the film is so confusing, such inner conflict 
seems apropos. 
</P>
<P>
	Amenabar's approach to the narrative is ambitious, forcing the  
viewer to question constantly what is truly happening, what is a 
flashback, what is hallucination. Like the characters themselves, 
we never know what is real or a dream, who is alive or dead, who is 
sane or mad. 
</P>
<P>
	This much we do know:  
</P>
<P>
	Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is a sexy, shallow yuppie living in a  
stylish Madrid apartment. He prides himself on never dating the 
same girl twice -- a habit his homely best friend Pelayo (Fele 
Martinez) simultaneously envies and abhors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Cesar's psycho ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) is stalking  
him. When she crashes his 25th-birthday party, Cesar avoids her by 
chatting the night away with Pelayo's date, the stunning Sofia 
(Penelope Cruz). Sure, Pelayo is his best buddy, but Sofia is smart 
and gorgeous, and she's the first woman with whom fidelity doesn't 
sound so painful after all. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cesar isn't rehabilitated just yet. After spending a  
magical, albeit innocent, night at Sofia's apartment, he's back to 
his old ways when Nuria pulls up outside the next morning and 
offers him a ride home and a chance to make love to her. In a 
jealous rage, she drives them both off a cliff in her red sports 
car, killing herself and destroying the best thing Cesar had going 
for him: his face. 
</P>
<P>
	We learn all this from flashbacks as Cesar recounts his tale for  
a psychiatrist in the mental ward of a prison. Cesar is locked up 
for a murder he doesn't recall committing. He tries to remember his 
dreams, but they come in opaque, swirling visions. Gone is the 
playboy's swagger -- he now cowers in the corner like a frightened 
animal, wearing a mask to shroud his scars and misshapen eyes and 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
	From here, it is nearly impossible to figure out what is going  
on. Just when you think you have a situation nailed, Amenabar 
taunts you and takes you in the opposite direction. He rushes 
forward and backward in time, from reality -- if there is such a 
thing in this film -- to hallucinations and nightmares. The pace is 
quick, and Amenabar relies on dizzying pans and off-kilter camera 
angles to enhance the film's tension. It's challenging and 
innovative, yet maddening. 
</P>
<P>
	After such stylized suspense, the ending disintegrates into the  
kind of science fiction that would have been original 40 years ago 
as a ``Twilight Zone'' episode. But even after the mysteries of the 
``plot'' are unraveled, it's still unclear what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The actors, however, muddle through the madness and offer strong  
performances. Noriega provides a fascinating portrayal of Cesar's 
shift from arrogant stud to raging, misshapen freak. And Cruz, with 
her almond-shaped brown eyes and Julia Roberts smile, is sensuous 
and charming as Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
	But they can't alter the problem of too many questions that are  
impossible -- and ultimately mind-boggling -- to answer. Cesar sums 
it up best during a session with his shrink: ``I like the floor. 
It's the only thing that seems real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Open Your Eyes,'' an Artisan Entertainment release, is in  
Spanish with English subtitles. It is rated R for sexual 
situations, language and some violence. Running time: 110 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Promises Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. is on the mend and won't be  
repeating the poor performance it had last year, executives 
promised shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Seattle-based Boeing, told them at a meeting Monday that the 
company is solving problems that led to losses in 1997 and 
depressed earnings in 1998. He touted profits that rose to $469 
million in the first quarter of 1999, compared to $50 million 
during the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a very challenging one and an experience I never  
intend to repeat,'' Condit said. ``... I believe we have turned the 
corner. This is a team that knows what success looks like. We are 
going to win. Watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has made significant changes to boost profit margins  
during the past year, although big challenges still remain, said 
Paul Nisbet, an aerospace industry analyst with JSA Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of hurdles here for Boeing to jump,'' he said.  
``The biggest one is probably getting back on track so that their 
costs and pricing of future aircraft are such that they can get 
back into the double-digit margins that they're looking for. That 
probably will take two to four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The generally upbeat meeting opened a few hours after Airbus  
Industrie announced in Paris that it plans to build the A318, a 
107-seat passenger jet that competes with Boeing's 717. Boeing has 
about 115 orders for the 717, but has failed to crack the regional 
airline market for which the plane is intended. Airbus said it has 
109 firm orders for the A318. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference that followed the shareholders meeting,  
Condit said the 717 is a better plane. He acknowledged that Boeing 
still is evaluating whether to continue the jet, which was 
developed by McDonnell Douglas before Boeing purchased the company 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It is among a number of programs Boeing is reviewing under a  
companywide effort to eliminate all but the most profitable 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big question as they go through the valuation of  
their various programs, whether the 717 will survive,'' Nisbet 
said. ``The key to that program succeeding is being able to sell 
that aircraft to the regional airlines, which they haven't been 
able to do yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condit suggested it was unlikely Boeing would compete with  
Airbus to build superjumbo aircraft capable of seating as many as 
600 passengers. Airbus has said it is considering such a project, 
although no final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there is a market to support development of a  
very large airplane,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology reported Monday  
that Boeing Co. is considering a new family of 450- to 550-seat 
jetliners, according to confidential company documents it obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade publication said that while ``Boeing is working  
closely with key suppliers on the design,'' development of the 
aircraft is far from certain. If approved, the earliest the plane 
could enter airline service would be 2006, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokeswoman Mary Jean Olsen declined to comment in detail  
about the proposal, except to say it was among many preliminary 
designs that have emerged over years of studying possible larger 
aircraft lines.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Kids To Attend Chatfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  
students are to return to class has been delayed because so many 
have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 
massacre, an administrator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The students are scheduled to begin classes Monday at another  
school a few miles away in afternoon sessions until the end of the 
year, said Barbara Monseu, area administrator for the Jefferson 
County School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were originally scheduled to go back Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Calling the return to the classroom ``a very important next step  
in the process of healing,'' Monseu said the first thing Columbine 
students will do when they arrive at Chatfield High School is 
attend an assembly to reunite them with their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teachers are very anxious to see their students again,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine and Chatfield are sports rivals, but junior John Danos  
said he welcomed the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fine with it,'' he said. ``We're going to treat them  
normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is  
being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and 
Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the resumption of classes, some of Columbine's  
158 teachers met Tuesday morning for the first time since two 
student gunmen fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher before 
taking their own lives.

<HEADLINE> Fergie Visits Columbine Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The Duchess of York visited the memorial  
for the victims of the Columbine High School attack on Tuesday, 
saying it reminded her of the tribute paid to Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	Such violence is ``not just America. It's a worldwide issue,''  
she said. ``I feel very strongly that the American people need to 
know they're supported in Europe and all over the world, too, not 
just in Columbine and Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Sarah Ferguson walked up to the sprawling memorial  
site in nearby Clement Park and read several of the hundreds of 
cards. She then knelt and laid flowers among the other flowers, 
teddy bears and memorabilia left in tribute to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming here today, it certainly has the feel of Kensington  
Palace after (Princess Diana) died,'' the duchess said. ``Everyone 
came to pay their respects. It certainly feels like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fergie was traveling from San Francisco to Kansas City on  
business. She had a two-hour layover at Denver International 
Airport and said she felt compelled to visit the site.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many Think Attack Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll found 40 percent of high school  
students questioned believe it is likely an attack similar to what 
happened in Colorado could take place at their school. 
</P>
<P>
	Four in 10 students also answered yes when asked whether any of  
their classmates might be troubled enough to do something like last 
week's slayings at Columbine High School in suburban Denver, 
according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students shocked the nation a week ago when they shot their  
way through the high school, killing 12 students and a teacher 
before shooting themselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the 40 percent of students who considered the chances  
likely that such an attack could happen at their school, 58 percent 
considered it unlikely; 49 percent of parents said the chances were 
likely, opposed to 48 percent who said it was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 23 percent of students and parents  
considered violence a serious problem at their school, while 77 
percent of teens and 76 percent of parents did not. The poll said 
88 percent of students felt safe at their school, while 11 percent 
felt unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, taken by International Communications Research, was  
conducted by telephone April 22-25 among a national sampling of 500 
high school students and 522 parents of students. The margin of 
error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Filly Is Ready To Run for Roses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Eddie Plesa Jr. says there's a  
simple reason for starting Three Ring, a filly who has not raced 
since March 16 and never against colts, in the grueling Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to run in the Kentucky Derby because we think  
we have the horse to win the race,'' Plesa said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three fillies have accomplished the feat -- Regret (1915),  
Genuine Risk (1980) and Winning Colors (1988). 
</P>
<P>
	``She just happens to be a filly,'' Plesa said. ``We wouldn't  
trade our filly for any filly or any 3-year-old and that's why 
we're going to the Kentucky Derby. If you're not sure you should be 
here, you shouldn't be here. There will be no second-guessing from 
myself or the owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Schwartz, chief executive officer of Calvin Klein Inc., is  
the principal owner of the filly, also owned by Ernest Dahlman and 
Eugene Hauman. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, bought for $70,000 as a 2-year-old, is a big,  
muscular filly, and Plesa says, ``There's nothing feminine about 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not just big, but tough, Plesa said of Three Ring, who got  
roughed up in her first start May 24 at Calder. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been in a situation where she's been bumped around,''  
Plesa said. ``It made her angry in a positive way.'' She hung tough 
and finished second in the six-furlong maiden race. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Rings, who breezed five-eighths of a mile in 1:01 2-5  
Sunday, won three of five starts as a 2-year-old, including two 
stakes for Florida-breds, and finished third behind Silverbulletday 
and Excellent Meeting in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Nov. 
7 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	In her first two starts this year, Three Ring finished second to  
China Storm in the 7-furlong Forward Gal Stakes on Jan. 27 and then 
won the Davona Dale over a mile and 70 yards Feb. 21 at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time we really thought about the Kentucky Derby we  
were thinking about the Florida Derby,'' Plesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring was entered for the 1 1-8-mile Florida Derby against  
the likes of Vicar and Cat Thief, both Kentucky Derby contenders, 
but she was scratched after she drew the No. 11 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Plesa said regardless of the draw after entries are made  
Wednesday, Three Ring will make her debut against colts in the 
1 1/4-mile Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Rings' last race was the 1 1-16-mile Bonnie Miss, which  
she won by 6 1/4 lengths March 16 at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	That's as far as she has raced, and now the daughter of Notebook  
is at Churchill Downs for the Derby in which it appears she will 
compete against 19 males. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like an evenly matched bunch of colts, and we can  
beat them,'' Plesa said.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Bilking N.J. Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A man with a history of preying on  
clergy admitted Tuesday he persuaded a priest to give him $1.4 
million in church money by falsely promising he would invest it, 
the lost it all gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Riggio faces a maximum nine years in prison when he is  
sentenced in June. Riggio, who pleaded guilty to two counts of 
theft by deception, has already spent 14 months in jail awaiting 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggio, 52, called Msgr. Federick Valentino, pastor of St.  
Bonaventure Church, in October 1996, and pretended to be a new 
parishioner who was $20,000 in debt to loansharks, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the money, Ryan called again, saying it would be  
difficult to repay it, but out of gratitude he would get the church 
a great investment through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Posing as Tom ``The Banker'' Barracus, Riggio persuaded the  
priest to continue sending cash to New York, supposedly for the 
great investment, until his arrest in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The scam came to light in December when Valentino tried to  
withdraw $30,000 in cash from a parish account. Fearing the priest 
might be an extortion victim, bank officials refused to allow the 
withdrawal without first notifying the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggio, who said he lost the money at Atlantic City casinos and  
at racetracks in New York, has pulled other scams in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted nine years ago in New York of bilking 52  
priests out of $130,000 by pretending to be a needy parishioner. He 
spent two years in prison on the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	After that he cheated a youth baseball league in Newburgh, N.Y.,  
of $80,000, paying his restitution in that case with money he took 
from St. Bonaventure, prosecutor Robert B. Leaman said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Enters Auto Recycling Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- While Ford Motor Co. works to take market  
share from rivals General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG, it 
is also aiming at a much less lofty, but perhaps equally 
challenging, goal: to become the global leader in recycled car and 
truck parts. 
</P>
<P>
	What Ford envisions is a global chain of auto parts recycling  
centers that generates $1 billion in revenue within a few years. 
The move could spur rapid consolidation of the largely family-owned 
auto junkyard business. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker expects the technology and economies  
of scale that it will bring to the business will lower the 
wholesale cost of used parts for the primary customers: insurers 
and repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives said Monday that they already have bought one  
auto recycling center in Tampa, Fla., and are in talks to acquire 
many others across North America in the coming weeks. The 
still-unnamed business will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to revolutionize the industry, to create a Fortune  
1000 company from scratch to become a global, environmentally 
focused powerhouse,'' said William Li, the 29-year-old chief 
operating officer of the new enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's move also is part of its campaign to be seen as the  
world's most environmentally sensitive automaker. Li said Ford 
wants to increase the amount of a junked car that is recycled to 95 
percent from the current average of 80 percent, thereby reducing 
the amount of scrap that goes into dumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The move fits into new president Jac Nasser's strategy to expand  
Ford's role into businesses that bring in revenue throughout a 
car's life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He zealously believes in the focus on the customer and the  
total life cycle of the car, and he's really supporting it with 
this kind of investment,'' said David Cole, an industry expert at 
the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also operates Visteon Automotive Systems, its parts-making  
unit; Ford Credit; and the global Hertz rental-car operation. 
Earlier this month it bought Europe's largest independent auto 
repair chain, Kwik-Fit, for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The move goes against the strategy of some other automakers,  
namely General Motors, to divest related businesses and focus on 
manufacturing. The history of U.S. automakers' investments in 
outside businesses is littered with failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The used parts business today consists of about 10,000 mostly  
small, family-run operations. They range from traditional auto 
junkyards -- where do-it-yourselfers and repair shops go to hunt for 
parts amid rows of rusting wrecks -- to clean, highly organized 
automotive recycling plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's investment will lean toward the latter. Part of the new  
business will be built through acquisitions. The first purchase, in 
March, was Copher Brothers Auto Parts in Tampa, Fla., a 
state-of-the-art recycling operation that serves central Florida. 
Ford plans to expand the operation and eventually use it to recycle 
parts from Ford plants as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said the used parts business, while fragmented, has become  
highly sophisticated with large regional operations and profit 
margins well above those in auto manufacturing. There's no shortage 
of business: about 11 million vehicles are scrapped annually in the 
United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting a player like Ford in, that's a big-time change,''  
Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to set up a nationwide, computerized parts inventory  
and shipping system that it expects will significantly reduce the 
time it takes a repair shop to get a used part. That will help 
dealers and Ford's primary customers: those who own Ford cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also said its recycling centers will have retail stores to  
serve the do-it-yourself mechanic, even though that's a dwindling 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary is likely to be the insurance industry,  
which will have a big, new customer for wrecked vehicles and a new 
source from which to buy replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said other big companies also are looking at getting into the  
business, which could lead to more rapid consolidation. He declined 
to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	William Steinkuller, executive vice president of the Automotive  
Recyclers Association, said an investment group in Chicago has been 
buying up auto recyclers over the past year, but that Ford's 
investment is the first of its kind by an automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford so far has declined to discuss its plans with his group,  
which has about 2,000 members in 19 countries, he said. 
``Obviously, consolidation in the auto recycling industry is a 
significant issue with us. We're anxious to talk to Ford about what 
their plans are.''

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Quit FDA Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental and public interest groups on  
Tuesday quit an advisory panel on food safety, created at the 
behest of Vice President Al Gore, charging the administration is 
failing to take steps to remove pesticides that pose a special 
danger to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-member advisory panel was created to get a broad spectrum  
of views as the Environmental Protection Agency decides how to 
proceed in eliminating hundreds of pesticides as required by a 1996 
food safety law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel has been embroiled in internal disagreements among  
its members, who represented a range of interests that included 
environmentalists, health safety advocates, farmers and 
representatives of the chemical industry and agribusiness. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the EPA, the groups said they were quitting the  
panel because the agency was unwilling ``to make hard choices'' 
needed to take the most dangerous pesticides out of service even 
though they pose a threat to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``EPA's indecision on these high-risk chemicals leaves everyone  
-- kids, farmers, farm workers, food processors, consumers and our 
precious biodiversity -- vulnerable,'' the groups complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Olson, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said,  
``The pesticide industry and agribusiness lobbyists and their 
allies in Congress have hijacked this process,'' and the Clinton 
administration ``has let it derail'' through delays and inaction. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to NRDC, other groups that quit the panel Tuesday  
were the World Wildlife Fund, Consumers Union, Pesticide Education 
Center, Farmworker Justice Fund, National Campaign for Pesticide 
Policy Reform, and the Farmworkers Support Committee. Last year the 
Environmental Working Group withdrew from the advisory group in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy EPA Administrator Peter Robertson, in a letter to the  
seven groups, said the agency remained ``absolutely committed'' to 
assessing the dangers posed by some pesticides and removing from 
the market those chemicals that pose a particular danger to 
children as required by the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We too wish that this process could go faster,'' wrote  
Robertson. ``But we are on schedule for assessing risks and taking 
risk-reduction actions beginning in August as the law prescribes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the environmentalists complained that the EPA and  
Agriculture Department are not moving quickly enough to remove the 
pesticides, including some widely used organophosphates, that pose 
the most critical health risks to infants and children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Food Quality Protection Act for the first time required  
the EPA to consider the unique dangers the chemicals pose to 
infants and children. It said the EPA should reassess the first 
batch of these chemicals by this August. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA ``now has admitted it will not meet the August  
deadline,'' the environmentalists said. They blamed the slow 
progress, in part, to ``endless debate'' within the advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore urged creation of the advisory panel last year after  
concerns were raised by agriculture interests and their advocates 
in Congress that the EPA was not taking into account farmers' 
views. Farm groups argued that many of the pesticides being 
targeted are essential and do not yet have adequate substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics at the time said Gore's involvement stemmed from concern  
that elimination of some of the pesticides could cause Gore 
political problems in states such as Iowa, Florida, Texas and 
California -- all key in Gore's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president said the broad representation on the advisory  
group would ensure sound science was used in implementing the 1996 
food safety law.

<HEADLINE> Park Place To Buy Caesars' Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- One of the most famous names in the  
hotel-casino industry is changing ownership, ending months of high 
stakes negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place Entertainment Corp. announced Tuesday it plans to  
purchase Caesars resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Lake Tahoe 
from Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide, Inc. for $3 billion in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the cream asset in gaming,'' Arthur Goldberg,  
president and chief executive officer of Park Place, said in a 
telephone news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale does not include the Desert Inn hotel-casino here, part  
of the Caesars World Inc. empire that has been on the market for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ends a 10-figure financial tug-of-war between two  
gambling titans -- Park Place and Mirage Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Park Place shares soared nearly 25 percent, while  
Starwood and Mirage lost ground on New York Stock Exchange. Park 
Place rose $2.25 to close at $11.37 1/2 a share, Starwood was off 68 3/4 
cents at $34.31 1/4 and Mirage was down 25 cents at $23.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase has been approved by the boards of both companies  
and is expected to be completed by year's end. It would give Park 
Place interests in 29 gambling properties with 28,000 rooms 
worldwide, 12,000 of them in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to owning one out of every 10 hotel rooms in Las  
Vegas, the purchase would give Park Place ownership of three of the 
four major hotels on the busiest intersection of the Las Vegas 
Strip -- the Flamingo Hilton, Bally's Las Vegas and Caesars. Park 
Place also plans to open French-themed Paris-Las Vegas, a 
2,900-room hotel next to Bally's in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase also would give Park Place prime land for future  
development on the Las Vegas Strip and the Atlantic City Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place owns two Atlantic City hotel casinos.  
</P>
<P>
	Its New Jersey flagship is the 1,263-room Bally's Park Place  
Casino Hotel, located at the famous intersection of Boardwalk and 
Park Place. Bally's Park Place is consistently the city's most 
profitable casino property. The Atlantic City Hilton has 805 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, which added a 620-room hotel  
tower last year, has 1,114 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said the sale provides ``significant benefits for both  
companies.'' He said Park Place obtains ``an internationally 
recognized brand name and a portfolio of premier gaming assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, Goldberg said, ``provides strategic assets, it should  
be accretive to earnings in the first year, and it has potential 
for future growth opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood Chairman Barry Sternlicht has made no secret of the  
fact he was uncomfortable with the volatility of the gambling 
industry. He orchestrated Starwood's purchase of ITT Corporation in 
February 1998. ITT's assets included the Caesars properties, one of 
the premier names in the gambling industry. Hilton lost out to 
Starwood in that bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said there is a possibility that Las Vegas-based Park  
Place might change its name, or the name of some of its other 
properties, to take advantage of the Caesars marque. 
</P>
<P>
	``By acquiring the Caesars' brand name and related customer  
database, we plan to heavily cross-market between our destination 
resorts,'' said Goldberg. ``This will boost revenues and expand the 
markets where we operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Caesars source who requested anonymity said Goldberg had  
indicated Park Place would provide an infusion of cash for projects 
including expansion of the Forum Shops at Caesars, an elegant 
shopping complex, and renovation of the front of the flagship 
Caesars Palace. There were also indications Park Place might 
proceed with a 700-room tower that was part of ITT's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The opulent Caesars Palace opened in August 1966, adding a new  
level of luxury on the fledgling Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternlicht had been negotiating the sale of the Caesars  
properties for months, concerned about the volatility of the 
high-stakes gambling for which the resorts are famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Dexter Wood, hospitality and leisure consultant for  
PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York, said the sale would allow 
Sternlicht to pay down debt taken on in the ITT purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also allow Starwood to focus on its hotel business,  
which includes the Sheraton, Westin and St. Regis/Luxury Collection 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said the recent entry of Mirage into the Caesars selloff  
played a role in pushing the Park Place deal to completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mirage helped bring it to a close a little quicker,'' Wood  
said. ``Mirage came in and there was more of a threat of a bidding 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirage may have quickened the pace and pushed the price a little  
higher, Wood said.

<HEADLINE> Income Growth Outpaces Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes climbed 4.4 percent in  
1998, significantly outpacing inflation. In every state, per capita 
incomes grew faster than prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It translates directly into buying power,'' said Steve  
Cochrane, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. ``We've seen really strong consumer spending over the 
last year ... and these figures tell us why: There's money out 
there to spend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, average income for America's 270.3 million people  
last year was $26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, the Commerce 
Department said Tuesday. The figures include not only wages and 
salaries, but other sources of income such as investment earnings 
and government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That per capita income growth was actually a bit slower than the  
4.7 percent increase in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inflation rate -- as measured by the government's price  
index for personal consumption expenditures -- declined from 2 
percent in 1997 to 0.8 percent last year. Factoring that in, 
Americans' buying power -- per capita income growth after inflation 
-- jumped 3.6 percent in 1998 compared with 2.7 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By state, per capita incomes in 1998 ranged from $37,598 in  
Connecticut to $18,958 in Mississippi. Growth rates in per capita 
income ranged from 7.8 percent in North Dakota, where farmers hurt 
by falling international commodity prices got relief payments from 
the government, to 2.1 percent in Hawaii, where tourism has fallen 
off because of economic troubles in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	After North Dakota, the states with the fastest per capita  
income growth rates were Colorado, 6.1 percent; Washington, 5.7 
percent; Texas, 5.3 percent; and Vermont and Massachusetts, 5.0 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Hawaii, other states with relatively slow per capita  
income growth last year included Wyoming, 2.5 percent; Nevada and 
Montana, 2.6 percent; and Alaska, 2.8 percent. Nevada has 
experienced strong economic growth in recent years, but the effects 
on its per capita income have been diluted by simultaneous rapid 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased earnings from service-sector jobs -- especially in  
finance and real estate -- was the driving force behind high per 
capita income growth in many states. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, for example, ``is really the capital of the  
mutual fund industry, and with the stock market going gangbusters, 
income generated from that industry is really very strong,'' said 
Cochrane. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Colorado is increasingly a service center where  
financial, real estate and insurance companies are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states like Texas and Washington have seen growth in  
relatively high-paying technical jobs, such as in the computer and 
telecommunications industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, unemployment is near a 29-year low, and brisk  
spending by Americans has been largely responsible for keeping the 
U.S. economy growing while other countries have been hurt by a 
global economic downturn that started two years ago in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	States heavily dependent on farming -- such as North Dakota --  
have been among those feeling the worst effects of the 
international crisis that has pulled down U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farming states' per capita income growth was  
pushed to among the best in the nation by billions of dollars in 
relief payments Congress and President Clinton approved late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	No such relief came for Hawaii, where tourism from Asia has  
declined dramatically, also pulling down retail sales in the island 
state.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a key indicator of future  
economic activity, rose for the sixth straight month in April, the 
Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are showing no signs of pessimism and no signs of  
curbing their strong spending habits,'' said Lynn Franco, associate 
director of the board's Consumer Research Center. ``They will 
continue to contribute significantly to this record-breaking 
economic expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business-financed study group reported its consumer  
confidence index rose nearly a full point to 134.9 from a revised 
134 in March, a stronger performance than Wall Street analysts had 
expected. An index designed to measure consumer expectations for 
the next six to nine months had an even bigger increase, rising to 
108 from 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	James Annable, chief economist at BankOne Corp. in Chicago, said  
the surge in consumer confidence, and the robust economy, can be 
attributed to an increase in real wages over the past year that has 
lifted consumers' mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this economy of low unemployment and low inflation, toss  
in the Asian crisis which created cheap imports, we're generating 
real wage growth faster than we've seen in a generation,'' he said. 
``Nothing makes people feel better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, real wages grew by  
a paltry half percent a year, Annable said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, by our measure, they grew by 3.5 percent. That's a  
sevenfold increase,'' he said, adding that he expects real wages to 
continue to their strong climb throughout this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic strength, the National Association  
of Realtors reported today that sales of existing single-family 
homes rose to a record high in March. The annual rate of 5.05 
million units in March, up from February's 5.02 million rate, broke 
the previous high of 5.04 million set in January. The figures are 
adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
	The record sales pace at the outset of 1999 follows an  
unprecedented year of 4.78 million existing home sales in 1998. 
March was the fourth consecutive month that the sales rate topped 5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability  
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping 
the market incredibly strong,'' said Sharon A. Millett, president 
of the real estate group. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had anticipated the consumer confidence figure would  
remain flat in April. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the index continued its steady rise begun with the  
rebound of the stock market from last fall's sharp downturn. It has 
gained 15 points since October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell below 7,500 in  
early October of last year and also has rebounded smartly, trading 
today in record territory and flirting with 10,800. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Hits Asia, Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Chernobyl computer virus struck hundreds of thousands of  
computers in Asia and the Middle East, with Turkey and South Korea 
each reporting 300,000 computers infected. Home users in the United 
States, including college students nearing term-paper deadlines, 
also were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, which is believed to have originated in Taiwan and  
attacks Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers, was designed to strike 
on April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 
and the reason for the virus' common name: Chernobyl. In affected 
computers, the virus attempts to erase the hard-drive and write 
gibberish into the computer's system settings, called its BIOS, 
which would prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Pollak, a spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response  
Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said today a 
``large number'' of home users were affected in the United States 
after people returned home Monday night and turned on their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to estimate how many computers were affected, but  
said CERT received many e-mail reports on the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Schrader, director of product marketing at Trend Micro Inc.,  
which develops antivirus software, said he had received about 150 
reports by Monday night, but only two were corporate clients. The 
rest were panicked home users and students. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 computers belonging to Princeton students were wiped  
out, less than two weeks before term papers were due, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives  
were rendered useless,'' spokesman Justin Harmon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest damage was Asia and the Middle East, where virus  
protection isn't considered as important and there is a large pool 
of pirated software, said Dan Takata, senior engineer at Data 
Fellows, a software company that develops the F-Secure Antivirus 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus infected some computers at an airport in Izmir, on  
Turkey's Aegean coast; erased computer memories at a military 
academy in Ankara; crashed computers at the state-run radio and 
television station; and slowed down transactions at a number of 
banks, Turkey's Radikal newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turkey was caught unprepared,'' said Mustafa Ucoklar, an  
electronics engineer. ``The warnings were there but nobody took any 
notice of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials also reported about 300,000 computers  
were hit in government offices, schools and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this  
virus,'' said Vice Information and Communications Minister Ahn 
Byung-yop. ``We need to strengthen our alert system and public 
education on computer viruses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahn estimated the computer bug has hit nearly 4 percent of  
computers in South Korea, by far the worst attack of its kind 
reported in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The national Yonhap News Agency, quoting industry officials,  
estimated the virus may have affected up to 15 percent of all 
computers and could cost South Korea up to $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past two days, we had 2,500 calls for help,'' said  
Hwang Mi-kyong, a spokeswoman for Ahn's Laboratory Ltd., which 
develops programs that can detect and wipe out computer viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company usually receives 200 calls a day for help, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of computers in the United Arab Emirates were affected,  
including some at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the 
English-language Khaleej Times reported. The Gulf News daily 
reported that up to 10 percent of all computer users in the 
Emirates were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, banks and publishing houses in India were shut down  
Monday and information worth millions of dollars was lost, the 
Indian Express newspaper reported. At least 10,000 Indian computer 
owners reported being affected by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangladesh, the virus struck at least 10,000 computers.  
``This was the country's worst computer disaster,'' Ahmed Hasan, 
general secretary of the Computer Society, said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 7,600 computers were damaged by the virus in China,  
state-run media reported. Liu Xu, General Manager of Beijing-based 
Ruixin Company, China's biggest antivirus hi-tech company, 
estimated that 100,000 computers had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our telephones have been busy since yesterday, jammed  
by computer users from various sectors and all the provinces,'' Liu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 computers in Norway were affected, according to the  
Aftenposten daily newspaper. ``This is definitely the worst virus 
attack ever,'' said Jan Kristensen, director of Norman ASA, 
Norway's largest virus-fighting company.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines Dominate Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six network newsmagazines, all of them with  
reports on the Colorado school massacre, were among the 12 
top-rated prime-time shows measured by Nielsen Media Research 
during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazines responded quickly with stories on the  
Littleton shooting and viewers apparently couldn't get enough. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``20/20'' on Wednesday had more viewers than any other  
newsmagazine, and had its highest ratings of the year except for 
the Monica Lewinsky interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, CBS's ``48 Hours'' on Thursday beat NBC's  
``ER'' in the ratings, although the medical drama was a rerun. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, viewership was down for the networks as they geared up  
for the May ratings ``sweeps'' period. CBS won the week with an 8.4 
rating and 14 share, NBC was second with an 8.1 rating and 14 
share, ABC had a 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.1 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular show of the week was a new episode of NBC's  
comedy, ``Friends.'' ABC's drama, ``The Practice,'' had its second 
highest rating in the history of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' did well during a busy news week, scoring  
its largest margin of victory over the ``CBS Evening News'' in more 
than two years. NBC had an 8.2 rating and 18 share, while CBS was 
at 6.5 and 14. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with a 7.9 
rating and 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 19-25, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.4; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 
12.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and 
Order,'' NBC, 11.8; ``Dateline NBC-Friday,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Dateline 
NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 11.6; ``48 Hours,'' CBS, 11.0.

<HEADLINE>  New Monarch Crowned in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUMASI, Ghana (AP) -- Thousands of Ashanti people crowded the  
Manhyia palace grounds in pouring rain today as tribal drums 
proclaimed the new ruler of the Ashanti kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, a London-trained accountant, sat three  
times on a golden stool shortly before 3 a.m., marking the final 
rite in more than 16 hours of intricate ceremonies to pass the 
royal seat of the Ashanti kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in bright-colored kente cloth, the king set out Monday  
morning from his palace in Kumasi, the royal seat of the Ashanti 
kingdom, with 20 men in black waist-cloths holding aloft his sedan 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried him to the small, royal neighborhood of Pampaso,  
for a series of secret rites that ended with his ``enstoolment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to tradition, the king, who changed into black  
mourning cloth and a leather cap early today, sat three times on 
the Golden Stool, a small, solid-gold seat believed to embody the 
soul of the Ashanti nation, which makes up about 40 percent of 
Ghana's population. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 Ashanti chiefs then paid allegiance one by one to  
the newly crowned king. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at least 40,000 jammed the Kumasi stadium to watch on a  
sweltering day as the 49-year-old king, covered in a heavy smock 
adorned with leather charms and amulets, fired three shots with a 
musket -- proving his ability to command and lead the Ashanti 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds followed the royal entourage of incense-bearers and  
drummers through pouring rain until they officially had a new king 
after the Feb. 25 death of 79-year-old Opoku Ware II, who had ruled 
the kingdom for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Ashanti king has no power under the constitution, he  
still wields great influence in this West African nation's 
political and business worlds, and his approval is needed for 
several political appointments in the Kumasi region. 
</P>
<P>
	The coronation comes a day after the new king was given his  
royal name, leaving his former name, Barima Nana Kwaku Dua, behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a once-in-a-lifetime happening. It's a landmark in  
Ashanti history. I know this new king will do a lot to change the 
destiny of the Ashanti people,'' said Nana Osei Banahene I, an 
Ashanti chief watching the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new king's coronation comes at a sensitive time in Ashanti  
history, as one of the wealthiest and best-known African royal 
families struggles to find its place in the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
	While recent Ashanti kings have been modern men -- businessmen  
who manage the royal families' myriad companies -- the families' 
position and role is also changing. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle for tradition came to a head in February when the  
former king's death was announced on state radio just a few days 
after he died -- a serious breach of protocol. In times past, the 
king's death has remained an official secret for weeks, or even 
months, until the new king was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern Ashanti state was born in the 1600s but by 1800 had  
grown well beyond the borders of present-day Ghana. Today, the 
Ashanti king still holds great power over traditional chiefs in 
parts of neighboring Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The visual culture of the Ashanti -- kente and adinkra cloth,  
gold weights and graceful wooden stools -- have become synonymous in 
the West with traditional Africa.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. reported today its profit rose 39  
percent in the first quarter, excluding one-time charges, beating 
Wall Street forecasts as revenue from cellular phone, corporate 
phone and other services more than offset a further decline in its 
flagship long-distance business. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's profit of $1.72 billion, or 61 cents a share, included  
the impact of the company's acquisition of the Tele-Communications 
Inc. cable-TV company, which was completed March 9, three weeks 
before the quarter's end. That was up from a profit of $1.24 
billion, or 46 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected AT&AMP;T to earn 57  
cents a share in the three months ended March 31. AT&AMP;T stock was up 
75 cents at $53.68 3/4 in early afternoon trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its revenue rose 9.9 percent to $14.10 billion from  
$12.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While TCI's sales added to AT&AMP;T's totals, the nation's largest  
telecommunications company also was buoyed by big revenue increases 
in several existing businesses. AT&AMP;T said sales from its cellular 
phone service grew 40 percent, its telecommunications management 
business grew 69 percent and its corporate phone services grew 7.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue increases more than offset a 3.4 percent drop in  
sales from the company's huge consumer long-distance services. 
AT&AMP;T's biggest business has suffered from a long-term decline amid 
competition from a slew of large and upstart rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time charges excluded in today's results are tied to  
AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI and other deals. Also excluded is Liberty 
Media, the TCI programming arm acquired by AT&AMP;T in the TCI 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also benefited from lower costs resulting from a reduction  
of 18,000 jobs last year and lower network connection costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus on execution is working,'' AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael  
Armstrong said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The results come after a spree of acquisitions and other deals  
led by Armstrong as he reshapes Ma Bell, the nation's largest 
long-distance company, into a diversified telecommunications 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its TCI acquisition, AT&AMP;T announced this morning  
a partnership with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's dominant 
telephone company, to manage communications networks for 
multinational companies. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T earlier this week said it will join British  
Telecommunications PLC in buying a combined 30 percent stake in 
Japan Telecom Co., Japan's third-largest long-distance and 
international carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T offered $58 billion last week to buy MediaOne, the  
fourth-largest U.S. cable TV operator, in an attempt to thwart a 
merger agreement between MediaOne and No. 3 cable company Comcast 
reached last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T agreed to merge its Canadian operations with  
MetroNet Communications Corp., a local Canadian phone service 
supplier to businesses.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Earnings Up on MTV Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. reported a nearly 42 percent  
increase in first-quarter income due to strong advertising sales at 
MTV Networks and video sales at Blockbuster stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The media company reported earnings from continuing operations  
of $68 million, or 8 cents a share, up from $48 million, or 5 cents 
per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped analysts' expectations of 6 cents per share,  
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom reported its earnings in the latest quarter were reduced  
by a one-time charge of $23.5 million for the early retirement of 
debt. Net income, which reflects one-time items, totaled $44.9 
million, or 5 cents per share, up from from $1.4 million, or a loss 
of 2 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings before interest, taxes and other non-operating items --  
a common performance measure for media and entertainment companies 
-- rose 3 percent to $474.6 million from $460.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall revenue rose to $2.95 billion, from $2.69 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at Viacom's network division rose 34 percent to $202  
million, due mainly to higher advertising revenues at MTV and VH1. 
Both music television networks experienced double-digit growth in 
advertising sales in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's entertainment division earned $163 million in the  
quarter, down 6 percent compared with the first quarter of 1998, 
when the company was reaping profits from the blockbuster movie 
``Titanic.'' The strongest offering from Viacom's Paramount 
Pictures in this year's first quarter was ``Varsity Blues,'' a 
modest hit among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's video business, led by Blockbuster stores, had a 13  
percent decrease in earnings as the parent company launched a major 
advertising campaign in an effort to boost its market share. 
Revenues, however, rose 20 percent to $1.1 billion. Viacom said 
same-store sales, which measure sales at outlets open for at least 
a year, rose 17 percent worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishing business posted a 30 percent increase in earnings  
due to strong sales in the Pocket Books and children's divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom said its revenues from online businesses more than  
doubled, to $4.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Guards Hurt in Texas Prison Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Two inmates at a state prison mental  
hospital attacked two guards and took a nurse hostage Tuesday, 
releasing her unharmed and surrendering nine hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted robber Julius E. Grulkey, 27, and convicted killer  
Curtis Joseph Robertson, 23, had demanded to see the personal 
effects they brought into prison. Once they released Cynthia Jobe, 
they were allowed to see them. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen Castlebury  
said they did not indicate why they wanted to see their belongings, 
which are kept by prison officials until inmates are released. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one correctional officer was moving two of the inmates,  
and they attacked him and cut him,'' Castlebury said. ``Another 
officer came to his aid and the two overpowered the second officer. 
That's when they grabbed the nurse and took her hostage in a file 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guards were treated at a hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> Scope of Disability Law Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices expressed confusion  
Tuesday over whether a federal law that protects the disabled from 
discrimination applies to people with correctable conditions such 
as poor eyesight or high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it then necessary to say everyone who wears false teeth or  
eyeglasses is also disabled?'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked the 
lawyer for a Kansas man who was fired from his mechanic's job 
because of high blood pressure. ``Is there a way of drawing the 
line?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Stephen R. McAllister asked the justices to let Vaughn  
Murphy sue United Parcel Service under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, a 1990 law best known for requiring 
handicap-access ramps in public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains that UPS fired him solely because of high  
blood pressure,'' McAllister said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS' attorney, William J. Kilberg, said Murphy was not protected  
by the law because he can bring his blood pressure down with 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of his medication, he does not suffer  
limitations,'' Kilberg said. ``His personal physician so 
testified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts have disagreed over how far the disability law's  
protections extend. The justices will consider the issue again 
Wednesday, hearing arguments in two cases involving an Oregon truck 
driver blind in one eye and two nearsighted women who 
unsuccessfully applied to be pilots for United Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA bars employers from discriminating against a ``qualified  
individual with a disability'' because of that disability. A 
qualified person is defined as one who can perform a job when given 
reasonable accommodation, and a disability is defined as a 
condition that substantially limits a major life activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA also protects people who are ``regarded as'' having a  
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy went to work for United Parcel Service in Topeka, Kan.,  
in 1994 as a mechanic. Because UPS mechanics conduct road tests on 
trucks, the company required them to have commercial drivers' 
licenses and health certification from the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy got DOT approval, but shortly afterward a UPS nurse  
reviewed his file and found that his lifelong high blood pressure 
exceeded a federal standard. UPS decided his health approval was 
issued in error and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued UPS, but lower courts ruled against his lawsuit, saying  
he was not disabled because his blood pressure could be treated 
with medication. 
</P>
<P>
	If someone's disability must be judged without considering  
corrective measures, Justice Antonin Scalia said, ``I am disabled 
in a major life function'' because of the need of glasses to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't square with what Congress seems to be talking  
about,'' Scalia added. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer James A. Feldman, arguing in Murphy's  
support, said Congress intended the disability law to protect him 
and others whose disabilities can be treated, such as people with 
epilepsy or diabetes. However, he said lower courts incorrectly 
have ruled that the ability to treat such conditions with 
medication means they are not disabilities under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested such people still could be  
protected by the law because they were ``regarded as'' being 
disabled. ``The scheme works,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilberg said UPS did not act on ``myth or stereotype'' about the  
disabled but relied on a government health standard. He noted that 
Murphy got another mechanic's job that did not require health 
certification after he was fired by UPS. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia asked if that meant a company could refuse to hire  
someone with asthma because that person could get a job somewhere 
else. When Kilberg said yes, Scalia's response was ``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, 97-1992.

<HEADLINE> Dole Raises $500,000 for 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole picked up $500,000 and the  
endorsement of former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the 
first fund-raiser of her presidential campaign Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The modest total failed to dampen speculation about her ability  
to compete with George W. Bush's cash-grabbing machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor, by contrast, sopped up nearly $300,000 a day  
in the first 28 days of his campaign -- never bothering with 
expensive, time-consuming fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's starting slow,'' said Bruce Buchanan, political science  
professor at the University of Texas. ``If she's not able to raise 
sizable chunks of money to come within one-half or one-third of 
what George W. Bush has raised, people might start raising 
questions about her viability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questions are already being raised, even among Dole  
supporters. But the former American Red Cross president plans to 
answer them with more than a dozen fund-raisers in the next two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to put it in context,'' Mrs. Dole said in an  
interview before the evening fund-raiser that also featured her 
husband, 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. ``I worked on a nonpartisan job 
at the Red Cross and wasn't allowed to fund-raise. When you're in a 
position to have a turnkey operation, a campaign in waiting, you 
have an advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was referring to Bush, who raised $7.6 million in the first  
quarter of 1999 from his Texas network and allies of his father, 
former President Bush. Mrs. Dole, courting the same moderate GOP 
base, raised $685,000 in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her weak first-quarter showing belied Mrs. Dole's strength in  
public opinion polls, most of which put her comfortably in second 
place behind Bush. Other GOP hopefuls, including some who have 
raised more money, trail Mrs. Dole in the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	``People know me. That gives me a huge financial advantage,''  
Mrs. Dole said. ``Other candidates who don't have that name 
recognition and the support that seems to be out there for me would 
have to spend a minimum of $10 million to $15 million just to 
achieve that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's fund-raiser came amid signs that Mrs. Dole's campaign  
is finally getting its footing after a sluggish start. She has 
carefully laid out her positions on abortion and the Kosovo crisis, 
avoiding the scale of criticism heaped on Bush after he addressed 
those issues. And she drew large crowds last weekend for her first 
major swing through Iowa, unveiling an impressive list of party 
supporters in the early-voting state. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick adds weight to Mrs. Dole's foreign policy portfolio  
and comes with a political bonus: Like Dole, Kirkpatrick is a 
former member of President Reagan's Cabinet. Bush is trying to 
corner the market on former Reagan advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She helped win the Cold War, and now she's going to help me  
win my battle for the presidency,'' Dole said at the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick praised Dole as a Reagan-style Republican who would  
move immediately to improve the nation's security and build on the 
former president's foreign policy successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a very good foreign policy adviser in her husband, Bob  
Dole,'' Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senate majority leader lingered in the back of the  
room as his wife basked in the Kirkpatrick endorsement. He said 
later he plans to help his wife raise money but other than that 
would do ``whatever she asks me to do'' to help her campaign. ``She 
has to establish her own campaign,'' said Dole, who has rarely 
appeared publicly with his wife since she entered the presidential 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Mrs. Dole strolled through the crowd in her trademark  
fashion and said she recognized dozens of faces from her 30-plus 
years of public service. She called the fund-raiser ``a great 
reunion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 people attended the event, many of whom were staff or  
volunteers who did not pay to attend. Aides said some of the 
$500,000 was donated by people who did not show up. The money also 
included some that was donated weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your typical Washington crowd,'' said her spokesman  
Ari Fleischer. ``Most of the Washington crowd is already sowed up'' 
by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Mrs. Dole refused to set a fund-raising goal, a senior  
adviser said she needs to collect at least $5 million in the second 
quarter of 1999 to maintain momentum. The adviser conceded 
Tuesday's showing was a slow start, but said future fund-raisers 
will produce bigger totals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole aides said Washington was not the best place to open the  
fund-raising season, because political professionals are 
traditionally reluctant to donate to campaigns.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pressured To Raise Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through gritted teeth, majority Republicans in  
Congress are struggling for the second time in four years with 
potentially unstoppable demands for an increase in the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm practical enough to know it's going to happen'' in the  
House, says Rep. Cass Ballenger, an ally of business who chairs a 
key subcommittee. ``Why wait till the ax falls?'' asks the North 
Carolina Republican, who promises that any measure will include tax 
breaks or changes in labor law designed as sweeteners to business 
groups that oppose a wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case three years ago, the ax is in the hands of  
minority Democrats as well as New York Rep. Jack Quinn and other 
moderate Republicans with ties to organized labor. They argue that 
the lowest-paid workers deserve a benefit from the longest 
expansion in American peacetime history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is prospering. The unemployment rate of 4.4  
percent is the lowest in almost three decades,'' Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., said recently. ``But millions of the country's 
hardest workers are not sharing in that prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sparring begins in earnest on Tuesday. A House committee has  
scheduled a hearing, and the invited witnesses are expected to 
testify that an increase in the minimum wage is not an effective 
way of helping workers in poverty, particularly heads of 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., complained Monday that  
the GOP had not invited any minimum wage earners to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hearing will be the first on the minimum wage since  
Republicans took control of the House in 1995. And the irony of a 
GOP Congress possibly approving its second wage increase in three 
years is not lost on organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's encouraging that the Republican leadership has  
learned from the 1996 experience not to wait to be bulldozed on 
this enormously popular public issue,'' said Peggy Taylor, top 
lobbyist for the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved legislation in 1996 providing for a 90-cent an  
hour increase phased in over two years, and at GOP insistence, 
attached a package of tax relief for small business. This time, 
Kennedy and Bonior, backed by the White House, are calling for a $1 
boost, to $6.15 an hour, over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballenger and other Republicans say a $1 increase may be  
possible, but perhaps spread over three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they have floated business-backed proposals such as  
full tax deductibility for the self-employed for health insurance, 
or a cut in the federal unemployment tax. The National Restaurant 
Association also favors an increase in the deductibility of 
business meals from the current 50 percent to 80 percent. It also 
supports a permanent reauthorization of a federal tax credit 
designed to encourage employers to move unskilled workers into 
better jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond tax policies, business interests have an array of changes  
they'd like to see, ranging from the rules governing comp time to 
the application of the wage minimum to restaurant workers who 
depend on tips for a portion of their income. 
</P>
<P>
	Precisely how far they can push for labor law change is unclear,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the slim majority that we have on the Republican side we  
can't get too cute,'' says Quinn, although he predicts a wage 
increase will pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is murkier in the Senate, where opponents can  
launch a filibuster. ``I don't plan on letting it pass,'' the GOP 
whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous aides have predicted in recent days that the issue will  
be allowed to come to a vote this year in the House. Speaker Dennis 
Hastert said recently he didn't expect any vote ``in the coming 
weeks.'' But a top aide is keeping abreast of developments, and a 
fellow Illinois lawmaker, John Shimkus, has taken a prominent role 
in the behind-the-scenes discussions as leaders seek an alternative 
to Quinn's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn has called for a $1 increase over three years, with the  
minimum wage to rise with inflation thereafter. He's met recently 
with an aide to Hastert, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and 
representatives of concerned business groups, and says the idea of 
providing offsetting benefits for business is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimkus' proposal is likely to include some of the provisions  
sought by business -- a measure ``they will not fully oppose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business foes won't give up without a fight. The National  
Federation of Independent Business recently launched a grass-roots 
lobbying effort designed to sway 40 or 50 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the National Restaurant Association, Lee Culpepper argues  
that the last minimum wage increase coincided with a decline in job 
growth in eating and drinking establishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say there's any way to make an increase acceptable,''  
he said. ``But obviously if you take an increase and combine it 
with other changes that might be beneficial, then obviously we'd 
have to evaluate the whole package.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Torture in N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A man already accused of  
kidnapping and sexually torturing two women this year was charged 
with torturing a third woman in 1996, and his 31-year-old daughter 
was accused of taking part. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Jean ``Jesse'' Ray was arrested Monday at her father's  
mobile home and charged with kidnapping, criminal sexual 
penetration and assault, among other charges, FBI agent Doug Beldon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office filed an identical dozen charges  
against her father, David Parker Ray. He now faces 37 counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges involve a woman who told police she was abducted  
by Ms. Ray and her father in June 1996, and sexually assaulted with 
objects for at least three days. The court sealed affidavits about 
the new charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ray was held today in the Dona Ana County Jail on $1 million  
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, two women testified against Ray. They told a  
judge they were abducted, sodomized, shocked with electricity, 
sexually tortured and kept captive in padlocked collars in separate 
incidents in February and March. Ray pleaded innocent and was 
ordered to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59, a former mechanic at Elephant Butte State Park, and his  
girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, were arrested March 22 after an 
Albuquerque woman escaped and ran to a neighbor's home, naked 
except for a padlocked collar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, dozens of federal and state agents have combed Ray's  
mobile home in Elephant Butte, collecting more than 1,000 pieces of 
evidence, digging around the home and bringing in cadaver-sniffing 
dogs to roam the property. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has generated more than 100 leads involving as  
many as 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	All along, the FBI and state police have said they were seeking  
more victims and more suspects -- and potentially some murder 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defendant, Dennis Roy Yancy, is charged with murdering a  
woman who vanished two years ago from a bar in Elephant Butte, a 
lakeside resort 180 miles south of Albuquerque.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas was elected to  
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame today, just four days before the 
trainer tries to win his fourth Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 10 Triple Crown races, has compiled a  
staggering list of accomplishments, including nearly $200 million 
in purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old trainer has 518 graded stakes victories, which  
accounts for an amazing 7 percent of all graded stakes the past 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Russell Baze, who rode more than 400 winners for the  
seventh consecutive year in 1998, was also elected to the hall. 
Thoroughbreds elected were Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to be here,'' the 62-year-old Lukas said. ``But  
I don't think anybody gets here by themselves. What makes it 
significant is I know I didn't get here alone. I had some very good 
clientele that had extreme faith in me and backed it up with their 
bankroll and let me buy some of the best horses in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he'll send out Cat Thief and Charismatic as he  
attempts to become only the third trainer to win four or more 
Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, born in Antigo, Wis., won six consecutive Triple Crown  
races from 1994-1996 with four horses -- Tabasco Cat, Thunder Gulch, 
Timber Country and Grindstone. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Baze became the 12th rider to win 6,000 races; Exceller  
was voted in as contemporary male horse; Miesque in the 
contemporary female category; and Gun Bow as the horse of 
yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IAAF Strips Medal From Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney is approaching the bell lap in  
full stride. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest U.S. distance runner in track history, stripped of  
her silver medal from the 1997 world championships, is going ahead 
with a lawsuit against the sport's world governing body despite 
Monday's ruling by an arbitration panel that she failed a drug test 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they are protected over there, safe in their little  
cocoon,'' Slaney said, referring to the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation headquarters in Monte Carlo. ``They can take 
away whatever rights the athletes had. This has to be addressed, 
fought and changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer said he doubts the suit ever will go to trial because  
the IAAF would prefer a settlement rather than make public what he 
called a ``sham'' test for female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take the veil from over how they've been  
operating their doping program. We're going to find out what 
athletes they've investigated, which athletes they've let off and 
why, to show the whole thing is a sham,'' attorney Jim Coleman 
said. ``It's fraudulent, and we're going to prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and also names the U.S.  
Olympic Committee, which administered the test Slaney failed during 
the 1996 Olympic Trials. It was filed in U.S. District Court in 
Indianapolis, the home of USA Track &AMP; Field, the sport's national 
governing body, although USATF was not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
(testosterone-epitestosterone) test was attributable to 
pathological or physiological conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, claimed the indication of a high level of  
testosterone was due to birth control pills she was taking. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF executive director Craig Masback called the IAAF decision  
``a tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, she's one of the great athletes in the sport and a  
pioneer,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``T-E testing for women is not supported by scientific evidence  
... never mind for her particular test. I think it's unfortunate 
that the IAAF decided to pursue this case after we exonerated her. 
They should come up with a legal test, not pursue someone who is 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio normally is about 1-to-1, but a routine urine test  
showed Slaney had more than a 6-1 ratio, which the IAAF regarded as 
proof of doping. Testosterone is a natural hormone that increases 
muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was suspended from competition in 1997, then later  
reinstated by USATF. The IAAF, however, referred the case to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that this was where this was headed,'' Coleman  
said of the panel's ruling. ``They weren't interested in whether 
the test was valid. They were simply trying to find a way to get 
out of this mess they got themselves into. They decided the way to 
get out of it is to simply dump on Mary and try to save their 
tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Slaney, the runner's husband, added, ``According to the  
IAAF, you're guilty until you prove your innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters,  
is free to compete since the IAAF said she had retroactively 
completed her two-year ban in June 1998. But she loses the medal 
she won in 1997 at Paris in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them come and try to get the $20,000 (in prize money) that  
she won in Paris,'' Coleman said. ``They don't say they're going to 
ask for it back, but the order suggested they might. ... They'll 
never see the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney now joins other prominent names in track found guilty by  
the IAAF: Ben Johnson, Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe. Another 
high-profile case is pending. U.S. sprinter Dennis Mitchell is 
going to arbitration after testing positive for high testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said IAAF now will likely challenge the Indianapolis  
court's jurisdiction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we establish the court has jurisdiction, then basically  
they're going to be left out there exposed, and I think they will 
try to find a way to bring it to an end,'' Coleman said. ``And I 
think that one thing that will happen is that they will not use 
this test against women in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, they will have wasted all this time, when what  
they should have been doing is trying to find a way to prove when a 
female athlete has used testosterone,'' he said. ``Rather than 
doing that, they've been trying to find a way to save a test that 
doesn't work. And now ... it's probably going to call into question 
anything they come up with.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Leaves With Stiff Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens' bid to become the first  
AL pitcher to win 18 straight decision ended after two innings 
Tuesday night because of stiffness in his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees trailed the Texas Rangers 5-0 when Clemens  
did not come out to pitch the bottom of the third. He was replaced 
by Hideki Irabu, who was given all the time he needed to warm up 
because an injury forced the pitching change. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens looked out of synch throughout his brief stint. He threw  
53 pitches, only 29 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first out he recorded came on an RBI fielder's choice that  
put Texas ahead 3-0. The Rangers scored twice more before making 
another out, although it began a streak of five straight outs for 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens allowed five runs on four hits and two walks. He didn't  
have any strikeouts. Two starts before, he allowed seven runs in 
three innings and left trailing Baltimore 7-6 but the Yankees came 
back to win 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who last lost May 29 against Seattle, tied the AL win  
streak record of 17 in his previous start, which also was against 
Texas. The mark was first set by Cleveland's Johnny Allen in 
1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 1968-69. Carl 
Hubbell holds the major league record with 24, set for the New York 
Giants from 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first attempt to add this record to his milestone-filled  
career, Clemens bought 50 tickets for friends and relatives. The 
drama was heightened by the fact the game was in his home state and 
against the team that nearly acquired him in a trade in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But the native Texan wasn't welcomed home.  
</P>
<P>
	A near sellout crowd booed Clemens in pre-game introductions and  
again while he warmed up before the first inning. They booed for a 
third time when pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre visited the mound 
during the first inning, then fans gave the Rangers a standing 
ovation after the five-run first. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens had won his last six decision against Texas since April  
1, 1996, when he was with Boston. The Rangers were the losers in 
streak wins Nos. 8 and 17.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Election' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Think back a moment -- all the way to high school. There was  
always one of 'em: the overachiever obsessed with student 
government, the guy or girl who felt as if winning the student-body 
presidency would hand them the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Be assured: They were nothing compared to Tracy Flick.  
</P>
<P>
	Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is a highly motivated -- and  
dangerously cute -- student at George Washington Carver High in 
Omaha. She's the attractive female equivalent of Max in 
``Rushmore'' -- a joiner who wants so desperately to lead that she 
has become a sad caricature. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the kind of student that gets under Jim McAllister's skin.  
Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a schlumpy social studies 
teacher, doesn't like Tracy's ambition and gradually grows 
determined to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Tracy's election as student government president appears  
at hand, chiefly because she's unopposed (and still campaigning 
fiercely), McAllister gets involved. He recruits Paul Metzler 
(Chris Klein), a well-meaning jock, to run against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Things unravel from there. Paul's sister, Tammy (Jessica  
Campbell), gets involved in the election -- with the aim of 
abolishing student government. Romances and other entanglements 
make things complicated for both Tracy and Mr. McAllister. And 
``Election'' inches painfully toward its quietly harrowing 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed with unsettling block camerawork and peppered with  
narration from many characters, ``Election'' at first has the feel 
of a simple work. But don't let that fool you; it's a complex, deep 
tale. The narrative devices and filmmaking techniques that director 
Alexander Payne uses only add to the through-the-looking-glass 
feel: This appears to be a normal high school, but unsettling 
things are happening beneath the surface. And Mr. McAllister really 
shouldn't be turning over the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Great things are in store for Witherspoon, who is a joy to watch  
on camera. Her blatant ambition and insolence, illustrated by 
flaring nostrils, icy stares and the occasional facial tic, are 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Tracy is both despicable and pitiable, pushed by her mother  
like the political version of a teen-age figure-skating queen. When 
she falters, she cries into her stuffed animals and you feel guilty 
for ever thinking bad thoughts about her. 
</P>
<P>
	Broderick, so forgettable of late in ``Godzilla'' (where his  
best line was ``That's a lotta fish''), is much more effective 
here. He's better on a smaller, subtler canvas, and his flip-flop 
between sad-sackery and determination to do the right thing rings 
true. He also has the fashion and demeanor of the high-school 
teacher down perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, McAllister, through a sequence of events that  
perfectly match his transgressions, falls from grace and must begin 
a new life. This is the message of ``Election'': That wrongdoing 
done in the name of good is no better than plain, unbridled 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	And the road to that revelation is both entertaining and, in its  
Omaha ordinariness, quite frightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Election,'' a Paramount Pictures release, is co-written by  
Payne and Jim Taylor based on a novel by Tom Perrotta. The movie is 
rated R for profanity and sexual encounters.

<HEADLINE> Avs Return Home With 2-0 Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Home-ice advantage finally kicks in this week for  
the Colorado Avalanche, who find themselves in a favorable 
position: They lead San Jose 2-0 with the next three games at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable, but not unscalable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche postponed the first two games of the first-round  
NHL series last week out of respect for the shooting tragedy at a 
suburban Denver high school. They opened in San Jose, where they 
beat the Sharks 3-1 in Saturday's opener and 2-1 in overtime Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning home for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday -- and a  
Game 5 in Denver on Saturday if necessary -- the Avalanche are 
cognizant of the pitfalls of thinking this series is just about 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie right wing Milan Hejduk, whose goal at 7:53 of overtime  
gave Colorado the win Monday night, said, ``It's great to win two 
in a row and be back home. It's the best situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiser heads urged caution.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our attitude hasn't changed,'' goaltender Patrick Roy said  
Tuesday. ``We have to take every game at a time. We remember last 
year when we were up 3-1 in the first round (against Edmonton) and 
had two of our last three games at home. We lost them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``So Game 3 is a huge game for us. It's the only game that  
matters right now. I haven't heard anybody talking about not 
wanting to go back to San Jose (for Game 6). All I know is we have 
to win four games, and until we do the series is not over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado captain Joe Sakic insisted it is ``still going to be a  
tough series. They've got a gritty hockey club. We can't take 
anything for granted. We have to make sure we play our best hockey 
(Wednesday) night. We want to make sure we take a good hold of this 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Avalanche struggled at home during portions of the  
regular season, they finished the year going undefeated (8-0-2) in 
their last 10 home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough, going there and getting the win,''  
Sharks forward Vincent Damphousse said. ``It can be done and we 
have to do it. Hopefully we'll play three games there and be able 
to come back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added defenseman Mike Rathje, ``It sure isn't over.''  
</P>
<P>
	San Jose goalie Mike Vernon, who was brilliant in defeat Monday  
with 34 saves, said, ``We're not a team that gives up when faced 
with adversity. This type makes you stronger, builds character and 
makes you a better player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to steal two in their building. We need to score more  
and do more banging on the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche were uncertain how they would respond emotionally  
to their first game at McNichols Arena since the shooting tragedy 
last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it's going to be pretty emotional (Wednesday)  
night,'' Sakic said. ``We just have to make sure we focus on our 
job at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley said his team is a part of the  
community and continued to grieve while watching televised reports 
of the developments from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's still going on,'' he said, ``but (Wednesday)  
night when the puck drops, our focus will be on the game. We've 
said it before, we dedicate our playoff to Columbine High School, 
and part of paying respect to them is playing great hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado defenseman Alexei Gusarov, who sprained his left knee  
in a collision with teammate Theo Fleury in Game 1, likely will 
miss the rest of the series.

<HEADLINE> Jurisdiction in Liggett Suit Argued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Attorneys on Tuesday challenged an Alabama  
judge's jurisdiction over a proposed settlement of Liggett Group's 
tobacco litigation, saying he cannot possibly protect the interests 
of ``everyone in the United States'' who is covered by the 
class-action case. 
</P>
<P>
	``No class-action has ever been this broad,'' said Houston  
attorney Steve Baughman, representing Trial Lawyers for Public 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Baughman and other lawyers representing health-care providers  
and plaintiffs in pending tobacco cases in other states argued that 
Mobile County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kendall lacks jurisdiction 
over the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Liggett said the critics' arguments were without  
merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett attorney Marc Kasowitz of New York said the only place  
for Liggett to settle the current dispute is in this class-action 
case, which creates a limited fund to compensate injured smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Bagwell, an attorney for Blue Cross insurance, said  
Alabama law requires that objectors to the settlement be allowed to 
opt out of the settlement and file their own lawsuits against 
Liggett if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized Liggett's claim that it has financial  
difficulties. A financial representative from Liggett next week 
will give a deposition to the objectors' attorneys, who contend the 
company is better off than when it first proposed this limited-fund 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, who inherited the Liggett case from a retired judge,  
did not immediately rule on the jurisdiction question. He scheduled 
a hearing June 3 to determine the fairness of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Kendall agreed to allow attorneys for black  
smokers opposing the settlement to intervene with an argument that 
it could block future lawsuits by black smokers. Statistics have 
shown that blacks suffer higher rates of disease and death from 
lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an attorney for Indian tribes was granted a request  
to have the tribes excluded from the settlement. Attorney Rhett D. 
Klok of Alburquerque, N.M., argued that tribes should be treated as 
a foreign nation when it comes to this settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett first proposed the class-action settlement here two  
years ago, but the case was transferred to West Virginia, where it 
was rejected as overly ambitious by a federal judge. Plaintiffs' 
lawyers came back to state court in Alabama last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, Liggett would cooperate with  
plaintiffs and their attorneys in lawsuits brought against other 
tobacco companies. Liggett is the smallest of the five major 
tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett also would pay an amount equal to 7.5 percent of all its  
future sales into a fund that would be earmarked for compensating 
victims who have smoked its cigarettes, such as L&AMP;M, Lark and 
Chesterfield. If it fails to turn a profit in any given year -- and 
it hasn't posted net income for years -- the class is guaranteed $1 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett also pledged to refrain from using outdoor or Internet  
advertising and would comply with regulations aimed at preventing 
youths from smoking. The proposal would place limits on the amount 
of damages that Liggett Group would pay to people claiming harm 
from the company's cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 objections to the settlement have been filed, with each  
objection containing numerous parties. Blue Cross, for example, 
represents 44 separate Blue Cross insurance plans from around the 
country.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Torture in N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A man already accused of  
kidnapping and sexually torturing two women this year was charged 
with torturing a third woman in 1996, and his 31-year-old daughter 
was accused of taking part. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Jean ``Jesse'' Ray was arrested Monday at her father's  
mobile home and charged with kidnapping, criminal sexual 
penetration and assault, among other charges, FBI agent Doug Beldon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office filed an identical dozen charges  
against her father, David Parker Ray. He now faces 37 counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges involve a woman who told police she was abducted  
by Ms. Ray and her father in June 1996, and sexually assaulted with 
objects for at least three days. The court sealed affidavits about 
the new charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ray was held today in the Dona Ana County Jail on $1 million  
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, two women testified against Ray. They told a  
judge they were abducted, sodomized, shocked with electricity, 
sexually tortured and kept captive in padlocked collars in separate 
incidents in February and March. Ray pleaded innocent and was 
ordered to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59, a former mechanic at Elephant Butte State Park, and his  
girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, were arrested March 22 after an 
Albuquerque woman escaped and ran to a neighbor's home, naked 
except for a padlocked collar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, dozens of federal and state agents have combed Ray's  
mobile home in Elephant Butte, collecting more than 1,000 pieces of 
evidence, digging around the home and bringing in cadaver-sniffing 
dogs to roam the property. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has generated more than 100 leads involving as  
many as 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	All along, the FBI and state police have said they were seeking  
more victims and more suspects -- and potentially some murder 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defendant, Dennis Roy Yancy, is charged with murdering a  
woman who vanished two years ago from a bar in Elephant Butte, a 
lakeside resort 180 miles south of Albuquerque.

	Today is Wednesday, April 28, the 118th day of 1999. There are  
247 days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On April 28, 1945, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and his  
mistress, Clara Petacci, were executed by Italian partisans as they 
attempted to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1758, the fifth president of the United States, James Monroe,  
was born. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1788, Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the  
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1789, there was a mutiny on the Bounty as the crew of the  
British ship set Captain William Bligh and 18 sailors adrift in a 
launch in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, a six-man expedition sailed from Peru aboard a balsa  
wood raft named the Kon-Tiki on a 101-day journey to Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, Vice President Nixon and his wife, Pat, began a  
goodwill tour of Latin America that was marred by hostile mobs in 
Lima, Peru, and Caracas, Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali refused to be  
inducted into the Army, the same day General William C. 
Westmoreland told Congress the United States would ``prevail in 
Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, French President Charles de Gaulle resigned his office.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, a federal jury in New York acquitted former Attorney  
General John Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H. 
Stans of charges in connection with a secret $200,000 contribution 
to President Nixon's re-election campaign from financier Robert 
Vesco. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: President Bush announced the U.S. and Japan had  
concluded a deal on joint development of a new Japanese jet 
fighter, the FSX, despite concerns that U.S. technology secrets 
would be given away. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Former CIA official Aldrich Ames, who had  
betrayed U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union and then Russia, pleaded 
guilty to espionage and tax evasion, and was sentenced to life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: In a breakthrough for the government's tobacco  
investigation, cigarette maker Liggett &AMP; Myers agreed to tell 
prosecutors whether the industry had hidden evidence of health 
damage from smoking. The Senate opened a new round of hearings on 
alleged abuse and mismanagement at the Internal Revenue Service.

	``Breathing Tornados'' (Grand Royal) -- Ben Lee  
</P>
<P>
	He may no longer be the teen-ager who wowed the indie music  
scene in the mid-1990s, but Ben Lee still sounds years ahead of his 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aussie's third solo album, ``Breathing Tornados,'' is a  
strong set recorded almost entirely using synthesized sounds. The 
result is a kind of electronic folk pop. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee declares his independence in ``I Am a Sunflower'' with the  
lines, ``Today a boy outgrew his town/Today a boy became a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigarettes Will Kill You,'' the lead track, is infectious, a  
pessimistic ditty about a manipulative relationship. Its polar 
opposite is ``Birthday Song,'' a sweet love song (perhaps written 
for girlfriend Claire Danes?). 
</P>
<P>
	Not every tune works, but give this 20-year-old credit. As Lee  
enters adulthood, he's doing it with maturity.

	``Don't Haffi Dread'' (VP Records) -- Morgan Heritage  

</P>
<P>
	Ah, the sounds of summer. Reggae may never attract more than a  
small following in this country, but it sure sounds cool when the 
weather turns warm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't Haffi Dread'' by Morgan Heritage is both tropical and  
topical, with soulful tenor Peter Morgan singing the praises of 
Jah, freedom, equality and music. The message is positive and the 
groove mighty, providing a firm foundation for the group's catchy 
melodies, lilting horns and sweet background vocals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloodlines explain the captivating sound: Morgan Heritage  
includes five of reggae legend Denroy Morgan's 29 children. The 
youngsters, all in their 20s, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and 
Springfield, Mass., and songs like ``Smile'' and ``Don't Go'' 
reflect the influence of American radio. But most of the 18 tunes 
on ``Don't Haffi Dread'' are rooted in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	For folks who buy one reggae record a year, this is a good one  
to get. After all, as Peter Morgan sings on the lovely title cut: 
``You don't have to dread to be rasta.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott went home  
Monday from a hospital after three days of treatment for breathing 
problems blamed on allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old Schott had checked herself into Jewish Hospital  
on Friday, said spokeswoman Stephanie Savicki. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott underwent respiratory treatment for severe, seasonal  
pollen allergies, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott said last week she had reached a deal to sell most of her  
shares in the Reds, including the controlling shares, to limited 
partners Carl Lindner Jr., George Strike and William Reik for $67 
million. The deal still needs approval from team owners, which 
could come in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has been the Reds' controlling partner since December  
1984.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most Students Not Saving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While most high school and college students know  
it's important to save money, only about one out of two follow 
through, and many already are developing poor personal finance 
habits, according to a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming 94 percent of the 1,000 students surveyed said  
it is somewhat or very important for them to save money on a 
regular basis. But just 49 percent of the 16- to 22-year olds said 
they actually set aside some money whenever they receive an 
allowance or paycheck, according to the 1999 Youth and Money 
Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the poor habits found was the practice of letting finance  
charges grow on credit card purchases, rather than paying off bills 
when they come due. The survey reported that 28 percent of those 
students who have credit cards for which they are responsible said 
they carry a balance each month. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted in January and February, was sponsored by  
the American Savings Education Council, the Employee Benefit 
Research Institute and Mathew Greenwald &AMP; Associates Inc., a New 
York consulting firm. It has an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The council is a nonprofit group supported by investment  
companies as well as study groups such as the institute and 
organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the survey is to learn more about young people's  
attitudes about money and how to teach them to make better choices 
to ensure a sound financial future, said Dallas L. Salisbury, 
chairman of the American Savings Education Council, 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial habits developed when we're young, good or bad, can  
last a lifetime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salisbury said it is encouraging that students recognize the  
importance of money management. But, clearly they need to be 
spurred to follow through and get the information they need and to 
begin saving and investing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, who  
highlighted some of the survey results during a New York news 
conference, urged the media to give personal finance more prominent 
play in day-to-day coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling it a ``crusade'' against the nation's ``financial  
literacy crisis,'' he also announced a campaign for securities 
regulators to visit classrooms to enlighten students on the value 
of saving early and often. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few decades, we've seen a dramatic transformation  
in how and where Americans save and invest,'' Levitt said. ``At the 
same time, an unacceptably wide gap has been growing between 
financial knowledge and financial responsibilities. And that gap 
spells trouble for many Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other survey findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--While 18 percent of those polled rated their money management  
skills as good or very good, 27 percent said they do not view 
regular savings as a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only 23 percent make a budget and stick to it. Thirty percent  
make a budget, but do not always heed it, while 46 percent make no 
attempt at budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
	--Although two-thirds admit they should know more about managing  
money, only 34 percent of those with access to such courses, or 21 
percent of the overall group, took advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the effectiveness of such courses is questionable.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey found students in the group that took  
money-management courses no more likely than others to think saving 
regularly is important or to actually save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the tools available to help teach young people the value  
of savings, Levitt said, is the Alliance for Investor Education's 
online Savings Calculator, which, for example, will show how $75, 
if invested by a 13-year-old rather than spent on new sneakers, 
could grow to $4,000 by retirement age.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a key indicator of future  
economic activity, rose for the sixth straight month in April, the 
Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are showing no signs of pessimism and no signs of  
curbing their strong spending habits,'' said Lynn Franco, associate 
director of the board's Consumer Research Center. ``They will 
continue to contribute significantly to this record-breaking 
economic expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business-financed study group reported its consumer  
confidence index rose nearly a full point to 134.9 from a revised 
134 in March, a stronger performance than Wall Street analysts had 
expected. An index designed to measure consumer expectations for 
the next six to nine months had an even bigger increase, rising to 
108 from 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	James Annable, chief economist at BankOne Corp. in Chicago, said  
the surge in consumer confidence, and the robust economy, can be 
attributed to an increase in real wages over the past year that has 
lifted consumers' mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this economy of low unemployment and low inflation, toss  
in the Asian crisis which created cheap imports, we're generating 
real wage growth faster than we've seen in a generation,'' he said. 
``Nothing makes people feel better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, real wages grew by  
a paltry half percent a year, Annable said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, by our measure, they grew by 3.5 percent. That's a  
sevenfold increase,'' he said, adding that he expects real wages to 
continue to their strong climb throughout this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic strength, the National Association  
of Realtors reported today that sales of existing single-family 
homes rose to a record high in March. The annual rate of 5.05 
million units in March, up from February's 5.02 million rate, broke 
the previous high of 5.04 million set in January. The figures are 
adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
	The record sales pace at the outset of 1999 follows an  
unprecedented year of 4.78 million existing home sales in 1998. 
March was the fourth consecutive month that the sales rate topped 5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A combination of factors -- excellent housing affordability  
conditions and a strong desire by consumers to buy -- are keeping 
the market incredibly strong,'' said Sharon A. Millett, president 
of the real estate group. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had anticipated the consumer confidence figure would  
remain flat in April. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the index continued its steady rise begun with the  
rebound of the stock market from last fall's sharp downturn. It has 
gained 15 points since October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell below 7,500 in  
early October of last year and also has rebounded smartly, trading 
today in record territory and flirting with 10,800. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced Wednesday morning, buoyed  
by an earlier rally on Wall Street. The dollar was stronger against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average added 124.32 points, or 0.73 percent,  
to end the morning session at 17,081.59. On Tuesday, the average 
closed up 38.76 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.67 yen at midday, up 0.21 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.40 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors were encouraged by strength in  
New York, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 
113.12 points to 10,831.71 on Tuesday, topping its previous record 
finish of 10,727.18, set last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, high technology and bank issues were among the gainers  
in morning trading, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.72 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,359.14. The 
TOPIX closed up 6.58 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar's relative weakness  
from its levels late in New York on Tuesday followed dollar-selling 
by Japanese exporters and institutional investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 127.12 yen, up from  
127.02 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players remained on the sidelines ahead of Japan's ``Golden  
Week'' holidays. Japanese financial markets will be closed Thursday 
as well as Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.445  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price 
down to 103.12 yen from 103.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Election' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Think back a moment -- all the way to high school. There was  
always one of 'em: the overachiever obsessed with student 
government, the guy or girl who felt as if winning the student-body 
presidency would hand them the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Be assured: They were nothing compared to Tracy Flick.  
</P>
<P>
	Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is a highly motivated -- and  
dangerously cute -- student at George Washington Carver High in 
Omaha. She's the attractive female equivalent of Max in 
``Rushmore'' -- a joiner who wants so desperately to lead that she 
has become a sad caricature. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the kind of student that gets under Jim McAllister's skin.  
Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a schlumpy social studies 
teacher, doesn't like Tracy's ambition and gradually grows 
determined to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Tracy's election as student government president appears  
at hand, chiefly because she's unopposed (and still campaigning 
fiercely), McAllister gets involved. He recruits Paul Metzler 
(Chris Klein), a well-meaning jock, to run against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Things unravel from there. Paul's sister, Tammy (Jessica  
Campbell), gets involved in the election -- with the aim of 
abolishing student government. Romances and other entanglements 
make things complicated for both Tracy and Mr. McAllister. And 
``Election'' inches painfully toward its quietly harrowing 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed with unsettling block camerawork and peppered with  
narration from many characters, ``Election'' at first has the feel 
of a simple work. But don't let that fool you; it's a complex, deep 
tale. The narrative devices and filmmaking techniques that director 
Alexander Payne uses only add to the through-the-looking-glass 
feel: This appears to be a normal high school, but unsettling 
things are happening beneath the surface. And Mr. McAllister really 
shouldn't be turning over the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Great things are in store for Witherspoon, who is a joy to watch  
on camera. Her blatant ambition and insolence, illustrated by 
flaring nostrils, icy stares and the occasional facial tic, are 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Tracy is both despicable and pitiable, pushed by her mother  
like the political version of a teen-age figure-skating queen. When 
she falters, she cries into her stuffed animals and you feel guilty 
for ever thinking bad thoughts about her. 
</P>
<P>
	Broderick, so forgettable of late in ``Godzilla'' (where his  
best line was ``That's a lotta fish''), is much more effective 
here. He's better on a smaller, subtler canvas, and his flip-flop 
between sad-sackery and determination to do the right thing rings 
true. He also has the fashion and demeanor of the high-school 
teacher down perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, McAllister, through a sequence of events that  
perfectly match his transgressions, falls from grace and must begin 
a new life. This is the message of ``Election'': That wrongdoing 
done in the name of good is no better than plain, unbridled 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	And the road to that revelation is both entertaining and, in its  
Omaha ordinariness, quite frightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Election,'' a Paramount Pictures release, is co-written by  
Payne and Jim Taylor based on a novel by Tom Perrotta. The movie is 
rated R for profanity and sexual encounters.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade after the latest weather 
forecasts predicted more rain for a soggy Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans in particular were supported by the latest  
10-day forecast from the National Weather Service, which called for 
above-normal rainfall in major growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent heavy rains have caused farmers to fall behind the  
five-year average for completed fieldwork, and the window for 
timely planted of corn typically closes by the end of May. With the 
latest forecasts calling for additional rain, there is some 
optimism that predicted record acreage may not be realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were supported by reports of heavy rain over the  
weekend in Argentina, which may have damaged part of that country's 
competing crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures bounced higher amid anticipation the government  
will buy another batch of wheat for donation to needy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.65 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 1/4 cent sto $2.22 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.20 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 1/4 cents to $4.92 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .33 cent to 63.65 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 71.92 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .35 cent to 57.82 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .52 
cent to 55.60 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply amid forecasts for beneficial rains  
and moderate temperatures that should help the winter wheat crop in 
its late stages of growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans initially moved higher on the latest 10-day  
forecast from the National Weather Service, which called for 
above-normal rainfall in major growing regions. But prices quickly 
fell after private forecasters predicted only scattered rainfall in 
the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent heavy rains have caused farmers to fall behind the  
five-year average for completed fieldwork, and the window for 
timely planting of corn typically closes by the end of May.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Named to Racing Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas was elected to  
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame today, just four days before the 
trainer tries to win his fourth Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 10 Triple Crown races, has compiled a  
staggering list of accomplishments, including nearly $200 million 
in purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old trainer has 518 graded stakes victories, which  
accounts for an amazing 7 percent of all graded stakes the past 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Russell Baze, who rode more than 400 winners for the  
seventh consecutive year in 1998, was also elected to the hall. 
Thoroughbreds elected were Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to be here,'' the 62-year-old Lukas said. ``But  
I don't think anybody gets here by themselves. What makes it 
significant is I know I didn't get here alone. I had some very good 
clientele that had extreme faith in me and backed it up with their 
bankroll and let me buy some of the best horses in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he'll send out Cat Thief and Charismatic as he  
attempts to become only the third trainer to win four or more 
Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, born in Antigo, Wis., won six consecutive Triple Crown  
races from 1994-1996 with four horses -- Tabasco Cat, Thunder Gulch, 
Timber Country and Grindstone. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Baze became the 12th rider to win 6,000 races; Exceller  
was voted in as contemporary male horse; Miesque in the 
contemporary female category; and Gun Bow as the horse of 
yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, a panel of more than 180 turf writers, broadcasters  
and historians vote on candidates selected by the Hall of Fame 
nominating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are Aug. 9 at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., home  
of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Ducks' Kariya Out Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Paul Kariya is lost to the Anaheim Mighty  
Ducks indefinitely because of a broken right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials made the announcement several hours before the  
Mighty Ducks faced possible elimination Tuesday night in an opening 
round playoff series against two-time defending Stanley Cup 
champion Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks said Kariya was hurt when he blocked a shot with his  
foot in Sunday's 4-2 loss to the Red Wings, who entered Tuesday 
night's game leading the best-of-7 series 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya had one goal and three assists in the first three games  
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya was third in the NHL in points with 101 and third in  
assists with 62 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovering from a concussion that kept him out of most of the  
1998 season, Kariya played in all 82 games for the Ducks this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, in their only previous playoff appearance, the  
Ducks were eliminated by Detroit in four games.

<HEADLINE> Goodrich Says FTC OK'd Coltec Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- BFGoodrich Co. says it has Federal Trade  
Commission approval to proceed with the purchase of Coltec 
Industries, a maker of aircraft and industrial parts, for about $2 
billion in stock and debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now looking forward to completing the merger,''  
Goodrich chief executive David L. Burner said Monday in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich and Coltec first announced the deal in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich intends to move its corporate and aerospace  
headquarters from Richfield, in northeast Ohio's Summit County, to 
Charlotte, N.C., resulting in a loss of 170 jobs in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich,  
D-Ohio, have asked federal antitrust regulators to look again at 
the deal because of new information from AlliedSignal Corp., a 
Goodrich competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine, Kucinich and United Auto Workers official Warren Davis  
said the merger of Goodrich and Coltec could jeopardize 650 jobs at 
Goodrich's landing gear operations in Cleveland, as well as 
industry competition. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal, of Morris Township, N.J., has notified DeWine and  
Kucinich that it has offered to buy Goodrich's landing gear 
operation, formerly known as Cleveland Pneumatic Co., for a ``fair 
value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich did not respond to the offer, AlliedSignal chief  
executive Lawrence A. Bossidy said in a letter to Kucinich. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich spokesman Rob Jewell would not comment on any  
AlliedSignal offer or on the possibility that Goodrich could close 
its Cleveland landing gear plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, AlliedSignal sued to block Goodrich's acquisition of  
Coltec, claiming the deal would break a partnering agreement 
between AlliedSignal and Coltec, as well as U.S. antitrust laws. 
AlliedSignal makes aircraft brakes, as well as other aircraft 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane Co. of Stamford, Conn., had previously filed a similar  
lawsuit in New York, which was dismissed by district and appeals 
court judges. Crane has since joined AlliedSignal's lawsuit in 
Indiana district court.

<HEADLINE> Moon Signs 2-Year Deal With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Is Warren Moon ready to caddy for Elvis  
Grbac? Or have the Kansas City Chiefs guaranteed a quarterback 
controversy by signing one of the most prolific passers in NFL 
history to back up a guy who's been benched by both injury and 
ineffectiveness the past two years? 
</P>
<P>
	``Quarterback controversies only come when one guy doesn't do  
well and the other guy does well,'' the 42-year-old Moon said 
Tuesday after signing a two-year contract with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that doesn't happen, that's where I step in. But we really  
shouldn't even talk about controversy until it gets to some point 
like that. Right now, he's the guy. I think he's going to grasp the 
position and take control and go. I'm very confident (Grbac) is 
going to play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 15 seasons with Houston, Minnesota and Seattle, Moon has  
passed for 49,097 yards and 290 touchdowns. Before that, he passed 
for 21,228 yards and 144 touchdowns in six years with the Edmonton 
Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 16, 1990, in Kansas City, he passed for 527 yards -- 37  
yards short of the NFL's single-game record -- in leading Houston 
past the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon spent the past two years at Seattle as the designated  
backup and admits it's not easy being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. There's no question it's tough. I've been a  
starter all my life and I've been very successful all my life. But 
I'm at a point in my career where you have to take advantage of 
whatever there is for you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this is the best opportunity for me all around. There's  
going to be some point in the season where I'm going to get on the 
field. I just hope it's not because of an injury or something like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac, who will be 29 when the next season starts, missed 16  
games the past two seasons. He was benched last year during a 
six-game losing streak that led to a 7-9 record and kept the Chiefs 
out of the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Gannon, who played well when he came in for Grbac, became  
the favorite of most Chiefs fans and many players. But he signed a 
free-agent contract with Oakland when the Raiders offered to make 
him their starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can help (Grbac) get a little bit better,  
hopefully I can push him and take him to new heights,'' said Moon, 
who started 10 games for Seattle last year. ``If not, I'll be there 
to take over the slack. That's basically my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he was careful Tuesday to say all the right things.  
</P>
<P>
	``Elvis is the guy playing from the outset here,'' he said. ``In  
order for this football team to do well, I've got to support him 
just like everybody else does. Believe me, I'll be behind him and 
answer any question he might have. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if something happens where he's injured or doesn't play  
very well, then I'm there and ready to play. That's just the role I 
have and I think it will be an easy role for me to do because I've 
done it once before and I think the guys will respond to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Chiefs announced Tuesday they signed veteran  
linebacker Marvcus Patton, 31, to a three-year contract as an 
unrestricted free agent. Patton spent the past four seasons with 
Washington -- including three as the Redskins' leading tackler -- and 
the preceding five with the Buffalo Bills, playing in 144 straight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	An eighth-round draft pick by the Bills out of UCLA in 1990,  
Patton has 972 career tackles (659 solo), 14 sacks, 10 
interceptions for 46 yards, seven fumble recoveries and 11 forced 
fumbles. With Washington in 1998 he had a career-high 192 tackles, 
including 134 solo.

<HEADLINE> SEC Chief Backs Extended Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission said Monday he would likely support bids by U.S. stock 
exchanges to extend trading hours as a measure to retain the 
nation's dominance in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were to decide to be competitive and trade in the  
early morning or late night, the chances are the commission would 
not stand in their way,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said at a news 
conference on financial literacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he would prefer that exchanges wait until next year,  
after any Year 2000 computer problems are addressed and the 
transition from fractions to decimals in stock trading is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the  
Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, is in the process of 
drawing up a proposal to extend trading hours to as late as 9 p.m., 
from the current 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD spokesman Scott Peterson said Monday he had no immediate  
comment on Levitt's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange's current planning envisions  
extended trading hours starting in mid 2000, although the exchange 
has that could be moved up if demand is high enough. The NYSE also 
plans to convert to decimal trading on about the same timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia declined to comment on Levitt's  
speech Monday.

<HEADLINE> Big Funds Achieve Surprising Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The giants of the mutual fund industry seem  
intent right now on debunking everything that everybody used to say 
about the effect of funds' size on their performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the earliest days of the industry's rise in the 1950s and  
1960s, analysts have warned all who would listen that funds tended 
to suffer from their own success. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument certainly sounds plausible: The bigger a fund grows  
as a result of rising portfolio values and the new money that good 
performance naturally attracts, the harder it becomes for the 
fund's manager to keep doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	If a $25 million or $100 million portfolio could be maneuvered  
like a speedboat, that same fund at $1 billion or $5 billion in 
assets became a supertanker, much harder to steer amid the 
fast-changing currents of the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	When many funds kept doing well past the $1 billion or $5  
billion mark, the experts said the same principles still held, even 
if the size limits somehow had been increased. Beyond a certain 
point, almost everybody agreed, a fund simply could not avoid the 
pressures of size. 
</P>
<P>
	The logic is accepted even by many fund managers themselves. But  
in the real world of fund performance over the past year or so, the 
pattern simply isn't holding up. 
</P>
<P>
	When you look at a list of the largest mutual funds as of late  
April, the performance numbers practically jump off the page. As 
compiled by the research firm of Lipper Inc., the tally shows that 
19 of the 25 racked up better returns for the Jan. 1-April 22 
period than the 7.19 percent average gain for more than 6,200 
equity funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the six that didn't surpass the average, furthermore,  
have income as a primary or secondary objective, and thus may have 
a significant part of their portfolio in bonds or other 
conservative, relatively high-yielding investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the 52 weeks ended April 22, ALL 25 (!) of the largest  
funds -- starting with Fidelity Magellan, at $90.78 million in 
assets, and Vanguard 500 Index, at $82.52 million in assets -- 
chalked up a better return than the Lipper average of plus-5.30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Before we get too carried away, we need to acknowledge a couple  
of special factors behind the statistics. First of all, recent 
market conditions have heavily favored large blue-chip growth 
stocks of the sort most likely to be owned by the biggest stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important, our list suffers from selection bias,  
because we are looking at the biggest funds as of the end of the 
performance-measuring period, rather than at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest of the small-company growth funds, for instance,  
which have generally produced negative results over the past year 
or so, aren't on the Top 25 list by assets because they have been 
shrinking. So, we must admit that our analysis suffers from an 
element of redundancy: The most successful funds are successful. 
</P>
<P>
	But even after we concede those points, the story still carries  
considerable force. Most of the current Top 25 were giant funds a 
year ago as well, and yet their size didn't seem to slow them down 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity Magellan, the longtime No. 1 whose assets stood at more  
than $63 billion at the end of 1997, outdistanced both the average 
fund and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in 1998, and again in the 
Jan. 1-April 22 period this year. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the Top 25 list includes funds of a variety of  
different management styles which seemingly ought to have hindered 
their performance chances even further. Fidelity Puritan and 
Vanguard Wellington, for instance, are balanced funds whose bond 
holdings make it hard for them to keep up with a rising stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco Total Return Institutional is a pure bond fund, while two  
of the others on the list are international or global funds -- the 
Europacific Growth and New Perspective funds from Capital 
Research's American Funds family. 
</P>
<P>
	It still makes sense for investors to keep an eye on any fund's  
performance as its size increases. But the record now shows that 
quite a few successful managers are better at adapting to asset 
growth than the experts ever expected they would be.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Let Autistic Girl Play Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An 18-year-old autistic girl who ``dreams  
of earning an athletic letter'' must be allowed to play softball 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Garr M. King means that  
Anna Inskip can take the field today for the Astoria High School 
junior varsity game against St. Helens High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the judge's ruling is only a preliminary injunction,  
school officials said they might accept the judge's order 
permanently. ``I think we have enough guidance from the court to 
move ahead,'' school Superintendent Larry McMacken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Inskip, a junior, tried out for the junior varsity team  
this spring. She was not cut and officials let her practice, but 
they would not allow her to play in scrimmages or games for fear 
that her autism might cause her to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	She has participated in basketball, swimming and horseback  
riding in the Special Olympics. Her mother, Mary Young, said in a 
compliant filed April 16 that her daughter ``dreams of earning an 
athletic letter.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Monday to give  
swift consideration to a news media request for the unsealing of 
lie-detector test results and other records in Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr's case involving presidential accuser Kathleen 
Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., ordered  
Starr's office to file papers by May 3 saying why some documents in 
the upcoming trial of Virginia woman Julie Hiatt Steele should be 
kept off the public record. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court filing, Starr's prosecutors said ``some -- though by  
no means all'' of the ``sealed investigative materials'' will be 
disclosed at Ms. Steele's trial, scheduled to begin May 3 in 
federal court in Alexandria, Va. Starr's office says disclosure of 
certain documents ``might impede ongoing criminal investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey alleged that President Clinton made an unwanted  
sexual advance, and Ms. Steele is accused of obstructing Starr's 
investigation of that allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton allowed Starr's  
office to file certain records under seal in the Steele case. News 
organizations including The Associated Press unsuccessfully 
challenged the pretrial secrecy and are petitioning the appeals 
court for a writ of mandamus to make the material public. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers revealed that the sealed documents include  
lie-detector test results for one or more of Starr's witnesses. 
After Ms. Steele testified this month at Susan McDougal's trial, 
the lawyer for the Clintons' former Whitewater partner, Mark 
Geragos, contended that Mrs. Willey failed a lie-detector test.

<HEADLINE> Inmate Admits Judge-Killing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Three inmates' elaborate plans to  
escape and kill three federal judges were foiled because they sent 
letters to the judges and the Secret Service detailing their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates even signed their names.  
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Fonseca, 26, admitted Monday that he and two other  
men sent letters to Judges Lawrence Piersol and John B. Jones and 
Appeals Judge Roger Wollman, telling them they had been ``sentenced 
to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fonseca's letter to the Secret Service said he had started an  
organization called The Group of Justice Reform and he would ``show 
you just who we are'' by killing three judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonseca, Charles Mann and Edward Maguire planned to hang  
themselves in order to be taken to the hospital, then escape to 
kill the judges, prosecutors said. It was not clear why the inmates 
targeted those particular judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonseca, serving time for writing bad checks and assaulting  
guards, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiring to kill the judges. He 
faces up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Mann, 19, and Edward Maguire, 22, are scheduled to stand  
trial in June. The men, both convicted burglars, face up to 45 
years in prison.

</P>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Arthur Boyd, whose talent for  
capturing Australian landscapes in oil helped establish him as one 
of the nation's leading painters, died Saturday at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister John Howard said Boyd was one of the greatest  
Australian painters of the 20th century. He described Boyd as a man 
of great generosity -- demonstrated by the artist's 1993 gift to the 
Australian people of his $13 million, 2,470-acre rural property in 
New South Wales state.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Crowley, a longtime NBC-TV censor who  
worked on ``The Tonight Show,'' ``Late Night With David Letterman'' 
and ``The Cosby Show,'' died Wednesday of an apparent heart attack. 
She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Carson, in his ``Tonight'' monologues, would occasionally  
refer to a fictional censor named ``Priscilla Goodbody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mace, who worked for the show from 1968 to 1971 as an  
assistant to Ed McMahon, said he believes Carson coined the name 
with Miss Crowley in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Crowley retired in 1987 after working for NBC for 40 years.  
As a manager for Standards and Practices, she was assigned certain 
shows and had the final say, in the tamer TV environment of her 
early career, on whether a costume was too revealing or a word like 
``toilet'' could be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Crowley also worked for ``Your Show of Shows,'' starring  
Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca, soap operas such as ``Another World'' 
and Hallmark Hall of Fame specials.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Walter J. Cummings, a former U.S. solicitor  
general who was one of the longest-serving federal appeals court 
judges, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 36, he became the youngest-ever U.S. solicitor general,  
holding the job from 1952 to 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by  
President Johnson in 1966. He spent 32 years on the court, which 
serves parts of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings took part in many landmark cases, including one in 1972  
freeing Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, who had been held in 
contempt of court in the Chicago Seven trial.

</P>
<P>
	TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) -- Teodoro Garcia, believed to be the last  
surviving Mexican soldier who fought Pancho Villa's rebel forces 
during the Mexican Revolution, died Sunday. He was 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Jan. 7, 1889, in Sacramento, Mexico, Garcia was among  
the Mexican ``Federales'' who fought for dictator Porfirio Diaz, 
who won several fraudulent elections for the presidency. Villa 
joined the revolution on the side of Francisco Madero, who in 1910 
toppled Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Urbina, professor of Latin American history at Texas  
City's College of the Mainland, said Garcia is the last of a 
handful of Mexican veterans he has tracked since the late 1980s. He 
said Garcia fought for Diaz in 1910 and 1911.

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Ken Grandquist, one of Des Moines'  
leading real estate developers and the owner of the minor-league 
Iowa Cubs, died Sunday of complications of a stroke. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist collapsed April 17 during the Cubs' home opener.  
</P>
<P>
	With William C. Knapp, Grandquist founded Iowa Realty Co., which  
became the state's largest real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist eventually founded his own company, Ken Grandquist &AMP;  
Associates. In 1986, he supplied the land in Altoona for the 
Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino and was the establishment's 
original gambling license holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist's involvement with the baseball team goes back 31  
years, when it was known as the Iowa Oaks. He chaired the team's 
steering committee before eventually buying a piece of the team in 
1982, and assumed near-total control in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was president of the American Association, the Triple-A  
league to which the Cubs then belonged, in 1988-89.

officer of the Missouri-based company that publishes The Daily 
Californian of El Cajon and 33 other California newspapers, died 
Saturday at age 56. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not given. Mace had recently undergone  
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace headed Central Valley Publishing, whose daily papers in  
California include the Dispatch of Gilroy, the Free Lance in 
Hollister, Madera Tribune, Merced Sun-Star and Turlock Journal.

                      *Douglas Lewis Manship Sr.    	
</P>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Douglas Lewis Manship Sr., the chairman  
emeritus of Capital City Press, which publishes The Advocate, 
SATURDAY and the Sunday Advocate, died Monday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Manship held positions ranging from reporter to publisher to  
president of Capital City Press. He was among the pioneers of the 
television industry in Baton Rouge, founding WBRZ. 
</P>
<P>
	Active in civic and professional organizations, he served in or  
led various state, regional and national publishing and 
broadcasting associations and led numerous community groups in 
Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Born into a newspaper family, Manship demonstrated an aptitude  
for the news business at an early age. When he was 13, he had his 
first newspaper assignment covering a marbles championship. He 
escorted the Baton Rouge winner to the Biloxi, Miss., regional 
shoot-off and the next year traveled with the Baton Rouge winner to 
New Jersey for the national championships. He sent stories home for 
every edition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Manship worked for racial harmony through  
WBRZ. He brought the city's black and white leaders together in 
meetings in the WBRZ board room, and broadcast a series of 
editorials that brought threats of violence to Manship and his 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Manship is survived by one daughter, three sons, four  
stepchildren, two granddaughters, three grandsons and two 
step-grandchildren.

	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Allen Quakenbush, who spent 21 years at the  
Topeka Capital-Journal as a sports writer, columnist and editor, 
died Saturday. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Quakenbush, who had been in ill in recent months, collapsed on  
his way home from work Saturday and died in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Quakenbush worked two years on the sports staff of the Lawrence  
Journal-World before joining the Capital-Journal staff in 1978.

                             *Rick Rood

<P>
	ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Rick Rood, who as ``Ravishing Rick Rude''  
was one of professional wrestling's biggest stars in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, died April 20. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Rood was found unconscious at his home. He was resuscitated, but  
died later at a hospital. Autopsy results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ring, Rood played a womanizing, conceited bad guy who  
would often finish off opponents with the ``Rude Awakening,'' a 
neck-breaking takedown. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured in a 1994 match with the wrestler Sting in Japan  
and then retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he had been a manager and commentator for Extreme  
Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation and, most 
recently, Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling.

</P>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- R&AMP;B star Roger Troutman, had hits such as  
``More Bounce to the Ounce'' and ``I Want to Be Your Man,'' was 
shot to death Sunday along with his brother in an apparent 
murder-suicide, police said. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Betz, executive director of the Montgomery County coroner's  
office, said authorities believe Larry Troutman shot his brother 
Sunday and then turned the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the shooting was not immediately clear.  
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were part of the Troutman family of performers that  
formed the band Zapp and helped pioneer the rock-funk ``Dayton 
sound'' in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Troutman also recorded as a solo artist under the name Roger.

<HEADLINE> London Shares Close at Record High / British Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Share prices rose Tuesday on the London Stock  
Exchange to a new record closing high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up  
90.0 points, or 1.4 percent, at 6,593.6. The previous record close 
of 6,515.3 was set on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that strength in U.S. blue chip stocks continued  
to drive shares in London as impressive first-quarter earnings from 
U.S. giants AT&AMP;T and DuPont kept British stocks moving upwards in 
the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some brokers warned of instability in the markets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are starting to get a little nervous at these  
levels,'' said James Dewhurst, senior salesman at British brokerage 
Charterhouse. ``We've been following Wall Street for some time and 
will continue to do so, but U.S. markets are looking pretty 
mixed.''

<HEADLINE> Early Photos Sold at NYC Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An early photo titled ``Two Women Posed With a  
Chair'' sold for a record $387,500 Tuesday at an auction that also 
featured the sale of one of the world's first news photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The daguerreotype, made around 1850 by Albert Sands Southworth  
and Josiah Johnson Hawes, was bought by an anonymous buyer. Its 
sale broke a record set minutes earlier at Sotheby's, when an 1840s 
Southworth &AMP; Hawes daguerreotype titled ``A Cloud Study'' was 
purchased by an anonymous buyer for $354,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday, the record price for a daguerreotype was  
$189,500, which the Getty Museum of Los Angeles paid Sotheby's in 
1995 for a circa 1846 depiction of the U.S. Capitol, said Gloria 
Harris, a spokeswoman for the auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	Southworth &AMP; Hawes are regarded among the finest  
daguerreotypists the medium has known. A daguerreotype is a 
mirror-image photograph produced on silver or copper. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the world's first news photos, of a man facing imminent  
death at Niagara Falls, went to an anonymous buyer for $55,200. 
Sotheby's had expected bids of $20,000 to $25,000 for the 1853 
daguerreotype of a man, a German immigrant identified only as Mr. 
Avery, clinging desperately to rocks in the raging Niagara River as 
rescuers tried to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
	The man perished over the falls just after the picture was taken  
by daguerrotypist Platt D. Babbitt -- one of the first times an 
event was captured by the process more often used to show buildings 
and people in static situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The daguerreotype was among hundreds of black and white  
photographs collected by David Feigenbaum, a radiologist for many 
years at Boston University. Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman 
said the archive, found in Feigenbaum's basement after his death 
last year, ``the most significant discovery in American photography 
in the last 25 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All prices included Sotheby's commission of 15 percent of the  
gavel price up to $50,000 and 10 percent of anything above that 
amount.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Dominates AP Annual Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A successful military operation against the  
Serbs in Yugoslavia will take the patience of the American people, 
intensified air strikes by U.S. forces and a unified front by NATO 
nations, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told newspaper executives 
attending The Associated Press annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of Albanian refugees forced from their homes  
because of ``ethnic cleansing'' by Yugoslavian President Slobodan 
Milosevic believe it will take a ground war to resolve the 
conflict, according to a panel moderated by Louis D. Boccardi, 
president and chief executive officer of the news cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP meeting and a luncheon that followed Monday were the  
opening events of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper 
Association of America's convention. AP chairman Donald E. 
Newhouse, president of Advance Publications and The Star-Ledger of 
Newark, N.J., opened the meeting attended by executives 
representing AP's 1,545 daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was  
the featured speaker at the luncheon. He said the importance of 
NATO leaders meeting last weekend in Washington to mark the group's 
50th anniversary was that it solidified the 19 nations in their 
fight against Milosevic, convinced them that the air strikes were 
working and confirmed that the air strikes would continue to 
intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting to prevail,'' said Richardson.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo conversation moderated by Boccardi included White  
House correspondent Terry Hunt; foreign affairs and national 
security correspondent Laura Myers; special correspondent Mort 
Rosenblum; photographer and international photo editor Jerome 
Delay; and Miles Kahler, a professor with the Graduate School of 
International Relations at the University of California, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum and Delay participated by live satellite from a  
refugee camp in Kukes, Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum said that when refugees arrive, often after days of  
walking or hiding in the mountains, ``they are in terrible 
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said refugees want NATO to send ground troops to the Yugoslav  
province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The air war is working on a sort of wholesale basis, but  
they're dealing in retail right now,'' Rosenblum said. He said the 
refugees believe ground troops are needed in addition to the 
current air war because the ``ethnic cleansing'' is being carried 
out by small groups of Serb military police. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi asked Delay to talk about a photo he took at a refugee  
camp of a little girl with blond pigtails. She had cried so much 
the skin around her eyes was bluish-red. After the photo was 
published in a German newspaper, more than $1 million was raised 
for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy job,'' Delay said, noting he sees his own  
daughters in the refugee children he photographs. ``Emotionally, 
it's very stressing ... but I think our role is very important to 
document what we're doing here (and) I hope people see the pictures 
and feel the same feelings that I felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delay said the little girl and her grandmother were now living  
in Hamburg, Germany, and Monday was her third birthday. Some of the 
money raised will go toward her health care, education and housing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials are assessing how many troops it would take to  
lead a ground war, said Myers. She said a ground mission would be 
difficult because the geography is rough and only Hungary, a NATO 
member, will allow troops to pass across its border into 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	An oil embargo is another possible step in ``tightening the  
noose around Belgrade,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahler said it was critical to realize the refugees believe they  
can eventually return to a stable environment politically and 
economically, which NATO promised it would help secure. He said the 
questions are whether that can happen without sending ground troops 
and forcing Milosevic from power. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi said he was proud of the dozens of AP journalists  
covering Kosovo, some of whom have been ``beaten, robbed and shot 
at as they reported from the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also paid tribute to AP television producer Myles Tierney,  
who was killed by rebel gunmen in Sierra Leone last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his report to members on the state of AP, Boccardi started by  
showing the photo portfolios that won both Pulitzer photo prizes 
this year. AP was cited for spot coverage of the terrorist bombings 
of two American embassies in Africa and feature photography for 
coverage of the White House scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi said the international video service AP started four  
years ago, now known as APTN, had its first profitable quarter this 
year and had ``begun to fulfill the expectations we've had all 
along that it would generate new revenue for our general funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi announced that the AP Leaf Desk will be replaced  
starting later this year with an all-new AP Server. It will go to 
all PhotoStream subscribers, including those who already own the 
current version of AP Server, at no additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with a new and improved satellite distribution system  
called ObjectStream, the new receivers will make it possible for AP 
to retire its aging AP GraphicsNet system and deliver photos and 
news graphics on the same circuit to the same up-to-date receiver, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later on, AP will add text to ObjectStream so that related  
stories, photos and graphics will be linked when they arrive in 
newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the next few months, Boccardi said, AP will give member  
newspapers a new Internet site at no charge called ``Your AP.'' It 
will provide a directory to access every story, picture and graphic 
available on any subject in the AP news report, and it can be 
customized by editors for their specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take the place of the systems we use for delivering  
our news to your production systems,'' Boccardi said. ``What we're 
doing here is using the Internet to offer another way to look at 
your AP news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, some 950 AP member newspapers will have  
Web sites, Boccardi said, and more than 300 will subscribe to The 
WIRE, AP's Web-based members-only service started more than two 
years ago. To make member sites more attractive to online readers, 
he said, the AP recently launched the MoneyWIRE, which allows users 
to retrieve specific mutual fund and stock listings by company 
name, ticker symbol or AP stock table abbreviation. 
</P>
<P>
	For editors who want to build their own multimedia  
presentations, Boccardi said the AP will soon offer ``multimedia 
components'' on all major stories, including audio and video clips. 
He said the AP is working with RealNetworks Inc. to let Web sites 
offer audio and news programming directly from their pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi also announced that as many as 10 new staffers will be  
added this year to domestic bureaus in a program AP hopes to 
continue for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first additions will be in Houston; Jackson, Miss.;  
Columbia, S.C.; a Washington-based regional reporter for Utah, 
Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico; and a technology writer based in 
San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, Newhouse and Boccardi were re-elected to their  
posts, and George W. Wilson, president of the Concord (N.H.) 
Monitor, was elected vice chairman of the AP board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other AP management officers re-elected to one-year terms were  
Patrick T. O'Brien, senior vice president and chief financial 
officer; James M. Donna, vice president and secretary; and vice 
presidents William E. Ahearn, Vincent J. Alabiso, Claude E. Erbsen, 
Walter R. Mears, John W. Reid, Wick Temple and James R. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas E. Slaughter was elected vice president for strategic  
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Boruch was re-elected treasurer, and Scott Johnson,  
Salvatore Focella and Ann Randolph were re-elected assistant 
treasurers. Other AP management officers re-elected were assistant 
secretaries Lilo Jedelhauser and Greg Groce. 
</P>
<P>
	In results of all-mail balloting for the AP's board of  
directors, four incumbents were re-elected and two new members were 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-elected were Judith W. Brown, editor, The Herald, New  
Britain, Conn.; Joe Hladky, president and publisher, The Gazette

<HEADLINE> Van Horn To Have Surgery on Thumb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets forward Keith Van  
Horn, the NBA's sixth-leading scorer this season, will have surgery 
on his broken left thumb on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn joined the growing list of Nets sidelined for the  
season when he sustained a displaced fracture on Sunday, falling 
near the stands after blocking a shot by Reggie Miller of the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was dislocated and something was wrong,'' Van Horn  
said before watching the Nets play the Miami Heat on Tuesday night. 
``The lady I fell into said: `Look at his hand' and I looked down 
and saw it and freaked out myself. I screamed and cursed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn will need four weeks to recover from the surgery, which  
will be performed by Dr. Charles Melone, a hand specialist based in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, who was averaging 21.8 points, said Melone won't know  
the extent of the surgery until he operates. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, who was placed on the injured list Tuesday, is the  
sixth Net to have a major injury in this lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	Centers Jayson Williams and Jim McIlvaine have had surgery for a  
broken leg and shoulder injury, respectively. Backup point guard 
Eric Murdock has missed 27 games with a sore knee. Center Rony 
Seikaly has played just nine games because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Scott Burrell joined the group Tuesday after being  
diagnosed with torn cartilage in his right knee. He will need 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a freak thing,'' Van Horn said. ``Maybe next year, stuff  
like this won't go on for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making the playoffs last season for the first time since  
1994, the Nets have struggled. They were eliminated from playoff 
contention last week.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Make Progress in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA and the players' union failed to  
complete their collective bargaining agreement Monday, although 
they reported progress in the labor dispute that forced the 
postponement of the league's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides met for about 8 1/2 hours Monday and planned to resume  
discussions Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	After a tentative deal fell apart late last week with each side  
blaming the other for introducing new terms at the last minute, the 
sides said they had moved closer to completing a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made progress in a number of areas and we're  
cautiously optimistic, but it isn't quite done yet,'' union 
spokesman Dan Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions continue, but we do not yet have a deal,'' said  
WNBA spokesman Mark Pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks ended for the night at about 1:30 a.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	An agreement in principle was reached April 14 on a new  
four-year contract, and the sides had hoped to have it in final 
written form by last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included increases in the minimum salary from $15,000  
to $30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those figures 
would rise to $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002. The 
benefits package was to include year-round health and dental 
benefits, pension, maternity benefits and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay forced the league to postpone Tuesday's draft  
indefinitely. The 10-week season is scheduled to begin June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The union claimed that the league introduced five issues in  
talks last Wednesday night and said that if the players' 
association did not agree to them, there would be no deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes was the right to extend the 32-game season  
without increasing salaries, the addition of random drug testing 
and no increase in the rookie wage scale for the duration of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old WNBA, which added franchises in Orlando and  
Minnesota for this season, plans for an unprecedented expansion of 
four more cities by 2000. That would increase the league's size to 
16 franchises.

<HEADLINE>  Lukas Named to Racing Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas was elected to  
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame today, just four days before the 
trainer tries to win his fourth Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has won 10 Triple Crown races, has compiled a  
staggering list of accomplishments, including nearly $200 million 
in purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old trainer has 518 graded stakes victories, which  
accounts for an amazing 7 percent of all graded stakes the past 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Russell Baze, who rode more than 400 winners for the  
seventh consecutive year in 1998, was also elected to the hall. 
Thoroughbreds elected were Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to be here,'' the 62-year-old Lukas said. ``But  
I don't think anybody gets here by themselves. What makes it 
significant is I know I didn't get here alone. I had some very good 
clientele that had extreme faith in me and backed it up with their 
bankroll and let me buy some of the best horses in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he'll send out Cat Thief and Charismatic as he  
attempts to become only the third trainer to win four or more 
Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, born in Antigo, Wis., won six consecutive Triple Crown  
races from 1994-1996 with four horses -- Tabasco Cat, Thunder Gulch, 
Timber Country and Grindstone. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Baze became the 12th rider to win 6,000 races; Exceller  
was voted in as contemporary male horse; Miesque in the 
contemporary female category; and Gun Bow as the horse of 
yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, a panel of more than 180 turf writers, broadcasters  
and historians vote on candidates selected by the Hall of Fame 
nominating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are Aug. 9 at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., home  
of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE>  IAAF Strips Medal From Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Slaney is approaching the bell lap in  
full stride. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest U.S. distance runner in track history, stripped of  
her silver medal from the 1997 world championships, is going ahead 
with a lawsuit against the sport's world governing body despite 
Monday's ruling by an arbitration panel that she failed a drug test 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they are protected over there, safe in their little  
cocoon,'' Slaney said, referring to the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation headquarters in Monte Carlo. ``They can take 
away whatever rights the athletes had. This has to be addressed, 
fought and changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer said he doubts the suit ever will go to trial because  
the IAAF would prefer a settlement rather than make public what he 
called a ``sham'' test for female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take the veil from over how they've been  
operating their doping program. We're going to find out what 
athletes they've investigated, which athletes they've let off and 
why, to show the whole thing is a sham,'' attorney Jim Coleman 
said. ``It's fraudulent, and we're going to prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and also names the U.S.  
Olympic Committee, which administered the test Slaney failed during 
the 1996 Olympic Trials. It was filed in U.S. District Court in 
Indianapolis, the home of USA Track &AMP; Field, the sport's national 
governing body, although USATF was not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF imposed the ban after the arbitration panel said there  
was ``failure to establish by clear evidence that an abnormal T-E 
(testosterone-epitestosterone) test was attributable to 
pathological or physiological conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, claimed the indication of a high level of  
testosterone was due to birth control pills she was taking. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF executive director Craig Masback called the IAAF decision  
``a tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, she's one of the great athletes in the sport and a  
pioneer,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``T-E testing for women is not supported by scientific evidence  
... never mind for her particular test. I think it's unfortunate 
that the IAAF decided to pursue this case after we exonerated her. 
They should come up with a legal test, not pursue someone who is 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio normally is about 1-to-1, but a routine urine test  
showed Slaney had more than a 6-1 ratio, which the IAAF regarded as 
proof of doping. Testosterone is a natural hormone that increases 
muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was suspended from competition in 1997, then later  
reinstated by USATF. The IAAF, however, referred the case to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that this was where this was headed,'' Coleman  
said of the panel's ruling. ``They weren't interested in whether 
the test was valid. They were simply trying to find a way to get 
out of this mess they got themselves into. They decided the way to 
get out of it is to simply dump on Mary and try to save their 
tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Slaney, the runner's husband, added, ``According to the  
IAAF, you're guilty until you prove your innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters,  
is free to compete since the IAAF said she had retroactively 
completed her two-year ban in June 1998. But she loses the medal 
she won in 1997 at Paris in the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them come and try to get the $20,000 (in prize money) that  
she won in Paris,'' Coleman said. ``They don't say they're going to 
ask for it back, but the order suggested they might. ... They'll 
never see the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney now joins other prominent names in track found guilty by  
the IAAF: Ben Johnson, Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe. Another 
high-profile case is pending. U.S. sprinter Dennis Mitchell is 
going to arbitration after testing positive for high testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said IAAF now will likely challenge the Indianapolis  
court's jurisdiction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we establish the court has jurisdiction, then basically  
they're going to be left out there exposed, and I think they will 
try to find a way to bring it to an end,'' Coleman said. ``And I 
think that one thing that will happen is that they will not use 
this test against women in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, they will have wasted all this time, when what  
they should have been doing is trying to find a way to prove when a 
female athlete has used testosterone,'' he said. ``Rather than 
doing that, they've been trying to find a way to save a test that 
doesn't work. And now ... it's probably going to call into question 
anything they come up with.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Seeks AL Win Streak Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- With a victory tonight, Roger Clemens  
would set an AL record with his 18th straight win. The Texas 
Rangers can only wish the milestone was being approached for them 
instead of against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens nearly was traded to Texas from Toronto in February. The  
Rangers were so close to landing him that they were arranging with 
management of the Dallas Stars, the NHL team owned by Rangers owner 
Tom Hicks, for Clemens to be introduced on the ice during their 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
	But before Clemens could lace up any skates, the New York  
Yankees trumped Texas' offer and brought him to the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing the two-time defending Cy Young Award winner join the  
defending world champions was tough enough for AL teams to swallow. 
It was even tougher for Texas considering Clemens, a Houston-area 
native, had said he wanted to return to his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, Clemens hasn't done much toward winning the  
sixth Cy Young of his career. Although he's 2-0, his ERA is 4.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Clemens has pitched well enough to extend his string of  
consecutive victories to 17, tying the AL record set by Cleveland's 
Johnny Allen in 1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 
1968-69. Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants set the major league 
record of 24 in 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who hasn't lost since last May 29 to Seattle, tied the  
mark last Thursday against Texas at Yankee Stadium. He gave up four 
hits and three walks in 7 1-3 innings of a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	That win was New York's 13th in 16 games against Texas. The  
Yankees, who eliminated the Rangers from the postseason in 1996 and 
1998, have won five of their last six games at The Ballpark heading 
into the three-game series that begins tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a do-or-die situation, but I think it's important  
that we beat the Yankees,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``I 
think it's important to our ball club because, No. 1, we need to 
let the Yankees know we can beat them, and, No. 2, we need to let 
our club know we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing Clemens for the Rangers will be their most consistent  
starter thus far, Aaron Sele (3-1, 3.22). Sele lost his only 
regular-season start to New York in 1998 and also lost the third 
and final playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the pitching matchups are Orlando Hernandez vs. Mark  
Clark on Wednesday night and Ramiro Mendoza against Mike Morgan on 
Thursday. Andy Pettitte was to have started Thursday, but didn't 
bounce back well after throwing 108 pitches Saturday against 
Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Brit GE Buys Internet Equipment Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's General Electric Co. PLC is buying  
Internet switching equipment maker FORE Systems Inc. for $4.5 
billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will bolster GEC's push into the U.S.  
telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will now be in a position to capture the full benefits of  
the impact of the explosive growth of Internet and other data 
traffic on the demand for communications equipment and systems,'' 
GEC chief executive George Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC is Britain's biggest electrical engineering company and is  
not related to the Fairfield, Conn.-based industrial giant General 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	FORE would continue to operate under its own name and work  
closely with GEC's Marconi Communications unit. 
</P>
<P>
	FORE's chief executive, Thomas J. Gill, said the deal would help  
create ``one of the world's foremost global telecommunications and 
networking equipment companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FORE is a leader in asynchronous transfer mode technology, which  
allows computers to talk to each other at super-fast speeds and 
send huge amounts of data back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh-based FORE, with 2,000 employees, had sales of  
$632.4 million and operating income of $55.4 million for the 12 
months ending March 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based GEC reported revenues for the year ending March 31,  
1998, of approximately $17.9 billion, at current exchange rates, 
and operating profits of about $1.8 billion. 
</P>

	The FORE purchase should not affect GEC's bottom line in the  
current year and should add to earnings after March 31, 2000, GEC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, FORE would become a wholly owned subsidiary  
of the British company. Gill would remain president and chief 
executive of FORE and would report directly to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition would be the second for GEC since it agreed in  
January to sell its defense electronics businesses to British 
Aerospace PLC. Earlier this month, GEC completed a $1.74 billion 
acquisition of Reltec Corp., a U.S.-based telecommunications 
products business.

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar Details Disguised Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Narcotics traffickers have come up with a new  
way to sneak cocaine shipments past drug-sniffing dogs and the eyes 
of human inspectors: chemically altering the drug so that it 
appears black. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding charcoal and other chemicals to cocaine transforms it so  
that it escapes detection by drug dogs and is undetectable by the 
usual chemical tests for cocaine, Barry McCaffrey, director of the 
White House Office of Drug Control Policy, told a Senate 
subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turn this stuff into black brick, but you can mold it  
into something that looks like metal moldings,'' McCaffrey said. 
``The dog won't smell it. ... It doesn't smell. It doesn't react to 
chemical tests the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the drug arrives at its destination, high-level drug  
traffickers use acetone or another chemical to turn it back into 
cocaine paste. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you have a very clever new initiative on the part of drug  
smuggling,'' the retired Army general told reporters after 
testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee's panel on 
emerging threats and capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffickers, usually from Colombia, also have moved cocaine in  
other colors, including red, yellow and blue, he said. Authorities 
also have seen altered cocaine that appears like transparent sheets 
of acetate. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, law enforcers have begun to seize shipments  
of the altered drug in countries including Spain, Albania, the 
Netherlands. U.S. authorities are seeing limited amounts in this 
country, McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	This type of chemical alteration currently is expensive for drug  
traffickers, which is probably why authorities have seen only 
relatively small ships of altered cocaine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug traffickers are relying on other new technologies,  
McCaffrey said. For example, ``super go-fast boats,'' which can 
easily outpace Coast Guard cutters, are being manufactured on the 
Colombia's west coast to be used as drug transports in the 
Caribbean and eastern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``One such boat is reportedly capable of carrying a two-ton  
payload at high speeds,'' McCaffrey said. ``It's now become the 
principal tool of drug smuggling now employed by these criminal 
organizations. It's the major tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have ways to stop the boat. McCaffrey told  
reporters they are secret but will start being seen ``in the coming 
weeks, and they're going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey told the subcommittee the world still faces a pandemic  
of drug abuse. The United States consumes 11 percent of the world's 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past two decades, the number of illegal drug users in  
the United States has dropped by 50 percent, while the global 
pandemic has been growing and expanding into other regions of the 
world,'' he said in a report to the panel.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Closing Pathfinder Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s Pathfinder site will be shut  
down after Internet users increasingly chose other ways to reach 
the online magazines it featured. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1994, before the World Wide Web was a household  
name, the Pathfinder site was heralded by Time Warner as an 
easy-to-use gateway to its magazine trove. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Web sites became more user-friendly and useful,  
Pathfinder struggled for relevance. Time Warner never adequately 
promoted the site, analysts said. Today, almost all the company's 
Web traffic flows through sites such as Money.com and Time.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of helping Time Warner's online image, Pathfinder, with  
its sagging traffic, began to have an opposite effect, said Melissa 
Bane, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, a research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It began being used by the industry as an example of how not  
to do it. People pointed to Pathfinder and said it hadn't taken 
off,'' Bane said. ``It's kind of been an albatross around Time 
Warner's neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner played down the move Monday, saying the site's  
demise was a natural evolution as Internet users chose to go 
directly to online magazines. The site will be closed in a few 
months, company spokesman said. The time is needed for technicians 
to change Web addresses to remove the Pathfinder designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to be the way consumers like to get their  
information, by going to a particular brand site,'' said Peter 
Costiglio, a Time Warner spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more of our promotion is in support of the individual  
sites and that will certainly continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is still out on consumer interest in all-in-one  
gateways to a media company's brand names. Walt Disney Co., for 
example, continues to heavily promote its Go Network as a gateway 
to the media conglomerate's properties, ranging from ABC.com to 
ESPN SportsZone.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Law Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed for new controls on  
guns Tuesday, and top Republicans proposed a hard look at the 
nation's violence-tinged culture as the two parties offered 
different responses to last week's Colorado high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People's lives are at stake here,'' Clinton declared at the  
White House. He urged the GOP-controlled Congress to raise from 18 
to 21 the legal age for handgun possession and to hold negligent 
parents liable when their children use guns to commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had  
agreed to give Democrats an opportunity for a debate and vote on 
firearms proposals in about two weeks. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois 
pronounced Lott's decision ``a breakthrough'' toward passage of 
legislation, and several advocates of tougher gun laws said they 
thought they could prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, neither Lott nor House Speaker Dennis Hastert mentioned  
gun control as they called jointly for a ``National Conference on 
Youth and Culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This conference should examine important issues facing  
students and society, including video games, drugs in school, 
Hollywood, prayer in schools, parental involvement and local 
control of schools,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Hastert nor Lott, who appeared together at a middle  
school in Virginia to tout recently passed education legislation, 
offered details. 
</P>
<P>
	Back inside the Capitol, Lott spoke dismissively of the call for  
new gun-control legislation as a ``typical knee-jerk reaction.'' 
The issues raised by last week's shooting at the Columbine High 
School outside Denver are ``bigger than just a gun debate,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he appeared to leave open the door to some  
type of restrictions, mentioning a measure calling for child safety 
locks on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats said they are counting on the horror of the  
Colorado shooting to fundamentally change the political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that the climate has changed,'' said Sen. Chuck  
Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	First at the White House, and then in the Capitol, the nation's  
political leaders paused during the day to observe a moment of 
silence for the victims of the shooting rampage. It was a week ago 
that 12 students and a teacher died at the hands of two heavily 
armed students, who ended the carnage by turning their weapons on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief silence since then was an interlude to the political  
jockeying that broke out Tuesday on an issue that had faded into 
the background in recent years. Republicans, heavily funded by the 
National Rifle Association, have traditionally opposed gun control 
legislation. Democrats have shied away from forcing votes on the 
question in recent years, in part to spare members of their rank 
and file from Western and Southern states from having to make 
politically unpalatable choices. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Clinton said his proposals would amount to  
no more than minor delays and minor hassles for sportsmen and legal 
gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a hassle for them. It's worth it. It's worth  
it. We're sorry -- it's worth it,'' the president said. ``People's 
lives are at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``So it's not just the culture of violence that has to  
change. It's the culture of hunting and sport shooting that has to 
stop financing efforts to frighten their members who are good, 
God-fearing, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens out there, into 
believing that every time we try to save a kid's life, it's a 
camel's nose in the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is criminal how easy it is for children in America to  
obtain guns,'' added first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, weighing a 
Senate candidacy in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes banning juvenile possession of  
semiautomatic assault rifles, halting imports of all high-capacity 
ammunition clips and limiting an individual's handgun purchases to 
one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of explosives also would be subject to the same Brady law  
background checks as gun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	One top Republican, House Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, whose Capitol  
office was invaded by a mentally ill gunman almost a year ago, said 
in a statement that he was ``offended by the president's political 
maneuvering. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We as parents have a responsibility to monitor what they  
watch, what they listen to and what they hold, not after the fact, 
but always. Our communities must be active in returning America to 
a society based on values, morals and discipline. And most 
importantly, we must stress faith in God and instill hope in our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican dissented from the leadership during the day.  
Rhode Island's Sen. John Chafee issued a strongly worded statement 
that said, ``To those who say there is something terribly wrong 
with an American culture that breeds the sort of children who are 
capable of reeking such carnage, I say it isn't our American 
culture that's wrong. What's wrong is our nation's love affair with 
guns.''

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ronald Alley, who built up the modern art  
collection at the Tate Gallery and served 21 years as its first 
Keeper of the Modern Collection, died Sunday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the gallery staff in 1951 following studies at the  
Courtauld Institute of Art and found that the Tate had hardly any 
modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article in the ``Museums Journal,'' Alley said Britain's  
public galleries lacked ``a single painting or sculpture that 
occupies a key position in the development of 20th century art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed Keeper of the Modern Collection in 1965, Alley built  
up the Tate's holdings.

undefeated football team in 1966, died Sunday when his car ran off 
a road and crashed. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, an attorney in Tuscaloosa, was an Associated Press  
All-Southeastern Conference selection in 1967 and 1968. He was a

<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Biochemist Heinz L. Fraenkel-Conrat, a  
professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology at the University 
of California, Berkeley, died April 10 of pulmonary failure. He was 
88. 
</P>
<P>
	He discovered that genetic information controlling viral  
reproduction is carried in the nucleic acid core of each virus 
particle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraenkel-Conrat, a native of Germany, fled the country after  
Adolph Hitler came to power. He earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry at 
the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1936 and came to the 
United States that same year. He joined the UC-Berkeley faculty in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Fraenkel-Conrat and his colleagues announced the  
complete sequencing of the 158 amino acids of the tobacco mosaic 
virus protein. He later worked on the chemical structure of the 
viral nucleic acid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the pioneers in the early days of virology with  
the tobacco mosaic virus,'' said UC-Berkeley colleague Michael 
Botchan. ``He was able to prove without a doubt that the genetic 
material was ribonucleic acid (RNA). He showed that he could 
actually reconstitute a complete infectious virus from the protein 
and RNA.''

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Al Hirt, whose power and technique made him  
``The King of the Trumpet'' in the 1960s when he won a Grammy for 
his hit ``Java,'' died Tuesday of liver failure. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 21 Grammy nominations in a career spanning more than 50  
years. In 1964, he won a Grammy for best non-jazz instrumental for 
``Java.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his peak in the 1960s, he played for John Kennedy's  
inauguration, starred at Carnegie Hall, and headlined numerous 
television variety shows, including his own ``Fanfare'' program on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he recorded more than 50 albums -- four gold and one  
platinum. ``Honey in the Horn'' reached No. 3 on Billboard's 
Popular Music Album Chart in 1963; ``Sugar Lips'' won Billboard's 
favorite instrumentalist of 1965. In 1962 he was named `best 
trumpeter' in the Playboy jazz poll, a prize he won for 15 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt got his first trumpet when he was 6. Classically trained at  
the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, he spent three years in the 
U.S. Army as a company bugler, then began his professional career 
in 1946 as a member of Benny Goodman's Orchestra. He later worked 
with other big bands, including the Dorsey Brothers and Ray 
McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
	Real national fame came in 1960 when Hirt's Dixieland Six booked  
into a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. His music caught the attention of 
Dinah Shore and he became an instant success on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career he mostly toured and performed on  
television, with occasional local appearances at ``Jellyroll's'' in 
the French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered one of his most important performances the 1987  
solo of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope John Paul II during the 
pontiff's visit to New Orleans.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Christian Howard, a leader in the movement  
that led the Church of England to ordain women as priests, died 
Thursday at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the General Synod, the church's governing body,  
she wrote a report, ``The Ordination of Women,'' in 1972. The 
report, which examined attitudes on women in church history as well 
as the Hebrew and Greek classical traditions, was updated in 1978 
and again in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a key document in a debate that ended in 1992 when the  
synod voted in favor of ordaining women. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a member of the faith and order committee of the World  
Council of Churches from 1961-75.

</P>
<P>
	He thought he was finished in show business in 1964 when an  
84-foot crane toppled on the television set of ``No Time for

<HEADLINE> Doors Reopen at Some Closed Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There is good news and bad news to report  
regarding several prominent stock mutual funds that have been 
closed to most new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that they have reopened! And the bad news is,  
well, that they have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Therein lies a tale. Because a simple action like a reopening  
can have positive and negative implications at the same time, it 
can serve to shed some light on how funds work. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund, the  
Fidelity Small Cap Stock Fund, the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value 
Fund and the Vanguard Windsor Fund, among others, have resumed 
accepting money from new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard Windsor had been closed since 1989, and Price Small-Cap  
Value since 1996, while the two Fidelity funds closed just last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Like dozens of other popular stock funds in this roaring bull  
market, they closed because the people who run them felt that money 
was coming in too fast to be managed effectively. After the 
closings, the funds' assets shrank considerably, and their managers 
decided they were ready to accept new money again. 
</P>
<P>
	What's so good, or bad, about that? It may be a good sign, for  
one thing, that a fund manager who had trouble finding good stocks 
to buy at attractive prices now thinks bargains are in better 
supply. At the same time, though, a reopening may be an unwelcome 
development for investors who believe funds become less 
maneuverable and more prone to mediocrity as they get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``As humans, we are trained to want what we can't have,'' says  
Jay Schabacker, editor of the newsletter Mutual Fund Investing in 
Potomac, Md. ``It's the allure of the unobtainable. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as investors it's important to be a little more  
discriminating. Just because a closed fund decides to reopen, that 
doesn't automatically imply it's time for you to get back in. The 
decision to invest must be made on a fund-by-fund basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any type of stock fund may close at some point. The largest of  
all funds, Fidelity Magellan, stopped accepting new accounts except 
in special cases such as retirement plans more than a year and a 
half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But closings are most common in specialties such as value and  
small-stock investing where the limits of size can be especially 
stringent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year or so, while technology stocks and a small  
elite of big blue chips have soared, many value and small stocks 
have suffered a significant decline. That has meant poor 
performance for many funds that invest in those areas, but it has 
also presumably increased the number of attractive places to put 
new money to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund had assets of more than $12  
billion a year ago. When it reopened in March, the total was about 
$7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with a smaller asset base, Low-Priced Stock remains the  
biggest small-value fund around,'' the monthly advisory Morningstar 
Fund Investor observed. ``While we still like this fund, we are 
disappointed in the reopening. We hope Fidelity does a better job 
in the future than it has in the past of controlling the fund's 
cash flows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story at Vanguard Windsor has even more twists and turns.  
This huge fund, after a long record of strong investment 
performance, ran into tough going in the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the fund's sponsors at the Vanguard Group  
announced that responsibilities for managing the portfolio were 
being split up to include a new, outside adviser. That action, 
Vanguard said, created additional room for an expansion of assets, 
which had fallen from about $23 billion to about $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a wait-and-see attitude before rushing into the fund,''  
Morningstar advises. ``The fund is not currently recommended,'' 
says Sheldon Jacobs, a longtime analyst of no-load funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who are partial to small-stock and value funds  
generally may find it heartening that managers of funds in these 
areas are ready to reopen their doors. But they don't have to focus 
their attention only on funds that have made announcements of that 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond all the closings and reopenings that may occur, the world  
of funds is so big that there are always numerous others to choose 
among.

<HEADLINE> Funny Feuds Envelop `Lonesome West' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``This parish would drive you to drink,'' sighs  
the overwhelmed young pastor in ``The Lonesome West,'' Martin 
McDonagh's blisteringly funny follow-up to last season's Broadway 
hit ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' Not only to drink, but quite 
possibly to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	We are back in Leenane in rural Ireland where McDonagh is in  
fine form dissecting the quirky -- heck, the psychotic -- folk who 
live, love and mostly fight there. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Lonesome West,'' which opened Tuesday at Broadway's  
Lyceum Theater, McDonagh focuses on the bruising battles between 
two middle-aged brothers, Coleman and Valene. They live together, 
but they don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
	These guys, described by one character as ``a penned-up Cain and  
Abel,'' are darker, more violent versions of the ``Odd Couple's'' 
Oscar and Felix. They know how to needle each other and draw blood, 
usually with their fists. Coleman is a professional provocateur, 
the kind of guy eager for confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Valene doesn't shirk from a slight either. Although more  
prissy, he can hold his own in any dust-up. A collector of small 
religious statues (his specialty: the Blessed Virgin) and 
controller of the family purse strings, Valene precipitates a major 
confrontation after their father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Dad was shot by Coleman. Was it really an accident? Judging from  
the son's temper, there are doubts. And those doubts plague poor 
Father Welsh, a newcomer to the area, who is more than bewildered 
by the murderous proclivities of his parishioners. Welsh takes 
things too personally and considers the locals' lack of piety a 
major failing on his part. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of the play, the priest urges the siblings to  
patch things up, a task that probably would require divine 
intervention. Even teen-age Girleen, the local distributor of 
homemade liquor, doesn't see any reason for a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The family outbursts remind one of Sam Shepard at his most  
bizarre and Quentin Tarantino at his most violent. Yet McDonagh's 
plays are more than oddball people with a penchant for mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	The playwright has his own voice, filled with a quirky poetry  
and love of language that create the most vivid and heartfelt 
characters. All four of his creations in ``The Lonesome West'' may 
be highly theatrical, but they have been brilliantly brought to 
life in this production, which comes from Ireland's Druid Theater 
in Galway by way of the Royal Court in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Garry Hynes handles the play with the lightest, most  
careful of touches. Brian F. O'Byrne, so good-hearted and earnest 
as the daughter's quiet suitor in ``Beauty Queen,'' gets to bust 
loose here. So does Maeliosa Stafford, who is genuinely scary as 
his fierce brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet McDonagh manages a few moments of poignancy in the midst of  
all the murderous activity. These are provided by David Ganly as 
the bewildered priest, particularly in his recitation of a gentle 
letter to the two brothers, urging their reconciliation. Dawn 
Bradfield completes the cast as the saucy Girleen, a young woman 
full of charm and practicality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lonesome West'' reconfirms young McDonagh's talent as a  
major writer. He has provided Broadway with yet another rich and 
memorable look at Irish life gone hilariously off-kilter.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Tuesday on the back of overnight gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index rose 237.77 points,  
or 1.8 percent, to 13,364.79, its highest close since Oct. 17, 
1997. On Monday, the index had gained 221.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was lifted by continued buying  
of technology and telecommunications stocks following gains in New 
York, where the Nasdaq composite rose 61.36 points to close at 
2652.05, surpassing its previous high of 2,598.81, set April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index has risen more than 21 percent this month,  
and traders expect further gains because of the inflow of foreign 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 38.76  
points, or 0.23 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,957.27. On 
Monday, it lost 4.74 points, or 0.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an overnight rally in technology related stocks in New  
York on Monday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange started moderately higher 
with buying centered on Japanese high technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But players remained reluctant to take aggressive positions  
ahead of Japan's ``Golden Week'' holidays, which start April 29 and 
last through next week. Tokyo financial markets will be closed 
Thursday and May 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also noted that many participants were avoiding taking  
new positions in advance of the summit between Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi and U.S. President Bill Clinton, set for May 3 in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was little affected by Monday's meeting of top  
finance officials from the world's major economies in Washington, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.46 yen at late  
afternoon, up 0.60 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its 
late New York level of 119.26 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply higher, with the key  
index ending at a one-year high on buying by foreign funds. The 
Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index rose 2.3 percent, to 9.65 
points to 425.33. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, boosted by hopes of an  
upgrade in the country's debt ratings by overseas agencies. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 17.90 points, or 2.3 
percent, to 793.98, its highest level since Oct. 24, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australia's benchmark stock index closed at another  
all-time high -- its twelfth since the beginning of April -- after a 
modest advance. The All Ordinaries Index rose 15.5 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 3,145.2. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's  
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 78.96 points, or 1.03 percent, 
to 7,550.13. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 34.56 points, or 1.5 percent, 
to 2,271.07. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher after the central bank  
reduced its overnight borrowing and lending rates by half a 
percentage point to 10.375 percent and 12.375 percent respectively. 
The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 25.38 points, 
or 1.1 percent, to 2,420.85. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower as investors took  
profits following gains over the past few weeks. The benchmark 
Composite Index slipped 3.88 points, or 0.5 percent, to 670.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The Straits Times Index  
rose 6.77 points, or 0.3 percent to 1,876.39. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesia shares closed lower for the second  
consecutive session. The Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent, or

<HEADLINE> Income Growth Outpaces Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes climbed 4.4 percent in  
1998, significantly outpacing inflation. In every state, per capita 
incomes grew faster than prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It translates directly into buying power,'' said Steve  
Cochrane, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. ``We've seen really strong consumer spending over the 
last year ... and these figures tell us why: There's money out 
there to spend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, average income for America's 270.3 million people  
last year was $26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, the Commerce 
Department said Tuesday. The figures include not only wages and 
salaries, but other sources of income such as investment earnings 
and government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That per capita income growth was actually a bit slower than the  
4.7 percent increase in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inflation rate -- as measured by the government's price  
index for personal consumption expenditures -- declined from 2 
percent in 1997 to 0.8 percent last year. Factoring that in, 
Americans' buying power -- per capita income growth after inflation 
-- jumped 3.6 percent in 1998 compared with 2.7 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By state, per capita incomes in 1998 ranged from $37,598 in  
Connecticut to $18,958 in Mississippi. Growth rates in per capita 
income ranged from 7.8 percent in North Dakota, where farmers hurt 
by falling international commodity prices got relief payments from 
the government, to 2.1 percent in Hawaii, where tourism has fallen 
off because of economic troubles in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	After North Dakota, the states with the fastest per capita  
income growth rates were Colorado, 6.1 percent; Washington, 5.7 
percent; Texas, 5.3 percent; and Vermont and Massachusetts, 5.0 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Hawaii, other states with relatively slow per capita  
income growth last year included Wyoming, 2.5 percent; Nevada and 
Montana, 2.6 percent; and Alaska, 2.8 percent. Nevada has 
experienced strong economic growth in recent years, but the effects 
on its per capita income have been diluted by simultaneous rapid 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased earnings from service-sector jobs -- especially in  
finance and real estate -- was the driving force behind high per 
capita income growth in many states. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, for example, ``is really the capital of the  
mutual fund industry, and with the stock market going gangbusters, 
income generated from that industry is really very strong,'' said 
Cochrane. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Colorado is increasingly a service center where  
financial, real estate and insurance companies are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states like Texas and Washington have seen growth in  
relatively high-paying technical jobs, such as in the computer and 
telecommunications industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, unemployment is near a 29-year low, and brisk  
spending by Americans has been largely responsible for keeping the 
U.S. economy growing while other countries have been hurt by a 
global economic downturn that started two years ago in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	States heavily dependent on farming -- such as North Dakota --  
have been among those feeling the worst effects of the 
international crisis that has pulled down U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farming states' per capita income growth was  
pushed to among the best in the nation by billions of dollars in 
relief payments Congress and President Clinton approved late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	No such relief came for Hawaii, where tourism from Asia has  
declined dramatically, also pulling down retail sales in the island 
state.

<HEADLINE> TV Criticized for History Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight  
is vividly recounted with the help of newsreel footage and 
eyewitness accounts in ABC's documentary ``The Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heightening the drama are snippets of radio broadcasts tracking  
Lindbergh's aircraft from North America to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is WJZ, New York, George Hicks reporting. As Saturday  
dawned over the vast Atlantic, the Lindbergh plane is unreported 
since passing Newfoundland early last night,'' is one message, 
tense and crackling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Lowell Thomas in New York: He made it!'' is another,  
celebrating Lindbergh's groundbreaking success. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasts make for effective storytelling. But they  
demonstrate a tin ear for history, radio experts say: They are 
fake. Thomas and Hicks, who in 1927 had not begun their radio 
careers, created the cuts in 1950 for a record album. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a small error in ABC's 12-hour ``The Century,'' which aired  
last month as part of a $25 million project that included the 
15 1/2-hour History Channel series ``The Century: America's Time,'' 
concluding this Thursday. ABC's Peter Jennings served as host for 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say the mistake is a telling example of how  
television's approach to history can be distorted by time and 
budget constraints, lack of research expertise and a sometimes 
uneasy mix of entertainment and information. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's goof ``is a very minor mistake compared to ... the  
'history' that television offers,'' said J. Fred MacDonald, a 
former history professor and author of six books on broadcasting, 
including ``Don't Touch That Dial,'' about radio and American life 
from 1920 to 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Shallow celebrity biographies, part of the explosion of history  
on TV, are consistent offenders, said MacDonald and others. But 
serious programs can stumble when it comes to the legitimacy of the 
images we see and the sounds we hear, or in their approach to a 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	For historians trained to vet all data, even relatively minor  
flaws are unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Biel, professor of radio and television at Morehead  
State University in Kentucky and an authority on radio's early 
years, was aghast at ABC's use of the Hicks and Thomas cuts in 
``The Century,'' and contacted The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts were recorded in 1950 for ``I Can Hear It Now ...  
1919-1932,'' a compilation of radio newscasts and programs, Biel 
said. The newscasts on the album were mostly re-created since few 
early ones were preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks began working in radio in 1928 for WRC in Washington,  
D.C.; Thomas' broadcasting career started in 1930 on ``Literary 
Digest,'' according to Ray Poindexter's ``Golden Throats &AMP; Silver 
Tongues: The Radio Announcers'' and other reference books. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald and the Museum of Television &AMP; Radio in New York  
agreed with Biel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ABC documentary is going to be looked on as an authentic  
historical document,'' said Biel. ``People ... are going to use 
this series as their source of history, just like ABC used the 
50-year-old 'I Can Hear It Now' as their source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Yellin, executive producer of ``The Century,'' said ABC was  
disappointed to learn the cuts obtained from the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corp. were not genuine. On-screen titles would be 
changed to note they were re-creations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great challenge to determine the origin of a lot of the  
things you rely on when you do shows like this. I'm not surprised 
that in 27 1/2 hours of programming we'll find ourselves confronting a 
mistake here and there,'' Yellin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound is a key area for such trespasses, accidental or  
otherwise, Biel said. In a BBC documentary that aired on American 
television, silent film of baseball great Babe Ruth was augmented 
with clearly modern special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	How could Biel be certain? When Ruth connected with the ball,  
there was the ping of an aluminum bat, not the crack of a wooden 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Film can be misused as well. The scarcity of footage from the  
earliest part of the century means that documentaries focusing on 
the period sometimes substitute clips from 15 or 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``But would you use footage from 1990 to indicate 1975?'' asked  
MacDonald, who owns a Chicago-based company that supplies film for 
many documentaries (``The Century'' among them). 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker David Grubin, whose many acclaimed PBS projects  
include ``America 1900'' and documentaries on U.S. presidents 
including Theodore Roosevelt, is well aware of the challenges of 
turning history into gripping television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basis of these films is the factual accuracy,'' Grubin  
said in an interview from New York City. ``But then you go one step 
removed from that: How do you actually evoke the past? ... What do 
you do about material where there's no film, or there's silent film 
and no sound? 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to do it in a way that's very clear this is an  
evocation, it's a suggestion,'' Grubin said. For ``TR,'' 
Roosevelt's famed battle charge up San Juan Hill was suggested by 
an impressionistic shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see a horse, only one horse, moving up that hill. You see  
it at six frames a second, it's slightly blurred and it's slowed 
down. So you're asking the viewer's imagination to play with the 
moment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one could think an attempt is being made to pass the sequence  
off as genuine, Grubin added. 
</P>
<P>
	All information is carefully researched as well: A film Grubin  
is preparing on Abraham Lincoln is being scrutinized, point by 
point, by Lincoln historians. 
</P>
<P>
	That approach gets high marks from observers like MacDonald, who  
considers PBS films to be consistently accurate and well made. 
</P>
<P>
	In a perfect world, he said, documentaries would be assembled  
with the care of PBS -- or that shown by CNN with its massive, 
24-hour ``Cold War'' project, which had the enthusiastic support of 
CNN founder Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, from respected producer Sir Jeremy Isaacs, had a  
solid staff of writers and researchers, enjoyed a nearly $15 
million budget and gathered original source material in Russia, 
China and from a variety of archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Most important, said Biel, it was closely scrutinized by  
historians. During the 3 1/2-year production period, about 100 
historians reviewed portions of the series; when it was finished, 
30 more reviewed it in its entirety, said CNN spokeswoman Maggie 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``Cold War'' has been criticized not for its accuracy,  
but for its interpretation of history. 
</P>
<P>
	That's probably inevitable when a film's subject is highly  
charged and deals with recent events. But there are instances of TV 
filmmaking when the perspective is deliberately skewed, MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are interpretations that are propagandistic, historical  
images that are distorted to argue a point of view,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled being approached by a researcher seeking film of  
retired Army Gen. William Westmoreland for a cable channel portrait 
of the key Vietnam War figure. A postwar interview in which 
Westmoreland said Asian mothers suffer less over a child's death 
because life is cheap in Asia was offered to the researcher, but 
was refused, according to MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	(The interview is included in Peter Davis' Academy Award-winning  
documentary ``Hearts and Minds.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``The researcher told me, essentially, that the network that was  
making the biography ... wanted happy, they wanted a positive 
image. They didn't want controversy,'' MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is inescapable: Television is a medium that puts  
entertainment first. But it's not unfairly demanding for viewers to 
expect the real story as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are learning their history on television and at the  
movies now,'' said Grubin. ``We have a tremendous responsibility to 
try to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sampson Named GM of IBL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Former Virginia basketball star Ralph  
Sampson was hired Tuesday as vice president and general manager of 
Richmond's International Basketball League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBL is scheduled to begin its 64-game schedule in November.  
</P>
<P>
	``Joining this franchise is a wonderful opportunity to be  
involved in the sport I love,'' Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson was The Associated Press player of the year three  
consecutive years at Virginia. He was the first player picked in 
the 1983 NBA draft and played for Houston, Golden State, Sacramento 
and Washington, earning rookie of the year honors and playing in 
four NBA all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBL will be open to any player over 18, with the presumption  
that those unable to meet NCAA academic standards or NBA-level 
talent would join. Officials expect some players to use the IBL as 
a springboard to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has franchises in Albuquerque, N.M.; Baltimore;  
Cincinnati; Jacksonville, Fla.; Las Vegas; San Diego; St. Charles, 
Mo.; Tampa, Fla.; and Richmond. The league hopes to expand to 20 
cities worldwide during the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Nanny Pleads Innocent to Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A nanny caught on videotape kicking,  
hitting and tossing children in her care pleaded innocent to 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Kahn, 59, a nanny for two families, was charged April 16  
with two counts of risk of injury to a minor. Kahn was freed on 
$50,000 bail. She entered her plea on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of an 11-month-old boy arranged to have a camera set  
up a clock in his home after finding his son and a 10-month-old 
girl in Ms. Kahn's care with dirty diapers and unexplained bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera allegedly caught Ms. Kahn repeatedly hitting, kicking  
and tossing the children. At one point, a cursing Ms. Kahn lifted 
the boy and slammed him face-down onto her thigh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kahn initially denied hitting the children, police said. But  
when she watched the video, authorities said, she told them she 
didn't remember hitting the children. 
</P>
<P>
	The families received the hidden camera from Know Your Nanny, a  
New Jersey company that checks out nannies.

<HEADLINE>  NHL Playoffs Hit by Slur Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It is easy to see that the NHL is not a  
place for the faint of heart. The best players will do anything to 
get an edge -- bite, spit, snort, and yes, unleash insults that can 
be personal and sometimes disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Clarke heard it all during his Hall of Fame career. Now  
Sandy McCarthy, one of Clarke's players on the Philadelphia Flyers, 
is accusing Toronto's Tie Domi of using a racial slur about his 
black heritage in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	The league began investigating the claim on Tuesday, but  
announced later in the day that it could not substantiate 
McCarthy's claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the on-ice or off-ice officials could confirm having  
heard an offensive remark,'' Colin Campbell, vice president and 
director of hockey operations, said in a statement from New York. 
``The league is on record as having a zero-tolerance policy 
regarding any racially motivated behavior, and any claim that a 
taunt or slur took place is an extremely serious one. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a thorough investigation, however, we have concluded  
this allegation cannot be independently substantiated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After trading shoves and words with Domi during Toronto's 2-1  
victory Monday night, McCarthy said the Maple Leafs forward 
``dropped an N-bomb on me'' during a heated exchange in the second 
period. Officials on the ice and players for both teams said they 
didn't hear the slur. Domi denied using it, saying instead that 
McCarthy had spit in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never use those kind of words, and he knows that,''  
Domi said. ``He can say what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL supervisor John D'Amico contacted commissioner Gary Bettman  
and Campbell immediately after the game. McCarthy talked with 
league officials early Tuesday morning and after practice later in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's awful for the game,'' McCarthy said Tuesday at  
the Flyers' training facility in suburban New Jersey. ``That's why 
it shouldn't be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you're a black player like Sandy McCarthy, none of us  
can understand what calling a person that name does to you,'' added 
Clarke, the Flyers' general manager who was captain of their last 
Stanley Cup championship team in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	After a workout at a separate New Jersey training site, Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn defended Domi. Asked why McCarthy would make such 
an accusation, Quinn said, ``I think he's bloody embarrassed by 
spitting in the man's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi added: ``It's something that will hopefully blow over. I've  
played with black guys in the league and I respect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy's father is black and his white mother is a native of  
Newfoundland. A day after the confrontation, McCarthy said he was 
sure about what Domi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt whatsoever,'' McCarthy said. ``You can't mistake that  
word for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past years, some NHL players have been accused of  
attacking the heritage of black players, whose numbers are still 
small but growing in a sport dominated by whites. In fact, McCarthy 
was involved in one of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	While with Tampa Bay, he and Darcy Tucker were cleared of  
accusations they made racial gestures at Florida Panthers forward 
Peter Worrell, who is black, during an exhibition game in October. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy was reminded of the incident when he said Tuesday,  
``I've been in trouble with the league zero times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was proven that nothing happened,'' McCarthy said. ``We  
talked to Peter on the phone, and he said, `I don't know what's 
going on, but I didn't hear anything and nothing happened.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, former Flyer Chris Gratton was accused of calling  
Worrell an ``ape.'' Gratton denied it, and the Panthers did not ask 
the league to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Simon and Craig Berube, then teammates with Washington,  
were found guilty of using slurs in separate cases in November 
1997. Both were suspended. Shortly thereafter, the league announced 
a ``zero-tolerance'' policy on the matter. Berube now plays for the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing a sport where there are nuts out there  
sometimes,'' Berube said. ``They're losing their minds, they're 
saying things. I say things. Everybody says stuff and does stuff 
they shouldn't do. You don't want to do it, but at the time you're 
not thinking like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers and Maple Leafs resume their best-of-7 series  
Thursday night in Philadelphia, with Toronto leading 2-1. It was 
unclear whether any action would be taken by the league before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said it was the first time anyone had attacked his race  
during a game, but Clarke said racial insults were prevalent during 
his career from 1969-84. The slurs were directed toward French 
Canadians or Europeans rather than blacks, who were even more rare 
in hockey when Clarke played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the league to control that kind of stuff,'' Clarke  
said. ``And if an official hears it, then they should do something 
to stop it.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore Views Long-Banned Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- More than 15 years after it was banned out of  
deference to neighboring Indonesia, the film ``The Year of Living 
Dangerously'' finally played in Singapore on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singapore Film Commission showed the 1982 movie, with much  
fanfare, as part of a program to inspire young filmmakers. 
Singapore's annual film festival gave it a high-profile debut the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, directed by Peter Weir, features Mel Gibson as a  
foreign correspondent covering the botched 1965 communist coup 
attempt in Indonesia, and the collapse of then-President Sukarno's 
authoritarian regime. Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt also star. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny island republic of Singapore, nearly surrounded by the  
huge Indonesian archipelago, banned the film in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	It lifted the ban late last year as ``part of a regular  
exercise'' by censors to ``review decisions on films previously 
disallowed,'' the government Films and Publications Department said 
in a written response to questions. It made no mention of political 
sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, an Australian who also directed ``The Truman Show,''  
``Witness,'' ``Green Card'' and other films, opened both showings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sign of maturity that the ban is gone, and I  
hope that the film festival suffers no further bans of any kind,'' 
he said at a news conference.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Set To Call Up Reservists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon intends to order 2,100 reservists  
to active duty in the first stage of a mobilization order that 
eventually will activate up to 33,000 reservists for the Kosovo 
conflict, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen today asked President Clinton  
for a formal go-ahead to begin the call-up, officials said, and 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was expected to 
sign the order shortly. The mandatory call-up is the first since 
the war against Yugoslavia began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Cohen  
intended to make an initial call-up of about 2,100 reservists, with 
more to get the call in the days ahead as additional U.S. aircraft 
are sent to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president fully recognizes this disrupts lives,'' Lockhart  
said. ``But this is what reservists train for. This is what their 
mission is. From time to time, they are called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, speaking at a Pentagon news conference with Israeli  
Defense Minister Moshe Arens, said the call-up would be made in 
stages, reflecting the needs of U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the 
top NATO commander, who is expanding allied air operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also said NATO would continue to insist that an armed  
international force be allowed to enforce a peace deal in Kosovo 
and that it be led by NATO rather than troops under the United 
Nations flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to insist on the conditions that NATO has set  
out,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said Monday that 30 more Air  
Force refueling aircraft -- including some to be flown by Air 
National Guard units -- have been ordered to Europe in support of 
the airstrikes against Yugoslavia. He said they would leave this 
weekend from bases in Arizona, California, Michigan and a fourth, 
unspecified state. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials awaited word, meanwhile, on a second visit by  
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
with three American POWs held in Belgrade. Red Cross officials said 
that in today's visit the soldiers handed over letters for delivery 
to their families. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials welcomed indications from an initial Red  
Cross visit Monday that the soldiers -- captured March 31 along the 
Macedonia-Kosovo border -- appeared to be in relatively good 
condition. But they complained that the POWs had been denied their 
full visitation rights under international law. 
</P>
<P>
	About three-quarters of the forces called to active duty are  
expected to be Air Force reserves. Some Army National Guard and 
Reserve members are likely to be called up to support the Apache 
helicopter operations in Albania. A smaller number of Navy and 
Marine Corps reservists also are likely to get the call to help 
with port management, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, briefing reporters at the  
Pentagon on Monday regarding the air campaign's progress, said 23 
Apache attack helicopters had arrived in Albania and were ready to 
begin attack missions against the Yugoslav army in Kosovo as soon 
as NATO commanders gave the signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, one of the Apaches crashed near Tirana while on a  
training mission. Officials at U.S. European Command in Germany 
said the two crew members were evacuated to an Army field hospital 
at Tirana and initial reports indicated they were in good 
condition. The cause of the crash was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald said bad weather again limited NATO operations Monday, but  
some planes managed to strike military targets, including Yugoslav 
armored vehicles in Kosovo and communications links elsewhere in 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these attacks are cumulatively starting to add up,'' Wald  
said, suggesting that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
eventually will be forced to change course in Kosovo and bend to 
NATO's will. ``His forces are starting to take a pretty good hit, 
in the field particularly. But you add that up to the fact that he 
can't sustain the force, he has no ammunition, (and) his command 
and control is going down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve call-up, which Cohen had predicted would happen a  
week ago, has been delayed while NATO worked out agreements with 
Hungary and other allied countries to host some of the additional 
300 strike and support aircraft requested by Army Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the NATO commander. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 of the extra 300 planes are to be refueling aircraft,  
reflecting Clark's desire to increase the tempo of air operations 
against Yugoslavia and enable the attacking planes to remain aloft 
for longer periods. Clark also asked for more strike planes as well 
as aircraft that jam air defense radars. 
</P>
<P>
	Many members of Congress have questioned NATO's conduct of the  
air campaign, but lawmakers are preparing an emergency spending 
bill to finance the Kosovo operation and military pay and benefit 
increases. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Monday 
he expected the bill to provide as much as $11 billion.

<HEADLINE> Disney Earnings Fall 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. reported Tuesday that  
second-quarter earnings fell 30 percent due to a drop in home video 
sales and soft sales in its merchandising business. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a charge related to the company's 1998 acquisition of  
43 percent of Infoseek Corp., Disney's earnings fell to $269 
million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $384 million, or 55 
cents a share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time charge, Disney's net income totaled $226  
million, or 41 cents a share, down 41 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's revenues rose to $5.51 billion from $5.24 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of Wall Street analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. But the company labeled its results 
disappointing, and warned that while its results are expected to 
improve in the second half of the Disney fiscal year, the 
improvements are not likely to overcome the first-half earnings 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner said in a statement Disney would  
focus on cutting costs to improve its profits. 
</P>
<P>
	During the second quarter, video sales fell from a year ago,  
when sales were boosted by the re-release of animated films from 
Disney's library. Current-year releases, including ``Mulan,'' 
didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also reported lower sales from licensed merchandise, due  
to economic problems overseas that have depressed consumer demand 
for non-necessities. The company also reported a slowing in sales 
at Disney Stores in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Brighter spots included Disney's theme parks and resorts  
division, which earned $1.4 billion during the quarter, 13 percent 
above the 1998 period. The higher earnings reflected higher guest 
spending and record attendance -- a change attributed to a full 
quarter of operations at the Disney Cruise Line, which launched in 
the prior year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting revenues were up 8 percent to $1.7 billion during  
the second quarter and rose 7 percent to $3.9 billion during the 
six month period. The increase was attributed to higher advertising 
income and subscriber growth at cable TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's broadcast holdings include the ABC television network  
and the Disney and ESPN cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first six months of the fiscal year were down  
26 percent to $848 million, or 41 cents per share, from $1.14 
billion, or 55 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $12.1 billion from $11.58 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Disney fell $2.50 to $32.50 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Littleton Says Goodbye to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He stood on the church stage, a stranger  
to the young man he was eulogizing, his voice wavering, his message 
simple: ``Thank you for saving my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Nick,'' the teen-ager said, looking out at hundreds  
of mourners crowding the church. ``I'm a senior at Columbine. I 
don't know Dan. ... I don't know his favorite color. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nick Foss did know Dan Rohrbough was a hero. Last Tuesday  
the 15-year-old freshman was shot as he held an exit door open for 
others so they could flee two teens on a shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough died on the sidewalk, just steps away from safety.  
</P>
<P>
	The service for Rohrbough was one of four held Monday for  
victims of last week's Columbine High School massacre. Three were 
for students; one was for teacher and coach William ``Dave'' 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more funerals were planned today, one week after the carnage  
in which Sanders and 12 students were killed. The two gunmen then 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rohrbough's funeral at Grace Presbyterian Church, the Rev.  
Dwight Blackstock commended the boy's selfless act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel guilty,'' he advised other teens who escaped thanks  
to Rohrbough. ``Thank God. Just thank God. And thank Danny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough's father, Brian, also spoke tenderly of his son, a boy  
who would save an entire year to buy Christmas gifts and loved 
computer games, cooking and tinkering with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking down at the casket, which included teddy bears and  
poems, his eyes misty, he said softly: ``Daniel Lee Rohrbough, in 
life and death, I'm proud of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, 2,500 people filled the sanctuary and two  
overflow rooms at the Trinity Christian Center to honor Sanders, 
who spent 24 of his 47 years at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders led  
students to safety until he was himself shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, 'Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sanders lay dying, students pulled out his wallet and held it  
open so he could see pictures of his wife and three daughters. 
``Tell my girls I love them,'' he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral, daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to  
daddy'' in which she said she'd always remember their talks on the 
porch. It contained a postscript: ``The girls and I would like you 
to know that we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sanders' 10 grandchildren, Austin Sanders, a preschooler,  
also spoke of his grandfather and how ``he always made good bedtime 
snacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At another funeral Monday, some 2,000 mourners gathered at the  
West Bowles Community Church to honor Cassie Bernall, the 
17-year-old girl who professed her belief in God just before she 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie's response does not surprise us,'' the family said in a  
statement. ``It was for her strong faith in God and His promise of 
eternal life that she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor George Kirsten told mourners, including rescuers who  
lined one wall of the church and received a standing ovation, that 
Cassie died a martyr. ``She went to the martyr's hall of fame,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people packed into the worship area of Foothills  
Bible Church at services for Lauren Townsend, an honor student and 
captain of the girls' varsity volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Townsend, 18, also was a member of the National Honor  
Society and a candidate for valedictorian 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family recalled a motivated, somewhat shy senior who  
wanted to become a biologist like her 25-year-old brother, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say that Lauren was a victim,'' he said. ``I don't  
think of her in that way. The ugly thing that happened last 
Tuesday, they couldn't conquer her beauty.''

	``My name is Nick,'' the teen-ager said, looking out at hundreds  
of mourners crowding the church. ``I'm a senior at Columbine. I 
don't know Dan. ... I don't know his favorite color. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nick Foss did know Dan Rohrbough was a hero. Last Tuesday  
the 15-year-old freshman was shot as he held an exit door open for 
others so they could flee two teens on a shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough died on the sidewalk, just steps away from safety.  
</P>
<P>
	The service for Rohrbough was one of four held Monday for  
victims of last week's Columbine High School massacre. Three were 
for students; one was for teacher and coach William ``Dave'' 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more funerals were planned today, one week after the carnage  
in which Sanders and 12 students were killed. The two gunmen then 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rohrbough's funeral at Grace Presbyterian Church, the Rev.  
Dwight Blackstock commended the boy's selfless act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel guilty,'' he advised other teens who escaped thanks  
to Rohrbough. ``Thank God. Just thank God. And thank Danny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough's father, Brian, also spoke tenderly of his son, a boy  
who would save an entire year to buy Christmas gifts and loved 
computer games, cooking and tinkering with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking down at the casket, which included teddy bears and  
poems, his eyes misty, he said softly: ``Daniel Lee Rohrbough, in 
life and death, I'm proud of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, 2,500 people filled the sanctuary and two  
overflow rooms at the Trinity Christian Center to honor Sanders, 
who spent 24 of his 47 years at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders led  
students to safety until he was himself shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, 'Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sanders lay dying, students pulled out his wallet and held it  
open so he could see pictures of his wife and three daughters. 
``Tell my girls I love them,'' he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral, daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to  
daddy'' in which she said she'd always remember their talks on the 
porch. It contained a postscript: ``The girls and I would like you 
to know that we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sanders' 10 grandchildren, Austin Sanders, a preschooler,  
also spoke of his grandfather and how ``he always made good bedtime 
snacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At another funeral Monday, some 2,000 mourners gathered at the  
West Bowles Community Church to honor Cassie Bernall, the 
17-year-old girl who professed her belief in God just before she 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie's response does not surprise us,'' the family said in a  
statement. ``It was for her strong faith in God and His promise of 
eternal life that she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor George Kirsten told mourners, including rescuers who  
lined one wall of the church and received a standing ovation, that 
Cassie died a martyr. ``She went to the martyr's hall of fame,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people packed into the worship area of Foothills  
Bible Church at services for Lauren Townsend, an honor student and 
captain of the girls' varsity volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Townsend, 18, also was a member of the National Honor  
Society and a candidate for valedictorian 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family recalled a motivated, somewhat shy senior who  
wanted to become a biologist like her 25-year-old brother, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say that Lauren was a victim,'' he said. ``I don't  
think of her in that way. The ugly thing that happened last 
Tuesday, they couldn't conquer her beauty.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Suburb OKs Anti-Gang Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- The blue-collar city where Al Capone once  
set up headquarters adopted an extraordinary ordinance Tuesday to 
run gang members out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ordinance, believed to be the first of its kind in the  
nation, those involved in illegal gang activity will have to 
promise not to do it again. If they refuse or go back on their 
word, they will have 60 days to leave Cicero or face a $500-a-day 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents and civil libertarians said the measure is unfair  
and fraught with problems. For example, the town can ban gang 
members who haven't been convicted of anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials said they expect legal challenges but maintain  
the measure is necessary to fight crime in the Chicago suburb of 
70,000. The ordinance was endorsed by 95 percent of voters two 
weeks ago, and the seven-member Town Board unanimously enacted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this town are petrified,'' said board member Mike  
Frederick. ``Some people are afraid to let their kids go outside 
because they're afraid they'll get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero officials also said they plan to file a $10 million  
federal civil rights lawsuit against 100 alleged gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they have a list of 300 to 400 known gang members,  
and town President Betty Loren-Maltese, the tough-talking widow of 
a Chicago mobster, said they will be the first targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials must hold a hearing and prove that the person is a  
gang member and involved in crime. Gang members would be allowed to 
stay in Cicero on a sort of one-year probation if they promised to 
refrain from gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Once banned, gang members could not return, not even to visit  
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance also applies to minors, whose parents would have  
to either move or give custody of their children to someone in 
another town, Ms. Loren-Maltese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Miller, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union's Chicago office, said the group would represent an ousted 
gang member who challenges the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has so many holes in it, we don't know how it's  
going to all sort out,'' he said. ``I don't understand what they're 
doing here, and I don't think they understand it either. It's 
almost silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Cicero residents complained that the ordinance unfairly  
targets Hispanics, the town's largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a shame when we have to blame our children for the  
problems of the town,'' said Delia Barajas, who was shouted down by 
Ms. Loren-Maltese and other board members when she tried to speak 
at Tuesday's meeting. ``We do have a gang problem and I care about 
public safety, but I'm angry because the decision was based not on 
the wishes of the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capone, the Chicago mob boss during the Prohibition era, ran his  
bootlegging empire from Cicero after being driven from Chicago. And 
the federal government has been investigating corruption in the 
town for the last three years.

<HEADLINE> Elway Announcement Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On Sunday, John Elway's football career will  
officially end, brought down by the sort of physical ailments that 
dog many 38-year-olds, let alone one who has been pounded for 16 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen confirmed Monday that Elway was  
leaving football because he ``felt in his own mind that he had some 
physical problems he didn't think he could overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamstring, back and rib injuries caused the usually durable  
Elway to miss all or part of six games last season. Of more 
concern, however, was a troublesome left knee. Elway played with a 
brace on that knee throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Limping around a golf course in California last weekend, he  
admitted he eventually will require an artificial knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said a news conference to announce the retirement,  
already delayed several times, will be held Sunday at a time and 
location to be determined later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be very sensitive to the families involved in the  
Columbine (school shooting) situation,'' Bowlen said. ``We wanted 
to make sure we did not in any way interrupt the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Sunday probably is the time when we could put  
this tragedy behind us, and perhaps John's press conference could 
be received as sort of a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's Denver Post, Elway left no doubt about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he told the newspaper. ``I  
seriously considered coming back, but I just couldn't make it 
because of my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen was in Australia nearly two weeks ago, promoting his  
team's Aug. 6 preseason game there, when he received a telephone 
message from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got the message, I knew what it was about,''  
Bowlen said. ``I called him back and basically it was a short 
conversation. He said, `Pat, I've decided to retire and go on with 
the rest of my life.' I told him I respected his decision and was 
really happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I couldn't get back until the following week, we  
originally decided to announce it on Wednesday (April 21). With 
what happened at Columbine (April 20), that was very much not 
appropriate. And it was just a matter of time before the press 
figured out what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, who said he will retire Elway's No. 7, insisted he would  
not lower his expectations for the two-time Super Bowl champions 
this season, despite the loss of the Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``John will be missed, for sure,'' Bowlen said. ``But our  
expectations are going to be the same. I think we've got a very 
solid football team. Bubby Brister is going to play well, and, of 
course, we have Terrell Davis and many other very good players on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had John come back for another  
year. I'd love to see him three-peat, do something that no other 
quarterback has done in history. But that wasn't to be. So we'll go 
forward. We'll be fine. I think we'll be a good football team, if 
not a great football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership void left by Elway's exit might be harder to  
overcome, Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves to talk about the comebacks and all the rest  
of those things, but there is much, much more to John's 
participation on this team than that,'' he said. ``His physical 
accomplishments are unparalleled, but my biggest concern right now 
is the man that John was -- the guy he was in the locker room and 
the stability he brought. Losing that is going to be difficult for 
us, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Bill Romanowski said he saw the retirement coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when he came back, he said that definitely was going  
to be his last year,'' Romanowski said. ``You have to believe what 
he said. In my mind, it's always been official. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl last year, John's  
intensity was unbelievable. I've never seen him like that. He 
wanted that game so badly. You just knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several other teammates, even when confronted with the  
evidence of Elway's decision, were in a state of denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to hear it come out of his mouth before I believe  
it,'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said. ``I just can't imagine 
football, much less the Broncos, without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, ``Until I hear it from him, he's still on the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, Elway's heir apparent, was reluctant to discuss his new  
status until the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, he does retire, I'm going to miss him,'' Brister  
said. ``Nobody will ever be John Elway. If he does retire, I hope 
we can keep the machine rolling.''

<HEADLINE> Russia's Gazprom Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom said Tuesday it  
produced 19 trillion cubic feet of gas in 1998, up 700 billion 
cubic feet from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom also produced 66.5 million barrels of condensed gas and  
oil in 1998, a 4.3 percent increase from the previous year, 
Gazprom's press service said, according to the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom is one of the biggest revenue earners in Russia, but the  
company has often fallen behind in paying its taxes, claiming that 
it is owed money by consumers, including government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the year, consumers owed about $7.3 billion to  
Gazprom for natural gas supplies, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the debt -- $5 billion -- was owed by consumers in  
Russia, and the balance by other former Soviet republics, the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Schooling Mighty Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Mighty Ducks are being schooled in  
playoff hockey. Class probably will be dismissed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Wings have a greatness and a meanness about them that  
allows them to win hockey games. That's what we have to learn to 
do,'' said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, whose Mighty Ducks are 
one loss away from being swept by Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've certainly been getting taught a pretty good lesson from  
the best team in hockey. This has to be a learning experience. We 
have to take something from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Paul Kariya, who along with linemate Teemu Selanne has  
been smothered by Detroit's defense, said: ``We're seeing what it 
takes to win in the playoffs. That's how you get better. When you 
see guys doing well, you try to take from their game, and take from 
their team game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to do, but we obviously have a long  
way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, which has outscored Anaheim 14-6 in building a 3-0  
series lead, can wrap it up with a victory tonight at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've found that fourth win in a series is always tougher,''  
Detroit left wing Brendan Shanahan said. ``That's a proud group of 
guys over there and we really saw them play a different game (in 
the Red Wings' Game 3 win). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not taking anything for granted.''  
</P>
<P>
	Despite their dire situation, Hartsburg and his players don't  
want to bow out without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll play as tough as we can,'' the coach said. ``We can't be  
down about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Kariya: ``I think we played our best game yesterday  
(Sunday), so we've been getting better. If we can win the next 
game, I think it would give us a sense of accomplishment, that 
we've gotten better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings won 5-3 and 5-1 in Detroit, then, although the  
Ducks played them tougher, won the third 4-2 in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' go-ahead goal in Game 3, scored by Steve Yzerman  
in the second period, came with Detroit holding a two-man advantage 
because of a dumb play by Anaheim defenseman Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored with Travis Green in the penalty box for elbowing  
and Grimson in the dressing room after getting a five-minute match 
penalty for checking Kris Draper into the glass from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimson, who said the game turned on that moment, and that his  
hit was ``overly aggressive'' and ``inappropriate,'' was suspended 
by the league Monday for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	While Grimson's mistake was costly, the story of the series has  
been the play of the Detroit defense, especially Chris Chelios and 
Nicklas Lidstrom on Selanne and Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne, who led the league with 47 goals, did not get off a  
single shot on goal in the third game. Kariya, limited to one shot 
in Game 2, managed three in the third game, but only one after the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Lidstrom and Chelios are both playing so well. And  
there are always three forwards back-checking at 100 mph,'' said 
Selanne, whose two goals in the series both came after the Red 
Wings had taken control of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings also have a decided edge in manpower.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the contenders, they have the most depth,'' Hartsburg  
said. ``They also have the most accomplished coach (Scotty Bowman, 
who has won eight Stanley Cups) ever to coach the game. It's quite 
a mix.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Refugees Arrive in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- With new stories of Serb forces  
separating the men from the women, another wave of Kosovo refugees 
has arrived in Macedonia and Albania to find overcrowded tent camps 
and unsanitary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3,000 refugees flowed into Macedonia on Monday, and  
aid groups scrambled to find room for the new arrivals in the 
country's six refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is we have no place to put these people anymore.  
We have no way to deal with this,'' said Paula Ghedini, a 
spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ``We have 
the tents ... but we don't have the land to put them up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest wave has brought more than 10,000 ethnic Albanians  
into Macedonia since late last week and has suggested Serb attacks 
were spreading south of Kosovo's provincial capital of Pristina 
into villages and mountain hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian authorities have kept tight controls on ethnic  
Albanian refugees and have been slow to open up new areas for 
shelter. The government fears a shift in its own demographic 
balance between Slavs and ethnic Albanians could destabilize the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, more than 135,000 refugees have entered Macedonia since  
Yugoslav authorities stepped up a crackdown after NATO bombing 
attacks began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid officials worry about sanitation problems and possible  
epidemics in the overcrowded camps. A U.N.-sponsored inoculation 
program for children was launched Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Albania, aid officials said 460 refugees from  
Kosovo, most women and children, walked across the border Monday. 
They spoke of being forced out of their homes by Serb forces in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government claims the refugees are fleeing NATO  
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The women and children said Serb forces came to their villages,  
rounded up the men and forced the others to leave immediately. They 
were herded onto buses and brought to the Morina border crossing, 
then left to walk into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left my 13-year-old brother and my uncle, I don't know if  
they're dead or alive. The police came, and they took all the women 
and children out of the village'' and then to Albania, said Mirgeta 
Troli, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Women and children from another group of 230 people told Ray  
Wilkinson of the UNHCR that Serb forces rounded them up in southern 
Kosovo after fighting in the area six days ago drove off the men. 
</P>
<P>
	They were put into buses and other vehicles, they said. Some  
younger women were separated from the others for 30 minutes to two 
hours. Wilkinson said none of the refugees said they were raped but 
there had been implications of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most they would say was that many women were touched,''  
Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson said a group of 24 men also crossed the border after  
being separated from their wives and children. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the men, Serb forces came into their village near  
Suva Reka on Monday and called out for all people between the ages 
of 15 to 65 years old. Twenty-four men were told they would be 
doing physical labor for the police but were later taken to a 
border police station and ordered to walk into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second incident in recent days in which men were  
separated from a village and sent out of Kosovo, leaving the women 
and children behind. The women left behind, Wilkinson said, were 
reluctant to leave on their own.

Wilkinson of the UNHCR that Serb forces rounded them up in southern 
Kosovo after fighting in the area six days ago drove off the men. 
</P>
<P>
	They were put into buses and other vehicles, they said. Some  
younger women were separated from the others for 30 minutes to two 
hours. Wilkinson said none of the refugees said they were raped but 
there had been implications of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most they would say was that many women were touched,''  
Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson said a group of 24 men also crossed the border after  
being separated from their wives and children. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the men, Serb forces came into their village near  
Suva Reka on Monday and called out for all people between the ages 
of 15 to 65 years old. Twenty-four men were told they would be 
doing physical labor for the police but were later taken to a 
border police station and ordered to walk into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second incident in recent days in which men were  
separated from a village and sent out of Kosovo, leaving the women 
and children behind. The women left behind, Wilkinson said, were 
reluctant to leave on their own.

<HEADLINE> Umps Wary of Strike-Zone Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league umpires are angry over baseball's  
new directive asking teams to chart pitches and file a report about 
strike zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nonsensical when you look at it,'' Richie Phillips, head  
of the umpires' union, told the New York Post. ``It's juvenile. 
It's just another case of Big Brother watching over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires perceive the directive as an attempt to undermine  
their authority, the newspaper said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the commissioner's office has the right to  
unilaterally impose an evaluation system on umpires,'' Pat 
Campbell, associate counsel for the major league umpires told The 
Associated Press. ``They have to negotiate with us first. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're using club personnel to do this. That seems very  
ineffective to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of the Office of the  
Commissioner, sent a letter to all teams earlier this month, asking 
that a high-ranking front-office official chart pitches, then file 
a report at the end of each homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson's memo said the directive's ``purpose is to stay on top  
of trends and provide as much feedback as possible to the league 
presidents and umpire supervisors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a Feb. 19 memo, Alderson told the umpires to raise the top of  
the strike zone to 2 inches above the top of the uniform pants -- 
still below the definition called for in the official playing 
rules: the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of 
the uniform pants.

<HEADLINE> Carradines Sue People Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Kung Fu'' actor David Carradine and wife  
Marina Anderson didn't think much of a Jan. 11 write-up in People, 
so they sued for libel and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses People parent Time Warner Inc. of violating  
a ``gentleman's agreement'' for a ``nice'' story in exchange for 
the couple dropping a lawsuit against another of Time Warner's 
subsidiaries, Who Weekly in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, People wrote of alleged substance abuse and called  
Carradine ``washed up,'' ``unemployable'' and ``a drunk.'' The 
story also falsely stated that he was ``court-martialed out of the 
Army,'' said the couple's attorney, Neville L. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner magazine chief Norman Pearlstine met personally with  
the couple and ``profusely apologized'' for the Who Weekly piece 
that called Anderson a porn star, according to the lawsuit filed 
Monday. He had promised that a nice story on the Carradines would 
be done for People or Entertainment Weekly, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	People magazine said it stands behind its story.  
</P>
<P>
	``The lawsuit is totally false and we intend to demonstrate in  
court that their lawsuit is totally without merit,'' People 
magazine spokeswoman Susan Ollinick said.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Financing OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge gave final approval  
Tuesday to a $750 million financing package allowing Service 
Merchandise Co. to keep paying suppliers and employees as the 
retail chain undergoes bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George C. Paine II's approval of the  
financing by Citibank and BankBoston was expected, but ``it's a big 
relief,'' Service Merchandise CEO Sam Cusano said after a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  
from creditors March 28, claiming total debts of $1.29 billion. The 
company has $1.46 billion in assets, about $3 billion a year in 
sales and more than 21,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was forced into bankruptcy by five vendors,  
including Remington and Samsonite, who say they are owed more than 
$27 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There potentially are thousands of claimants. A claims deadline  
likely will be set early this summer, said company attorney Jack 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws serves to shield a company  
from its creditors so it can reorganize and get a second chance at 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's financing package expires on June 30, 2001, and  
Service Merchandise officials hope to emerge from Chapter 11 before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, Service Merchandise has struggled to stay  
competitive with mega-discounters including Wal-Mart and Circuit 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reorganized its operations last year, basically  
eliminating the catalog and showroom aspects, and narrowing its 
product offerings to jewelry, housewares and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is the No. 2 U.S. jewelry mass marketer behind Zale  
Corp. and is No. 441 on the Fortune 500, but sales and stocks have 
continued to sag. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise reported $3.6 billion in sales in 1997 but  
had $3.1 billion last year. And shares that traded at $15 in 1993 
were trading at 25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the company changed its leadership, cut jobs  
at its Brentwood headquarters, south of Nashville, and began 
closing more than a third of its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	After the closings are complete later this year, Service  
Merchandise will operate 223 stores in 32 states.

<HEADLINE> Bentley-Rolls Hopes To Expand Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A venerable British manufacturer of ultra-luxury  
cars for the few, now under the ownership of Germany's automaker 
for the masses, is turning its attention to the U.S. market with 
the ambitious goal of increasing sales sixfold within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.'s hand-built  
Rolls-Royces and Bentleys are priced well beyond reach of most 
Americans -- as much as $340,000 for the high-performance Bentley 
Azure convertible. These cars won't be targeted to most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stratospheric prices and exclusivity are part of the cache of  
Bentley and Rolls. But exclusivity has its limits when you're 
trying to make money selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new ownership of Volkswagen AG, which brought an  
infusion of cash and plans for an expanded Bentley line, the 
manufacturer of cars for the richest of the rich is targeting the 
world's biggest luxury car market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting challenge -- we've got a lot to do,'' said  
Alasdair Stewart, who is in charge of the Bentley and Rolls 
operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to sell 3,000 cars annually in the United States  
within five years. It's an ambitious target given that only 537 
Bentleys and Rolls-Royces were sold in the United States last year. 
Even in its best year, 1990, the number was 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	And within a few years, VW won't have any Rolls-Royces left to  
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because while VW acquired Bentley and the Rolls-Bentley  
assembly plant in Crewe, England, last year from Vickers PLC, rival 
German automaker BMW AG cut a deal to get the Rolls-Royce brand in 
2003. BMW will get Rolls in name only -- it will have to build its 
Rolls-Royces someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts figure BMW got the better end of the deal. For $66  
million, BMW got a marque that's better known worldwide without the 
cost of having to upgrade an aging plant. VW paid $790 million and 
has said it will spend an additional $850 million on the plant and 
developing new Bentleys. 
</P>
<P>
	But other analysts argue that Bentley offers VW a chance to  
develop and expand the brand somewhat ``downmarket'' -- if you can 
consider $100,000 cars downmarket -- in a way that Rolls-Royce 
couldn't without hurting its most-expensive, most-exclusive image. 
</P>
<P>
	The target audience will be rich, aging baby boomers -- a growing  
demographic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley will try to position itself with new models that are a  
step above the top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz S-class or the BMW 
7-series sedans. (Mercedes-Benz is also planning to expand upmarket 
with its sleek, limited-edition Maybach ultra-luxury sedan.) 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Jacobs, an industry consultant who tracks the luxury  
market, said VW likely will also take advantage of Bentley's racing 
heritage by heavily promoting its image as a driver's car. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where Bentley is more different from Rolls-Royce; it's  
more of a car for people who want to drive it, as opposed to people 
who want to be chauffeur-driven,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bentley lacking the same level of brand recognition in the  
United States as the competition, the company is spending $1.5 
million on ads in such publications as The Wall Street Journal and 
Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	One full-page ad, which appeared recently in the newspaper,  
describes a speeding Bentley Continental R as ``first-class 
travel.'' The tagline: ``Just bear in mind that you'll never be 
able to upgrade from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs sees Bentley's lack of image as an opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of baggage being carried by the Bentley  
brand,'' she said. ``It gives them a lot of freedom in 
communicating with the target audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Jim Hall of AutoPacific Inc. said Bentley runs the risk  
of offending its loyal owners if it increases its volume too much 
and loses some of its exclusivity. The strategy is most likely to 
succeed if the new models are drastically different from the 
current higher-priced cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting kind of brand management to do, but  
it's also the most difficult,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces are sold at 35  
dealers scattered across the country -- most offer the British cars 
as a sideline. The core markets are California, southern Florida 
and the tri-state area around New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company does not plan to increase the number of dealers, but  
is reassessing some dealer locations. Stewart said Houston, Dallas 
and Seattle are markets that may have untapped potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he sees Bentley's competition as not just other  
high-priced cars, but high-priced speedboats, jets, jewels and 
other discretionary playthings. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical Bentley buyer's net worth is between $8 million and  
$10 million. He or she is generally an entrepreneur and 
international traveler, owns up to six luxury cars, and has two or 
three homes. The average age is 53 for Rolls-Royce, 51 for Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only real common denominator is they have a lot of  
money,'' Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Court To Rule in LVMH Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- An Amsterdam appeals court said  
Tuesday it will rule May 27 on a dispute between LVMH Moet Hennessy 
Louis Vuitton of France and its takeover target, the Gucci fashion 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH asked the courts in the lawsuit filed in April, a month  
after announcing a hostile takeover bid, to overturn measures taken 
by Gucci to avoid the bid, including issuing new shares to a third 
party, Pinault Primtemps Redoute of France. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a written statement Tuesday, banned the Italian  
group from investing $2.9 billion in proceeds from the sale of the 
40 percent stake to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	PPR's purchase of the 40 percent stake effectively diluted the  
34 percent stake LVMH already had in Gucci to around 20 percent and 
reduced its voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci said the sale was needed to fend off LVMH's ``creeping  
takeover.'' It will hold its annual shareholders' meeting after the 
court's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Makes '99 Debut for Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With Cliff Floyd healthy, the Florida Marlins no  
longer look quite so sickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's feeble lineup received a boost Tuesday when Floyd was  
activated from the disabled listed and inserted as the cleanup 
hitter against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' left fielder missed the first 19 games with a  
sprained left knee. In his absence, Florida went 5-14 and averaged 
just 3.6 runs per game, worst in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lift for us to have him in the lineup,'' manager John  
Boles said. ``We need a transfusion. I think it will give everybody 
a psychological boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd hit .282 last year with 22 homers, 90 RBIs and 27 stolen  
bases in 153 games, all career highs. He then signed a four-year, 
$19 million contract -- the biggest payroll commitment by the 
Marlins since the breakup of their 1997 World Series championship 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been frustrating not playing, because they signed me to  
this deal,'' said Floyd, 26. ``You feel obligated to live up to it. 
They took care of you, so you want to take care of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the Marlins' best player coincided with the return  
of their best pitcher. Right-hander Alex Fernandez, recovering from 
inflammation in his right shoulder, made his first start Tuesday 
night since April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said he's not 100 percent yet and wants to be careful not  
to do too much too soon. The stint on the disabled list was his 
fourth since 1995, and he's trying to shake a reputation for being 
injury-prone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to win the World Series, so I've got to do the  
right things so I can be out there every day,'' he said. ``I won't 
try to be Superman. I just want to go out there and be smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's fine with Boles.  
</P>
<P>
	``He might rip it up, or it might take him awhile,'' Boles said.  
``But it helps the other hitters because pitchers have to pitch 
differently, and he's a longball threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's sprained knee limited him to 14 games in spring  
training. His return was delayed when doctors found torn cartilage 
that required surgery April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .293 with one homer in spring training but found himself  
pressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency to put pressure on myself,'' Floyd said. ``I  
have the talent. I have everything I need to play at a high level. 
I just need to relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Floyd on the roster, Florida optioned  
outfielder Tim Hyers to Triple-A Calgary.

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Defensive Tackle Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns took a step toward shoring  
up their run defense Tuesday by signing free agent defensive tackle 
Jerry Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal, contingent on Ball passing a physical, were  
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive tackle position was becoming a concern for the new  
Browns, especially since Cleveland will rejoin the AFC Central, 
which has powerful running backs such as Fred Taylor 
(Jacksonville), Jerome Bettis (Pittsburgh) and Eddie George 
(Tennessee). 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, who played for Minnesota in 1998, ``will provide  
additional depth on the defensive line and is one of the premier 
defensive tackles against the run in the NFL,'' said Dwight Clark, 
the Browns director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, a 12-year veteran and three time Pro-Bowler, had 15  
tackles for losses last season. He started 25 consecutive games at 
nose tackle for the Vikings in the past two seasons and had been 
seeking about $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball started his career with Detroit, then played for the old  
Browns in 1993, before moving to the Raiders and then Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 320-pound Ball is the third important defensive free agent  
the Browns have lured from the Vikings. Cleveland previously signed 
cornerback Corey Fuller and defensive end Derrick Alexander.

<HEADLINE> Source: Reggie Lewis Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- One of four doctors accused of malpractice in the  
death of Celtics star Reggie Lewis has reached a settlement with 
Lewis' widow, a legal source told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Rutherford, now a cardiologist in Texas, settled with  
Donna Harris-Lewis, the source said. Terms of the settlement, also 
reported Tuesday by The Boston Globe, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in the lawsuit against the remaining three  
doctors were scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the defendants, Dr. Gilbert Mudge, claims that Lewis told  
him he used cocaine, which could have contributed to his death. 
Harris-Lewis denies her husband ever used the drug and said she 
sued to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Mudge, the suit names Drs. Mark Creager and Peter  
Friedman, who, like Rutherford, were consultants. Calls to 
Rutherford's lawyer were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, an attorney for Harris-Lewis, declined to comment  
on the reported settlement Tuesday, citing a judge's order not to 
speak publicly about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis died at age 27 while shooting baskets at Brandeis  
University in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months earlier, he collapsed during a playoff game and a  
team of New England Baptist Hospital doctors diagnosed him with a 
life-threatening heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where a team  
led by Mudge diagnosed him with a less-harmful neurological 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy revealed a badly damaged heart.

<HEADLINE> Moon Signs 2-Year Deal With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Warren Moon apparently will finish his  
career where Joe Montana and Marcus Allen did -- as a member of the 
Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's most prolific passers was to be introduced  
today as the backup to Elvis Grbac of the Chiefs. The 42-year-old 
Moon, an unrestricted free agent after playing for Seattle last 
year, signed a two-year contract with the Chiefs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, who started 10 games for the Seahawks last year, joined  
the Chiefs knowing full well he was assuming a backup role, Chiefs 
president and general manager Carl Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon reportedly received a $200,000 signing bonus and $800,000  
salary, plus incentives for 1999. He would get $2.2 million in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren gives us the veteran quarterback experience that every  
team would like to have,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City today announced the signing of veteran linebacker  
Marvcus Patton to a three-year contract as an unrestricted free 
agent. He spent the past four seasons with Washington -- including 
three as the Redskins' leading tackler -- and the preceding five 
with the Buffalo Bills, playing in 144 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs signed Moon primarily for his 14 years of NFL  
experience as they begin the third year of trying to develop Grbac 
into a top-flight quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try to use him in any way that I can,'' said Grbac, who  
has been bothered by injuries for two straight seasons, and last 
year lost his confidence as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac missed 16 games the past two seasons because of injuries  
and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after recovering from an injury in last season's opening  
game, Grbac was kept on the bench in favor of Rich Gannon. Grbac 
came back to start the season finale at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Gannon has signed as a free agent with the Raiders  
and Marty Schottenheimer resigned as coach. Todd Collins is the 
Chiefs' third quarterback, but has not played a down. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer insisted despite the consistently fine play of  
Gannon last year that Grbac was the Chiefs' quarterback of the 
future. New coach Gunther Cunningham has repeated that refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon continues a Chiefs trend that brought both Montana and  
Allen into the clubhouse in the twilight of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the really important factors was viewing the prior  
experience of Marcus Allen and Joe Montana,'' said Moon's agent, 
Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to have a career resurrection in Kansas City. They  
seemed to have been treated in a very classy manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and Cunningham emphasized Moon's leadership skills.  
</P>
<P>
	``His experience on the field, in the classroom and in the  
locker room will be similar to that which Marcus Allen brought 
us,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be very helpful to Elvis Grbac in his  
development,'' Cunningham said. ``I think the players will respond 
well to him because I think he carries respect throughout the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac, signed as a free agent from the 49ers in 1997, got the  
Chiefs off to an 8-1 start that season before he fractured his left 
collarbone while being sacked against Pittsburgh and missed six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a shoulder injury against Oakland in the opener last  
season and remained out until making a start Nov. 8 at Seattle. 
After throwing two first-half interceptions that led to two 
touchdowns, Grbac was replaced by Gannon and remained on the bench 
until he started the final game at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac threw two interceptions in the victory over the Raiders  
that was small consolation for a team that finished 7-9 and was 
among the NFL's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon passed for 1,632 yards with 11 touchdown passes and eight  
interceptions for the Seahawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon played in the Canadian Football League before joining the  
Houston Oilers. He played at Minnesota before going to the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moon has completed 3,972 of 6,786 passes for 49,097  
yards, with 290 touchdown passes and 232 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks third in NFL history in pass attempts, pass completions  
and passing yardage. He is tied for fourth with Johnny Unitas in 
touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon has passed for 3,000 yards in a season nine times, and for  
300 yards in a game 49 times. 
</P>
<P>
	His 527 yards against the Chiefs in Kansas City on Dec. 16,  
1990, was the second most in NFL history behind the 554 yards of 
Norm Van Brocklin in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Food Burglar's Sentence Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two appellate judges considered Gregory  
Taylor, who tried to pry open a church kitchen door, as a 
third-strike felon. A dissenting judge likened him to a sad 
character from ``Les Miserables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority prevailed, and Taylor, 37, is serving 25 years to  
life in prison for his third felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was defended Monday by a spokesman for Attorney  
General Bill Lockyer, who believes the three-strikes law has proper 
safeguards against excessive sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spirit of three strikes is one that gives the court and  
our district attorneys the discretion to determine who can be 
sentenced under three strikes,'' spokesman Nathan Barankin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was spotted by security guards early one morning in July  
1997 using a board to try to open a screen over the kitchen door of 
St. Joseph's Church in Los Angeles. Taylor told a policeman he knew 
a priest at the church and was trying to enter the kitchen to get 
something to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, the Rev. Allan McCoy said he had known Taylor for  
about nine years and sometimes gave him food. Taylor also had been 
allowed to sleep in a church building in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was convicted of burglary for entering the kitchen to  
steal. He had two robbery convictions from the 1980s and a 1988 
parole violation, said Deputy Attorney General Chung Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced under the three-strikes law, which requires a  
term of 25 years to life for any felony committed by a defendant 
with two previous serious or violent felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's appellate lawyer, Howard J. Specter, did not return  
telephone calls Monday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge James Dunn refused to use his authority to  
disregard one or both of Taylor's past convictions, which would 
have lessened his sentence. He said the jury must have concluded 
Taylor meant to steal the church's valuable possessions, which 
included chalices and alms boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal issue in the appeal was Dunn's refusal to instruct the  
jury that the crime would be only trespassing, and not burglary, if 
Taylor believed he had the right or permission to take food from 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd District Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 ruling Friday, said  
Taylor could not offer such a claim since the food was inside a 
locked church. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Earl Johnson dissented, invoking Jean Valjean, the hero  
of Victor Hugo's ``Les Miserables,'' who spent 19 years in a penal 
colony after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hungry, homeless man is sent away for 25 years to life for  
trying to break into a church so he could eat some food he thought 
the church would be glad for him to have'' -- a defense the jury 
wasn't allowed to consider, Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> F-16 Pilots Eject Before US Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An F-16 based at Luke Air Force Base crashed  
while on a training mission, the sixth such crash in six months. 
Both pilots ejected safely. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness, Dave Barko, said he and his wife heard an engine  
starting and stopping about a dozen times as the jet fighter 
approached the White Tank Mountains west of Phoenix on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a roar and then there was just dead silence,'' said  
Barko, who lives near the base. He said the plane ``just kept 
circling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those aboard were identified as Maj. Kevin Grove, the  
instructor, and Capt. Stephan Kleinheyer, a student pilot, both of 
the 63rd Fighter Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
	Sr. Airman Jill Prost, a spokeswoman, said both pilots appeared  
to be in good condition. Luke is the nation's premier training 
ground for F-16 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	All 400 of the nation's F-16s equipped with Pratt &AMP; Whitney  
engines were grounded after an F-16 based at Luke crashed during a 
training mission on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	An inspection revealed hairline cracks in the engines of some of  
the 190 F-16s based at Luke that are equipped with Pratt &AMP; Whitney 
220 engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had said the planes would not fly until the cracks  
were repaired. Flights were resumed several days ago and were back 
at the normal level of about 160 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-16s flying in the Kosovo airstrikes do not use the Pratt &AMP;  
Whitney 220 engine.

<HEADLINE> Two Rangers Shot at Oregon St. Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANZANITA, Ore. (AP) -- An unarmed ranger was killed and another  
shot in the face Tuesday by a gunman who fled a rugged coastal park 
in the slain ranger's truck and led police on a high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry G. Cole was arrested when the truck skidded in a gravel  
pit as he tried to avoid a roadblock. A motive for the shooting 
wasn't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, 52, allegedly confronted the rangers at Oswald West State  
Park on the Oregon coast as one cleaned the bathroom and the other 
did outside maintenance, police said. The gunman emerged from the 
restroom with the ranger working inside and forced both rangers to 
walk up a trail, where he shot them, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slain ranger was identified as Danny Blumenthal, 50. The  
second ranger, 51-year-old John Kerwin, was shot twice in the jaw 
and was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerwin hiked out of the park and flagged down a motorist, who  
drove him to a fire station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fell to the ground and played dead after he was shot,''  
Shelly Solum, an ambulance service spokeswoman, told The Daily 
Astorian. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman fled in Blumenthal's Ford Ranger pickup.  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Meinen, the state's parks director, said rangers don't carry  
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally we haven't felt that we need them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The park 65 miles west of Portland is popular with surfers. It  
has overnight camping overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Critics Seek To Cancel Manson Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Critics of shock rocker Marilyn Manson want  
his next show canceled in light of what they say may have been his 
appeal to the students who opened fire at a Littleton, Colo., high 
school last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manson's message, which targets youth, is one of destruction,  
hopelessness and violence,'' said Tom Prichard, president of the 
Minnesota Family Council. ``It preys on vulnerable youth and may be 
just what causes some to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton said Monday her office  
had received hundreds of calls to protest the show, which was 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are opposed to Marilyn Manson, assume your parental  
responsibility and don't let your child attend the concert,'' she 
said. ``An empty house ... is the best way to discourage future 
concerts of this genre in our community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson had been scheduled to headline a show in Denver on  
Friday, but the event was canceled by the sponsor, a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rampage, Manson, who takes his stage name from Marilyn  
Monroe and cult murderer Charles Manson, released a statement 
saying, ``It's tragic and disgusting any time young people's lives 
are taken in an act of senseless violence. My condolences go out to 
the students and their families.''

<HEADLINE> Civilian Imaging Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A civilian satellite that can take the kind  
of detailed photos that previously only spy satellites could 
produce disappeared shortly after it was launched Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An Athena II rocket carrying the Ikonos 1 satellite roared off a  
Vandenberg Air Force Base launch pad at 11:22 a.m., bound for an 
orbit 400 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications with the spacecraft ended about eight minutes  
after liftoff, as planned, but it failed to re-establish contact as 
expected later in the flight. Officials could not say whether it 
remained in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Imaging, the Denver company that planned to operate the  
satellite, has already built a spare Ikonos. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1, named after the Greek word for ``image,'' has a camera  
capable of resolving objects one meter square -- about 10 square 
feet. That means the satellite would be able to distinguish between 
a car and truck, according to Space Imaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, only military satellites have been able to photograph  
Earth in such detail. Some experts said they worried that images 
from Ikonos 1 could be used by terrorists or enemy governments to 
plan attacks or spot mobilizing troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government approved the satellite in 1994. Space  
Imaging, a privately held company, said it expects its clients to 
use the images for urban planning, environmental monitoring, 
mapping, assessing the scope of natural disasters, oil and gas 
exploration, monitoring farmland and planning communication 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pike, an authority on space reconnaissance with the private  
Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C., pointed out 
that the government will not allow images of some places to be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dilemma that you've got, though, is how do you make sure  
that Serbia doesn't know where American troops are while making 
sure that American news media is able to cover the war,'' Pike 
said. ``And we're obviously going to have a hard time drawing that 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was built by Lockheed Martin Commercial Space  
Systems. Raytheon built the communications, image processing and 
other elements of the system. Eastman Kodak built the digital 
camera system.

<HEADLINE>  Palestinians Set To OK U.S. Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Yasser Arafat convened the PLO  
leadership today to decide whether to declare a Palestinian state 
on May 4 or -- the more likely choice -- extend peace talks with 
Israel for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	An extension was proposed by President Clinton in a letter to  
Arafat, and the Palestinian leader called the plan ``more than 
positive.'' Arafat had initially pledged to declare statehood on 
May 4, the target date for a permanent peace accord with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision on a statehood declaration is up to the  
124-member Palestinian Central Council, a PLO body stacked with 
Arafat loyalists. Still, Arafat adviser Nabil Amr predicted heated 
debate, and said it would be difficult to anticipate the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The council began its closed-door debate today in a packed  
meeting room at Arafat's seaside office in Gaza City. With 
observers, more than 100 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opening speech, Arafat said the Palestinians had the right  
to declare independence, but did not mention a date, said Ahmed 
Abdel Rahman, the secretary general of the Palestinian Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat also blamed the deadlock in peace talks on Israel, but  
did not let on how he felt about giving negotiations more time, 
Abdel Rahman said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it is widely expected that Arafat will push for  
postponing a statehood declaration. A unilateral move on May 4 
would help Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 
win re-election May 17 and also would anger the United States at a 
time when Palestinian-U.S. relations are blossoming. 
</P>
<P>
	There were conflicting reports on how long the council would be  
in session. The chairman, Salim Zanoun, initially said he did not 
expect a decision for several days or even until after the Israeli 
election. However, after the morning session he said he expected 
the council to make a decision by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In dragging out the debate beyond the Israeli election, Arafat  
would avoid giving ammunition to Netanyahu, who is trying to 
portray himself as the only candidate able to stand up to 
Palestinian demands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Israel radio today, Netanyahu repeated that he would never  
permit creation of a Palestinian state. ``He (Arafat) knows that as 
long as I'm prime minister of Israel, such a state with Jerusalem 
as its capital will not be established,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister said he sent Arafat ``a very sharply worded  
message'' two days ago that the Palestinians must not declare 
statehood unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank in  
retaliation for a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Palestinian Central Council said they were not  
impressed by Israel's threats. ``It is the Palestinians who will 
decide'' on statehood, said council member Suleiman Najjab. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of two opposition groups attended today's debate  
-- the Islamic militant group Hamas and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, a small radical PLO faction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas -- represented by the group's founder, Ahmed Yassin and  
three senior members -- demanded that Arafat walk away from the 
peace agreements with Israel. Hamas representatives set a precedent 
by attending the session, although only as observers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West Bank town of Nablus, more than 1,000 Palestinians,  
including members of Arafat's Fatah movement, marched in the 
streets today, demanding statehood be declared May 4. Dozens of 
masked demonstrators fired shots in the air and burned Israeli 
flags and a wooden model of a Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, about 200 supporters of another small Palestine  
Liberation Organization faction, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, demonstrated outside Arafat's office. 
Marchers chanted: ``Yes to the state of the free on the fourth of 
May.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Recover From Early Retreat / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices rose Tuesday, as the dollar  
gained against the yen while U.S. officials pushed Japan to do more 
to stimulate demand for goods across Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32  
point, or $4.38 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.54 percent from 5.57 
percent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping bonds were gains in the dollar against the yen, boosting  
the allure of U.S. assets to foreign investors who must convert 
their proceeds to other currencies. The dollar had its biggest gain 
against the yen in a week on indications that Japan won't spend 
more to help its economy out of the worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen came as Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin exhorted Japan and Europe to do more to stimulate 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
finished between unchanged and up 1/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities rose 3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.48 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from Monday to 4.37 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.58 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point to 4.41 percent. One-year yields were 4.68 percent 
as the discount was unchanged at 4.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.88 percent from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 123 15/16 from 123 25/32. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.26 from 5.25 percent Monday.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sale Agreement Is Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the Washington Redskins, the only change  
will be at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Norv Turner will stay, along with general manager Charley  
Casserly and other Redskins employees if Daniel Snyder is approved 
as the new owner of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees of the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke announced  
an agreement Monday to sell the team, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and 
the Redskin Park training facility to Snyder, a local 
communications executive, for $800 million -- a record price for any 
sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to retain both Norv Turner and Charley Casserly in  
their current positions with the Redskins,'' Snyder said. 
``Football will be a new business for me, and I am going to need 
experienced football personnel to run the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale will be examined by the NFL's finance  
committee and submitted before league owners at their May 25-26 
meetings in Atlanta. Approval is expected, which would make Snyder, 
34, the youngest majority owner in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday marked the second time the trustees have agreed to sell  
the team for $800 million. In January, they reached an agreement 
with a group headed by New York real estate magnate Howard Milstein 
and including Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein never won favor with most of the 31 NFL owners, 24  
of whom must vote to approve the sale of any team. Some owners said 
he was using too much borrowed money to finance the deal, while 
others worried that he would be a maverick owner because of his 
contentious stewardship of the NHL's New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	When Milstein withdrew April 7, Snyder formed his own group. It  
includes members of Snyder's family, plus New York Daily News 
publishers Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner. Zuckerman is also 
publisher of U.S. News &AMP; World Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snyder group matched the Milstein-Snyder offer of $800  
million. Snyder allayed financing concerns by putting more than 
$100 million cash behind the bid, and his promise to retain Turner 
and Casserly offers a sense of continuity that could help win the 
votes of several owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based of our own review ... and our discussions with the  
league office, we believe the financing and ownership structure 
will comply with NFL rules,'' the trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price would shatter the record $530 million paid by  
Alfred Lerner last year for the expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, when Milstein and Snyder were partners, Snyder  
strongly hinted at major personnel changes if the group bought the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his theme is stability.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am writing to assure you that if I am approved, I intend to  
retain all of you,'' Snyder wrote in a letter to all employees at 
Redskin Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Turner nor Casserly would comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The only person who wouldn't survive the ownership change is  
team president John Kent Cooke, who reacted bitterly to losing the 
battle to keep the team in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale and the manner in which it has been conducted is an  
extreme disappointment to me personally,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke, who became the Redskins' majority owner in  
1974, died April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the team to his son, he 
instructed that the team and stadium be sold and the money used to 
establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke was among several bidders, but he could not  
match the $800 million offer made by the Milstein-Snyder group in 
January. Cooke made a new offer this month after Milstein withdrew, 
but once again it was substantially less than $800 million. He took 
the offer off the table last week because the trustees were 
negotiating only with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The executors and their representatives stated that accepting  
the highest bid was their fiduciary obligation required to fulfill 
my father's wishes and to comply with the law,'' Cooke said. ``None 
of these claims is correct, and the result of this decision is a 
loss of a family business and a personal tragedy to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have speculated that my father did not want his family to  
continue with the Redskins. This, too, is false. He simply did not 
think it was possible to do so in the early 1990s with the downturn 
of the economy and a downturn with our family businesses and with 
the ever-present demands of inheritance taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the trustees said they chose Snyder over Cooke  
because Snyder's offer would mean more money for scholarships and 
that Cooke's bid would require special waivers of NFL rules because 
of its financial structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is chief executive of Snyder Communications in Bethesda,  
Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 locations in 
12 countries.

<HEADLINE>  Anwar To Be Tried on Sodomy Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  
Ibrahim, convicted two weeks ago of corruption, will now stand 
trial for an act of sodomy he allegedly committed seven years ago, 
prosecutors announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the prosecution for an additional four sodomy charges  
and one charge of corruption against Anwar will be postponed, 
Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Abdul Wahab Patail said the court would  
reconvene May 4 to determine the trial date, which is likely to 
begin that month. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, when asked to enter his plea, replied, ``Not guilty.'' He  
then paused and added, ``Malicious prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison on April 14, after a  
judge found him guilty on four counts of abuse of power. The 
prosecution claimed Anwar had illegal sex with men and women and 
then forced police to cover up his misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar has rejected all the charges, saying they aim to derail  
the challenge he posed to his former mentor, Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was charged today with committing ``carnal intercourse''  
against his former family driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, at the Tivoli 
Villa apartments in May 1992. Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma 
Dermawan, was charged last Friday with assisting Anwar in the act 
of sodomy against Azizan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim country. If  
convicted, Anwar could face up to 20 years in prison and whipping 
with a rattan cane. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are trumped-up charges to slander my husband further,''  
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said outside the courtroom. ``He knows 
that they are out to kill him politically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azizan, 38, testified during Anwar's trial that Anwar made him a  
``homosexual slave'' while he was a driver for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Another judge, meanwhile, rejected Anwar's plea to be allowed to  
attend the ongoing session of Parliament, of which he is still a 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge declined to examine the prison warden's decision to  
forbid Anwar from Parliament on grounds of national security, the 
Bernama news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys on Monday filed an appeal on his conviction.  
</P>
<P>
	Anwar's conviction sparked rioting in the capital, Kuala Lumpur,  
by thousands of supporters who believe it was politically 
motivated. Riot police responded with tear gas and water cannons 
and dozens of protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, was finance minister from 1991 and deputy prime  
minister from 1993 until he was fired last September. He and 
Mahathir began to have grave policy differences after the economic 
crisis hit in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The former No. 2 man also had begun to talk of clamping down on  
nepotism and cronyism and to call for more openness within the 
ruling party and among government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	His firing Sept. 2 and subsequent arrest and beating by police  
led to unprecedented anti-government demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> U.N. To Send Police to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUSA DUA, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations will send police  
advisers to East Timor as early as next month to prevent violence 
before an Aug. 8 vote deciding the future of the territory, the 
Indonesian president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie said the U.N. advisers will assist  
Indonesia's police and military in maintaining security in a 
referendum on whether the former Portuguese colony will win 
autonomy within Indonesia or independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment may come as early as May. Habibie declined to  
reveal how many advisers were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest and only concern is for the innocent people of East  
Timor, the majority,'' said Habibie, who has promoted democratic 
reforms in Indonesia since the downfall last year of his 
authoritarian predecessor, President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto invaded the territory in 1975 and annexed it a short  
time later. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In a policy reversal earlier this year, Habibie said the  
territory could become independent if the majority of East Timorese 
rejected an offer to become an autonomous state within the world's 
fourth most populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has escalated in East Timor in recent months between  
factions vying for and against independence, raising fears that the 
ballot might be further delayed. The vote is now planned for Aug. 
8, though it had been scheduled for July. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence activists welcomed advisers, but also urged a  
full U.N. peacekeeping presence. A spokesman from the militias 
condemned the deployment of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups favoring independence have charged that those backing  
Indonesian rule have been armed and trained by sections of 
Indonesia's military. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie declined to say whether factions fighting for or against  
independence will be forced to disarm before voting takes place. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-brokered deal also calls for the disarming of  
paramilitary groups, but it was unclear how this would be achieved, 
said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie said Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Germany, Britain  
and the United States would be invited under U.N. auspices to 
supervise the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Terry Bowden Enjoying Sabbatical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Terry Bowden's house is tucked into woods on  
a hill overlooking a pond. His Labradors, Shug and Bear Bryant, 
roam the yard. His five young children rule the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without football, life is good.  
</P>
<P>
	Six months after abruptly walking away from his job as head  
football coach at Auburn, Bowden is sticking around town, living 
only a few miles from Jordan-Hare Stadium, and enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
	He ignored father Bobby Bowden's advice to ``get out of town.''  
He and his wife, Shyrl, stayed put, kept their five children in 
Auburn's public schools and together coach their daughters' 
softball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Shyrl, for a change, is the head coach in the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am no longer depressed or demoralized like I was back in  
October and November,'' said Bowden, the bust of Bear Bryant for 
his 1993 Coach of the Year award on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Shyrl and I are as excited as we can be about the  
future, because there are so many possibilities. And we think time 
will erase the bitterness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's already faded among Auburn residents, with whom he mingles  
at church, on errands and at his kids' school functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't perceive anybody wishing he'll get out of town or  
thinking badly about him,'' says Barry McKnight, host of a 
Montgomery sports radio show who lives in Auburn. ``I think a lot 
of people are kind of proud he thinks enough about this town that 
he's sticking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden took over the Tigers in 1993 and won his first 20 games.  
He also won the Southeastern Conference Western Division title in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the injury-riddled Tigers started 1-5 last season and  
Bowden's job security soon became an issue. He has said Auburn 
athletic director David Housel told him there was little to do to 
save his job and that powerful trustee Bobby Lowder was behind the 
decision. Both have denied the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Bowden left. He walked away the night before the  
Tigers played Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can debate ad nauseum why I left, how I left, whose fault  
it was,'' says Bowden, who wound up 47-17-1 in 5 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very comfortable right now looking back and saying to my  
friends at Auburn, 'Didn't we have a good time? Didn't we roll 
Toomer's Corner (after victories) enough?''' 
</P>
<P>
	As new coach Tommy Tuberville leads the Tigers toward the 1999  
season, Bowden is sorting out his professional life. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't been idle. He spends two or three days a week in  
Birmingham working with brother Steve to kick-start a business and 
is an avid reader and fisherman. Of the business, he'll only say, 
``We think it's going to be something very valuable for the state 
of Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to be a college football analyst for a ``major  
network'' next fall. Bowden has spoken to such 
coaches-turned-analysts-turned-coaches as Dick Vermeil (St. Louis 
Rams), Jimmy Johnson (Miami Dolphins) and Lou Holtz (South 
Carolina). 
</P>
<P>
	``They all got hungry for it again,'' Bowden says. ``I hope I  
can live without it. I was always taught, don't coach football 
unless you can't live without it. I'm hoping I'll fall in love with 
broadcasting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Florida State's coach, said he was surprised when  
his son went into coaching in the first place, but expects him to 
return to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was going to be a lawyer,'' Bobby Bowden says.  
``I have a feeling that after a year, when all the schools start 
knocking on his door, he'll want to be back into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Bowden received a settlement of about $620,000 from  
Auburn, his base salary of $155,000 for the remaining four years on 
his contract, plus some other benefits. But it forbade the Bowdens 
from making ``negative or derogatory'' statements about Auburn or 
Auburn officials. There seems little risk of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll always think of Auburn as one of the greatest times of  
our life,'' Bowden says. ``Once a school gives you a chance, like 
Auburn gave me a chance, I think you owe them something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back on a career that included stops at NAIA Salem  
College in 1983, Samford in 1987 and Auburn, the 43-year-old Bowden 
figures he was on pace, with 111 career wins, to eclipse Bear 
Bryant's all-time record of 323 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always chasing that Bear Bryant record,'' says Bowden,  
who named his dogs after Bryant and Auburn's winningest coach, 
Ralph ``Shug'' Jordan. ``All my life I was chasing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That chase is over. For now, anyway.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Stumble Towards Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- This was supposed to be the Los Angeles  
Lakers' year. Instead, just about everything that could go wrong 
has. And now, with the playoffs less than two weeks away, they're a 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off two horrendous performances, the Lakers spent nearly  
2 1/2 hours behind closed doors Tuesday before a 70-minute practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meetings and film, that's what went on,'' Lakers coach Kurt  
Rambis said afterward. ``We hashed out some things as a team. The 
whole idea was to get everybody on the same page. There were some 
frustrations that were aired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis wouldn't know about all of those frustrations, since a  
players-only meeting was held as well as an overall team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't heated,'' Kobe Bryant said of the players-only  
get-together, which he said lasted about 45 minutes. ``We were 
trying to figure out what happened, why we started spiraling 
downward, how we got to this point, how we're going to get out of 
this. It wasn't pointing fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many picked the Lakers to win their first championship in 11  
years before this abbreviated campaign, and they've certainly been 
anointed the NBA's glamour team in the league's first season AJ -- 
After Jordan -- as evidenced by their many nationally televised 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, all has not gone according to plan, or come close.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Del Harris was fired after three straight losses dropped  
the Lakers to 6-6 in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	Eccentric seven-time rebounding champion Dennis Rodman was  
brought in to help on defense and on the backboards, and while he 
did at times, he also created several disruptions and was finally 
waived April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers acquired sharpshooter Glen Rice and J.R. Reid for  
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell just before the trade deadline last 
month, and it's been an ill-fated deal to this point. 
</P>
<P>
	They've certainly saved their worst for the last 2 1/2 weeks,  
losing six of the last eight games including the last three. The 
six losses came by an average of 17 points, including a 108-81 
embarrassment at San Antonio on Saturday night and a 102-80 
humiliation at Houston on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first quarter was finishing in Houston with the Lakers  
trailing 28-14, veteran announcer Chick Hearn, broadcasting his 
3,101st consecutive Lakers game, observed, ``I've seen disarray, 
but not much more than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis admitted afterward his team didn't play hard, and said  
Tuesday he believes a lot of the problems ``come from within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have a tendency to play harder when you feel a  
responsibility to the team,'' he said. ``When individuals accept 
that, they play beyond their expectations because they don't want 
to let their teammates down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports of friction between center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's No. 2 scorer, and Bryant, who ranks 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to regroup,'' was one of the few things O'Neal  
told reporters Tuesday. ``I'm glad we're the underdog. You 
(reporters) counted us out about four weeks ago, you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Bryant, who made just 3-of-14 field goal  
attempts at Houston, said he didn't believe the Lakers were a team 
in turmoil, and that the alleged problems with O'Neal were 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know him that well off the court,'' Bryant said. ``Our  
relationship on the court, it's very, very fine. We're constantly 
communicating on the court. It's really not that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said the two haven't had a talk about things.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, for what,'' he said. ``Our relationship is great on the  
basketball court, and it's only going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal recently told reporters: ``You know the real problem,  
you're just scared to write about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later told CBS Sportsline: ``What is this, an experiment?  
Nobody waited for me when I came into the league. ... I'm not going 
to be here that long that I want to wait years for (Bryant) to 
figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Lakers have been losing, Bryant said,  
``There's a lot of different reasons, not just one particular 
reason. I really don't want to get into it. A true team keeps 
things like that to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One deficiency several players have talked about is defense.  
It's been especially bad recently -- the Lakers allowed an average 
of 105 points per game over the last eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Two problem positions have been point guard and power forward.  
The team hasn't gotten consistent play at the point, with 
37-year-old Derek Harper sharing the load mostly with Derek Fisher. 
Rookie Tyronn Lue has been added to the mix recently. And power 
forward hasn't been a position of great strength before, during or 
after Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have four games remaining before the playoffs begin --  
not a lot of time to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't played very good basketball lately,'' Rick Fox  
said. ``Are we capable of changing that? Yeah, I'd like to think 
we're a team capable of changing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done the talking before. That's enough talk.''

<HEADLINE>  Slain Students Tenderly Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A ``gentle giant.'' A boy who treated  
others with ``the utmost respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the one-week anniversary of the Columbine High School  
massacre, mourners gathered today to remember two teens as this 
community's sad string of funerals continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Kechter, 16, was remembered as a tender-hearted,  
thoughtful yet intense football player. ``He was kind and always 
treated everyone with the utmost respect,'' football coach Andy 
Lowry told a crowd of about 1,800 mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry recalled a day when Kechter attempted to look stern for a  
team photograph, but couldn't. ``He tried to act tough. He did his 
very best to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a second service, friends and family recalled Kyle Velasquez,  
16, as a gentle lad who enjoyed routine tasks, like washing the 
car. Gov. Bill Owens was one of 800 people in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kyle was known as a gentle giant, and when he looked down on  
his parents, it was as their little boy,'' said John Newhauser, 
Kyle's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Wayne LaGrone told the group that if people want the  
violence to stop, ``we must begin with ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind those two young assailants were  
acting under satanic intervention,'' LaGrone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve students and one teacher were slain a week ago today.  
Students Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who invaded the 
school with guns and bombs, committed suicide at the end of their 
rampage, bringing the day's toll to 15. 
</P>
<P>
	At one of four services Monday, Dan Rohrbough was remembered for  
the way gave his life holding an exit door open for others so they 
could flee. Rohrbough, 15, died on the sidewalk, just steps away 
from safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Dwight Blackstock commended the boy's selfless act.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel guilty,'' he advised other teens who escaped thanks  
to Rohrbough. ``Thank God. Just thank God. And thank Danny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough's father, Brian, also spoke tenderly of his son, a boy  
who would save an entire year to buy Christmas gifts and loved 
computer games, cooking and tinkering with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking down at the casket, which included teddy bears and  
poems, his eyes misty, he said softly: ``Daniel Lee Rohrbough, in 
life and death, I'm proud of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, 2,500 people filled the sanctuary and two  
overflow rooms at the Trinity Christian Center to honor teacher 
William ``Dave'' Sanders, who spent 24 of his 47 years at 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders led  
students to safety until he was himself shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, 'Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to daddy'' in which she  
said she'd always remember their talks on the porch. It contained a

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A ``gentle giant.'' A boy who treated  
others with ``the utmost respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the one-week anniversary of the Columbine High School  
massacre, mourners gathered today to remember two teens as this 
community's sad string of funerals continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Kechter, 16, was remembered as a tender-hearted,  
thoughtful yet intense football player. ``He was kind and always 
treated everyone with the utmost respect,'' football coach Andy 
Lowry told a crowd of about 1,800 mourners.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Seek New Markets for Crop / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Farmers in northeast North Dakota are  
working to find new markets for a rotational crop that is already 
helping them overcome depressed wheat prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northland Alfalfa Producers Association plans to research  
the potential of building a farmer-owned plant to process the crop 
into a product that can be shipped more economically. 
</P>
<P>
	Association members already are selling alfalfa hay to dairy  
operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and other states, said Dennis 
Brown of Milton, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers can net about $60 an acre for high-quality alfalfa,  
Brown said. Meanwhile, poor wheat prices make it nearly impossible 
for farmers to make money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in a good year like last year when we had a good yield,  
with the price it just doesn't work,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alfalfa association was formed a month ago after a couple of  
years of discussion between farmers and economic development 
officials. It currently has about 20 farmer members from northeast 
North Dakota and northwest Minnesota, in addition to about two 
dozen industry members. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will look into building a value-added processing  
plant, probably to compress alfalfa hay. 
</P>
<P>
	Compressed bales are easier to market overseas because shipping  
fees are based on the number of containers rather than weight, 
Brown said. Last month, association members toured a plant north of 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, that compresses alfalfa and ships it to 
customers in Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Radke, a North Dakota State University Extension Service  
specialist for high-value crops, is encouraging the alfalfa group. 
With prices for traditional crops slumping, ``farmers need to take 
a good hard look at several projects like the alfalfa one in terms 
of adding value,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke is involved in a three-state study of a process now used  
in France that breaks down alfalfa and produces everything from 
bulk feed to individual proteins and vitamins. If the study 
determines there are markets for the products, the next step would 
be to look at building a processing plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alfalfa association and the Cavalier County Job Development  
Authority contributed $1,000 to the $80,000 study. The group also 
is studying the idea of building a plant that would turn alfalfa 
hay into livestock feed pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to look into all kinds of different possibilities and  
opportunities for alfalfa,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association is working with the state Economic Development  
and Finance agency to find money for a marketing and feasibility 
study on compressed hay, hopefully by the fall, he said. If the 
group eventually decides to build a plant, ``we'd probably have to 
look at a co-op structure,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising money in these times is very difficult. But it's got  
to start someplace, sometime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines Dominate Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks responded quickly last week  
to the public hunger for news about the Colorado school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Six prime-time newsmagazines, each one with reports on the  
Littleton shooting, were among the 12 most-watched programs 
measured by Nielsen Media Research during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``20/20'' on April 21 had more viewers than any other  
newsmagazine, and had its highest ratings of the year except for 
the Monica Lewinsky interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, CBS's ``48 Hours'' beat NBC's ``ER'' in the  
ratings, although last Thursday's medical drama was a rerun. CBS 
faced criticism, however, for not responding to the Littleton story 
in prime-time as fast as its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, viewership was down for the networks as they geared up  
for the May ratings ``sweeps'' period. CBS won the week with an 8.4 
rating and 14 share, NBC was second with an 8.1 rating and 14 
share, ABC had a 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.1 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular show of the week was a new episode of NBC's  
comedy, ``Friends.'' ABC's drama, ``The Practice,'' had its second 
highest rating in the history of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' did well during a busy news week, scoring  
its largest margin of victory over the ``CBS Evening News'' in more 
than two years. NBC had an 8.2 rating and 18 share, while CBS was 
at 6.5 and 14. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with a 7.9 
rating and 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 19-25, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.4; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 
12.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and 
Order,'' NBC, 11.8; ``Dateline NBC-Friday,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Dateline 
NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 11.6; ``48 Hours,'' CBS, 11.0.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Drops Puck in Edmonton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton's favorite adopted son -- Wayne  
Gretzky -- returned to the scene of his greatest triumphs Tuesday 
and was greeted by more than 17,000 screaming, towel-waving Oilers 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cups with the Oilers in the 1980s,  
dropped the ceremonial first puck prior to the start of the 
Dallas-Edmonton playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first return to Skyreach Centre since he tearfully  
retired from the NHL earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like home for me,'' Gretzky said in a television  
interview during the game. ``I had a lot of great years here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance was kept a secret until he walked to center ice  
to a thunderous standing ovation. Players from both teams pounded 
their sticks on the ice in tribute to No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and gold tie, Gretzky  
dropped the puck between Oilers captain Kelly Buchberger and the 
Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	He waved to the crowd as they chanted ``Gretzky, Gretzky!''  
Dallas stars Mike Modano and Brett Hull came over to shake his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then with a final wave, Gretzky walked off. He was on ice for  
all of two minutes. The standing ovation followed him back through 
the tunnel but the man who has always said he doesn't want to be 
bigger than the game didn't return for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of great memories with some great teams and some  
nice championships but, more importantly, I have a lot of friends 
here and it's nice to come back to Edmonton,'' Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was invited to the game by Oilers general manager Glen  
Sather, whom Gretzky cited as one of the key influences on his life 
when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glen came all the way to New York for my last game and he  
said: `You know, you've got to come to Edmonton for a game.' ...I 
promised I'd come up for a game and I'm happy to be here.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A magistrate authorized a conservative group's  
questioning of former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung, who also 
has been called to testify on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung can be deposed by Judicial Watch regarding the alleged  
sale of Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for 
campaign donations, magistrate John Facciola said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He could become available for questioning in the lawsuit after  
investigators from the House Government Reform Committee complete 
their interviews of him this week in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee plans to make Chung its star witness at a  
May hearing regarding Chinese connections to 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung was sentenced to five years probation after admitting that  
he made $30,000 in illegal contributions, including $20,000 to the 
1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He has told federal investigators that China's chief military  
intelligence officer sent him $300,000 to give to the Democratic 
Party to aid President Clinton's re-election, The Los Angeles Times 
has reported. Chinese government officials have denied the 
allegations.

<HEADLINE>  Scoonie Penn To Stay at Ohio State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Scoonie Penn wasn't sure where he would go  
in the NBA draft, so he decided to stay at Ohio State for three 
sure things: a good team, good times and a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically feel like if I was to make the decision to go out,  
I think I could make it'' in the NBA, Penn said Tuesday, announcing 
he'd be back with the Buckeyes for his senior season. ``I'm 
confident enough that, yes, I can play. But I don't have to worry 
about that. My main focus is working hard in the offseason and 
worrying about this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the Big Ten's co-player of the year, had been considering  
his options since Ohio State's surprising trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-team All-American said he kept his eyes and his mind  
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you want to focus on is your dream, your goal, of becoming  
a professional athlete,'' he said. ``It was hard to see anything 
else because that's all I wanted. I still want it. But I realize 
there's other things in life besides becoming a professional 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he didn't know how high he might have gone in the  
draft because it was difficult to factor in the underclassmen who 
almost daily add their names to the list of seniors available. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State head coach Jim O'Brien was vacationing in Florida,  
but associate head coach Rick Boyages said there was a glut of 
quality point guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's somewhere in the pack,'' Boyages said. ``The obvious  
names that come to mind besides Scoonie are Andre Miller at Utah, 
Steve Francis at Maryland, Jason Terry at Arizona, William Avery at 
Duke. ... There are probably eight or 10 point guards and Scoonie's 
right in there in the top five or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The squat, 5-foot-10 shooting guard from Salem, Mass., became a  
crowd favorite of Ohio State's fans, who had been beaten down by 
five consecutive losing seasons. Before last season even began, 
Penn brashly predicted the Buckeyes would make it to the NCAA 
tournament -- despite going 8-22 overall and 1-15 in the Big Ten 
while Penn sat out a transfer year from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Penn averaging 16.9 points, 4.3 assists, 2 steals and 4  
rebounds a game, Ohio State posted one of the biggest turnarounds 
in NCAA history. The Buckeyes finished 27-9, were second in the Big 
Ten at 12-4 and were the surprise team of the NCAA tournament 
before losing to eventual champion Connecticut 64-58 in the 
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Songs about Penn were played on local radio stations, and kids  
chanted his name and begged for autographs after games. His uniform 
No. 12 became so popular that someone stole it out of the team's 
dressing room shortly before the start of the UConn game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to a situation like that, I know a lot of players  
say this might be the best time to leave, while your name's out 
there and you're on top,'' Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ohio State returns much of last year's team, in addition to  
several top prospects including 7-foot-3 junior-college standout 
Aleksandar Radojevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he wasn't worried about a disappointing season.  
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, I do feel it was a Cinderella season. We had a  
terrific run and personally I had a great year,'' he said. ``But I 
feel with the type of team we have coming back and the same 
coaching staff, I feel we can only get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to another run at the NCAA tournament -- Penn has  
never missed in two years at BC and one season at Ohio State -- he 
also said he was on schedule to graduate in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important things to my family would be to see  
me walk across that stage and receive my degree,'' he said. 
``That's all I need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, who would become the first member of his family to  
graduate from college, said he told O'Brien of his decision last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he said to me was, 'Are you sure this is what you  
want?' I said, 'Yes, it's my decision. I've been thinking about it 
and this is exactly what I want,''' Penn said.

there's other things in life besides becoming a professional 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he didn't know how high he might have gone in the  
draft because it was difficult to factor in the underclassmen who 
almost daily add their names to the list of seniors available. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State head coach Jim O'Brien was vacationing in Florida,  
but associate head coach Rick Boyages said there was a glut of 
quality point guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's somewhere in the pack,'' Boyages said. ``The obvious  
names that come to mind besides Scoonie are Andre Miller at Utah, 
Steve Francis at Maryland, Jason Terry at Arizona, William Avery at 
Duke. ... There are probably eight or 10 point guards and Scoonie's 
right in there in the top five or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The squat, 5-foot-10 shooting guard from Salem, Mass., became a  
crowd favorite of Ohio State's fans, who had been beaten down by 
five consecutive losing seasons. Before last season even began, 
Penn brashly predicted the Buckeyes would make it to the NCAA 
tournament -- despite going 8-22 overall and 1-15 in the Big Ten 
while Penn sat out a transfer year from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Penn averaging 16.9 points, 4.3 assists, 2 steals and 4  
rebounds a game, Ohio State posted one of the biggest turnarounds 
in NCAA history. The Buckeyes finished 27-9, were second in the Big 
Ten at 12-4 and were the surprise team of the NCAA tournament 
before losing to eventual champion Connecticut 64-58 in the 
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Songs about Penn were played on local radio stations, and kids  
chanted his name and begged for autographs after games. His uniform 
No. 12 became so popular that someone stole it out of the team's 
dressing room shortly before the start of the UConn game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to a situation like that, I know a lot of players  
say this might be the best time to leave, while your name's out 
there and you're on top,'' Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ohio State returns much of last year's team, in addition to  
several top prospects including 7-foot-3 junior-college standout 
Aleksandar Radojevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he wasn't worried about a disappointing season.  
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, I do feel it was a Cinderella season. We had a  
terrific run and personally I had a great year,'' he said. ``But I 
feel with the type of team we have coming back and the same 
coaching staff, I feel we can only get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to another run at the NCAA tournament -- Penn has  
never missed in two years at BC and one season at Ohio State -- he 
also said he was on schedule to graduate in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important things to my family would be to see  
me walk across that stage and receive my degree,'' he said. 
``That's all I need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, who would become the first member of his family to  
graduate from college, said he told O'Brien of his decision last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he said to me was, 'Are you sure this is what you  
want?' I said, 'Yes, it's my decision. I've been thinking about it 
and this is exactly what I want,''' Penn said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Refinery to Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- An oil refinery where four men were  
killed and a fifth was badly burned in a February explosion and 
fire will reopen in about two months, Tosco Refining Co. officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant should be ready for use again in eight weeks, Tosco  
president Dwight Wiggins told Contra Costa County supervisors at a 
meeting to discuss the plant's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Tosco shut down the refinery near Martinez, Calif., as it  
investigated the incident after the Feb. 23 explosion. Tosco since 
has been giving its 700 employees full-time safety training classes 
and has promised to pay workers through May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft report issued two weeks ago by an independent consulting  
firm said Tosco managers' commitment to safety was ``lacking.'' An 
adversarial relationship between workers and their managers impeded 
communication, and layoffs have made the plant dangerous, the 
report said. A final report was issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tosco, in full-page ads in newspapers Sunday and Monday, pledged  
that safety would be a top priority. Wiggins said Tosco would 
follow all of the private auditor's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take much more than taking out ads and telling  
the public that all they needed is a few safety classes,'' said 
Supervisor Donna Gerber. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery shutdown, along with world oil production cuts and  
warm weather that enticed motorists onto the roads, has helped 
contribute to sharp increases in the price of gas in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Penney's Cuts 'South Park' Stuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- J.C. Penney has killed Kenny -- and the rest of the  
round-faced ``South Park'' gang. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer has decided to stop ordering merchandise based on  
the popular animated television show after receiving negative 
feedback from customers, said Penney spokesman Duncan Muir. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company received ``many'' complaints from people who  
didn't think ``South Park'' T-shirts and other items were 
appropriate for Penney stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comedy Central show about foul-mouthed grade school children  
has drawn criticism from conservative groups because of its 
language and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A group called the Christian Family Network is praising Penney,  
saying the school shootings in Colorado can be traced, in part, to 
shows such as ``South Park.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Face Human Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Human rights activists in the United States  
and abroad increasingly are calling upon the world's major oil 
companies to leave oil-rich regions where tales of torture and 
disappearances flow as freely as crude itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent activism includes a campaign by women's groups to stop  
the construction of a pipeline in Afghanistan, a lawsuit against a 
California oil company's practices in Myanmar and protests over the 
deaths of three activists, including Terence Freitas of Los 
Angeles, in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	This week in Los Angeles, a Colombian Indian tribe and its  
supporters will ask Occidental Petroleum Corp. shareholders to 
consider an ultimatum: drop drilling plans on their tribal land or 
they will commit mass suicide by walking off a 1,400-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's meeting in Santa Monica, shareholders will face the  
protesters' demands and vote on a resolution -- written in part by 
Freitas before he was killed by Colombian guerrillas in February -- 
that calls for a study on how opposition by the 5,000-member tribe 
could affect profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based Occidental opposes the resolution, saying it  
has acted as ``a model corporate citizen in Colombia for 30 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to stockholders is just one of a growing number of  
strategies used by activists to influence the behavior of oil 
companies, said Arvind Ganesan, an analyst with Human Rights Watch 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an industry under pressure on human rights now,'' Ganesan  
said. ``Shareholder meetings are a good forum to air these kinds of 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most oil giants refuse to pull out of troubled regions,  
some are responding with new corporate human rights policies, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are realizing that, because of the reputation hit  
they can take in an environment of low oil prices, it's not in the 
company's best interest to have a human rights problem,'' Ganesan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freitas was a longtime U'wa supporter who worked to keep  
Occidental from drilling on tribal land. His organization, the U'wa 
Defense Working Group, contends that oil brings violence: 
Guerrillas target pipelines and surrounding villages and 
governments respond by militarizing the regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil always brings an ugly transformation of the culture and  
almost always brings violence,'' said Robert Benson, a Loyola 
University law professor, who heads a group seeking to bring state 
pressure on companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition filed last week with state Attorney General Bill  
Lockyer, Benson's group asked the state to revoke the corporate 
charter of El Segundo-based Union Oil Company of California, or 
Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson claims that in Myanmar, Unocal has forced villagers to  
relocate and used forced labor to build the company's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal denies the allegations. Mike Thacher, a Unocal spokesman,  
says the company is a solid corporate citizen. Just this year, it 
formalized a corporate position on human rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, we respect human rights in all of our  
projects,'' Thacher said. ``This includes our investment in Myanmar 
and it would have included any investment in Afghanistan, had we 
had one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Unocal withdrew from a plan to build an $8 billion  
pipeline through Afghanistan. Feminist groups had criticized the 
company over the project, which required working with the Taliban, 
an Islamic militia whose interpretation of religious law has forced 
women to wear an all-enveloping veil and banned women from work and 
girls from school. 
</P>
<P>
	Thatcher said the company withdrew over concern that there ``was  
not a stable government in place that was recognized by the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal was the only major U.S. company still in Myanmar after  
Atlantic Richfield Co. ended its natural gas exploration there last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco, based in Los Angeles, also contended its retreat from  
Myanmar, ruled by a military government accused of human rights 
abuses, was a business decision that had nothing to do with human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But human rights may be playing a bigger role in company  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron faced a shareholder proposal in 1997 asking the board to  
develop guidelines for working in countries with ongoing human 
rights violations. Shareholders have, also without success, made 
similar demands of Royal Dutch-Shell over its drilling operations 
in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposals have failed, Shell has altered its  
approach to human rights issues, said spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor, 
in a phone interview from the company's office in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Shell has consulted with human rights  
groups and adopted a human rights policy, Ms. Tavinor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do withdraw if violence occurs and we have canceled  
contracts if we're not happy with the other participating groups' 
behavior,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Tavinor acknowledged that the Nigerian government  
makes its own decisions about ``protecting strategic 
installations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't control any government anywhere,'' she said.

	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was mixed today against other  
major currencies in European trading. Gold prices rose in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 120.15 Japanese yen from 118.91 yen late  
Monday, but fell against the euro, the currency of 11 European 
nations. The euro rose to $1.0633 from $1.0608 late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Saving Incentive Offered to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Low-income people who put money in a bank and  
learn about basic economics could get up to $300 each year from the 
federal government under a proposal announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax-free earnings, financed through special tax credits  
given out to banks, would be restricted to buying a home, starting 
a business, attending school or learning new job skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said the proposal was a chance for  
poorer families to share in the tax cuts under consideration in 
Congress. He said the targeted people generally earn too little to 
pay income taxes and would not otherwise benefit from tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said savings could help people improve their lives.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wealth is through ownership,'' he said at a news conference.  
``That is how most people in America accumulate wealth, through 
ownership and savings. We're providing incentives for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would encourage individuals to set up savings  
accounts with a local bank. The bank would match those savings 
dollar for dollar and then deduct the full amount of the match from 
its federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Before withdrawing the matching funds, individuals must complete  
an economic literacy course that teaches about saving, banking and 
investing. The course would be provided by the bank or community 
organizations, and the government would reimburse some costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some banks and community groups already offer these types of  
matching savings accounts but fund them through private donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would make an estimated $2.5 billion available from  
the government over five years and could be incorporated into a 
broader package of tax cuts, said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. He 
said more than 10 million Americans do not have a bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickie B. Tassan, senior vice president for community  
development banking at the Bank of America, said the proposal would 
help change behavior and introduce more people to banking.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Aussies Make Antitrust Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Australia signed an  
agreement Tuesday to help each other with antitrust investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement will let the two countries exchange confidential  
evidence and enforcement strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not have antitrust enforcement that is truly effective  
unless we have international cooperation and the ability to 
exchange evidence,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's treasurer, Peter Costello, said he was delighted to  
sign the first international antitrust mutual assistance agreement 
with the United States since Congress passed a bill allowing such 
pacts in 1994. Australia's Parliament had passed such a law 
earlier. The two countries have had a less extensive antitrust 
cooperation agreement since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement -- signed by Reno, Costello and Federal Trade  
Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky -- any Australian evidence 
obtained by U.S. officials can be used in criminal or civil 
actions, including merger reviews. Australia has only civil 
antitrust enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Australia has an attitude on competition very close to our own  
and a vigorous enforcement program,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General Joel I. Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade between the two countries totaled more than $18 billion in  
1998. U.S. investment in Australia exceeds $26 billion.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose early Wednesday following  
another rally on Wall Street and buying from foreign investors. The 
dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average added 129.02 points, or 0.76 percent,  
to 17,086.29 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, 
the average closed up 38.76 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.16 yen in early trading, up 0.70 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its level of 120.40 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange started higher on  
continued foreign buying of Japanese stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market was also encouraged by Tuesday's record close  
in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.12 
points to 10,831.71, topping its previous record finish of 
10,727.18, set last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.47 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,358.89. The 
TOPIX closed up 6.58 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar's relative weakness  
from levels late in New York Tuesday came on dollar-selling 
pressure from Japanese exporters and institutional investors, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's upside would be limited as market  
players were poised to adjust positions ahead of Japan's annual 
string of ``Golden Week'' holidays which start Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets will be closed Thursday as well as  
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.425  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price 
down to 103.30 yen from 103.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bells Toll for Columbine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Exactly a week after the first shots  
rang out at Columbine High School, a hush fell over the Denver area 
Tuesday and church bells tolled 15 times -- one for each victim and 
the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first public expression of mourning that included the  
two killers, whose names went unmentioned at Sunday's memorial for 
70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Televisions and radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m.  
After the tolling, the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a celebratory peal to remind everybody that there is  
life after death,'' said Barry Bowman of St. John's Episcopal 
Cathedral in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were held. The 
Velasquez services drew 800 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, questioned Dylan Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, who is believed to have bought at least two of the 
weapons used by Klebold and Eric Harris. Investigators want to know 
whether she knew how the guns were to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an employee of a local hardware store, said he saw  
Harris purchase several barbecue containers of propane and bags of 
nails, screws and wires. When asked what the items were for, Gary 
Sowell told NBC Nightly News that the youth replied, ``For 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington, President Clinton announced proposals to  
tighten federal gun laws. ``We don't have to go through another 
Littleton if the American people want it badly enough,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, committed suicide after bursting  
into Columbine High with guns and bombs on April 20. They killed 12 
fellow students and one teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Four guns were found in the school. On Tuesday, authorities said  
they had discovered a total of 50 bombs, ranging from small pipe 
bombs to at least one large incendiary device rigged with barbecue 
propane tank. If they had been detonated, investigators say they 
might have blown up the school, killing hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Robyn K. Anderson bought at least two of the  
weapons -- a rifle and a semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun -- at a 
Denver-area gun show in the fall. Miss Anderson has not been 
arrested, and authorities stopped short of describing her as a 
suspect. She has retained a lawyer and is said to be cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, it is illegal to give a minor a pistol, and illegal  
to give anyone a gun with the knowledge that it will be used in a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been cooperating, but obviously for someone who may be  
possibly in the future linked as a suspect it would be very smart 
of them to seek legal advice,'' said sheriff's department spokesman 
Jim Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	At Velasquez's funeral, neighbors and relatives remembered him  
as a ``gentle giant'' who enjoyed chores and family activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt in my mind that those two young assailants  
were acting under satanic influence,'' said the Rev. Wayne LaGrone. 
``If we want the violence to stop, we must start with ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine teachers returned to work Tuesday -- not at the heavily  
damaged high school, but a few miles away at Chatfield High. 
Columbine students will return to classes on Monday -- also at 
Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Security there will be increased, with guards checking IDs and  
continuing sweeps by law enforcement officers. School 
administrators also have banned students from wearing trench coats 
of the sort worn by the killers to conceal their weapons as they 
approached the school. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday afternoon, the Columbine girls soccer team held a  
tearful moment of silence for the shooting victims before playing 
rival Golden High School. The game, which was played on a field in 
neighboring Lakewood, was the first event for the high school other 
than memorial services since the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	A Colorado Springs gun shop owner said Harris and three other  
young men, as well as Miss Anderson, tried to purchase automatic 
weapons from his shop in March. But federal agents said a 
surveillance tape from the shop did not show the Columbine 
students.

	``They were in combat fatigues. They said they heard it on the  
radio. Well, it wasn't on the radio at that time,'' Jefferson 
County Sheriff John P. Stone told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Stone laid out the timeline for the attack  
and also disclosed that a school surveillance camera captured the 
attack in the cafeteria. Stone's department is leading the 
investigation into the April 20 shootings in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Stone called the three his ``best leads,'' sheriff's  
spokesman Jim Parr told other media outlets late Tuesday that 
investigators had questioned the three men and cleared them. The 
discrepency between what Parr and his boss said was not immediately 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone declined to name the teens, who have been questioned but  
not formally named as suspects. ``They are subjects of our 
investigation,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drama unfolded on national television, the three young  
men in dark jackets were stopped by deputies. They were frisked and 
taken off for interrogation. The men carried no weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the school, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
killed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men, who Stone said knew the gunmen and had  
previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' have 
maintained their innocence. Investigators tested them for gun 
residue after the shootings and found no evidence that they had 
fired guns. 
</P>
<P>
	All three teens claimed to have heard of the massacre on the  
radio -- and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had 
been released, Stone said. One of them had been expelled from 
Columbine High School, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three men who were  
questioned as Matthew Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just three punks with a lot of curiosity,''  
Christianson said in Monday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered a call Tuesday night to Akard's home, told  
the AP she had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	All three wore black jackets with combat-style boots when they  
were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the scaredest I've ever been,'' Christianson said. He  
said they didn't know Klebold and Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said the two gunmen initially tried to escape through  
three separate exits, and killed themselves only after being turned 
back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a diary seized at 
the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen planned to fly 
to Mexico or another country if they could escape, and kill 
themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a sheaf 
of papers investigators have characterized as a diary. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said a school surveillance camera captured ``the entire  
carnage'' in the cafeteria, where Klebold and Harris hurled 
homemade bombs and opened fire on terrified students. Authorities 
have sent the tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously have not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a celebratory peal to remind everybody that there is  
life after death,'' said Barry Bowman of St. John's Episcopal 
Cathedral in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were held. The 
Velasquez services drew 800 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, questioned Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and 
Harris. Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns 
were to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an employee of a local hardware store said he saw  
Harris purchase several barbecue containers of propane and bags of 
nails, screws and wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Four guns were found in the school. On Tuesday, authorities said  
they had discovered 50 bombs, ranging from small pipe bombs to at 
least one large incendiary device rigged with barbecue propane 
tank. If they had been detonated, investigators say they might have 
blown up the school, killing hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Robyn K. Anderson bought at least two of the  
weapons -- a rifle and a semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun -- at a 
Denver-area gun show in the fall. Miss Anderson has not been 
arrested, and authorities stopped short of describing her as a 
suspect. She has retained a lawyer and is said to be cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, it is illegal to give a minor a pistol, and illegal  
to give anyone a gun with the knowledge that it will be used in a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine teachers returned to work Tuesday -- not at the heavily  
damaged high school, but a few miles away at Chatfield High. 
Columbine students will return to classes on Monday -- also at 
Chatfield.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Drops Puck in Edmonton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton's favorite adopted son -- Wayne  
Gretzky -- returned to the scene of his greatest triumphs Tuesday 
night and was greeted by more than 17,000 screaming, towel-waving 
Oilers fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cups with the Oilers in the 1980s,  
dropped the ceremonial first puck prior to the start of the 
Dallas-Edmonton playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first return to Skyreach Centre since he retired  
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance was kept a secret until he walked to center ice  
to a thunderous standing ovation. Players from both teams pounded 
their sticks on the ice in tribute to No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and gold tie, Gretzky  
dropped the puck between Oilers captain Kelly Buchberger and the 
Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	He waved to the crowd as they chanted ``Gretzky, Gretzky!''  
Dallas stars Mike Modano and Brett Hull came over to shake his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then with a final wave, Gretzky walked off. He was on the ice  
for all of two minutes. The standing ovation followed him back 
through the tunnel but the man who has always said he doesn't want 
to be bigger than the game didn't return for an encore.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 65.01 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones  
industrials at record highs on strong earnings reports, but the 
Nasdaq composite lower on profit-taking in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 65.01 at 10,783.60. On  
Monday, the blue chips rose 28.92 to 10,718.59, just shy of its 
record close of 10,727.18 set Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.32 at 1,360.36, and the  
Nasdaq composite index was down 45.02 at 2,607.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston,  
said a confluence of factors was behind the divergent trading 
pattern. DuPont's earnings, released this morning, helped affirm 
last week's move into the economically sensitive companies, Hogan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the technology stocks were lower on ``a little light  
uninformed profit-taking in technology (shares). There is no 
fundamental news in that area, it's just that the prices got to 
such a raucus level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., said the  
Nasdaq was slowing down after hitting a new closing high Monday and 
ahead of some key earnings releases. He said investors are 
``waiting on bated breath'' for earnings from America Online and 
Amazon.com., due out today and Wednesday, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was boosted by earnings reports. AT&AMP;T's first-quarter  
profit came to 61 cents per share, beating analysts' expected 57 
cents, as revenues from cellular and corporate services offset a 
downturn in long-distance business. AT&AMP;T was up 1/8 at 53 1/16, 
having risen as high as 55 5/8 in earlier trading. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, also a Dow component, reported earnings from continuing  
operations of 66 cents a share, down from 68 cents a year earlier 
but soundly beating analysts' expected 60 cents. DuPont was up 2 
1/16 at 68 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's strong results showed investors were right last week  
when they moved into economically sensitive issues, said Brian 
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dow component Disney was down 2 1/16 at 32 15/16. The  
entertainment company's second-quarter profit results released 
today met expectations of 13 cents a share, but Disney called the 
results disappointing and said it will assess where it can cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mixed. Online auctioneer eBay was up 4  
13/16 at 213 13/16 after reporting on Monday first-quarter earnings 
that beat Wall Street expectations. Amazon.com was up 1 5/16 at 
208 1/2 ahead of that company's earnings release Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But America Online was down 4 15/16 at 157 1/16 on the Big Board  
despite a growing consensus that the company's earnings, scheduled 
for release late today, would beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood on Wall Street was helped by a report from the  
Conference Board that its index of consumer confidence rose for the 
sixth straight month in April, to 134.9 from a revised 134 in 
March. The index is a key indicator of future economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	An index designed to measure consumer expectations for the next  
six to nine months had an even bigger increase, indicating the 
current economic boom is not likely to end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 5 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 724.36 million shares, up from 
Monday's pace.

<HEADLINE> AOL Earnings Triple in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLS, Va. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings for America Online Inc.  
tripled as the largest online service added 1.8 million new 
customers, helping it beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $117 million, or 11 cents per share,  
excluding charges, in the three months ended March 31. In the same 
quarter a year ago, AOL earned $39 million, or 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
9 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 66 percent to nearly $1.3 billion -- the first  
$1 billion quarter in the company's 14-year history. Advertising, 
commerce and other revenues accounted for $275 million of the 
increase, up 94 percent over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Including its purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. and  
other one-time events, AOL posted net income of $420 million, or 33 
cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $78 million, 
or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL completed its nearly $10 billion acquisition of Netscape on  
March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pivotal quarter for America Online,'' AOL chairman  
and CEO Steve Case said Tuesday. ``Through key acquisitions and 
partnerships, we substantially broadened and deepened our 
capabilities, and advanced our leadership in interactive 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said third-quarter results ``demonstrate that we can deliver  
strong, consistent growth in profits while taking advantage of 
opportunities to improve our competitive position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lise Buyer, an analyst with CS First Boston, said the company's  
performance was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly compelling that they have 19 million  
customers,'' she said. ``That's an immense number and gives them 
tremendous clout with advertisers. ... It looks like it was a 
tremendously solid quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has nearly 17 million members, plus another 2 million  
subscribers through its CompuServe subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president, said in an interview that the  
third-quarter results illustrate that ``we've transformed ourselves 
into a multiple-brand, multiple-revenue company, and it's all 
coming together nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time events, net income for the first nine months  
of the fiscal year was $249 million on revenue of $3.4 billion, 
compared with earnings of $1 million on revenues of $2.1 billion in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AOL finished Tuesday at $153, down $9 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, shares fell to 
$152. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Feinstein, partner and senior analyst with Crowell, Weedon  
in Los Angeles, said the slide in the stock price seemed to be a 
small market correction after huge gains during the past week and 
was unrelated to the earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earnings came out after the close (of the market Tuesday)  
and anything the stock did may be irrelevant'' to that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After soaring from $112 a share to trade as high as $167.12 1/2, a  
one-week increase of 49 percent, Tuesday's decrease was a natural 
market adjustment, Feinstein said.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Closing Pathfinder Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s Pathfinder site will be shut  
down after Internet users increasingly chose other ways to reach 
the online magazines it featured. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1994, before the World Wide Web was a household  
name, the Pathfinder site was heralded by Time Warner as an 
easy-to-use gateway to its magazine trove. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Web sites became more user-friendly and useful,  
Pathfinder struggled for relevance. Time Warner never adequately 
promoted the site, analysts said. Today, almost all the company's 
Web traffic flows through sites such as Money.com and Time.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of helping Time Warner's online image, Pathfinder, with  
its sagging traffic, began to have an opposite effect, said Melissa 
Bane, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, a research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It began being used by the industry as an example of how not  
to do it. People pointed to Pathfinder and said it hadn't taken 
off,'' Bane said. ``It's kind of been an albatross around Time 
Warner's neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner played down the move Monday, saying the site's  
demise was a natural evolution as Internet users chose to go 
directly to online magazines. The site will be closed in a few 
months, company spokesman said. The time is needed for technicians 
to change Web addresses to remove the Pathfinder designation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to be the way consumers like to get their  
information, by going to a particular brand site,'' said Peter 
Costiglio, a Time Warner spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more of our promotion is in support of the individual  
sites and that will certainly continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is still out on consumer interest in all-in-one  
gateways to a media company's brand names. Walt Disney Co., for 
example, continues to heavily promote its Go Network as a gateway 
to the media conglomerate's properties, ranging from ABC.com to 
ESPN SportsZone.

<HEADLINE> NTT, AT&AMP;T Reach Pact on Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's biggest  
telephone company, has formed a partnership with U.S. 
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T Corp. to manage communications 
networks for multinational companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said today in announcing the deal their first  
priority was to collaborate on expanding the IBM Global Network in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is acquiring the IBM Global Network which specializes in  
data networking and Internet services for large companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two telecommunications companies said they were also  
considering a joint venture involving the global network business 
but NTT president Junichiro Miyazu said they are not considering an 
equity alliance involving their core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came amid a wave of consolidation in the global  
telecommunications industry. Last week, Deutsche Telekom AG and 
Telecom Italia SpA announced plans to merge in an $82 billion deal, 
while AT&AMP;T launched a $58 billion bid for cable company MediaOne 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today represents NTT's first major alliance  
with a foreign telecommunications company since a change in 
Japanese law permitted NTT to offer its services globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``As businesses become more dependent on network technology and  
as the promise of the Internet as a business platform for the 
future is realized, the issue of network reliability and quality 
across multiple borders is critical,'' NTT's Miyazu said today. 
</P>
<P>
	For AT&AMP;T, it is the second major step in a week to expand its  
international business with the help of a Japanese partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The American telecommunications company said earlier this week  
that it will join British Telecommunications PLC in buying a 
combined 30 percent stake in Japan Telecom Co., Japan's 
third-largest long-distance and international carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong said via a satellite link to  
the news conference where Miyazu spoke that AT&AMP;T hopes to expand 
its services for international business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said the timing of today's announcement, which came  
two days after the Japan Telecom agreement, ``just happened that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Japan Telecom had been fully briefed on the NTT  
agreement, and was given the opportunity to announce its deal 
first.

<HEADLINE> 2 Jailed in Cross Burning Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- An interracial couple who found a  
partially burned cross on their lawn said the two teen-agers 
convicted in the case weren't sent to jail long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	A Circuit Court judge followed a jury's recommendation Monday  
and sentenced Richard J. Elliott, 19, to 90 days in jail and a 
$2,500 fine. The jury convicted Elliott on Feb. 23 of attempting to 
burn a cross with the intent to intimidate and acquitted him of a 
conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan S. O'Mara, 19, who pleaded guilty Feb. 22 to both  
felony charges, was ordered to serve 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Frederick B. Lowe sentenced O'Mara to 90 days on  
each charge, to be served concurrently, and a $2,500 fine. The 
judge then suspended 45 days and $1,000 of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teens, who are white, remain free on bond while their  
attorneys appeal. A third teen, David Targee, who was 17 at the 
time, previously pleaded guilty to the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Targee, now 18, was released from jail April 14 after serving 15  
days of a 30-day sentence. A judge said he halved Targee's 30-day 
sentence because he mistakenly thought Targee pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanors. Targee also received a suspended 12-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	James Jubilee, who found the 4-foot-by-2-foot wooden cross with  
a burned spot in the middle on his lawn May 3, said the teen-agers 
should serve at least a year in prison. The maximum possible 
punishment on each charge was five years and a $2,500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really frustrated with the system,'' Jubilee, who is  
black, said outside court Monday. ``The system is supposed to be on 
the side of the victim. I don't think it is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Scott C. Vachris said Lowe could not increase the  
jury's recommendation for Elliott and gave O'Mara a similar 
sentence to be consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jubilee's wife, Susan, testified at Elliott's sentencing hearing  
that the cross burning left her family frightened. The Jubilees and 
their two young sons moved out of their rural Pungo neighborhood 
near the North Carolina border. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if it was an organized (hate) group, or just  
punky teen-agers, which it turned out to be,'' said Mrs. Jubilee, 
who is white. ``We didn't know every single night if whoever did it 
was coming back to burn our house down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Mara testified at his sentencing hearing that he drank at  
least 24 beers by himself at a party at Targee's house before the 
cross-burning incident. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered his ``deepest apology to both of the Jubilees and  
your family. There was never anything meant to harm any of you, 
especially on my part.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit, County Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Gun makers and merchants who knowingly put  
firearms in the hands of felons and juveniles should pay a price 
for turning streets violent, city and county leaders said in suing 
more than 30 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry profits from the assaults, maimings and killings  
on the streets of our city and county,'' Mayor Dennis Archer said 
Monday. ``Detroit and Wayne County have had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their separate lawsuits, the city named 31 companies and the  
county listed those 31 and four others as defendants. Archer said 
he expects the two Wayne County Circuit Court cases to be 
consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits, similar to several others filed by local governments  
across the country, did not specify damages, but lawyers said they 
could exceed $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta USA in Accokeek, Md., one  
of the companies named, said he was disappointed at ``a ridiculous 
trend in this country of blaming an object for human behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What these lawsuits fail to do is take into account the  
hundreds of thousands of lives that are saved each year by 
defensive gun use'' by private firearms owners, Reh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits claim that firearms makers and retailers know that  
the person filling out gun-purchase papers often is not the person 
who will eventually own the weapon, said Deputy County Executive 
Mike Duggan. 
</P>
<P>
	These are known as ``straw purchases,'' and manufacturers have  
adopted a policy of ``willful blindness'' toward them, the county 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent sheriff's department sting operation involving 10  
gun dealers picked at random, nine dealers allowed ``straw 
purchases'' by undercover agents who said they were felons or 
juveniles. No criminal charges have been filed against the dealers, 
but three cases may lead to charges, Sheriff Robert Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits are similar to those filed by local government  
leaders in Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn., Cleveland, Chicago, 
Miami-Dade County and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal court jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., found nine  
gun makers liable for shootings. Three companies were ordered to 
pay a total of $500,000 to one of the seven plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A firearms industry lobbying group said the lawsuits do nothing  
to prevent crime and are aimed at driving gun makers out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that these are misguided efforts,'' said Jack Adkins,  
director of operations for the American Shooting Sports Council 
Inc. in Atlanta. ``Not one life will be saved by such lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gun groups have responded to such lawsuits by lobbying state  
legislatures to pass laws prohibiting such legal action. In 
February, Georgia approved such a law. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Republican state Rep. Valde Garcia said still plans to  
go forward with legislation prohibiting state and local governments 
from suing gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the Monday's lawsuits had nothing to do with last  
week's school shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo., officials said. 
But some pointed to the deaths of 15 people at Columbine High 
School as a sign of the pervasiveness of illegal guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Littleton can happen anywhere, anytime, any place,'' county  
prosecutor John O'Hair said.

<HEADLINE> Big Funds Achieve Surprising Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The giants of the mutual fund industry seem  
intent right now on debunking everything that everybody used to say 
about the effect of funds' size on their performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the earliest days of the industry's rise in the 1950s and  
1960s, analysts have warned all who would listen that funds tended 
to suffer from their own success. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument certainly sounds plausible: The bigger a fund grows  
as a result of rising portfolio values and the new money that good 
performance naturally attracts, the harder it becomes for the 
fund's manager to keep doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	If a $25 million or $100 million portfolio could be maneuvered  
like a speedboat, that same fund at $1 billion or $5 billion in 
assets became a supertanker, much harder to steer amid the 
fast-changing currents of the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	When many funds kept doing well past the $1 billion or $5  
billion mark, the experts said the same principles still held, even 
if the size limits somehow had been increased. Beyond a certain 
point, almost everybody agreed, a fund simply could not avoid the 
pressures of size. 
</P>
<P>
	The logic is accepted even by many fund managers themselves. But  
in the real world of fund performance over the past year or so, the 
pattern simply isn't holding up. 
</P>
<P>
	When you look at a list of the largest mutual funds as of late  
April, the performance numbers practically jump off the page. As 
compiled by the research firm of Lipper Inc., the tally shows that 
19 of the 25 racked up better returns for the Jan. 1-April 22 
period than the 7.19 percent average gain for more than 6,200 
equity funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the six that didn't surpass the average, furthermore,  
have income as a primary or secondary objective, and thus may have 
a significant part of their portfolio in bonds or other 
conservative, relatively high-yielding investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the 52 weeks ended April 22, ALL 25 (!) of the largest  
funds -- starting with Fidelity Magellan, at $90.78 million in 
assets, and Vanguard 500 Index, at $82.52 million in assets -- 
chalked up a better return than the Lipper average of plus-5.30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Before we get too carried away, we need to acknowledge a couple  
of special factors behind the statistics. First of all, recent 
market conditions have heavily favored large blue-chip growth 
stocks of the sort most likely to be owned by the biggest stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important, our list suffers from selection bias,  
because we are looking at the biggest funds as of the end of the 
performance-measuring period, rather than at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest of the small-company growth funds, for instance,  
which have generally produced negative results over the past year 
or so, aren't on the Top 25 list by assets because they have been 
shrinking. So, we must admit that our analysis suffers from an 
element of redundancy: The most successful funds are successful. 
</P>
<P>
	But even after we concede those points, the story still carries  
considerable force. Most of the current Top 25 were giant funds a 
year ago as well, and yet their size didn't seem to slow them down 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity Magellan, the longtime No. 1 whose assets stood at more  
than $63 billion at the end of 1997, outdistanced both the average 
fund and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in 1998, and again in the 
Jan. 1-April 22 period this year. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the Top 25 list includes funds of a variety of  
different management styles which seemingly ought to have hindered 
their performance chances even further. Fidelity Puritan and 
Vanguard Wellington, for instance, are balanced funds whose bond 
holdings make it hard for them to keep up with a rising stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimco Total Return Institutional is a pure bond fund, while two  
of the others on the list are international or global funds -- the 
Europacific Growth and New Perspective funds from Capital 
Research's American Funds family. 
</P>
<P>
	It still makes sense for investors to keep an eye on any fund's  
performance as its size increases. But the record now shows that 
quite a few successful managers are better at adapting to asset 
growth than the experts ever expected they would be.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Illegal Gratuity Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it harder to convict  
someone of giving an illegal gratuity to a federal official, ruling 
Tuesday that gifts are a crime only if prosecutors prove they are 
linked to an official act. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, it would be a crime even for a championship sports  
team to give a jersey to the president while visiting the White 
House, the justices said in a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a defeat for Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz  
in a case stemming from his corruption investigation of former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Smaltz had asked the high court to 
reinstate a California agricultural cooperative's conviction of 
illegally giving gifts to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy himself was acquitted last December of all 30 corruption  
charges involving gifts he accepted from Sun-Diamond Growers of 
California and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by telephone, Smaltz had no immediate comment on the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun-Diamond's lawyer, Eric W. Bloom, said the company was  
``enormously gratified'' by the ruling. ``We hope and expect that 
this decision will end these proceedings,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Samuel J. Buffone of the American League of Lobbyists,  
which supported Sun-Diamond in a friend-of-the-court brief, said 
the ruling clarified the legal standard for lobbyists and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real danger here is that a broad, imprecise statute ... in  
the hands of an aggressive or unethical prosecutor can be a 
dangerous weapon,'' Buffone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal-gratuity law makes it a crime to give ``anything of  
value'' to a public official ``for or because of any official act 
performed or to be performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that the words  
``official act'' appeared to require ``that some particular act be 
identified and proved.'' It is not enough to show that gift-givers 
wanted to curry favor because an official was in a position to help 
them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading the law that broadly would lead to ``peculiar results,''  
Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would criminalize, for example, token gifts to the  
president based on his official position and not linked to any 
identifiable act -- such as the replica jerseys given by 
championship sports teams each year during ceremonial White House 
visits,'' the justice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia noted that the illegal-gratuity law is only one of many  
laws and ethical regulations governing what gifts can be given to 
government officials, lawmakers and judges. Those rules were 
unaffected by the justices' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``A statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted  
to be either a meat ax or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to 
be the latter,'' Scalia added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun-Diamond, a raisin and nut cooperative, was prosecuted in  
1996 as part of Smaltz's investigation of corruption allegations 
against Espy. The cooperative was convicted of giving $5,900 in 
illegal gratuities to Espy, including tickets to the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament, luggage, meals, a framed print and a crystal 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court last year threw out the conviction and  
$1.5 million fine and ordered a new trial. The U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the jury could not 
convict Sun-Diamond without evidence that its gifts to Espy were 
linked to his official actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaltz argued to the Supreme Court that the appeals court's  
opinion would create a ``serious obstacle'' to federal corruption 
allegations. He said the ruling meant prosecutors would have to 
show ``the virtual equivalent of a bribe,'' which requires proof 
that a gift was given in exchange for an official act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court upheld the appeals court's decision. Scalia  
added the justices' decision cast doubt on lower court rulings that 
the indictment was legally sufficient even though it did not allege 
a specific connection between the gifts and any official acts.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Unveils Durable Photo Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Go ahead and pass around your treasured  
snapshots. Eastman Kodak Co. says it has found a way to safeguard 
them from coming back torn, dogeared or curled up at the corners. 
</P>
<P>
	It unveiled a laminated, multi-layer photographic paper Tuesday  
that it claims is five times tougher than existing prints. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive George Fisher called the DuraLife brand the  
biggest advance in the photographic paper market since the 
introduction of color photo paper in 1942. It will be test-marketed 
in several cities this summer, followed by a national rollout in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who opt for DuraLife, it will add around $2 to the  
cost of each batch of prints. Customers who select Kodak's more 
expensive ``premium processing'' services would not be charged more 
for the new paper, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is still looking for ways to protect photos from other  
ubiquitous threats, like thumb smudges and water stains. ``Over 
time you may see some of those other improvements as well,'' 
promised spokesman Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife was developed in response to customer surveys  
indicating that 82 percent of people would like their photos to be 
more resistant to tears and creases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is virtually impossible to tear,'' said Bill Smith, a  
marketing manager for Kodak. ``It takes the worry out of using and 
sharing your pictures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife resists curls in most climates, even in high humidity,  
Kodak said. The paper also produces sharper and brighter images 
than regular prints and more accurately reveals pastel color 
details, the company contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The product introduction is the latest step in Kodak's bid to  
maintain its market dominance amid price wars with Japanese rival 
Fuji Photo Film Co. that have hurt revenues and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Although choosing the new paper would cost consumers more,  
Kodak's strategy is to ``truly differentiate'' itself with superior 
products and services rather than lower prices, Fisher said at a 
news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not use price as a competitive tactic,'' said Fisher,  
allowing that the company would protect its market share with lower 
prices as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who also provided an update on Kodak's financial  
outlook, stood by projections for at least 10 percent annual growth 
in earnings-per-share and said the company deserves a higher value 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Kodak rose $1 to $77.62 1/2, extending a sharp rebound from a low of 
$60.81 1/4 earlier this month. The stock is now about 12.7 percent 
below the peak of $88.93 3/4 set nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak, the world's biggest photography company, has also been  
trying to cut costs by eliminating 19,900 jobs out of a worldwide 
payroll of 100,500 by year-end. About two-thirds of those cuts have 
been made, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife will be highlighted with a major advertising campaign.  
Kodak is hoping a growing share of consumers will prefer it over 
conventional paper. Premium-quality film, Smith noted, is now 
preferred by 45 percent of Kodak customers, up from 37 percent just 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``DuraLife won't ever replace conventional paper,'' he added.  
``There's always going to be a segment that wants a lower-cost 
product.''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Killing Pastor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The family of a pastor gunned down in his  
church gave the man convicted of the fatal shooting plenty to chew 
on as he headed off to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray that you spend the rest of your days on this earth  
thinking about the senseless crime you committed and the grief you 
caused our family and others to suffer,'' Candace Henry told 
Kenneth Nance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance was sentenced to life in prison Monday in Montgomery  
County Common Pleas Court for the slaying of Henry's father, the 
Rev. Andrew Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance, 59, pleaded guilty to aggravated murder this month, but  
has never explained the Sept. 16 shooting of Lofton, 65, at Christ 
Temple Apostolic Church in suburban Trotwood. Police have said 
religious differences likely led to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney William Ary said the two men had had serious  
disagreements and Nance may have been upset about an attempt to 
expel him from the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the reverend had been trying to get him out of the  
church,'' said Ary. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton's family denied there was any confrontation or an effort  
to kick Nance out of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was very passive, a very easygoing person,'' said  
Jonathan Lofton, one of the pastor's 11 children. ``He was not 
confrontational. He would walk away before he would have a 
confrontation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton said Nance was not a member of the church, even though he  
sang in the church choir and attended Bible classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance had sat quietly during class on Sept. 16, while Lofton  
explained the Book of Revelation and urged his Bible students to 
prepare themselves for the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Nance shot Lofton several times as the pastor spoke  
with people after the class. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you did, the way you did it, where you did it was  
wrong,'' Judge Dennis Langer told Nance at sentencing. ``I hope you 
contemplate every day you are there how wrong your murderous act 
was and how it has caused unbelievable heartache.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nance will be eligible for parole in 20 years.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. Girlfriend May Have Had Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Radios and televisions fell silent  
across the Denver area at 11:21 a.m. today, one week to the minute 
after the eruption of gunfire at Columbine High School was first 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Church bells tolled 15 times, one for each person killed,  
including the gunmen, and television news broadcasts showed a blue 
Columbine memorial ribbon while observing the moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, authorities said the 18-year-old girlfriend of gunman  
Dylan Klebold had purchased at least two of the weapons used in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that investigators believe the  
girlfriend bought three weapons not long after her 18th birthday in 
November. The Denver Rocky Mountain News said the young woman, 
identified as Robyn K. Anderson, was believed to have bought two 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also discounted a report from a Colorado Springs  
gun dealer that the other gunman, Eric Harris, was among five teens 
who tried to buy a machine gun and another weapon last month. The 
dealer said the aborted transaction was videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larry Bettendorf, an agent with the federal Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the videotapes had nothing to 
do with the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agents have reviewed the videotape or tapes, and they did  
not find any evidence of the suspects or their associates in 
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, committed suicide after bursting  
into Columbine High with guns and bombs a week ago today, killing 
12 fellow students and one teacher. Four guns were found in the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson was questioned Monday, and authorities describe her  
as a witness, not a suspect. District Attorney Dave Thomas said she 
was cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the weapons may have been purchased legally.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think three of them were provided by the girlfriend of  
Klebold,'' Mark Paulter, a Jefferson County chief district 
attorney, told the Post. ``She bought them because she was older. 
She was 18 at the time. She bought them in November or December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure she committed a crime under Colorado statute.  
If you provide a handgun to a person under 18, that's a violation 
of the statute. If you provide a shotgun or a rifle, that's not a 
violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Anderson bought two shotguns and a rifle.  
Sheriff John Stone acknowledged it was possible that she did know 
how Klebold and Harris planned to use the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not going to use those for pheasant hunting,'' Stone  
told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who was at Ms. Anderson's home declined to comment, saying  
the family was terrorized by reporters, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still believe that someone other than Klebold and  
Harris was aware of their plans in the days and weeks leading up to 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of munitions there,'' Stone said. ``Either  
somebody else brought it in or they brought it in and stored it. 
... It's hard to get that in under your raincoat and not be 
noticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said three boys who were arrested near Columbine on the  
day of the attack have not been cleared in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm suspicious of their story,'' Stone said. ``They are not  
out of the woods in this one yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, authorities said Klebold and Harris had aimed for  
an even bigger bloodbath, plotting to kill hundreds of students, 
and then to hijack a plane and crash it into New York City. 
Investigators cited a diary they found that was kept by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack's bold, bizarre nature led to speculation that the  
gunmen might have been taking drugs, but toxicology tests revealed 
no drugs or alcohol in their bodies, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it a little more frightening to me that they were of  
sound mind and not under the influence of alcohol and drugs,'' 
prosecutor Thomas told MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's campus remained closed to everyone except bomb  
squads and investigators. Columbine teachers reported for duty 
today at an undisclosed location. Columbine's students will begin 
classes at nearby Chatfield High School next Monday, four days 
later than planned, school officials decided today. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers haven't been allowed to pick up their books and other  
belongings since the bloodshed at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they need anything and we can find it, we'll get it for  
them,'' sheriff's Sgt. Jim Parr said Monday. ``But I think they're 
going to be operating on a shoestring for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chatfield Principal Sally Blanchard said her staff would try to  
make Columbine teachers feel welcome on campus as they prepare 
their lessons in hopes of finishing out the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want them to feel honored. We want them to feel safe,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals were held Monday for three students and Dave Sanders,  
the only teacher killed in the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners, including students by the hundreds, also turned out  
Monday to remember Lauren Townsend, an 18-year-old honor student 
and captain of the girls' volleyball team; Daniel Rohrbough, the 
15-year-old boy shot while holding an exit door open for fleeing 
students; and Cassie Bernall, the 17-year-old girl who professed 
her love of God just before she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' Pastor George Kirsten told  
mourners. ``She went to the martyrs' hall of fame.''

noticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said three boys who were arrested near Columbine on the  
day of the attack have not been cleared in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm suspicious of their story,'' Stone said. ``They are not  
out of the woods in this one yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, authorities said Klebold and Harris had aimed for  
an even bigger bloodbath, plotting to kill hundreds of students, 
and then to hijack a plane and crash it into New York City. 
Investigators cited a diary they found that was kept by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack's bold, bizarre nature led to speculation that the  
gunmen might have been taking drugs, but toxicology tests revealed 
no drugs or alcohol in their bodies, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it a little more frightening to me that they were of  
sound mind and not under the influence of alcohol and drugs,'' 
prosecutor Thomas told MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's campus remained closed to everyone except bomb  
squads and investigators. Columbine teachers reported for duty 
today at an undisclosed location. Columbine's students will begin 
classes at nearby Chatfield High School next Monday, four days 
later than planned, school officials decided today. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers haven't been allowed to pick up their books and other  
belongings since the bloodshed at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they need anything and we can find it, we'll get it for  
them,'' sheriff's Sgt. Jim Parr said Monday. ``But I think they're 
going to be operating on a shoestring for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chatfield Principal Sally Blanchard said her staff would try to  
make Columbine teachers feel welcome on campus as they prepare 
their lessons in hopes of finishing out the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want them to feel honored. We want them to feel safe,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals were held Monday for three students and Dave Sanders,  
the only teacher killed in the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners, including students by the hundreds, also turned out  
Monday to remember Lauren Townsend, an 18-year-old honor student 
and captain of the girls' volleyball team; Daniel Rohrbough, the 
15-year-old boy shot while holding an exit door open for fleeing 
students; and Cassie Bernall, the 17-year-old girl who professed 
her love of God just before she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' Pastor George Kirsten told  
mourners. ``She went to the martyrs' hall of fame.''

<HEADLINE> Obesity Risks Decline With Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as  
it is for the middle-aged or young adults, according to a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are similar to those of a study reported last year  
that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 
75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people 
are extremely obese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get  
older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor 
decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the 
University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the 
study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers not affiliated with the study said the findings  
are not that meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this  
study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr. 
JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and  
women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an 
average of 14.8 years. The patients, who were referred to an 
obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and 
body mass index. 
</P>
<P>
	Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard  
way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare 
the girth of people of different heights. BMI is body fat in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared. 
</P>
<P>
	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of  
Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 
and above is obese. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese  
person -- with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or 
younger. Moderately obese men and women -- with a BMI between 32 and 
40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is  
a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density 
declines with age. They also noted that the study participants were 
recruited rather than randomly selected.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sale Agreement Is Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the Washington Redskins, the only change  
will be at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Norv Turner will stay, along with general manager Charley  
Casserly and other Redskins employees if Daniel Snyder is approved 
as the new owner of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees of the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke announced  
an agreement Monday to sell the team, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and 
the Redskin Park training facility to Snyder, a local 
communications executive, for $800 million -- a record price for any 
sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to retain both Norv Turner and Charley Casserly in  
their current positions with the Redskins,'' Snyder said. 
``Football will be a new business for me, and I am going to need 
experienced football personnel to run the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale will be examined by the NFL's finance  
committee and submitted before league owners at their May 25-26 
meetings in Atlanta. Approval is expected, which would make Snyder, 
34, the youngest majority owner in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday marked the second time the trustees have agreed to sell  
the team for $800 million. In January, they reached an agreement 
with a group headed by New York real estate magnate Howard Milstein 
and including Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein never won favor with most of the 31 NFL owners, 24  
of whom must vote to approve the sale of any team. Some owners said 
he was using too much borrowed money to finance the deal, while 
others worried that he would be a maverick owner because of his 
contentious stewardship of the NHL's New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	When Milstein withdrew April 7, Snyder formed his own group. It  
includes members of Snyder's family, plus New York Daily News 
publishers Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner. Zuckerman is also 
publisher of U.S. News &AMP; World Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snyder group matched the Milstein-Snyder offer of $800  
million. Snyder allayed financing concerns by putting more than 
$100 million cash behind the bid, and his promise to retain Turner 
and Casserly offers a sense of continuity that could help win the 
votes of several owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based of our own review ... and our discussions with the  
league office, we believe the financing and ownership structure 
will comply with NFL rules,'' the trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price would shatter the record $530 million paid by  
Alfred Lerner last year for the expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, when Milstein and Snyder were partners, Snyder  
strongly hinted at major personnel changes if the group bought the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his theme is stability.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am writing to assure you that if I am approved, I intend to  
retain all of you,'' Snyder wrote in a letter to all employees at 
Redskin Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Turner nor Casserly would comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The only person who wouldn't survive the ownership change is  
team president John Kent Cooke, who reacted bitterly to losing the 
battle to keep the team in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale and the manner in which it has been conducted is an  
extreme disappointment to me personally,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke, who became the Redskins' majority owner in  
1974, died April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the team to his son, he 
instructed that the team and stadium be sold and the money used to 
establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke was among several bidders, but he could not  
match the $800 million offer made by the Milstein-Snyder group in 
January. Cooke made a new offer this month after Milstein withdrew, 
but once again it was substantially less than $800 million. He took 
the offer off the table last week because the trustees were 
negotiating only with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The executors and their representatives stated that accepting  
the highest bid was their fiduciary obligation required to fulfill 
my father's wishes and to comply with the law,'' Cooke said. ``None 
of these claims is correct, and the result of this decision is a 
loss of a family business and a personal tragedy to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have speculated that my father did not want his family to  
continue with the Redskins. This, too, is false. He simply did not 
think it was possible to do so in the early 1990s with the downturn 
of the economy and a downturn with our family businesses and with 
the ever-present demands of inheritance taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the trustees said they chose Snyder over Cooke  
because Snyder's offer would mean more money for scholarships and 
that Cooke's bid would require special waivers of NFL rules because 
of its financial structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is chief executive of Snyder Communications in Bethesda,  
Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 locations in 
12 countries.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Group Launches Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- To fight declining readership, newspapers must  
launch aggressive advertising campaigns to win new readers and win 
back those who have switched to other media, the Newspaper 
Association of America said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association on Monday announced its intent to help  
newspapers improve readership with an $11.5 million marketing plan 
headed by Coca-Cola Co.'s former marketing czar, Sergio Zyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to become better marketers and understand our  
customers better. There are a whole lot of marketers who want to 
take our readers away,'' said association chairman Richard 
Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, a nonprofit organization representing the  
country's $54 billion newspaper industry, announced the five-year 
marketing plan at its annual conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary goals of the Readership Initiative campaign are to  
find ways to stop readers from defecting to other media and to make 
newspapers a part of every advertiser's media plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman was chosen to head the initiative to inject some  
excitement into what have traditionally been drab newspaper 
campaigns to lure readers, Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the heaviest hitters in the industry of  
marketing,'' said Gottlieb, president and CEO of Davenport, 
Iowa-based Lee Enterprises Inc., which owns newspapers and 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman, who stepped down at Coca-Cola last year, oversaw the  
successful debut of Diet Coke and the unfavorable launch of New 
Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	He will direct research on what attracts or repels readers, and  
design a campaign that can be used by newspapers nationwide, said 
N. Christian Anderson III, president of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors and publisher and CEO of The Orange County 
Register in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously the highest priority, to find better ways of  
reaching readers,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newspapers are doing well financially, but the bottom line  
is that readership is declining at too many publications, said John 
Sturm, association president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily newspaper readership in the top 50 markets in the United  
States is 58 percent of the adult population, according to the 
association. Readership is about 10 percent higher on Sundays.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Focusing on Web Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc. plans a major push into  
e-commerce, announcing plans to spin off its Web sales operation 
into a separate subsidiary called toysrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus-based company vowed to leapfrog past eToys into the  
top spot among online vendors of toys, clothing and other 
children's products by the fall, the all-important holiday shopping 
season, chief executive officer Robert C. Nakasone said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can see this, over time, becoming an important business for  
us,'' Nakasone predicted. ``We're going to be No. 1 in e-commerce 
in toys and children's products for the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also build a large distribution center in  
Memphis, Tenn., and possibly sell stock for the unit. Toys R Us 
said it will take on a venture capital firm as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison said  
that goal is feasible, given the company's name recognition and 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're late (focusing on e-commerce), but it's good  
that they're doing it now, and they have a strong chance of being 
successful,'' McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us was passed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. as America's top  
toy retailer last year. It still claims to be the world's biggest 
retailer of children's products, with $11.2 billion in annual 
sales, but the company reported a $132 million loss last year 
because of a $508 million charge for store closings and 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has operated a Web site for nearly two years, but  
until last June it only supplied company information such as store 
locations. After beginning to sell toys on the Web, Toys R Us saw a 
jump in online visitors -- including a surge so strong during the 
holiday season that the Web page had to be taken down for a few 
days -- leading to the decision to improve the site, Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides making it easier to navigate and improving graphics,  
Toys R Us will also add some e-mail options, including notifying 
customers when out-of-stock merchandise again becomes available or 
reminding patrons when relatives' birthdays are coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	While Internet toy sales are only expected to total $52.6  
million this year, or 0.2 percent of all U.S. toy sales, those 
revenues are expected to increase tenfold to about $555 million in 
the next three years, according to Ken Cassar of New York-based 
research firm Jupiter Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Mattel, the world's biggest toymaker and one  
of Toys R Us' biggest suppliers, announced that it would spend $50 
million to launch an Internet sales venture called Mattel.com in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Toys R Us subsidiary handling the Web sales will be  
located somewhere in Northern California's Silicon Valley, but a 
site has not been chosen yet. The improved site, which will also 
sell merchandise from the company's Kids R Us and Babies R Us 
clothing stores, should be operating by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Benchmark Capital of Menlo Park, Calif., the Silicon Valley  
venture capital firm that helped bankroll such Internet successes 
as the online auction house eBay, will partner with Toys R Us in 
the new venture and is making an undisclosed investment. 
</P>
<P>
	McGowan said the partnership gives Toys R Us ``access to smart  
people with good technology faster than they would have gotten 
there on their own.'' The plan to offer shares will help attract 
workers from the Silicon Valley looking for lucrative options on an 
Internet stock, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us operates 1,488 stores worldwide, down from its peak of  
around 1,500, according to company spokeswoman Rebecca Caruso. The 
current stores include 703 U.S. toy stores, 455 international toy 
stores, 212 Kids R Us children's clothing stores and 118 Babies R 
Us stores.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Law Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed for new controls on  
guns Tuesday, and top Republicans proposed a hard look at the 
nation's violence-tinged culture as the two parties offered 
different responses to last week's Colorado high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People's lives are at stake here,'' Clinton declared at the  
White House. He urged the GOP-controlled Congress to raise from 18 
to 21 the legal age for handgun possession and to hold negligent 
parents liable when their children use guns to commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had  
agreed to give Democrats an opportunity for a debate and vote on 
firearms proposals in about two weeks. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois 
pronounced Lott's decision ``a breakthrough'' toward passage of 
legislation, and several advocates of tougher gun laws said they 
thought they could prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, neither Lott nor House Speaker Dennis Hastert mentioned  
gun control as they called jointly for a ``National Conference on 
Youth and Culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This conference should examine important issues facing  
students and society, including video games, drugs in school, 
Hollywood, prayer in schools, parental involvement and local 
control of schools,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Hastert nor Lott, who appeared together at a middle  
school in Virginia to tout recently passed education legislation, 
offered details. 
</P>
<P>
	Back inside the Capitol, Lott spoke dismissively of the call for  
new gun-control legislation as a ``typical knee-jerk reaction.'' 
The issues raised by last week's shooting at the Columbine High 
School outside Denver are ``bigger than just a gun debate,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he appeared to leave open the door to some  
type of restrictions, mentioning a measure calling for child safety 
locks on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats said they are counting on the horror of the  
Colorado shooting to fundamentally change the political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that the climate has changed,'' said Sen. Chuck  
Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	First at the White House, and then in the Capitol, the nation's  
political leaders paused during the day to observe a moment of 
silence for the victims of the shooting rampage. It was a week ago 
that 12 students and a teacher died at the hands of two heavily 
armed students, who ended the carnage by turning their weapons on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief silence since then was an interlude to the political  
jockeying that broke out Tuesday on an issue that had faded into 
the background in recent years. Republicans, heavily funded by the 
National Rifle Association, have traditionally opposed gun control 
legislation. Democrats have shied away from forcing votes on the 
question in recent years, in part to spare members of their rank 
and file from Western and Southern states from having to make 
politically unpalatable choices. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Clinton said his proposals would amount to  
no more than minor delays and minor hassles for sportsmen and legal 
gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a hassle for them. It's worth it. It's worth  
it. We're sorry -- it's worth it,'' the president said. ``People's 
lives are at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``So it's not just the culture of violence that has to  
change. It's the culture of hunting and sport shooting that has to 
stop financing efforts to frighten their members who are good, 
God-fearing, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens out there, into 
believing that every time we try to save a kid's life, it's a 
camel's nose in the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is criminal how easy it is for children in America to  
obtain guns,'' added first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, weighing a 
Senate candidacy in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes banning juvenile possession of  
semiautomatic assault rifles, halting imports of all high-capacity 
ammunition clips and limiting an individual's handgun purchases to 
one per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of explosives also would be subject to the same Brady law  
background checks as gun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	One top Republican, House Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, whose Capitol  
office was invaded by a mentally ill gunman almost a year ago, said 
in a statement that he was ``offended by the president's political 
maneuvering. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We as parents have a responsibility to monitor what they  
watch, what they listen to and what they hold, not after the fact, 
but always. Our communities must be active in returning America to 
a society based on values, morals and discipline. And most 
importantly, we must stress faith in God and instill hope in our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican dissented from the leadership during the day.  
Rhode Island's Sen. John Chafee issued a strongly worded statement 
that said, ``To those who say there is something terribly wrong 
with an American culture that breeds the sort of children who are 
capable of reeking such carnage, I say it isn't our American 
culture that's wrong. What's wrong is our nation's love affair with 
guns.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Considers Gambling Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton administration effort to protect  
compulsive gamblers from the lure of some casinos and games of 
chance ran into rigorous Supreme Court questioning today. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices wondered aloud about the legitimacy of a  
government ban on television and radio ads promoting privately 
owned casinos while such advertising is allowed for casinos owned 
by Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why doesn't Indian casino advertising have the same effect as  
private casino gambling with respect to the compulsive gambler?'' 
Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Justice Department lawyer Barbara 
Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the ban might deter only  
casual gamblers. ``The true drunk is going to find the bottle,'' 
she said, equating tribe-owned casinos with that bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising ban is being challenged by broadcasters as a  
violation of free-speech rights. The ban is in effect in only some 
parts of the nation because some federal appeals courts have ruled 
it unconstitutional while others have upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' decision is expected by late June.  
</P>
<P>
	``The federal scheme is so riddled with exceptions that it  
cannot advance the government's asserted interests'' in protecting 
compulsive gamblers, argued Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer 
representing New Orleans-area broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Underwood, the government's lawyer, emphasized ``the  
devastating social costs that are inflicted'' on an estimated 3 
million compulsive gamblers, and said Congress is free to address 
the largest part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	She said privately owned casinos account for 40 percent of the  
revenues from all types of gambling nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing federal law bans broadcast advertising for ``any  
lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But over the 
past 20 years, Congress has amended the anti-broadcast law to allow 
ads for casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any 
gambling sponsored by nonprofit promoters for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia sponsor and  
aggressively advertise lotteries, and more than two-thirds of the 
states are home to Indian-owned casinos. Non-Indian casinos are 
legal in 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.  
Kennedy and David H. Souter also asked questions that seemed 
skeptical of the government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speech is different,'' Souter told Underwood at one point.  
</P>
<P>
	But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin  
Scalia appeared far more sympathetic to the government's defense of 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters are supported in friend-of-the-court briefs  
submitted by, among others, the American Advertising Federation, 
American Civil Liberties Union, Newspaper Association of America 
and American Gaming Association. No friend-of-the-court briefs 
support the government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Supreme Court rulings appear to cut against such an  
advertising ban. The court last year barred states from banning 
advertising that refers to liquor prices in efforts to promote 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association vs.  
U.S., 98-387.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Girlfriend May Have Had Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Exactly a week after the first shots  
rang out at Columbine High School, a hush fell over the Denver area 
Tuesday and church bells tolled 15 times -- one for each victim and 
the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first public expression of mourning that included the  
two killers, whose names went unmentioned at Sunday's memorial for 
70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Televisions and radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m.  
After the tolling, the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a celebratory peal to remind everybody that there is  
life after death,'' said Barry Bowman of St. John's Episcopal 
Cathedral in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were held. The 
Velasquez services drew 800 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, questioned Dylan Klebold's 18-year-old  
girlfriend, who is believed to have bought at least two of the 
weapons used by Klebold and Eric Harris. Investigators want to know 
whether she knew how the guns were to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington, President Clinton announced proposals to  
tighten federal gun laws. ``We don't have to go through another 
Littleton if the American people want it badly enough,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, committed suicide after  
bursting into Columbine High with guns and bombs on April 20. They 
killed 12 fellow students and one teacher. Four guns were found in 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Robyn K. Anderson bought at least two of the  
weapons -- a rifle and a shotgun -- at a Denver-area gun show last 
fall. Ms. Anderson has not been arrested, and authorities stopped 
short of describing her as a suspect. She has retained a lawyer and 
is said to be cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, it is illegal to give a minor a pistol, and illegal  
to give anyone a gun with the knowledge that it will be used in a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	At Velasquez's funeral, neighbors and relatives remembered him  
as a ``gentle giant'' who enjoyed chores and family activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt in my mind that those two young assailants  
were acting under satanic influence,'' said the Rev. Wayne LaGrone. 
``If we want the violence to stop, we must start with ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine teachers returned to work Tuesday -- not at the heavily  
damaged high school, but a few miles away at Chatfield High. 
Columbine students will return to classes on Monday -- also at 
Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Security there will be increased, with guards checking IDs and  
continuing sweeps by law enforcement officers. School 
administrators also have banned students from wearing trench coats 
of the sort worn by the killers to conceal their weapons as they 
approached the school.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Brazil Bank Chief Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A scandal tarnishing Brazil's  
Central Bank is undermining recent optimism that Latin America's 
largest economy is on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested former Central Bank president Francisco Lopes on  
Monday after he refused to sign a document pledging to tell the 
truth at a Senate inquiry into alleged banking irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later released after making a $175 bail payment, the  
Agencia Estado news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo stock exchange index plunged after the arrest,  
closing down 2.1 percent. Traders also predicted strong losses 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since the founding of the institute 35  
years ago that a former president has been arrested. The bank is 
equivalent to the U.S. Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso late Monday expressed  
concern at Lopes' stance, saying he ``neglected to do his duty,'' 
but moved to play down the controversy's potential effect on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are calm like me. ... We don't need a commotion  
about a Senate inquiry or two,'' Cardoso said in a televised 
interview. ``In the United States, President Clinton went through 
various congressional inquiries and (financial) markets did not 
die. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil isn't going to stop ... the government will continue  
governing and Congress will continue to vote on reforms,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes, who headed the Central Bank briefly during Brazil's rocky  
currency devaluation in January, was due to answer allegations that 
the Central Bank gave special treatment to some banks at the time 
and leaked confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked by a Senate committee member if he would sign the  
document before giving testimony, he said he had been ``advised by 
my lawyers'' not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I can testify here as a witness because I am  
being accused,'' Lopes told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators suspect Lopes fed economic consultancy firm  
Macrometrica with information on the Central Bank's next moves on 
interest rates and foreign exchange while he was president. Lopes 
owned the firm, which gives advice to banks, until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Their suspicions are based on documents seized at Lopes' house  
during a police search earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes' refusal in the Senate to sign the document Monday --  
equivalent to refusing to swear an oath on the Bible in court -- was 
seen as a strategy by Lopes' lawyers to take his case to a regular 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes was president of the Central Bank for just 15 days before  
being dismissed. He had held other posts at the bank since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced on Feb. 2, without an official explanation, days  
after implementing a policy allowing Brazil's currency, the real, 
to float freely against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two weeks after the policy was introduced, the real  
plunged 32 percent against the dollar, sparking fears of a serious 
knock-on effect in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government quickly won Congress approval of several  
reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund to implement a 
$41 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, fears that inflation would take hold have  
subsided, the real has grown stronger and foreign investment has 
started to return.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Group Launches Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- To fight declining readership, newspapers must  
launch aggressive advertising campaigns to win new readers and win 
back those who have switched to other media, the Newspaper 
Association of America said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association on Monday announced its intent to help  
newspapers improve readership with an $11.5 million marketing plan 
headed by Coca-Cola Co.'s former marketing czar, Sergio Zyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to become better marketers and understand our  
customers better. There are a whole lot of marketers who want to 
take our readers away,'' said association chairman Richard 
Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, a nonprofit organization representing the  
country's $54 billion newspaper industry, announced the five-year 
marketing plan at its annual conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary goals of the Readership Initiative campaign are to  
find ways to stop readers from defecting to other media and to make 
newspapers a part of every advertiser's media plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman was chosen to head the initiative to inject some  
excitement into what have traditionally been drab newspaper 
campaigns to lure readers, Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the heaviest hitters in the industry of  
marketing,'' said Gottlieb, president and CEO of Davenport, 
Iowa-based Lee Enterprises Inc., which owns newspapers and 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyman, who stepped down at Coca-Cola last year, oversaw the  
successful debut of Diet Coke and the unfavorable launch of New 
Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	He will direct research on what attracts or repels readers, and  
design a campaign that can be used by newspapers nationwide, said 
N. Christian Anderson III, president of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors and publisher and CEO of The Orange County 
Register in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously the highest priority, to find better ways of  
reaching readers,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newspapers are doing well financially, but the bottom line  
is that readership is declining at too many publications, said John 
Sturm, association president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily newspaper readership in the top 50 markets in the United  
States is 58 percent of the adult population, according to the 
association. Readership is about 10 percent higher on Sundays.

<HEADLINE> Nafzger's Seeks Win in Ky. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Carl Nafzger would like nothing more than  
to end the 1990s the way he started it -- with a victory in the 
Kentucky Derby. Duplicating the heartwarming stretch run call he 
made for 92-year-old Frances Genter, however, is another issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a moment of exhilaration, of love, of affection,''  
Nafzger said on a rainy Monday morning at Churchill Downs. ``She 
was everyone's grandmother Genter. Nothing was rehearsed, not then, 
not now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990 race, Unbridled pulled away for a 3 1/2-length victory  
over Summer Squall, and Nafzger making sure a frail `Mrs. Genter' 
knew what was happening as they stood together in the owner's box. 
Captured on national TV, the magical moment stands as one of the 
most memorable in the 125-year history of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taking the lead. He's gonna win. He's gonna win. He's  
gonna win. He's a winner! He's a winner! He's a winner Mrs. Genter! 
You've won the Kentucky Derby, Mrs. Genter! I love you,'' Nafzger 
said, his voice rising and cracking with emotion as Unbridled moved 
closer and closer to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Genter died in 1992, but now the 57-year-old Nafzger is  
back at the Derby a second time. And the bull-rider turned trainer 
will saddle a top contender in Florida Derby winner Vicar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sit around thinking about getting to the Derby every  
year,'' Nafzger said. ``If we make the cut, we make the cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, ridden by Shane Sellers, certainly did this year. The  
3-year-old son of Wild Again had minor throat surgery after a 
fifth-place finish in the Jan. 16 Holy Bull Stakes, then won the 
Fountain of Youth and Florida Derby before a solid third-place 
effort in the Blue Grass Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In '90, Nafzger used the same path, with similar results, in  
preparing Unbridled for the Derby. Unbridled was third in the 
Fountain of Youth, first in the Florida Derby and third in the Blue 
Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the routine won't be much different, either. Vicar  
galloped 1 1/8 miles with exercise rider Krissie Knorr on Monday. 
Vicar, owned by 75-year old James Tafel, was scheduled to work 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a perfect gallop, and now he's ready to work,''  
Nafzger said of his colt, who prefers to race just of the pace. 
``If it keeps raining, it doesn't matter. He'd have to run in the 
rain anyway, but this is a good track and rain doesn't hurt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 57-year-old Nafzger is saddling his second Derby  
horse, trainer Bob Baffert is going after an unprecedented third 
straight Derby win. Trainers Nick Zito and D. Wayne Lukas are 
looking for their third Derby wins in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	When entries are taken on Wednesday, a full field of 20 horses --  
based on money earned in graded stakes -- is expected. Baffert's 
General Challenge and Prime Timber, 1-2 in the April 3 Santa Anita 
Derby, are the likely favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about this Derby,'' Baffert said. ``I've got two  
horses who are contenders. I hope one of them wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert won the '97 Derby with Silver Charm and last year's with  
Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also said Monday that Silverbulletday, one of two  
fillies he was considering for the Derby, would run in Friday's 
Kentucky Oaks. Silverbulletday has won nine of 10 career starts. A 
decision on his other filly, Excellent Meeting, could come as early 
as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, a winner of four straight, made things  
tougher after she worked 5 furlongs in a swift 59 1-5 seconds on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to think about it for Excellent Meeting,''  
Baffert said, adding that owner John Mabee, who also owns General 
Challenge, will be in town today. ``I was hoping she wouldn't have 
had such a great work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One filly, Three Ring, is set for Saturday's $1 million Derby.  
Only 36 fillies have run in the Derby; three have won -- Winning 
Colors in 1988, Genuine Risk in 1980 and Regret in 1915. Serena's 
Song, who finished 16th in 1995, has been the only filly to run in 
the Derby in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, trained by Edward Plesa, has five wins in eight  
career starts, but will be going against the boys for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert is only the sixth trainer to be in position to win a  
third straight Derby. Only two, Dick Thompson (in the 1930s) and 
Lukas, had a starter in the third year. Lukas won with Thunder 
Gulch in '95 and Grindstone in '96, but was 13th with Deeds Not 
Words in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who has saddled at least one Derby horse every year since  
1981, will have two chances on Saturday -- Cat Thief and 
Charismatic. Cat Thief was second in the Blue Grass, while 
late-bloomer Charismatic is coming off a win in the April 18 
Lexington Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito also has two set for the Derby, Wood Memorial winner Adonis  
and Gallery Furniture.com Stakes winner Stephen Got Even.

<HEADLINE> Moon Signs 2-Year Deal With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Warren Moon apparently will finish his  
career where Joe Montana and Marcus Allen did -- as a member of the 
Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's most prolific passers was to be introduced  
today as the backup to Elvis Grbac of the Chiefs. The 42-year-old 
Moon, an unrestricted free agent after playing for Seattle last 
year, signed a two-year contract with the Chiefs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, who started 10 games for the Seahawks last year, joined  
the Chiefs knowing full well he was assuming a backup role, Chiefs 
president and general manager Carl Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon reportedly received a $200,000 signing bonus and $800,000  
salary, plus incentives for 1999. He would get $2.2 million in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren gives us the veteran quarterback experience that every  
team would like to have,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City today announced the signing of veteran linebacker  
Marvcus Patton to a three-year contract as an unrestricted free 
agent. He spent the past four seasons with Washington -- including 
three as the Redskins' leading tackler -- and the preceding five 
with the Buffalo Bills, playing in 144 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs signed Moon primarily for his 14 years of NFL  
experience as they begin the third year of trying to develop Grbac 
into a top-flight quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try to use him in any way that I can,'' said Grbac, who  
has been bothered by injuries for two straight seasons, and last 
year lost his confidence as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac missed 16 games the past two seasons because of injuries  
and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after recovering from an injury in last season's opening  
game, Grbac was kept on the bench in favor of Rich Gannon. Grbac 
came back to start the season finale at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Gannon has signed as a free agent with the Raiders  
and Marty Schottenheimer resigned as coach. Todd Collins is the 
Chiefs' third quarterback, but has not played a down. 
</P>
<P>
	Schottenheimer insisted despite the consistently fine play of  
Gannon last year that Grbac was the Chiefs' quarterback of the 
future. New coach Gunther Cunningham has repeated that refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon continues a Chiefs trend that brought both Montana and  
Allen into the clubhouse in the twilight of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the really important factors was viewing the prior  
experience of Marcus Allen and Joe Montana,'' said Moon's agent, 
Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to have a career resurrection in Kansas City. They  
seemed to have been treated in a very classy manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and Cunningham emphasized Moon's leadership skills.  
</P>
<P>
	``His experience on the field, in the classroom and in the  
locker room will be similar to that which Marcus Allen brought 
us,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be very helpful to Elvis Grbac in his  
development,'' Cunningham said. ``I think the players will respond 
well to him because I think he carries respect throughout the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac, signed as a free agent from the 49ers in 1997, got the  
Chiefs off to an 8-1 start that season before he fractured his left 
collarbone while being sacked against Pittsburgh and missed six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a shoulder injury against Oakland in the opener last  
season and remained out until making a start Nov. 8 at Seattle. 
After throwing two first-half interceptions that led to two 
touchdowns, Grbac was replaced by Gannon and remained on the bench 
until he started the final game at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Grbac threw two interceptions in the victory over the Raiders  
that was small consolation for a team that finished 7-9 and was 
among the NFL's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon passed for 1,632 yards with 11 touchdown passes and eight  
interceptions for the Seahawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon played in the Canadian Football League before joining the  
Houston Oilers. He played at Minnesota before going to the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moon has completed 3,972 of 6,786 passes for 49,097  
yards, with 290 touchdown passes and 232 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks third in NFL history in pass attempts, pass completions  
and passing yardage. He is tied for fourth with Johnny Unitas in 
touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon has passed for 3,000 yards in a season nine times, and for  
300 yards in a game 49 times. 
</P>
<P>
	His 527 yards against the Chiefs in Kansas City on Dec. 16,  
1990, was the second most in NFL history behind the 554 yards of 
Norm Van Brocklin in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Facing Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Many Boston Bruins didn't seem overly  
concerned about their 2-1 playoff deficit against the Carolina 
Hurricanes. Then there's goalie Byron Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play with a sense of urgency, like there's no  
tomorrow, because if we lose, there is no tomorrow,'' he said after 
Tuesday's practice. ``It's not a panic situation, but this is about 
as close to being in a corner as we want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, there would be a tomorrow for the Bruins even if they  
lose Game 4 on Wednesday night. The problem is that Game 5 would be 
on the road Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe led the NHL with 10 regular-season shutouts and added  
another in the playoff opener, but wasn't as sharp as the Bruins 
lost Games 2 and 3 by 3-2 scores. Monday night's loss marked the 
first time since the Bruins played Colorado and the New York 
Islanders on Feb. 2 and 4 that Dafoe lost consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be why he's taking Game 4 so personally. Or perhaps it  
is simply because Dafoe knows the team's history, and what could 
happen if the Bruins lose at home Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe everyone is confident, but I feel we have to elevate our  
game where we have got to win no matter what,'' Dafoe said. ``We 
all know what happened last year when we got down 3-1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins trailed the Washington Capitals 3-1 and lost the  
series 4-2. And they went 0-3 at home during the series. The Bruins 
have faced 19 deficits of 3-1 in their history and have lost all 19 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a pattern Dafoe does not want to see repeated. And he  
will have a lot to say about that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dafoe will be tougher in Game 4. He has that ability,''  
Carolina's Keith Primeau said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bruins play with the same intensity they had during the  
final 10 games of the regular season, when they went 7-3, Dafoe 
thinks they will even the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins wing Anson Carter said the team needs to forget about the  
2-1 deficit and just play its game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stay the course,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Pat Burns dismissed suggestions that Boston is  
struggling against the Hurricanes' physical style. Aside from 
Mattias Timander replacing injured defenseman Dave Ellett, the 
coach said he will not make any changes to balance Carolina's 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't go out and try to match what they do,'' Burns said.  
``We need to settle down and play our style of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's Andrei Kovalenko, who was credited with the winning  
goal Monday night when the puck went in off Dafoe's glove early in 
the third period, expects another tight-checking game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key for the series has been whoever plays better defense  
will win the series,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bourque, who has been in 19 playoffs in 20 years with  
Boston, took Monday night's loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things change quickly,'' Bourque said. Carolina ``is in the  
same situation we were in two games ago. They responded and we have 
to do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina has won two games since losing the opener 2-0.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew when we left home we needed to come here and get one.  
It was nice to get the first one,'' said Ray Sheppard, who has 
three of Carolina's six goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping we'd be up 2-1 right now,'' Bourque said, ``but  
it's not a panic situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bruins can't even count on a home-ice advantage. They  
are 1-5 in the playoffs in the FleetCenter since they began playing 
there in the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe there's a home-ice disadvantage.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I like the sound of that,'' Dafoe said. ``If  
we want to win the series, we have to win one game at home. And I'd 
rather do it tomorrow night.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar Details Disguised Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drug traffickers have discovered a new  
chemical process that will allow them to slip cocaine past 
drug-sniffing dogs and the eyes of casual observers, the White 
House's director of drug control policy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding charcoal and other chemicals to cocaine will transform it  
into a black substance that has no smell and does not react when 
subjected to the usual chemical tests for cocaine, retired Gen. 
Barry McCaffrey told a Senate subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turn this stuff into black brick, but you can mold it  
into something that looks like metal moldings,'' McCaffrey said. 
``The dog won't smell it. ... It doesn't smell; it doesn't react to 
chemical tests the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the drug arrives at its destination, high-level drug  
traffickers use acetone or another chemical to turn it back into 
cocaine paste. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you have a very clever new initiative on the part of drug  
smuggling,'' McCaffrey told reporters after testifying before the 
Senate Armed Services Committee's panel on emerging threats and 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffickers, usually from Colombia, also have moved cocaine in  
other colors, including red, yellow and blue, he said. Authorities 
also have seen altered cocaine that looks like transparent sheets 
of acetate. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, law enforcement authorities have begun to  
seize shipments of the altered drug in several countries, including 
Spain, Albania and the Netherlands. U.S. authorities are seeing 
limited amounts in this country, McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug traffickers are relying on other new technologies,  
McCaffrey said. For example, ``super go-fast boats'' -- vessels that 
can easily outpace Coast Guard cutters -- are being manufactured on 
the west coast of Colombia to be used as drug transports in the 
Caribbean and eastern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``One such boat is reportedly capable of carrying a two-ton  
payload at high speeds,'' McCaffrey said. ``It's now become the 
principal tool of drug smuggling now employed by these criminal 
organizations. It's the major tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have come up with ways to stop the boat, but  
McCaffrey told reporters, ``I shouldn't tell you what those things 
are. Some of them will start showing up in the coming weeks, and 
they're going to work.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Auto Exports Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese vehicle exports fell 3.3 percent in the  
last fiscal year for the first decline in three years, as a big 
decline in sales in economically troubled Asia more than offset 
rises in exports to the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall exports of Japanese cars, trucks and buses totaled 4.52  
million in the fiscal year that ended March 31, down from 4.67 
million in the previous year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For March alone, vehicle exports declined 1.9 percent from the  
same month the previous year to 394,719, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese auto exports to the U.S. rose 4.9 percent to nearly  
1.36 million units and climbed 8.9 percent to 1.17 million to the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	But shipments to Asia plummeted 53.3 percent to 248,880 units.  
</P>
<P>
	All of Japan's leading automakers posted declines in overseas  
shipments in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports at Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest car manufacturer,  
fell 5.8 percent to 1,449,165 vehicles. Nissan Motor Co. exports 
fell 0.1 percent to 710,845, while those at Honda Motor Co. dropped 
4 percent to 535,604. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors Corp. exports fell 8.1 percent to 511,349  
units and Mazda Motor Corp. posted a decline of 1.7 percent to 
546,618 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese passenger car shipments in fiscal 1998 dipped 0.4  
percent to 3,705,228 units. Truck exports fell 11.6 percent to 
70,678. Bus exports posted the sharpest fall, declining 31.4 
percent to 3,254 units.

<HEADLINE>  NHL Faces Another Racial Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- When Sandy McCarthy and Tie Domi mocked each  
other with playful gestures and trash talk, it seemed like typical 
tough-guy posturing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy says it was much more than that, accusing Domi of  
uttering a racial slur during the playoff game between Philadelphia 
and Toronto on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dropped an N-bomb on me,'' said McCarthy, a Flyers forward  
whose father is black and mother is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Domi denied the accusation and accused McCarthy of spitting in  
his face. The Maple Leafs defeated the Flyers 2-1, but the episode 
threatened to embroil the league in another racial controversy in 
the middle of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spit in my face, so maybe he was looking for some excuse,''  
Domi said. ``I would never use those kind of words, and he knows 
that. He can say what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL supervisor John D'Amico said he would immediately notify  
commissioner Gary Bettman and Colin Campbell, the league's 
disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll phone them and tell them exactly what has happened, and  
it's up to them on how they want to investigate,'' D'Amico said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell did not return a telephone call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy's father is black and his white mother is a native of  
Newfoundland. After practice today at the Flyers' suburban training 
complex, McCarthy said he had no doubt that Domi used a slur that 
was preceded by a profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt whatsoever,'' McCarthy said. ``You can't mistake that  
word for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke declined to say whether he  
would ask for an investigation, which would be the league's fourth 
in a little more than a year as it attempts to cope with race 
relations in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the league look into it? Yes,'' D'Amico said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before a faceoff in the second period, McCarthy and Domi were  
talking trash to one another. McCarthy switched sides to be next to 
Domi, and they continued jawing. 
</P>
<P>
	Domi mocked McCarthy by shaking his knees and motioning his hand  
as if to encourage McCarthy to keep talking. 
</P>
<P>
	At the next stoppage, Domi skated away from a tussle in the  
corner, and McCarthy motioned to Domi and flapped his arms like a 
chicken. Domi merely rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Domi used the slur before the faceoff; Domi  
insisted McCarthy spit on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just before the faceoff, and I turned to fight him and  
he wouldn't fight me,'' McCarthy said. ``You speak words like that, 
you better be ready to defend yourself. It's the first time it's 
happened to me in my career, and I think the NHL should do 
something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi, a hockey pugilist, said he was under strict orders from  
Toronto coach Pat Quinn not to fight in the playoffs. Pressed on 
whether he said anything that could have been taken as racial, Domi 
said, ``Absolutely not. And he knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their whole bench saw him spit in my face,'' Domi said. ``I  
showed the linesman, and I left it on my face and I showed the ref, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials, including referee Paul Stewart, told McCarthy and  
D'Amico that he didn't hear what the players said or see anyone 
spit. Stewart declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was there some, say, saliva around his chest or face area?''  
D'Amico asked. ``Yes, there was. So now the thing is, we have the 
tape. We'll look at the tape and see if we can see some kind of 
conversation between the two in the second period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has investigated several accusations of racial slurs in  
recent years. McCarthy was involved in one of them. While with 
Tampa Bay, he and Darcy Tucker were cleared of accusations they 
made racial gestures at Florida Panthers forward Peter Worrell, who 
is black, during a preseason game in October. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, former Flyer Chris Gratton was accused of calling  
Worrell an ``ape.'' Gratton denied it, and the Panthers did not ask 
the league to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Simon and Craig Berube, then teammates with Washington,  
were found guilty of using slurs in separate cases in Nov. 1997. 
Both were suspended. Shortly thereafter, the league announced a 
``zero-tolerance'' policy on the matter. Berube now plays for the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy and Domi were both born in Ontario. The two clearly  
dislike each other, and have fought before. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 0-for-5 against me, and he knows that,'' Domi said. ``I  
don't have to prove anything to him and I don't have to prove 
anything to my teammates. That's all that matters.''

<HEADLINE>  Elway Announcement Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On Sunday, John Elway's football career will  
officially end, brought down by the sort of physical ailments that 
dog many 38-year-olds, let alone one who has been pounded for 16 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen confirmed Monday that Elway was  
leaving football because he ``felt in his own mind that he had some 
physical problems he didn't think he could overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamstring, back and rib injuries caused the usually durable  
Elway to miss all or part of six games last season. Of more 
concern, however, was a troublesome left knee. Elway played with a 
brace on that knee throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Limping around a golf course in California last weekend, he  
admitted he eventually will require an artificial knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said a news conference to announce the retirement,  
already delayed several times, will be held Sunday at a time and 
location to be determined later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be very sensitive to the families involved in the  
Columbine (school shooting) situation,'' Bowlen said. ``We wanted 
to make sure we did not in any way interrupt the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Sunday probably is the time when we could put  
this tragedy behind us, and perhaps John's press conference could 
be received as sort of a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's Denver Post, Elway left no doubt about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he told the newspaper. ``I  
seriously considered coming back, but I just couldn't make it 
because of my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen was in Australia nearly two weeks ago, promoting his  
team's Aug. 6 preseason game there, when he received a telephone 
message from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got the message, I knew what it was about,''  
Bowlen said. ``I called him back and basically it was a short 
conversation. He said, `Pat, I've decided to retire and go on with 
the rest of my life.' I told him I respected his decision and was 
really happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I couldn't get back until the following week, we  
originally decided to announce it on Wednesday (April 21). With 
what happened at Columbine (April 20), that was very much not 
appropriate. And it was just a matter of time before the press 
figured out what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, who said he will retire Elway's No. 7, insisted he would  
not lower his expectations for the two-time Super Bowl champions 
this season, despite the loss of the Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``John will be missed, for sure,'' Bowlen said. ``But our  
expectations are going to be the same. I think we've got a very 
solid football team. Bubby Brister is going to play well, and, of 
course, we have Terrell Davis and many other very good players on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had John come back for another  
year. I'd love to see him three-peat, do something that no other 
quarterback has done in history. But that wasn't to be. So we'll go 
forward. We'll be fine. I think we'll be a good football team, if 
not a great football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership void left by Elway's exit might be harder to  
overcome, Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves to talk about the comebacks and all the rest  
of those things, but there is much, much more to John's 
participation on this team than that,'' he said. ``His physical 
accomplishments are unparalleled, but my biggest concern right now 
is the man that John was -- the guy he was in the locker room and 
the stability he brought. Losing that is going to be difficult for 
us, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Bill Romanowski said he saw the retirement coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when he came back, he said that definitely was going  
to be his last year,'' Romanowski said. ``You have to believe what 
he said. In my mind, it's always been official. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl last year, John's  
intensity was unbelievable. I've never seen him like that. He 
wanted that game so badly. You just knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several other teammates, even when confronted with the  
evidence of Elway's decision, were in a state of denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to hear it come out of his mouth before I believe  
it,'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said. ``I just can't imagine 
football, much less the Broncos, without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, ``Until I hear it from him, he's still on the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, Elway's heir apparent, was reluctant to discuss his new  
status until the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, he does retire, I'm going to miss him,'' Brister  
said. ``Nobody will ever be John Elway. If he does retire, I hope 
we can keep the machine rolling.''

<HEADLINE>  Elway Announcement Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On Sunday, John Elway's football career will  
officially end, brought down by the sort of physical ailments that 
dog many 38-year-olds, let alone one who has been pounded for 16 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen confirmed Monday that Elway was  
leaving football because he ``felt in his own mind that he had some 
physical problems he didn't think he could overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamstring, back and rib injuries caused the usually durable  
Elway to miss all or part of six games last season. Of more 
concern, however, was a troublesome left knee. Elway played with a 
brace on that knee throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Limping around a golf course in California last weekend, he  
admitted he eventually will require an artificial knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said a news conference to announce the retirement,  
already delayed several times, will be held Sunday at a time and 
location to be determined later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be very sensitive to the families involved in the  
Columbine (school shooting) situation,'' Bowlen said. ``We wanted 
to make sure we did not in any way interrupt the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Sunday probably is the time when we could put  
this tragedy behind us, and perhaps John's press conference could 
be received as sort of a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's Denver Post, Elway left no doubt about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he told the newspaper. ``I  
seriously considered coming back, but I just couldn't make it 
because of my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen was in Australia nearly two weeks ago, promoting his  
team's Aug. 6 preseason game there, when he received a telephone 
message from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got the message, I knew what it was about,''  
Bowlen said. ``I called him back and basically it was a short 
conversation. He said, `Pat, I've decided to retire and go on with 
the rest of my life.' I told him I respected his decision and was 
really happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I couldn't get back until the following week, we  
originally decided to announce it on Wednesday (April 21). With 
what happened at Columbine (April 20), that was very much not 
appropriate. And it was just a matter of time before the press 
figured out what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, who said he will retire Elway's No. 7, insisted he would  
not lower his expectations for the two-time Super Bowl champions 
this season, despite the loss of the Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``John will be missed, for sure,'' Bowlen said. ``But our  
expectations are going to be the same. I think we've got a very 
solid football team. Bubby Brister is going to play well, and, of 
course, we have Terrell Davis and many other very good players on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had John come back for another  
year. I'd love to see him three-peat, do something that no other 
quarterback has done in history. But that wasn't to be. So we'll go 
forward. We'll be fine. I think we'll be a good football team, if 
not a great football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership void left by Elway's exit might be harder to  
overcome, Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves to talk about the comebacks and all the rest  
of those things, but there is much, much more to John's 
participation on this team than that,'' he said. ``His physical 
accomplishments are unparalleled, but my biggest concern right now 
is the man that John was -- the guy he was in the locker room and 
the stability he brought. Losing that is going to be difficult for 
us, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Bill Romanowski said he saw the retirement coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when he came back, he said that definitely was going  
to be his last year,'' Romanowski said. ``You have to believe what 
he said. In my mind, it's always been official. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl last year, John's  
intensity was unbelievable. I've never seen him like that. He 
wanted that game so badly. You just knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several other teammates, even when confronted with the  
evidence of Elway's decision, were in a state of denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to hear it come out of his mouth before I believe  
it,'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said. ``I just can't imagine 
football, much less the Broncos, without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, ``Until I hear it from him, he's still on the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, Elway's heir apparent, was reluctant to discuss his new  
status until the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, he does retire, I'm going to miss him,'' Brister  
said. ``Nobody will ever be John Elway. If he does retire, I hope 
we can keep the machine rolling.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Homes Have Lots of Brains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Ever get up in the morning and wonder, ``What's my  
blood sugar?'' Or find yourself in the dairy aisle, not sure if 
you're out of milk? 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, homeowners will soon be able to answer those questions  
with a mere push of a button. Electronics companies are hard at 
work on wiring new homes with fiber optic cables that connect rooms 
to each other and to the vast world outside: the Internet, cable 
TV, hospitals and travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The houses burst with little high-tech perks. Lights go on by  
themselves when someone enters the room. The toilet weighs you, 
monitors body fat and measures your urine sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology marks a dramatic turnaround for the Japanese  
home, where until the 1960s a bathtub was considered an extra. Even 
today, homes are flimsy and cramped by international standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech homes -- estimated to cost about 5 percent more  
than a regular new home -- are still small, but they're smart. And 
while full-scale versions aren't yet available, certain features 
have already begun showing up in Japanese homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Matsushita Electrical Industry Group is working on an HII --  
Home Information Infrastructure -- model that it's aiming to market 
beginning in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an entirely new home environment,'' gushed Yuko  
Matsumoto, a guide who gave reporters a tour of the model, dubbed 
``Warp House HII.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system revolves around an ``HII Station,'' a sort of central  
nervous system that serves as a depository for reams of 
information. Through screens in every room, occupants can monitor 
the activities and use of appliances throughout the house, check 
security cameras and contact cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The bedroom, for example, has a medical consultation kit that  
allows the electronic equivalent of an old-fashioned house call. A 
user can type in his complaint, some basic physical information and 
call the doctor, who makes a diagnosis based on that info and 
medical history that's available from the household system. 
</P>
<P>
	A key feature of the system is a wireless terminal -- about the  
size of a cellular phone -- which permits remote access to the 
house. A user can program the device to keep track of household 
information like what's in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
	Convenient, yes. But a look into the smart house also reveals a  
future world of no secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras and sensors monitor who is where, doing what. Detailed  
information like blood pressure, weight and schedules of family 
members are available to other family members in the main memory 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	And teens can forget about that wild party when the parents are  
away: The security system makes digital photos of all visitors and 
monitors their movement through the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech wizardry is a jarring contrast with other aspects  
of the Japanese home, where walls are paper-thin and floors 
advertised as ``wood'' are actually more like paneling. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology also surpasses similar developments in the United  
States. Microsoft mogul Bill Gates' $53 million Seattle mansion 
features a computer system that changes music, temperature, 
lighting and even digital artwork to match visitor preferences as 
people move from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
	For ordinary Americans, though, the nearest equivalent may be a  
``home management system,'' designed by IBM, which allows people to 
operate all their electronics using a universal remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, dozens of high-tech companies have formed a consortium  
to standardize the technology. Tsutomu Asabe, a main player in the 
project for the Matsushita Group, said consumer interest and the 
explosion of communications have prompted the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Society and technology are changing rapidly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fats Domino Reunites With Musician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Fats Domino and his former partner, trumpeter  
Dave Bartholomew, were together again for a show at the New Orleans 
Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Domino, 71, and Bartholomew, 78, drifted apart about 12 years  
ago to pursue separate careers but did a joint newspaper interview 
recently and decided to reunite. 
</P>
<P>
	Domino played many of his standards Sunday, including  
``Blueberry Hill'' and ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll.'' He closed the set 
with ``When the Saints Go Marching In.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the song played out, he bumped the grand piano across the  
stage with his thighs, just like the old days. When someone tried 
to take away his microphone, Domino mouthed, ``We're not done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domino played a little longer, then headed to his trailer as  
Bartholmew urged the crowd to call him back.

<HEADLINE> Side Effects Limiting Chemotherapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New research suggests up to one-fifth of  
breast cancer patients may not be getting optimal doses of 
chemotherapy needed for the best chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: side effects. Doctors prescribe the right amount of  
chemotherapy, but may lower the dose mid-treatment or postpone 
chemotherapy sessions when women suffer serious side effects, a 
practice that could have a larger impact than realized, says a 
study of the medical records of 15,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a newer combination of chemotherapy drugs could  
give patients a better chance of tolerating the full dose, said Dr. 
Garrett A. Smith of the University of California, San Francisco, 
whose patients were among those the study analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study should change practice patterns,'' he said.  
``Physicians all over the country who use the older (chemotherapy) 
regimen had a terrible time staying on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Project ChemoInsight was performed by Amgen Inc., which makes a  
treatment for a chemotherapy side effect called neutropenia -- a 
loss of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to 
serious infection. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is ``adjuvant chemotherapy'' given after breast tumors  
are surgically removed. Previous studies have found that the women 
who fare best receive at least 85 percent of the chemotherapy 
``dose intensity'' -- proper dose received during a certain amount 
of time. But side effects can prevent that. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen nurses gathered medical records from hundreds of  
oncologists to see how often that happens. About 20 percent of 
patients got less than optimal dose intensity, according to data to 
be presented at an Oncology Nursing Society meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Neutropenia was the main culprit.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are visiting doctors whose records were analyzed to  
discuss how their patients fared. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said his patients did well, and credits a newer  
chemotherapy combination known as AC, for 
adriamycin-cyclophosphamide. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors believe AC is harder to tolerate than an older  
combination called CMF, but Smith said Project ChemoInsight found 
CMF patients were more likely to be undertreated because of side 
effects. He will present details at an oncology meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claudine Isaacs of Georgetown University in Washington  
called the project important for illustrating what really happens 
to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There certainly is a perception out there that AC is more  
toxic,'' said Isaacs. The study suggests ``in fact it's easier to 
give ... on time and at the dose intended, and that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She already tells patients that AC causes more nausea, but new  
anti-nausea drugs largely control that. AC also causes more hair 
loss than CMF and has about a 1 percent risk of heart toxicity, but 
lasts just three months. CMF takes six months, causes mouth sores 
and diarrhea and may increase risk of premature menopause.

<HEADLINE> FDA Makes New Mammogram Provisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting Wednesday, mammography clinics will  
have to notify women in writing about the results of the breast 
cancer test. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulation by the Food and Drug Administration is in  
response to reports that some women may not have learned soon 
enough that they had suspicious mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mammogram clinics will continue to report results of the X-ray  
tests to a woman's doctor, who is responsible for ordering 
additional tests or treatments. Many clinics already voluntarily 
sent a copy to women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new regulation requires clinics to mail women a  
separate, easy-to-understand report of their test results within 30 
days -- sooner if the breast X-ray suggests cancer is present. That 
way the woman knows the results even if her doctor has not yet 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule is part of the reauthorized Mammography Quality  
Standards Act, which already required the nation's 10,000 
mammography clinics to be certified for quality. Women can check a 
clinic's certification by calling 1-800-4-CANCER or check 
www.fda.gov/cdrh/faclist.html on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Ken Starr Wants To Question Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Weighing whether to retry Susan  
McDougal on two contempt charges, Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr's office wants to talk to jurors who acquitted her of 
obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal court filing Monday, Whitewater prosecutors argued  
that they should be allowed to contact jurors and ask for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Post-trial contacts with the trial jurors may help save the  
United States, the court and the defendant from undergoing another 
judicial proceeding,'' prosecutor Julie Myers said in a court 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, who at first said he would  
welcome such interviews by the prosecution team, later changed his 
mind and filed an objection to the request. He argued that federal 
rules do not allow an inquiry into the ``mental processes or the 
juror deliberation'' and said such interviews would amount to 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Mrs. McDougal on April 12 of the obstruction  
charge but deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt 
charges. The judge declared a mistrial on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are trying to determine whether to go to trial on  
the outstanding charges, which stem from Mrs. McDougal's refusal to 
answer grand jury questions about President Clinton and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal says she refused to cooperate with Starr's office  
because he wanted her to lie against the Clintons, her former 
business partners in the failed Whitewater land development in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the filing, Starr's office cited interviews it conducted  
after a previous trial in which jurors acquitted two Perryville 
bankers on four charges and deadlocked on seven others. Interviews 
with those jurors helped persuade prosecutors not to retry the two 
men, Ms. Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In media interviews after the McDougal verdict, the jury  
foreman, Donald Thomas, had criticized Starr's staff members. 
Thomas, who had voted to acquit on all counts, said prosecutors 
handling the trial showed ``a certain amount of arrogance'' and one 
who was called as a witness against Mrs. McDougal gave ``evasive'' 
answers.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- A bodyguard for Fidel  
Castro who defected at the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo has been 
flown to the United States, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodyguard was flown to Miami on Friday and then on to an  
unknown destination, said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department sources have identified the defector as  
Capt. Lazaro de Betancourt, second-in-command in the security team 
that guards the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodyguard appeared without warning at the U.S. Embassy on  
April 17, during a meeting of Latin American and Caribbean leaders. 
He is the first known member of Castro's security team to defect in 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection came a year after Cuba and the Dominican Republic  
restored diplomatic ties. In August, Castro made his first visit to 
the neighboring country since coming to power in 1959.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The former leader of the police intelligence  
unit that captured legendary rebel chieftain Abimael Guzman has 
formed a political party to compete in Peru's elections next year, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketin Vidal, now retired as a police general, will lead the  
newly formed United Nation Movement, party spokesman Carlos Tapia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The party has not announced its presidential candidate, but it  
is expected to be Vidal, who is seen by many Peruvians as a 
national hero for his role in capturing Guzman and other rebel 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidal directed the police operation that led to the 1992 capture  
of Guzman, who founded the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Maoist Shining Path rebels raided a village in  
Peru's northern Andes mountains, executed two peasant farmers and 
hung signs saying ``death to informers'' on their bodies, police 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were dragged from their homes Sunday and shot in the  
town square in the remote village of Taurija, police said. The 
village is 240 miles north of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels fled the town and have not been captured.  
</P>
<P>
	Peru's war against Shining Path and pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru  
Revolutionary Movement rebels has left 30,000 dead since 1980, but 
political violence has fallen sharply since the capture of top 
rebel leaders in the early 1990s.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A clash between police and squatters  
resisting a court-ordered eviction left two people dead in 
southeastern Brazil, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation occurred Monday in a wooded area near the city  
of Betim, 300 miles northeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who fired the shots that killed two squatters and  
wounded two more, said Jane Soares, spokeswoman for Betim's City 
Hall. She said police used rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	A large group of homeless had occupied the area set aside for a  
low-income housing project, Soares said. They had refused to 
negotiate and turned down an offer of 70 lots elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	After the clash, a judge rescinded the eviction notice and gave  
the squatters and city hall seven days to come up with a solution, 
she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Allies Debate Economic Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's major economies fell to bickering  
Tuesday, a day after pledging greater unity in dealing with the 
global currency crisis. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin bluntly 
told Japanese and European finance ministers they must work harder 
to spur their lagging economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the spring meeting of the 182-nation International  
Monetary Fund, Rubin noted that America's trade deficit has soared 
to record levels as a result of nearly two years of global turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this rising deficit, which has resulted in the loss of  
more than 300,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, had occurred while 
Japan's trade surplus was increasing and Europe's trade balance was 
remaining essentially unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has borne the bulk of the burden of the  
global current-account adjustment in response to the Asian 
crisis,'' Rubin said. ``This situation cannot continue 
indefinitely. Japan and Europe must boost domestic demand-led 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's unusually frank message reflected U.S. frustration at  
the failure to win greater commitments by Japan and Europe to spur 
their domestic economies to take pressure off America's huge trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	To underscore the need to do more, IMF Managing Director Michel  
Camdessus warned that despite recent signs of recovery in countries 
hardest hit by the currency crisis, the overall global economy 
remained fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	``The balance of risks remains on the downside,'' Camdessus  
said. ``Continuing financial sector fragilities in several emerging 
market economies add to the risks of further market turbulence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's policy-setting interim committee was expected to  
endorse granting greater debt relief for the world's poorest 
countries and to call for renewed work on overhauling the global 
financial system to prevent or at least better cope with future 
Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	However, actual adoption of any new changes was not expected  
until President Clinton and other leaders of the world's seven 
largest economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada -- hold their annual summit in June in 
Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank presidents  
pledged after talks Monday to strive for greater cooperation to 
promote global growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But their comments Tuesday underscored that there was no  
agreement on just what that vague promise meant. Both Japanese and 
European officials rejected U.S. suggestions that they need to do 
more to promote growth. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that the new European Central Bank, which handles  
monetary affairs for the 11 countries switching to the new common 
euro currency, recently cut interest rates by a half percentage 
point and Japan has reduced its rates to virtually zero while also 
implementing a massive government spending program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has been forcefully implementing'' the stimulus package,  
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel expressed worries about the  
U.S. economy and the impact on the high-flying American stock 
market and dollar if growth slows too abruptly later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interests of the United States and the world economy,  
it will be important to avoid an excessively sharp adjustment with 
setbacks in the financial and foreign exchange markets,'' Eichel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the  
world owed a debt of gratitude to the U.S. economy, which has 
outperformed expectations for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. capacity to combine growth and price stability is not  
merely an object for admiration, but is a contributor to 
international economic stability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank were being held in  
a far less frenzied atmosphere than last October's sessions. At 
that time, Russia's default on billions of dollars of foreign debt 
had sent shockwaves through global markets, raising real concerns 
of a possible worldwide recession. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board stepped in with a series  
of interest rate cuts, and financial markets in both industrial 
countries and many of the crisis countries have rebounded in recent 
months.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Disaster-Help Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed bills Tuesday  
creating a disaster-protection program for small businesses and 
naming the Raleigh, N.C., federal building for the late Gov. Terry 
Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disaster Mitigation Bill authorizes the Small Business  
Administration to allocate up to $15 million in existing disaster 
funds to establish a pilot program offering low-interest, long-term 
loans to small businesses that want to buttress their facilities 
against natural disasters. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., the 
legislation's sponsor, witnessed Clinton's signature in the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford's widow, Margaret Sanford, and his children and  
grandchildren joined Clinton and a half-dozen North Carolina 
lawmakers for the Oval Office ceremony enacting legislation for the 
new Sanford Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford, also a former U.S. senator, twice ran unsuccessfully  
for the Democratic presidential nomination. He died from cancer 
last year. He was represented at the White House Tuesday by his 
widow and their two children and two grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Klebold's Girlfriend Bought Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators said Tuesday that Dylan  
Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend bought at least two of the guns 
used in the bloodbath at Columbine High School, and they want to 
know if she knew what he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine senior Robyn K. Anderson was interviewed by  
investigators, released without charges being filed and has 
retained a lawyer, said Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson 
County sheriff's office. The weapons were purchased at a Denver 
area gun show last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not called Miss Anderson a suspect but  
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone told the Denver Rocky Mountain 
News it was conceivable she knew what Klebold and classmate Eric 
Harris had intended to do with the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not going to use those for pheasant hunting,'' he told  
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he didn't know where Miss Anderson was on April 20,  
the day Klebold and Harris killed 12 students, a teacher and 
themselves. The boys carried four guns. Investigators traced a 
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 pistol and a rifle to Miss Anderson, whom 
authorities described as a witness, not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know, she's still cooperative,'' said Sgt. Jim  
Parr, of the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old person can buy a rifle according to federal law,  
but cannot legally buy a pistol from a federally licensed gun 
dealer. However, in Colorado, an 18-year-old person can buy a 
handgun in a private sale, such as from a seller at a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold was 17 and Harris turned 18 earlier this month. Miss  
Anderson was 18 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Miss Anderson bought the guns legally, she still could  
face serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a rainbow of charges there,'' Davis said, ranging from  
supplying a weapon to a juvenile to 13 separate homicides, 
depending on whether she or anyone else knew why they were buying 
the guns or how they would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the school's National Honors Society, Miss Anderson  
attended the senior prom with Klebold just days before the attack. 
There was no answer at the door of her home on Tuesday and her 
attorney has not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they didn't know her well, but had complained to  
her about driving too fast down the street with her friends in 
their quiet street. She lives in a two-story red brick home at the 
end of a cul-de-sac in the shadow of a church. 
</P>
<P>
	But two former Columbine students who knew her said they doubted  
she was aware of the plan to commit mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that she had any idea,'' said Andrea Meglen, 20.  
``If she had any idea that they were going to do this mass 
destruction, she wouldn't have anything to do with it. She isn't 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure of the gun purchase came as a co-owner of the  
Dragon Arms gun shop in Colorado Springs, 60 miles away, said that 
a girl resembling Miss Anderson was the one of five teens who tried 
to purchase weapons in his store in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The four boys in the group wore trench coats similar to those  
worn by the gunmen in the shooting and were underage, but the girl 
was 18, said co-owner Mel Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said the youths were interested in buying an M-60  
machine gun and a silencer-equipped MP-5 automatic rifle, but he 
said no. He quickly identified Miss Anderson from local newspaper 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked right in her face because she jumped up and said  
'I'll buy them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said  
a videotape from the store does not show the youths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agents reviewed the videotapes and they did not find any  
evidence of the suspects or their associates in there,'' said ATF 
agent Larry Bettendorf. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parr said the fact the teens do not appear to be on the tape  
doesn't mean they weren't in the store at some other time.

<HEADLINE> DuPont's Earnings Dip Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co., recovering from the effects  
of overseas economic problems, reported a slight decline in income 
and earnings from continuing operations during the first quarter. 
Its results beat Wall Street projections. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont said Tuesday that income from continuing operations --  
taking into account the planned divestiture of Conoco, DuPont's oil 
and gas subsidiary -- was $628 million, or 66 cents a share, 
compared with $637 million, or 68 cents a share, in the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
60 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose to $6.3 billion from $6.19 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	When one-time items are factored in, including 1998 income from  
Conoco and the purchase of the automotive coatings business of 
Hoechst AG, DuPoint reported net income of $663 million, or 58 
cents a share, compared with $906 million, or 79 cents a share, in 
the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time items also included a $118 million charge to cover  
the costs of employee layoffs in the nylon business and the 
shutdown of manufacturing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The divestiture of Conoco, which is being spun off as a separate  
company, and the plant closings are part of an ongoing 
restructuring at DuPont, which is focusing on higher-profit 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many manufacturers, DuPont has been hurt by the economic  
crisis in Asia, Latin America and Russia, which depressed demand 
for chemicals and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon our first quarter results, we believe that 1999  
could be slightly stronger than expected, reinforcing our 
confidence that DuPont will return to our stated objective of 
double-digit earnings growth next year,'' chairman and chief 
executive Charles O. Holliday Jr. said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont reported gains in most of its divisions, but said its  
polyester business suffered a $6 million loss compared to earnings 
of $4 million a year earlier. The company said overcapacity and 
price pressure hurt its polyester results. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of DuPont rose $2.37 1/2 to $69.12 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Set To Accept US Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Yasser Arafat convened the PLO  
leadership today to win broad backing for an American proposal to 
continue peace talks with Israel and postpone a declaration of 
Palestinian independence for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat described the U.S. plan, presented in a letter from  
President Clinton, as ``more than positive.'' Arafat had earlier 
pledged to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision on a statehood declaration is up to the  
124-member Palestinian Central Council, a senior PLO body stacked 
with Arafat loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The council began its debate today at Arafat's seaside office in  
Gaza City, but was not expected to reach a decision for several 
days or even until after Israel's May 17 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat apparently is concerned that any Palestinian decision  
before the election would give campaign fodder to Israel's 
hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is trying to 
portray himself as the only candidate able to stand up to 
Palestinian demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on Israel radio today, Netanyahu insisted that as long  
as he was prime minister he would not permit the creation of a 
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu said he sent Arafat ``a very sharply worded message''  
two days ago that the Palestinians must not declare statehood 
unilaterally. ``I think that message was heard,'' Netanyahu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank in  
retaliation for a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Palestinian Central Council said they were not  
impressed by Israel's threats. ``It is the Palestinians who will 
decide,'' Suleiman Najjab, a member of the council, said as he 
headed into Arafat's office today. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of two opposition groups attended the debate --  
the Islamic militant group Hamas and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, a small radical PLO faction. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin demanded that Arafat  
walk away from the peace agreements with Israel. Hamas 
representatives set a precedent by attending the session, although 
only as observers. The group until now has boycotted PLO meetings 
because of ideological differences and disagreements over 
representation in the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the council meeting, Clinton sent a letter of  
guarantees to Arafat, delivered by the U.S. consul general in 
Jerusalem, John Herbst. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Clinton set May 2000 as a new target date for  
completing the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and 
affirmed the Palestinians' right ``to determine their own future on 
their own land,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials indicated that the letter stopped short of  
backing statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the one-year extension  
was not a deadline but a realistic target goal for the completion 
of final status talks.

<HEADLINE> Klebold Friend May Have Bought Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The 18-year-old girlfriend of Columbine  
High School gunman Dylan Klebold apparently bought at least two of 
the weapons used in the attack at a Denver-area gun show, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also were checking a report from a Colorado  
Springs gun dealer that the other gunman, Eric Harris, was among 
five teens who tried to buy a machine gun and another weapon last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post reported  
today that investigators believe the girlfriend, Robyn K. Anderson, 
bought three weapons not long after her 18th birthday in November. 
The Denver Rocky Mountain News said she was believed to have bought 
two guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, committed suicide after bursting  
into Columbine High School with guns and bombs a week ago today, 
killing 12 fellow students and one teacher. Four guns were found in 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson was questioned Monday and authorities describe her  
as a witness, not a suspect. District Attorney Dave Thomas said she 
was cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the weapons may have been purchased legally.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think three of them were provided by the girlfriend of  
Klebold,'' Mark Paulter, a Jefferson County chief district 
attorney, told the Post. ``She bought them because she was older. 
She was 18 at the time. She bought them in November or December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure she committed a crime under Colorado statute.  
If you provide a handgun to a person under 18, that's a violation 
of the statute. If you provide a shotgun or a rifle, that's not a 
violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operator of the Tanner Gun Show, which holds shows in the  
Denver area several times a year, said the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms asked on Monday for a list of all of the 
show's exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors think Ms. Anderson bought two shotguns and a rifle.  
District Attorney Dave Thomas said prosecutors are not sure what 
knowledge she had about how the guns would be used. But Jefferson 
County Sheriff John Stone acknowledged it was possible that she did 
know how Klebold and Harris to planned to use the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not going to use those for pheasant hunting,'' Stone  
told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who was at Ms. Anderson home declined to comment, saying  
the family was terrorized by reporters, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mel Bernstein, owner of Dragon Arms, told  
investigators that four teen-age boys dressed in trench coats -- 
including Harris -- and a young woman came to his store in early 
March. They tried to buy an M-60 machine gun and a pistol equipped 
with a silencer. He said he declined to sell the guns to Harris 
because he was too young. When the young woman in the group tried 
to buy the guns, saying she was 18, he escorted them from the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said the incident was captured on a surveillance  
videotape that he turned over to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real mopey, like punk kids with the makeup on, like  
punk rockers,'' Bernstein said. ``To me, it was just another bunch 
of kids who wished they could own everything they see on the wall 
here. This is like Toys R Us to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said Harris ``was doing all the talking.''  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still believe that someone other than Klebold and  
Harris was aware of their plans in the days and weeks leading up to 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of munitions there,'' Stone said. ``Either  
somebody else brought it in or they brought it in and stored it. 
... It's hard to get that in under your raincoat and not be 
noticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said three boys who were arrested near Columbine on the  
day of the attack have not been cleared in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm suspicious of their story,'' Stone said. ``They are not  
out of the woods in this one yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, authorities said Klebold and Harris had aimed for  
an even bigger bloodbath, plotting to kill hundreds of students, 
and then to hijack a plane and crash it into New York City. 
Investigators cited a diary they found that was kept by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack's bold, bizarre nature led to speculation that the  
gunmen might have been taking drugs, but toxicology tests revealed 
no drugs or alcohol in their bodies, the county coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it a little more frightening to me that they were of  
sound mind and not under the influence of alcohol and drugs,'' 
Thomas told MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's campus remained closed to everyone except bomb  
squads and investigators. Columbine teachers were due to report for 
duty today at nearby Chatfield High School, where armed sheriff's 
deputies and parents have been assigned to guard the doors. 
Columbine's students will begin classes at Chatfield on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers haven't been allowed to pick up their books and other  
belongings since the bloodshed at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they need anything and we can find it, we'll get it for  
them,'' sheriff's Sgt. Jim Parr said Monday. ``But I think they're 
going to be operating on a shoestring for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chatfield Principal Sally Blanchard said her staff would try to  
make Columbine teachers feel welcome on campus as they prepare 
their lessons in hopes of finishing out the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want them to feel honored. We want them to feel safe,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals were held Monday for three students and Dave Sanders,  
the only teacher killed in the rampage. The emotionally exhausted 
community faced two more funerals today and planned a moment of 
silence at 11:21 a.m., the time the attack began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners, including students by the hundreds, turned out Monday  
to remember Lauren Townsend, an 18-year-old honor student and 
captain of the girls' volleyball team; Daniel Rohrbough, the 
15-year-old boy shot while holding an exit door open for fleeing 
students; and Cassie Bernall, the 17-year-old girl who professed 
her love of God just before she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' Pastor George Kirsten told  
mourners. ``She went to the martyrs' hall of fame.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert entered both his star  
fillies, Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting, in Friday's 
Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was made the 3-5 early-morning favorite on  
Tuesday, while Excellent Meeting was the 2-1 second choice as an 
eight-horse field was set for the 125th Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, though, left open the possibility that Excellent  
Meeting, owned by John Mabee, could run in Saturday's Kentucky 
Derby. Entries for the Derby will be taken Wednesday, and the 
decision to run Excellent Meeting against the boys could hinge on 
the post position draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the luck of the draw, and that could make me think about  
it,'' said Baffert, who already has two of the Derby's top 
contenders in General Challenge and Prime Timber. ``If I put her in 
there (the Derby), it would be for Mr. Mabee. But I got to take 
care of the fillies. They have been good to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mabee also owns General Challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to assess Excellent Meeting's chances against the boys in  
the 1 1/4-mile Derby, Baffert said: ``I don't know how they all fit 
in, but she would be tough. You know, if Three Ring won the Derby, 
I would say `What did I do?' But we'll just have to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, a filly trained by Edward Plesa, will run in the  
Derby, 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday has won nine of 10 career starts -- she's 3-for-3  
this year -- and is coming off a seven-length win in the Ashland 
Stakes at Keeneland on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting has won her last four races, including the  
Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Park on April 2. A strong workout on 
Sunday makes Baffert's decision even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered in the $500,000-added Oaks: Gold From The West,  
Marley Vale, The Happy Hopper, Sweepin Story, Dreams Gallore and 
Positive Gal. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAFFERT'S BOYS:* Trainer Bob Baffert's expected Derby favorites  
General Challenge and Prime Timber had their final major workouts 
before Saturday' race. 
</P>
<P>
	And Baffert was happy to get them over with.  
</P>
<P>
	``General Challenge was just cruising, he went around there so  
easy,'' said Baffert, trying for an unprecedented third straight 
Derby win. ``Prime Timber, he's different than General Challenge. 
We started him a little slower today but he finished up strong. 
They're ready. I'm just going to lead them over there Saturday and 
all we need is a little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge worked five furlongs in a strong 1:00 over a  
sloppy Churchill Downs surface, while Prime Timber went the same 
distance in 1:00 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried about the weather and the track, but it turned  
out fine,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ADONIS FLEXES MUSCLES:* Adonis, one of trainer Nick Zito's two  
Derby contenders, finally got his final major Derby workout on 
Tuesday, 
</P>
<P>
	The Wood Memorial winner went five furlongs in 1:02 2-5 with  
Jamie Sanders aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that's over,'' the always jittery Zito said. ``It's  
always scary working on an off track, but Jamie did a tremendous 
job, just right. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw General Challenge was getting over it, I felt  
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even, winner of the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes,  
galloped 1 1/2 miles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHEIKH-ING OUT:* Godolphin Racing's Worldly Manner and Aljabr  
galloped 1 1/2 miles over the sloppy Churchill Downs track on Tuesday, 
and an interested party stopped by to see one of the colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Kent Desormeaux gets the call aboard Aljabr if the filly  
Excellent Meeting runs in Saturday's Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's my first call and if she goes in the Derby, I'd ride  
her,'' Desormeaux said. ``I appreciate Godolphin for having such 
patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Excellent Meeting be entered in the Derby and then  
scratched, Desormeaux would be left without a Derby mount a year 
after winning the race aboard Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it doesn't come to that,'' Desormeaux said. ``It's show  
time and we work all year to get to this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUTTA THERE:* Certain became the latest 3-year-old to be  
withdrawn from Kentucky Derby consideration. On Sunday, Forty One 
Carats was a dropout with a lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Azpurua, Certain's trainer, said, ``I've been playing  
catch-up with this horse and it's not right -- not for the horse and 
not right coming up to a race of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain came down with a fever a few days after finishing second  
in the Arkansas Derby, and missed several days of training. He is 
now being pointed to the Illinois Derby on May 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal commission is considering  
recommending a suspension in the spread of casinos, slot machines 
and lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft report being discussed by the National Gambling Impact  
Study Commission says states should consider ``an explicit 
moratorium on further expansion'' until more is known about the 
effects of legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``time to pause,'' argued commission member Richard Leone,  
who proposed the moratorium. ``We all have come to realize that 
more thinking is required, more information, more understanding of 
what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting Tuesday to work on a report due in June, the nine-person  
commission split on the word ``moratorium,'' with some members 
arguing it is vague and too drastic. The commission will take up 
the dispute Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether labeled a moratorium or a pause, the idea addresses a  
common concern among commissioners that states are blindly 
``chasing'' one another in a competition for gambling dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in Tuesday's meeting, the commissioners debated  
which term to use to describe the relationship between governors 
and gambling revenue -- ``dependence,'' ``craving'' or 
``addiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of work, the commission has just one more  
two-day session planned, in May, to wrap up its work. It has a June 
18 deadline to submit a report to Congress, the president, state 
governments and tribal governments on the economic and social 
effects of legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's staff drafted a 247-page report. But Leone, a  
former New Jersey state treasurer, drafted an alternative opening 
chapter using what he called ``much stronger'' language. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Leone's proposals: label pathological gambling ``a  
pressing social issue'' and recommend that states consider a 
moratorium. Gambling has ``gone very far very fast,'' he wrote, 
``and it is time, at the minimum, for a pause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leone has been a critic of state-sponsored gambling since the  
1970s, when he opposed the ultimately successful movement to 
legalize casino gambling in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las Vegas,  
said the commission's discussion reminded her ``why I had 
reservations about a national gambling commission from the start. 
These are issues that are best left to the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of a moratorium ``sends the wrong signal,'' said Berkley,  
who attended part of the commission meeting. ``It condemns an 
entire industry based on no rational or factual information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Robert Loescher, a businessman and member of a  
native American tribe in Alaska, said the draft report ``ignores 
the fact that millions of Americans are involved in gaming for a 
number of reasons: for competition, for entertainment, for 
recreation. For native Americans, we've always had gambling as part 
of our culture for thousands and thousands of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most if not all the commissioners agree on some overriding  
principles. 
</P>
<P>
	They say state lottery advertising should be subject to tighter  
scrutiny; government should spend more on compulsive gambling 
treatment, education and research; and casinos in destinations such 
as Las Vegas and Atlantic City are less troublesome than slot 
machines and video poker at neighborhood bars and stores. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agree there should be a uniform national minimum age  
of 21 to place bets. In some states, 18 is the minimum age to 
participate in certain types of gambling.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Ace Glavine Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Almost a month into the season, Tom Glavine  
hardly looks like the 20-game winner who captured the Cy Young 
Award a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves left-hander is still seeking his first  
victory after four starts, his ERA a most un-Glavine-like 5.61. 
He's 0-3 for the first time since his rookie season in 1988, and 
he's given up a staggering 33 hits in 25 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	This from the pitcher who has averaged more than 16 victories a  
year since '89, including four 20-win seasons. Last year, he won 
his second Cy Young after going 20-6 with a 2.47 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just four out of 35 or 36 starts,'' said Glavine, who  
pitches again Wednesday night against Pittsburgh. ``There's a lot 
of time to turn it around and get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers have speculated that Glavine's problems can be  
traced to baseball's attempts to better define the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the biggest disputes have involved the outside  
strike, most notably Eric Gregg's trampoline-size plate when Livan 
Hernandez had 15 strikeouts against the Braves in a 1997 NL 
championship series game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, who works most effectively when his changeup is an inch  
or two off the plate, insists that a narrower strike zone is not 
his problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``My location is, at best, inconsistent,'' he said. ``But I'm  
not far off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves don't seem too concerned about Glavine's early woes,  
even though he always has been a fast starter in the past. Prior to 
this season, he was 24-13 with a 2.66 ERA in the first month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a slump,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``It's just like  
a hitter who goes a few games without getting a hit. Same thing for 
a pitcher. They go through slumps, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there was ever a pitcher who could handle the fickleness of  
the game, it's Glavine. He's been there for all of Atlanta's good 
times during this decade, including his eight-inning, one-hit 
performance in the deciding game of the '95 World Series. But he's 
also been the losing pitcher in the final game of the NLCS the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In every case, his poker-faced expression never changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's real mature,'' Lopez said. ``He's know how to handle it.  
It's just a matter of trying a little harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine looks like his old self when throwing the slider and  
fastball on the outside corner of the plate. But he's struggled 
with his best pitch, the changeup, and he's been hammered when he 
tries to come inside to right-handed hitters with the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he throws the changeup, it's not slow and sinking like it  
was last year,'' Lopez said. ``And he's leaving his fastball over 
the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Mark Wohlers, who was finally dumped by the Braves  
because of control problems, Glavine's command of the strike zone 
may be a little too precise. He's only had four unintentional walks 
through his first four starts, an average of 1.4 per nine innings. 
His career average is three walks per nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at a lot of guys and sometimes they've struggled  
because they're not throwing strikes and walking people,'' Glavine 
said. ``That's not my problem. My problem is too many strikes that 
are good. I'm catching too much of the plate.''

<HEADLINE> Heat's Mourning Sits Out Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning returned to South  
Florida a day early, missing Tuesday night's game at New Jersey to 
have his injured right eye examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning flew home from Cleveland, where he stayed overnight  
after being poked in the eye during the first half of Miami's 90-65 
victory over the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury didn't keep Mourning from getting 23 points, 12  
rebounds and four blocks against the Cavaliers, although he played 
with a lot of discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel right the whole game,'' said Mourning, who was  
taken for X-rays after Monday night's win. ``I could see, but it 
just didn't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning was hurt late in the first quarter when Cleveland's  
Cedric Henderson reached in caught him under the eye. No foul was 
called, something Miami coach Pat Riley called ``a little 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it and this guy gets pounded and hit in the head  
more than any player I have ever coached in my life -- over the 
head, in the face,'' Riley said Tuesday. ``This is the second time 
he's had this problem in a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning missed two games last season and played with a  
protective mask for 10 more after breaking a cheekbone in a 
collision with Boston's Andrew DeClercq, now with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning's status is day-to-day, pending the outcome of further  
examination by team doctors scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are all concerned about what is going on with Zo,''  
Heat guard Tim Hardaway said. ``That's our big man. That's our 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center is having perhaps his best season,  
averaging 20.3 points and 11.0 rebounds and leading the league in 
blocked shots with a 4.0 average.

	Reservists To Be Called for Duty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon announced today it will call  
33,102 reservists to active military duty for the Kosovo conflict, 
the largest nonvoluntary call-up since 240,000 served during the 
1991 Gulf War. The first reservists to get the call are from Air 
Force Reserve and Air National Guard units based in Alabama, 
Arizona, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and 
Wisconsin. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the call-up will 
enable NATO to accelerate the pace of its airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia by keeping planes in the air longer and to expand the 
attacks by fueling a larger fleet of strike aircraft.

actually exercising statehood,'' the official news agency WAFA 
quoted Arafat as saying during the Palestinian Central Council's 
12-hour debate on statehood. The United States, the European Union 
and Arab states have urged Arafat to back down from his 
oft-repeated pledge to declare independence next Tuesday.

<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court reprimanded a  
municipal court judge Tuesday for asking a woman whether her 
pregnant daughter could ``keep her pants on and not behave like a 
slut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Judge Robert Michelson's comments were ``wholly  
inappropriate,'' and said he should take anger management classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The reprimand stems from a January 1998 incident in which a  
woman requested more time to pay fines for unspecified tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said she couldn't pay because she was caring for two  
children belonging to her daughter, who was pregnant and ill with 
cancer, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelson, a judge in Racine, became angry and said, ``I suppose  
it was too much to ask that your daughter keep her pants on and not 
behave like a slut,'' according to the documents.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Unveils Durable Photo Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Go ahead and pass around your treasured  
snapshots. Eastman Kodak Co. says it has found a new way to 
safeguard them from coming back torn, dogeared or curled up at the 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
	It unveiled a laminated, multi-layer photographic paper Tuesday  
that it claims is five times tougher than existing prints. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive George Fisher called the DuraLife brand the  
biggest advance in the photographic paper market since the 
introduction of color photo paper in 1942. It will be test-marketed 
in several cities this summer, followed by a national rollout in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who opt for DuraLife, it will add around $2 to the  
cost of each batch of prints. Customers who select Kodak's more 
expensive ``premium processing'' services would not be charged more 
for the new paper, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is still looking for ways to protect photos from other  
ubiquitous threats, like thumb smudges and water stains. ``Over 
time you may see some of those other improvements as well,'' 
promised spokesman Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife was developed in response to customer surveys  
indicating that 82 percent of people would like their photos to be 
more resistant to tears and creases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is virtually impossible to tear,'' said Bill Smith, a  
marketing manager for Kodak. ``It takes the worry out of using and 
sharing your pictures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife resists curls in most climates, even in high humidity,  
Kodak said. The paper also produces sharper and brighter images 
than regular prints and more accurately reveals pastel color 
details, the company contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The product introduction was the latest step by Kodak, which has  
been rebounding from a setback in the U.S. market at the hands of 
Japanese rival Fuji Photo Film Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak, the world's biggest photography company, is trying to  
grow more competitive by cutting 19,900 jobs out of a worldwide 
payroll of 100,500 through the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, its photo business was hit hard by competition from  
Fuji, which opened its first U.S. papermaking plant in Greenwood, 
S.C., in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	DuraLife will be highlighted with a major advertising campaign.  
Kodak is hoping a growing share of consumers will prefer it over 
conventional paper. Premium-quality film, Smith noted, is now 
preferred by 45 percent of Kodak customers, up from 37 percent just 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``DuraLife won't ever replace conventional paper,'' he added.  
``There's always going to be a segment that wants a lower-cost 
product.''

opportunity,'' said Michael Robertson, chairman, chief executive 
and founder of MP3.Com, which takes its name from the technology 
that allows Web surfers to download CD-quality music into their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has blamed the MP3 technology for the  
distribution of pirated songs because it allows for music to be 
easily transferred from CDs into a computer and then over the 
Internet. But increasingly, the industry has been looking for ways 
to incorporate the Internet into its regular businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact marks a breakthrough for MP3.Com, a San Diego-based  
company that made a name for itself by allowing unknown artists to 
market music directly to consumers through its popular Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal won't allow fans to download songs by Morrissette  
and Amos. It will use a different technology that allows for 
listening only. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will be able to buy concert tickets through the site and  
will be able to see pictures and post-concert interviews with the 
artists and their fans. The site will be linked to a site operated 
by Best Buy, a retailer and co-sponsor, where fans can buy CDs by 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour will begin Aug. 8 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and  
conclude in Irvine, Ca., on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-promotions may also include live concert broadcasts into  
Best Buy stores, said Gary Arnold, senior vice president of 
merchandising for Best Buy. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has the blessing of Time Warner, a partner in Miss  
Morissette's Maverick record label, and Atlantic Records, Miss 
Amos' distributor, although neither company is ready to move into 
online distribution or marketing on a large scale, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt this was an opportunity to embrace the Internet,''  
said Scott Welch, a partner in Atlas/Third Rail Management, which 
manages Miss Morissette. ``All of us are in uncharted territory. I 
think we all are trying to find a way to increase the relationships 
the artists have with their fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Amos' manager, Arthur Spivak of Spivak Entertainment said  
Miss Amos has been pressing him to make use of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last eight years or so I've had my artist calling up  
talking about getting involved in the Internet. What comes back to 
me is Internet, Internet, Internet. ... This is how her fans 
communicate. This is how they talk to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither singer appeared at the news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has been struggling to come to terms with  
the Internet and companies such as MP3.Com, which enable both 
artists and consumers to bypass traditional recording companies and 
retailers with direct-to-consumer marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.Com did not develop the MP3 technology that allows  
high-quality downloads of recordings. The company, however, has 
used it to legally distribute thousands of recordings on its Web 
site of the same name. The company uses the site to market the 
songs of any artist on the condition that one song be made 
available for free download. Artists set the price for the rest and 
split the revenue with MP3.Com. 
</P>
<P>
	The music exists in digital files in MP3.Com's servers linked to  
CD-cutting equipment. When a customer orders music, the sound 
automatically is transferred from the digital file to a CD and 
shipped to the buyer.

<HEADLINE> New Dinosaur Species Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Some dinosaurs were like prehistoric tanks on  
four legs -- protected by bony armor and huge tails that could swat 
away an attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new species of these heavily armored dinosaurs have emerged  
from an unusually productive Utah fossil bed near the College of 
Eastern Utah in Price, about 100 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The species, both 30 feet long, are an ankylosaur, or  
club-tailed armored dinosaur that's the oldest ever found, and a 
clubless armored dinosaur or nodosaur, the biggest on record. 
</P>
<P>
	James Kirkland, incoming state paleontologist for the state of  
Utah, has worked the fossil bed for more than a decade, piecing 
together discoveries that provide clues to life 100 million years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see a lot of animals coming out of here,''  
said Kirkland, referring to the Utah location. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland displayed bone casts of the discoveries Monday. The  
actual bones of the plant-eaters are kept at the College of Eastern 
Utah Prehistoric Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the species will be named when the findings are  
published in the coming year. Kirkland will analyze the bones with 
Kenneth Carpenter, a dinosaur paleontologist with the Denver Museum 
of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	Ankylosaurs and nodosaurs are ankylosaurids, heavily armored  
dinosaurs that originated in the Jurassic Period but are more 
common in the Cretaceous, the last dinosaur period. 
</P>
<P>
	The ankylosaurids are mainly from Asia and are believed to have  
crossed a land bridge to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some Asian animals very similar to this,'' Kirkland  
said. ``This is really dating the first animals coming in from 
Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter said the ankylosaur discovery pushes back the date of  
the land bridge some 20 million years to about 110 million years 
ago. The dating was done through volcanic ash known to be 98 
million years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert M. Sullivan, senior curator of paleontology and geology  
at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, called the 
findings exciting and said the large ankylosaur -- nearly 50 percent 
bigger than others previously found -- shows that the dinosaur 
family is more complex than had been believed. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Sullivan said, the discoveries will be hard to assess until  
published findings are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Norell, chairman of the department of vertebrate  
paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, 
agreed that the size of the ankylosaur was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Museum of Natural History was selected for the  
announcement because it is hosting a dinosaur exhibit which 
produces proceeds that help finance dinosaur research through the 
nonprofit Jurassic Foundation.

<HEADLINE> The Force May Push Hasbro to No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Out on the Toy Wars battlefield, Luke  
Skywalker is slashing away with his light saber -- but Barbie's 
leaps are keeping her beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbie is defending Mattel's title as the world's No. 1  
toymaker. Luke is trying to snatch it for Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
	But wait. Obi-Wan Kenobi, returned from the dead and years  
younger, is about to come onto the field for Hasbro. And he's got 
about 100 ``Phantom Menace'' figures to back him up. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the force be with Obi-Wan? Will Hasbro rule the toy trade?  
</P>
<P>
	It's anyone's guess.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro, the No. 2 toymaker, has battled Mattel for what seems  
like light years, launching competing products designed to win the 
hearts of children and the money of parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Hasbro is about to launch a major offensive.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the company will introduce the most-hyped line of  
toys in the history of the industry: a series of action figures 
based on ``Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly 
awaited new film by George Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 figures will begin appearing in stores 16 days before  
the May 19 release of the movie, which tells the story of Darth 
Vader before he became evil. Hasbro will have other spinoffs as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new toy line, said industry analyst Chris Byrne, Hasbro  
has ``a good shot'' catching Mattel in sales. Hasbro, based in the 
Providence suburb of Pawtucket, reported a record $668.4 million in 
revenues in the first quarter of the year -- a 38 percent increase 
from the same period a year ago. Mattel, headquartered in El 
Segundo, Calif., reported first-quarter sales of $692.1 million, 
down 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro expects great things from the new ``Phantom Menace'' toy  
line, which has generated hoopla nearly as noisy as that of the new 
movie. In an unprecedented move, most Toys R Us stores will open at 
12:01 a.m. on May 3 to greet the expected hordes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put on your seat belt,'' said Byrne, editor of the New  
York-based Toy Report newsletter. ``I think you're going to see 
lines of people around the blocks at Toys R Us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With two more ``Star Wars'' movies planned over the next few  
years and Hasbro holding a 10-year licensing agreement, analysts 
say the toymaker could see $5 billion in ``Star Wars'' spinoff 
sales over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity that doesn't come often,'' said Alan  
Hassenfeld, Hasbro's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro went to great lengths to woo Lucas, the brain behind  
``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassenfeld even dressed up as Obi-Wan Kenobi for a presentation  
at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do some strange things'' to get a deal, Hassenfeld  
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Rights to the ``Phantom Menace'' line were not cheap.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro has agreed to pay about $600 million in advances on  
royalties to Lucas in installments over nine years. That amount 
includes advances promised to Lucas by Lewis Galoob Toys, which was 
bought by Hasbro last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While excited about the Phantom Menace toy line, Hasbro  
executives point out that they have already introduced some of the 
1990s biggest hits -- like Furby, Pokemon and Teletubby. 
</P>
<P>
	Another star performer for Hasbro is its interactive division,  
the maker of video game versions of classic board games like 
Monopoly, Scrabble and Risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Hasbro Interactive announced it had obtained  
the rights to make and distribute video games based on 11 Namco 
Ltd. properties, including the well-known Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel, which has seen declining sales of traditional toys like  
Barbie dolls, has also been aggressively developing CD-ROMs and 
other high-tech toys to better keep pace with sophisticated 
interests of today's children. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Hasbro overtakes Mattel, there's no guarantee it will  
keep the crown. Hasbro was the No. 1 toymaker in the 1980s, but 
lost out to Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the Toy Wars grind on.  
</P>
<P>
	In October, Mattel will launch Mattel.com, a Web site through  
which it will sell popular toy brands like Barbie dolls and 
Matchbox cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toy Wars, it appears, may be increasingly fought in  
cyberspace.

<HEADLINE>  Littleton Says Goodbye to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He stood on the church stage, a stranger  
to the young man he was eulogizing, his voice wavering, his message 
simple: ``Thank you for saving my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Nick,'' the teen-ager said, looking out at hundreds  
of mourners crowding the church. ``I'm a senior at Columbine. I 
don't know Dan. ... I don't know his favorite color. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nick Foss did know Dan Rohrbough was a hero. Last Tuesday  
the 15-year-old freshman was shot as he held an exit door open for 
others so they could flee two teens on a shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough died on the sidewalk, just steps away from safety.  
</P>
<P>
	The service for Rohrbough was one of four held Monday for  
victims of last week's Columbine High School massacre. Three were 
for students; one was for teacher and coach William ``Dave'' 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more funerals were planned today, one week after the carnage  
in which Sanders and 12 students were killed. The two gunmen then 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rohrbough's funeral at Grace Presbyterian Church, the Rev.  
Dwight Blackstock commended the boy's selfless act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel guilty,'' he advised other teens who escaped thanks  
to Rohrbough. ``Thank God. Just thank God. And thank Danny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough's father, Brian, also spoke tenderly of his son, a boy  
who would save an entire year to buy Christmas gifts and loved 
computer games, cooking and tinkering with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking down at the casket, which included teddy bears and  
poems, his eyes misty, he said softly: ``Daniel Lee Rohrbough, in 
life and death, I'm proud of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, 2,500 people filled the sanctuary and two  
overflow rooms at the Trinity Christian Center to honor Sanders, 
who spent 24 of his 47 years at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders led  
students to safety until he was himself shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, 'Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sanders lay dying, students pulled out his wallet and held it  
open so he could see pictures of his wife and three daughters. 
``Tell my girls I love them,'' he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral, daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to  
daddy'' in which she said she'd always remember their talks on the 
porch. It contained a postscript: ``The girls and I would like you 
to know that we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sanders' 10 grandchildren, Austin Sanders, a preschooler,  
also spoke of his grandfather and how ``he always made good bedtime 
snacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At another funeral Monday, some 2,000 mourners gathered at the  
West Bowles Community Church to honor Cassie Bernall, the 
17-year-old girl who professed her belief in God just before she 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie's response does not surprise us,'' the family said in a  
statement. ``It was for her strong faith in God and His promise of 
eternal life that she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor George Kirsten told mourners, including rescuers who  
lined one wall of the church and received a standing ovation, that 
Cassie died a martyr. ``She went to the martyr's hall of fame,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people packed into the worship area of Foothills  
Bible Church at services for Lauren Townsend, an honor student and 
captain of the girls' varsity volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Townsend, 18, also was a member of the National Honor  
Society and a candidate for valedictorian 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family recalled a motivated, somewhat shy senior who  
wanted to become a biologist like her 25-year-old brother, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say that Lauren was a victim,'' he said. ``I don't  
think of her in that way. The ugly thing that happened last 
Tuesday, they couldn't conquer her beauty.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Obstruction Trial Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Attorneys argued Tuesday over immunity  
for a Marine jet navigator, delaying testimony in the obstruction 
of justice trial of the pilot who sliced an Italian gondola cable, 
killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement flared after a jury of seven officers was  
selected, including three helicopter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged  
with obstruction of justice and conspiracy. He admitted during his 
manslaughter trial in March that he helped hide a videotape shot 
before his EA-6B Prowler struck the cable on Feb. 3, 1998. A jury 
acquitted Ashby of manslaughter March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who was Ashby's navigator on the fatal  
flight and is expected to testify for the government and defense, 
asked the judge to grant him immunity from prosecution for his 
testimony. The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, said he would issue a 
ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said in an interview Tuesday that he expects to be  
out of active service by June 1 and wants to get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want this thing to end and I don't want to revisit  
it,'' he said. ``The issue here is what will happen two to three 
years from now. I accept responsibility for everything I did and 
everything I have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the same  
obstruction and conspiracy charges Ashby faces and was ordered 
dismissed from the Marines earlier this month. Schweitzer said he 
threw the tape into a bonfire because he feared a frame on it of 
his smiling face might be used to vilify him on Italian television. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fully testified about everything he knows,'' said  
Schweitzer's attorney, Maj. Eric Veit. ``Our concern is that 
although he plead guilty ... his conviction is not yet final. 
Should his conviction be reversed for any errors in the case, the 
government would be free to prosecute him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that by being called to testify in this case he is  
being further asked to incriminate himself,'' Veit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Daniel Daugherty argued Schweitzer waived his 5th Amendment  
right against self-incrimination by pleading guilty. Prosecutors 
also said the plea agreement didn't include immunity and required 
him to testify truthfully at Ashby's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it is pending in appeal does not make a  
difference in this case,'' Daugherty said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Ponderds Gambling Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices voiced free-speech  
concerns Tuesday over a ban on television and radio advertisements 
promoting privately owned casinos, the federal government's effort 
to help compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly during a 60-minute argument session, queries and  
comments from the bench questioned how the ban can protect such 
people when 240 casinos owned by Indian tribes in 31 states, 38 
state-run lotteries and other gambling operations are free to 
advertise at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Barbara Underwood emphasized the  
``devastating social costs'' caused by an estimated 3 million 
compulsive gamblers, and said Congress was entitled to address part 
of the problem by reining in commercial speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Some justices appeared unconvinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why doesn't Indian casino gambling have the same effect as  
private casino gambling with respect to the compulsive gambler?'' 
Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the ban might deter  
only the casual gambler. ``The true drunk is going to find the 
bottle,'' she said, equating tribe-owned casinos with that bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can the government use speech as an element of political  
largess?'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked in a tone that hinted 
he thinks it cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing federal law bans broadcast advertising for ``any  
lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But over the 
past 20 years, Congress has amended that law to allow ads for 
casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any gambling 
sponsored by nonprofit promoters for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, the law primarily has targeted privately owned  
casinos. It is being enforced only in some parts of the country 
because federal appeals courts have split over its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court for two decades has demanded that any  
government limits on truthful and non-deceptive commercial speech 
be shown to directly advance some asserted government interest and 
be no more extensive than necessary. If they do not, the court has 
ruled, they violate the First Amendment's free-speech protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day  
O'Connor also seemed skeptical that the casino ad ban meets that 
test. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia 
appeared to be most sympathetic to the government's defense of the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing. But when the court last  
year prevented states from banning advertising that refers to 
liquor prices -- an effort to promote sobriety -- Thomas wrote 
separately to support giving commercial speech full-fledged 
constitutional protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer representing the New  
Orleans-area broadcasters who challenged the advertising ban, 
called the case ``an appropriate vehicle'' for doing just that. But 
he said the court need not go that far to overturn the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal scheme is so riddled with exceptions that it  
cannot advance the government's asserted interest,'' he contended. 
</P>
<P>
	A key to the casino ad case may be whether the court believes a  
law with so many exceptions can protect compulsive gamblers. A 
decision is expect by late June.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Drowning Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERRYVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A man convicted of letting his girlfriend  
drown after they got stuck driving through high water was sentenced 
to 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Maddox of Leesburg remained emotionless Monday as  
Circuit Judge John R. Prosser handed him a 35-year prison term with 
10 years suspended. Prosser also ordered Maddox to pay $12,190 in 
restitution to the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddox, 36, was convicted of second-degree murder last month in  
the death of Evelyn Tumblin, who died in February 1998 in high 
water near the swollen Shenandoah River. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, rescue workers said they found Maddox smoking a  
cigarette while sitting in debris-filled water in his Ford Bronco. 
Minutes later, they found the unconscious 24-year-old Winchester 
woman in the back seat, her body partially submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Suzanne M. Perka said Maddox repeatedly  
told rescuers he was alone in the truck but later admitted Ms. 
Tumblin was with him and said he killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	According to other testimony, Maddox said Ms. Tumblin became  
hysterical when they got stuck because she was afraid of the water 
and that he struck her, causing her to slump over. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Maddox never harmed Ms. Tumblin  
and that he was disoriented when rescue crews arrived because he 
was suffering from hypothermia and had been drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's sentencing, Ms. Perka referred to Maddox's prior  
drunken driving convictions and asked that he be sentenced to the 
35-year term the jury had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really is going to do whatever he wants to do,'' she said.  
``He's a risk to other people, not really caring about anybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Luke Boyd said Maddox will appeal the trial  
verdict and sentence on the grounds that the jury didn't hear all 
the evidence in the case and didn't take into consideration the 
effect hypothermia had on Maddox's lucidity.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Back at Bargaining Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Negotiators for the WNBA and its players  
association returned to the bargaining table Tuesday in an effort 
to finalize their first collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides talked for eight hours Monday, trying to resolve  
differences which caused an apparent agreement to fall apart last 
week. At that time, both sides claimed the other had injected new 
terms at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The league postponed its player draft which had been scheduled  
for Tuesday, causing Pam Wheeler, executive director of the WNBA 
players association, to issue a statement charging league officials 
with trying to intimidate the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the union and league agreed on a four-year deal that  
would increase minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000 for 
veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those figures would increase to 
$40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002. The benefits package 
was to include year-round health and dental benefits, pension, 
maternity benefits and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-week season is supposed to begin June 10.  
</P>
<P>
	The union claimed that the league introduced five issues in  
talks last Wednesday night and said that if the players association 
did not agree to them, there would be no deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes was the right to extend the 32-game season  
without increasing salaries, the addition of random drug testing 
and no increase in the rookie wage scale for the duration of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old WNBA has added expansion teams in Orlando and  
Minnesota for this season and plans to add four more cities by 
2000, increasing membership to 16 franchises.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Recruiting New Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Police here admit they are targeting  
blacks, Hispanics, women, gays and lesbians -- not as suspects, but 
as candidates to join the force. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when images of police brutality have been seared into  
the American psyche, the New Haven Police Department is recruiting 
the very people who have often been seen as their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The department began its campaign Monday, printing  
advertisements in alternative publications and distributing fliers 
to inner city organizations, churches, and a community center for 
gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The fliers say, ``I want you'' in bold letters and feature  
photographs of minority and women officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want populations that have been traditionally underserved  
by police and underrepresented in police departments,'' said Kay D. 
Codish, director of training and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar recruitment drives have had mixed results in San  
Francisco, Boston and elsewhere, said Penny Harrington, director of 
the National Center for Women &AMP; Policing in Los Angeles and former 
chief of the Portland, Ore., police department. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of women and minorities do not see policing as a place  
for them. In the media, on television, they're frequently shown in 
subsidiary roles,'' Harrington said. ``If an agency is serious, 
they have to go out and target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Williams, director of the Police Foundation, a  
Washington, D.C.-based research organization, said mistrust of 
police in some minority communities has reached crisis proportions 
because of ``racial profiling,'' allegations that police make 
traffic stops and detain people based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for the police officers to do their job, they must  
have public support,'' said Williams, former director of police in 
Newark, N.J. ``You have populations that see the police in hostile 
ways, that they're not there to protect and to serve, but to 
control and oppress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James McIver of the National Organization of Black Law  
Enforcement Executives in Alexandria, Va., said studies show that a 
police force that reflects the community it serves demographically 
is less likely to have accusations of police brutality lodged 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to two recent cases in New York City. Four police  
officers have been charged in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, 
an unarmed West African, and four other city officers are charged 
with sodomizing a Haitian suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Justice Department Bureau of Statistics,  
there are about 664,000 full-time police officers in the country. 
At the municipal level, the latest figures available show that 
roughly 11 percent are black, 6 percent are Hispanic, and about 9 
percent are women. The federal government does not keep track of 
officers' sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	New Haven's 447-member department already is diverse compared to  
national statistics, with 39 percent being minorities and 16 
percent female. 
</P>
<P>
	In a newspaper editorial earlier this month, Police Chief Melvin  
Wearing said there is no quota and minorities don't get extra 
points on their applications just for being who they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is simply to increase the number of applicants from  
those groups that, in the past, have not presented themselves for 
consideration in substantial numbers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, police union officials have questioned the recruitment  
effort and some have said they fear white male candidates will feel 
unwelcome to apply for the 40 job openings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start encouraging one certain group, others might feel  
slighted. We would like to see an open recruitment. The key is that 
they be qualified,'' said Frank Lombardi, vice president of the 
local union. 
</P>
<P>
	Most, if not all, police departments say they are ``equal  
opportunity employers,'' but Codish believes law enforcement 
agencies must go further by advertising in unlikely places such as 
women's health clinics and day care centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Joanne Schaller, who has been on the force eight  
years, said she may be a lesbian but she does not want to be the 
``poster child'' for lesbian recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do my job and I'm professional, should my sexual  
orientation be a factor?,'' she asked. ``No. To me, it shouldn't be 
an issue.''

<HEADLINE> Teamsters To Make Exec Pay Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Teamsters say executives  
shouldn't benefit when rank-and-file employees lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	To support their claim, Teamsters say they'll submit a proposal  
at the company's annual shareholders' meeting this week that would 
prevent executives from cashing in on stock options within six 
months of an announced workforce reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders for Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewery,  
are scheduled to meet at SeaWorld in Orlando, Fla. The St. 
Louis-based company makes Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob and other 
beers. It also operates theme parks, including SeaWorld. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past the company was concerned about the well-being of  
its workers and the community,'' said Joseph Zuffrante, a member of 
Teamsters Local 122 and an employee at an Anheuser-Busch 
distributorship in Boston. ``Now it seems the only thing that 
matters is how high managers can crank up the profits despite who 
gets hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Anheuser-Busch did not immediately return phone  
calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters say layoffs are planned at plants in St. Louis and  
Williamsburg, Va. The Teamsters also continue to be upset over the 
brewery's decision last year to enact a new contract, even though 
the union had not accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract boosts pay and benefits by about 11 percent  
over five years. With overtime, the average worker will make 
$66,000 annually by the end of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Teamsters have said the contract fails to ensure that  
job levels will be maintained. The company has acknowledged that at 
least 600 full-time jobs would be eliminated nationwide, mostly 
through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep good, full-time jobs in the communities where  
Anheuser-Busch brews its beer,'' said Jack Cipriani, director of 
the Teamster Brewery and Soft Drink Conference.

<HEADLINE> MGM Names New Chairman, CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. on Tuesday  
named Alex Yemenidjian, 43, its new chairman and chief executive 
officer, replacing Frank Mancuso who is stepping down after six 
years at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemenidjian, who is controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian's  
casino aide, is an MGM director and chairman of the executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The retiring Mancuso will continue to serve on the MGM board. As  
part of the transition, vice chairman A. Robert Pisano, 56, who 
came to the company with Mancuso in 1993, also stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
	Mancuso, 65, had tired of the pressure of his job, Daily Variety  
reported Tuesday. His contract runs until October 2001, but it 
specifies he can quit at any time with 30 days notice. 
</P>
<P>
	He will receive a payout of about $11 million, according to  
MGM's latest proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM said the new leadership was ``part of an aggressive  
long-term growth strategy to simultaneously leverage its unmatched 
library and expand new film and television production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MGM has the world's largest film library with more than 5,000  
titles, more than half of all films made by Hollywood studios in 
the past half-century. The MGM library also has more than 8,000 
hours of TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports about a possible management shakeup boosted MGM  
stock 10 percent on Monday. In trading Tuesday, MGM stock was at 
$14.18 3/4, down $1.62 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemenidjian has spent the past nine years at Kerkorian's  
Tracinda Corp. and MGM Grand Inc., most recently as president and 
chief operating officer of the Las Vegas-based entertainment, hotel 
and gambling company. He will retain the title of president of MGM 
Grand.

<HEADLINE> Scope of Disability Law Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Does the law protecting disabled workers from discrimination  
also cover someone who wears glasses to correct his impairment? 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning today, the Supreme Court considers this question in  
three closely watched cases that will eventually define who is 
protected under the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act: the 
severely disabled, or millions more with contact lenses, diabetes 
or hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of this case and the other two is that they  
will determine how open the front door to the ADA will be,'' said 
Kirk Lowry, a Topeka, Kan., lawyer involved in the first case to be 
heard by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry represents Vaughn Murphy, who controls his high blood  
pressure with medication. When UPS fired him as a mechanic and 
driver, saying his condition made him unfit to drive, he sued under 
the law protecting the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts have come down on both sides of the issue -- giving  
the Supreme Court an impetus to step in and clarify the scope of 
the civil rights law banning discrimination against the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both employers and employees need to know what the correct  
rule of law is,'' said Aaron Hughes, lawyer for Karen Sutton and 
Kimberly Hinton, severely nearsighted twin sisters whose case comes 
before the court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sutton of Spokane, Wash. and Ms. Hinton of Petal, Miss. sued  
United Airlines for rejecting them from pilots jobs. The third case 
involves Hallie Kirkingburg, a truck driver hired in Portland, Ore. 
by Albertson's grocery stores. Kirkingburg, who has poor vision in 
one eye, sued the company after they fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have fared well in ADA court battles. They've won 92  
percent of the 700 ADA cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, 
according to a study by the American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But now employers fear that victories by the workers in the  
Supreme Court cases could lead to a flood of new lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will allow a much larger population to claim rights under  
the ADA,'' said Quentin Riegel, deputy general counsel for the 
National Association of Manufacturers, which has filed a brief with 
the court siding with United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the numbers of people protected by the ADA would  
skyrocket. Take one example: Nearly 40 percent of the U.S. 
population -- or about 152 million people -- are nearsighted enough 
to need glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers scoff at the idea that a person whose impairment is  
corrected day-to-day can sue for discrimination under the ADA, 
which defines a disability as an impairment that substantially 
limits a major life activity. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS lawyer William Kilberg argues that by the ADA's definition,  
Murphy is ``not entitled to the advantages that the statute 
reserves for people who are disabled.'' UPS says Murphy was fired 
in 1994 because his blood pressure exceeded federal regulations for 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	But advocates for the disabled -- along with the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission -- argue that if someone is fired or rejected 
from a job because of their impairment, that is discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say someone's lost a leg, and they can walk with a prosthesis,  
they're still substantially limited in a major life activity: 
walking,'' said Ellen Vargyas, EEOC legal counsel. ``Most people 
would accept as a given that that person is covered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Murphy has found another job, fixing utility trucks. But  
he's still angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's blatant discrimination,'' said the Manhattan, Kan.,  
mechanic.

<HEADLINE> Ernst &AMP; Young Agrees To Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Accounting and consulting firm Ernst &AMP; Young  
has settled claims it provided incompetent and fraudulent advice 
for the now-defunct Merry-Go-Round clothing chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the settlement, announced Monday, Ernst &AMP; Young  
will pay $185 million but will not acknowledge wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Merry-Go-Round hired Ernst &AMP; Young in 1993 to help it devise a  
bankruptcy reorganization strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.8 billion lawsuit, filed by a bankruptcy trustee, alleged  
that Ernst &AMP; Young instead contributed to the retailer's demise, 
charging that Ernst &AMP; Young assigned inexperienced people to the 
job and moved too slowly to fix Merry-Go-Round's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter of 1995, Ernst &AMP; Young launched a  
cost-cutting program that was designed to save $11 million. The 
suit claimed that the program, which included the closing of 230 
stores, deprived the chain of badly needed Christmas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Merry-Go-Round, based in Joppa, Md., lost $186 million during  
1995 and closed the rest of its stores in March 1996 with $300 
million in unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial in the case had been scheduled to start Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Ernst &AMP; Young, one of the nation's top  
accounting and consulting concerns, had claimed that awarding even 
a fraction of $3 billion in punitive damages and $800 million in 
compensatory damages sought could threaten the firm's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Merry-Go-Round was founded in 1968 by Harold Goldsmith and  
Leonard ``Boogie'' Weinglass, who was the inspiration for one of 
the characters in ``Diner,'' director Barry Levinson's hit film 
about his teen-age years in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain eventually grew to 1,500 mall-based stores, but ran  
into trouble in the early 1990s when its clothing fell out of favor 
among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst &AMP; Young said in a statement Monday that it ``believes  
other parties bear substantial responsibility for the failure of 
Merry-Go-Round to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm will look to these parties for contribution to the  
settlement,'' which is largely covered by insurance, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiff in the case, bankruptcy trustee Deborah H. Devan,  
issued a statement describing the settlement as a fair agreement 
which ``serves the best interests of the estate of Merry-Go-Round 
Enterprises, Inc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has said she hoped a settlement would allow full payment of  
more than $80 million in claims by primary creditors, including 
former vendors and 2,000 former employees owed vacation time, 
bonuses and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Devan, a Baltimore attorney, began serving as  
Merry-Go-Round's bankruptcy trustee in March 1996 after the 
company's reorganization in federal court under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy laws was converted into a Chapter 7 liquidation.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 113.12  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed today, as the Dow Jones  
industrials moved to record highs amid a return to manufacturing 
and basic-materials stocks, but the Nasdaq composite sank on 
profit-taking in some technology shares. The Dow closed up 113.12 
at 10,831.71, breaking 10,800 for the first time. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index rose 2.75 to 1,362.79, and the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index fell 49.90 to 2,602.15. Bob Gasser, head of 
block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., said the Nasdaq was slowing 
down after hitting a new closing high yesterday. He also said 
investors were ``waiting on bated breath'' for earnings from 
America Online and Amazon.com., due out late today and tomorrow, 
respectively. AOL shares today were down 7 at 155, and Amazon.com 
was down 15/16 at 205 7/8.

	Income Growth Outpaces Inflation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes climbed 4.4 percent in  
1998, significantly outpacing inflation. In every state, per capita 
incomes grew faster than prices. ``It translates directly into 
buying power,'' said Steve Cochrane, an economist at Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``We've seen really 
strong consumer spending over the last year ... and these figures 
tell us why: There's money out there to spend.'' Nationally, 
average income for America's 270.3 million people last year was 
$26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, the Commerce Department said 
yesterday. The figures include not only wages and salaries, but 
other sources of income such as investment earnings and government 
benefits.

	Consumer Confidence Rises Again  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a key indicator of future  
economic activity, rose for the sixth straight month in April, the 
Conference Board reported today. The business-financed study group 
reported its consumer confidence index rose nearly a full point to 
134.9 from a revised 134 in March, a stronger performance than Wall 
Street analysts had expected. An index designed to measure consumer 
expectations for the next six to nine months had an even bigger 
increase, rising to 108 from 105.5. The National Association of 
Realtors also reported that sales of existing single-family homes 
rose to a record high rate of 5.05 million units in March.

	Rubin: Global Economic Risks Remain

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One day after the United States failed to  
achieve solid commitments from Europe and Japan to boost growth, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned that the world could face 
severe risks if major countries do not carry out their 
responsibilities. Rubin noted that America's trade deficit has 
soared to record levels as a result of nearly two years of global 
turmoil while Japan's trade surplus has actually increased and 
Europe's trade balance has been essentially unchanged. Rubin spoke 
at the opening of discussions among world finance ministers who sit 
on the steering committee for the 182-nation International Monetary 
Fund.

	Disney Reports Earnings Drop  
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. reported that  
second-quarter earnings fell 30 percent due to a drop in home video 
sales and soft sales in its merchandising business. Excluding a 
charge related to the company's 1998 acquisition of 43 percent of 
Infoseek Corp., Disney's earnings fell to $269 million, or 13 cents 
a share. Including the one-time charge, Disney's net income totaled 
$226 million, or 41 cents a share, down 41 percent from a year ago. 
Disney's revenues, however, rose to $5.51 billion from $5.24 
billion. Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner said in a statement Disney 
would focus on cutting costs to improve its profits. Disney shares 
were down 2 1/2 at 32 1/2.

	DuPont's Earnings Dip Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co. reported a slight decline in  
income and earnings from continuing operations during the first 
quarter. Its results beat Wall Street projections. DuPont said 
today that income from continuing operations -- taking into account 
the planned divestiture of Conoco, DuPont's oil and gas subsidiary 
-- was $628 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with $637 
million, or 68 cents a share, in the same period last year. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of 60 
cents a share.

	Louisiana-Pacific Plans 4 Plants

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Louisiana-Pacific Corp. plans to build  
four new plants in British Columbia to make wood products from 
fast-growing aspen trees. The Portland-based lumber and building 
products company said yesterday it plans to spend about $175 
million on the plants, which would produce veneer, laminated veneer 
lumber, I-joists and oriented strandboard. The plants would be 
supplied by forests managed by the British Columbian government. 
The fast-growing aspen are not considered prime trees for lumber 
production. But they can be chipped and flaked into the raw 
materials used in engineered wood products.

or curled up at the corners. It unveiled a laminated, multi-layer 
photographic paper today that it claims is five times tougher than 
existing prints. Chief executive George Fisher called the DuraLife 
brand the biggest advance in the photographic paper market since 
the introduction of color photo paper in 1942. It will be 
test-marketed in several cities this summer, followed by a national 
rollout in the fall. It will add around $2 to the cost of each 
batch of prints. Kodak shares were up 1 at 77 5/8.

	Clinton Calls Up Reservists  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today authorized the  
Pentagon to order 33,102 reservists to active duty, the first 
nonvoluntary call-up of reservists since the Kosovo conflict began 
March 24. Clinton said Defense Secretary William Cohen informed him 
he intends to use the call-up authority to immediately activate 
2,000 airmen from the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve , 
but he did not specify their units or identify their states. About 
1,000 reservists have volunteered their services in recent weeks, 
but many more will be needed as NATO expands its fleet of attack 
and support aircraft in the Balkan campaign.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck Slobodan Milosevic's  
ruling party headquarters today as hopes for a diplomatic 
settlement to the Kosovo conflict foundered. After signaling that 
the Yugoslav leadership might be searching for a way out of the 
confrontation, a deputy premier acknowledged he had not discussed a 
key sticking point -- whether a peacekeeping force would be armed -- 
with President Milosevic. Meanwhile, the 23-story Usce Center 
building was hit by NATO for the second time. Taking advantage of 
clear weather, NATO jets also were in action over the skies between 
the Kosovo city of Prizren and the Albanian border, with American 
A-10 tank-fighting airplanes visible from the ground.

after the eruption of gunfire at Columbine High School was first 
reported. Church bells tolled 15 times, one for each person killed, 
including the gunmen. Meanwhile, authorities said the 18-year-old 
girlfriend of gunman Dylan Klebold had purchased at least two of 
the weapons used in the attack. She was questioned yesterday. They 
described her as a witness, not a suspect. Prosecutors also said 
the weapons may have been purchased legally.

children commit crimes with guns. Buyers of explosives would also 
be subject to the same Brady law background checks as gun 
purchasers. The crime package also proposes banning juvenile

education. Students in low-performing schools would be able to 
transfer to private schools at state expense using vouchers or what

<HEADLINE> Japan Survey Shows Low Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Pummeled by a bad economy, rising crime and general  
social malaise, the Japanese are more pessimistic about their 
country and its future than they have been in decades, a government 
survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Ministry study, based on 2,680 responses last  
September and October, showed record lows in confidence in Japan's 
economic and technological levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark mood has even hit people individually: respondents'  
emotional well-being was at a record low, and only 19 percent of 
those surveyed said they expected to achieve happiness in their 
lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are losing confidence as a whole because of the  
recession,'' Yoshiyuki Sakamoto, of the ministry's Institute of 
Statistical Mathematics, told reporters when the survey was 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes at a tough time for Japan. The economy,  
in a rut for most of the 1990s, is now stuck in its deepest 
recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy is not the only worry. Japan's low crime rates are  
spiking upwards, particularly among youth. The country's education, 
health and even family systems are largely seen as outmoded and in 
need of drastic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted in varying forms every five years since  
1953, marked a sharp contrast with the previous poll taken in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents who said they were emotionally well-off dived 15  
points to a record 26 percent. Satisfaction with living standards 
plunged 21 points to 53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the national economy, the feeling that it is in good or  
fairly good condition crashed from a robust 79 percent five years 
ago to a record low of 32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Respondents who rated Japan's technological level as very high  
were at a record low of 24 percent, down from 46 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Forty-seven percent said they would prefer to have a girl if  
they had only one child, an increase of 11 points. Only 28 percent 
said they would want a boy, possibly reflecting the feeling that 
girls are better suited to care for elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey gave no margin of error.

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio simply causes a riot  
wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
	His bodyguards were questioned by Taiwanese police after  
photographers angling for a picture Monday in Taipei's airport 
complained that they shoved and insulted them, Taiwanese television 
and newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed after the bodyguards, reported to number  
three or five, admitted inappropriate behavior and apologized to 
reporters, according to the mass circulation China Times, the 
entertainment paper Min Sheng Daily and the TVBS entertainment 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures showed DiCaprio smiling behind sunglasses, a pulled  
down baseball cap and plastic shopping bag partially hiding his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Titanic'' star stayed in the China Airlines VIP departure  
lounge for two hours Monday until his flight left, the reports 
said.

Bangkok after completing shooting of ``The Beach'' on Thailand's

singer Michael Jackson, have also had run-ins with Taiwan's 
aggressive news media.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Shipment Disappears Briefly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A lead container with a radioactive material  
strong enough to kill anyone who opened the armored package was 
found in England 10 days after it was supposed to have been shipped 
to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The container, which was found unopened, held a relatively small  
amount of a radioactive isotope of the metal iridium, used to X-ray 
pipeline welds and aircraft parts as well as in treatment of cancer 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The package was shipped via Federal Express on April 16 by AEA  
Technology QSA of Burlington and addressed to a construction 
company in Toluca, Mexico, according to Federal Express and the 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Its disappearance touched off a frantic search and an NRC  
special alert, until it turned up Monday at Stansted Airport 
outside London. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the isotope's high radioactivity, unprotected  
exposure for more than 10 or 15 minutes could cause a quick death, 
NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened the possible physical effects to ``thousands and  
thousands of X-rays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said the bulk of the package was made up of protective  
materials and a security system, and the iridium made up a 
relatively small part of the total weight. He said he didn't know 
how much the iridium weighed. 
</P>
<P>
	The cylinder containing the iridium was designed to resist  
breaking even in a 40-foot drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``These packages are built better than tanks,'' William  
McDaniel, AEA director of operations, told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC said that nationally, packages of nuclear materials are  
misplaced about once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express said only 0.5 percent of material it ships is  
radioactive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said the NRC was satisfied that the iridium package has  
been safely recovered, but said the Department of Transportation is 
expected to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Potentially Lethal Shipment Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Federal Express package with a potentially  
lethal radioactive metal disappeared for 10 days before it turned 
up safely in England -- to the relief of government inspectors and 
crews that had to patrol highways with radiation detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The package contained 200 pounds of supplies from a  
Massachusetts technology company to a construction company in 
Toluca, Mexico. Inside was a cylinder of iridium, which is used to 
X-ray pipeline welds and aircraft parts and in chemotherapy 
treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the isotope's high radioactivity, anyone who opened  
the package unwittingly could be exposed to the equivalent of 
``thousands and thousands of X-rays'' and die quickly, said Neil 
Sheehan, a spokesman for Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The package was shipped on April 16 by AEA Technology QSA of  
Burlington and addressed to a construction company in Toluca, 
Mexico. On April 21, the Mexican company told AEA it had received 
the bill of lading, but no package. 
</P>
<P>
	That put the NRC on alert. Health crews outside Boston and the  
FedEx hub of Memphis, Tenn., patrolled highways with radiation 
detectors looking for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the package was found Monday, unopened, in a hangar in  
a small airport outside of London. FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn said 
Tuesday the company was still trying to figure out how the package 
got there.

<HEADLINE> Texaco Q1 earnings down nearly 60 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texaco Inc., joining other oil companies whose  
results have been hurt by depressed prices for crude, reported its 
first-quarter earnings fell nearly 60 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-biggest oil said Tuesday it had earnings from  
continuing operations of $105 million, or 18 cents a share, 
compared with $259 million, or 46 cents a share, in the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the steep earnings decline, Texaco beat the expectations  
of Wall Street analysts who predicted it would earn 17 cents per 
share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's net income for the quarter was $199 million, or 35  
cents a share, compared with $234 million, or 42 cents a share, a 
year ago. The 1999 results include a gain of $94 million for 
inventory adjustment and production tax refunds. Last year's 
results include a gain of $25 million for an accounting adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 11 percent to $7.19 billion from $8.15 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's stock rose $2.50 to $61 a share in afternoon trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Major oil companies have watched a slump in oil prices eat away  
at their earnings. Lower demand around the world due to poor 
economic conditions has forced oil companies to lower the prices 
they charge their customers, reducing their revenues and profits 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said it sold oil in the United States at an average price  
of $9.11 a barrel, down 23 percent from a year ago. Natural gas 
prices fell by 16 percent to $1.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's results were also hurt by some operational problems in  
the North Sea, which reduced production capabilities by about 
30,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's exploration and producing division had $18 million  
in 1999 first-quarter earnings compared with a $156 million a year 
earlier. Its marketing and refining division earning rose to $283 
million from $229 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco chairman and chief executive Peter Bijur said he expects  
the results to improve in the coming months due to the recent rise 
in oil prices and a resumption of normal production in the North 
Sea during April.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Illegal Gratuity Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it harder to  
convict someone of giving an illegal gratuity to a federal 
official, ruling in a case that stemmed from the corruption 
investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that people cannot be convicted of  
giving an illegal gratuity unless prosecutors prove the gift was 
linked to an official act. It is not enough to show that someone 
wanted to curry favor because an official was in a position to help 
them, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled against independent counsel Donald Smaltz,  
who had asked them to reinstate a California agricultural 
cooperative's conviction of illegally giving gifts to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy was acquitted last December of all 30 corruption charges  
involving gifts he accepted from Sun-Diamond Growers of California 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law makes it a crime to give ``anything of value'' to a  
public official ``for or because of any official act performed or 
to be performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that the words  
``official act'' appeared to require ``that some particular act be 
identified and proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reading the law more broadly would lead to ``peculiar results,''  
Scalia said. ``It would criminalize, for example, token gifts to 
the president based on his official position and not linked to any 
identifiable act -- such as the replica jerseys given by 
championship sports teams each year during ceremonial White House 
visits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted  
to be either a meat ax or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to 
be the latter,'' Scalia added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun-Diamond, a raisin and nut cooperative, was prosecuted in  
1996 as part of Smaltz's investigation of corruption allegations 
against Espy. The cooperative was convicted of giving $5,900 in 
illegal gratuities to Espy, including tickets to the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament, luggage, meals, a framed print and a crystal 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court last year threw out the conviction and a  
$1.5 million fine. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia said the jury was wrongly allowed to convict 
Sun-Diamond without evidence that its gifts to Espy were linked to 
his official actions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Smaltz argued that the  
appeals court's opinion would create a ``serious obstacle'' to 
federal corruption allegations. He said the ruling meant 
prosecutors would have to prove ``the virtual equivalent of a 
bribe,'' a more serious offense that carries heavier penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal bribery law requires proof of an actual agreement in  
which a gift is given with intent to influence an official act. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court upheld the appeals court's decision.  
Scalia said other laws show that when Congress wants to impose a 
broad ban on gift-giving, it has done so in ``more precise'' 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the appeals court threw out Sun-Diamond's conviction,  
it had ruled the indictment was legally sufficient even though it 
did not allege a specific connection between the gifts and any 
official acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia said today's ruling cast doubt on the lower courts'  
decisions on that issue, adding that the justices were leaving the 
question to be re-examined by the district court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is U.S. vs. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, 98-131.

<HEADLINE> Court To Mediate Calif. Propisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal mediator will try to quell the  
division over a 1994 measure to bar illegal immigrants from 
attending public school or receiving other state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court on Monday granted Gov. Gray Davis'  
request for mediation in the dispute over Proposition 187. The 
mediation would not be binding. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Proposition 187, which bars illegal immigrants  
from receiving public schooling and non-emergency health care, has 
been blocked by the federal courts from taking effect as part of an 
ongoing legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat who took office earlier this year, opposed  
Proposition 187. His predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson, backed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidestepping a politically fraught issue, Davis proposed that  
the dispute be submitted to mediation, a process that is typically 
used to resolve matters such as attorney fees and other disputes 
which involve money. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the governor respects  
the will of the 59 percent majority that approved Proposition 187 
in November 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has taken an oath of office to uphold the laws, including  
those laws that he doesn't necessarily agree with,'' Bustamante 
said, adding that prospects for a settlement should be known in 
three to four months, far sooner than an appeal would take to 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower-court judge has ruled that the core provisions of  
Proposition 187 amount to an attempt to regulate immigration, an 
area that is the exclusive responsibility of the federal 
government. In addition, the ban on public schooling was found to 
conflict with a Supreme Court ruling that struck down an identical 
prohibition in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Sharon Browne of the Pacific Legal Foundation, which  
represents sponsors of Proposition 187, criticized the mediation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the backers of the measure have been denied status as  
parties to the case, she said, they will not be allowed to take 
part in the mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this does is leave Proposition 187 basically undefended  
in the mediation hearing, because the governor has made it clear he 
opposes the philosophy behind Proposition 187,'' she said. ``I just 
don't see how it can be a fair mediation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the civil rights groups challenging the measure also  
have been critical, saying the constitutionality of a law cannot be 
resolved by mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	While willing to listen to the governor's offers, ``We will  
never accept an offer that removes children from classrooms, or 
denies health care or social services to needy individuals to which 
they are entitled,'' said Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana-Pacific Plans 4 Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Louisiana-Pacific Corp. plans to build  
four new plants in British Columbia to make wood products from 
fast-growing aspen trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland-based lumber and building products company said  
Monday it plans to spend about $175 million on the plants, which 
would produce veneer, laminated veneer lumber, I-joists and 
oriented strandboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants would be supplied by forests managed by the British  
Columbian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-growing aspen are not considered prime trees for lumber  
production. But they can be chipped and flaked into the raw 
materials used in engineered wood products. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of Louisiana-Pacific's effort to get out of the  
pulp business and concentrate exclusively on building products. But 
a decline in world pulp prices has made it difficult to sell pulp 
plants in Chetwynd, British Columbia, and Samoa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells the pulp rather than manufacture paper  
products itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana-Pacific shares closed Monday at $22.9375, just  
slightly below the 52-week high of $23 a share on April 19. Shares 
were trading as low as $16.375 as recently as Nov. 23.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Teams Up for New Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., criticized for misjudging the  
importance of the Internet in its earliest days, is joining a 
research effort to build the formative stages of the next 
generation of the worldwide computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft becomes the latest corporate partner of the  
Washington-based University Corporation for Advanced Internet 
Development, which is coordinating the research among more than 150 
universities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's involvement, along with a minimum pledge of $1  
million, was expected to be announced Wednesday. Other partners 
already include IBM Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called Internet2, is aimed at creating an  
ultra-fast, experimental computer network with speeds 45,000 times 
faster than the best telephone modems people now use to surf the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to see is the high-bandwidth applications become  
heavily used,'' said Rick Rashid, vice president of Microsoft 
Research. ``The goal here is to create a spawning ground for new 
ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fast network is used solely by academics and other  
professional researchers, with no way to let home users dial in. 
But its benefits are expected to trickle down to consumers in just 
a few years, as experts discover ways to use unprecedented data 
transmission speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's relatively early investment in the project stands in  
contrast to the company's failure to predict the significance of 
the commercial Internet until late in 1995, when Chairman Bill 
Gates announced in an industry speech: ``We're hard-core about the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. had already  
established a foothold with its popular Web browser, foreshadowing 
the ``browser wars'' between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's research offices, at its campus outside Seattle,  
will be physically hooked up to the network through the nearby 
University of Washington, which is already connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Van Houweling, president of the group organizing  
Internet2, noted Microsoft's expertise designing software 
applications and operating systems, which allow computers to 
communicate over data networks. The company's Windows software runs 
most of the world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is a major presence,'' Van Houweling said. ``We very  
much want to work together with Microsoft to make sure that every 
place it makes sense, their directions and our directions fit 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry rivals and the government have accused Microsoft  
of exerting too much influence over the commercial Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft and Internet2 officials, including some other  
corporate partners, said there was no risk that the software giant 
will unduly influence the next Internet in ways that benefit only 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to share research, share ideas before  
they become battlegrounds for products,'' Rashid said. ``It gives 
everybody the opportunity to learn together, to move the state of 
the art together faster than if we were working independently. ... 
It's our intention to work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's program director for Internet technology, Michael Nelson,  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet2 is a research program,'' he said. ``This is a very  
different activity than a product development effort. I don't think 
there's any concern here, and we're very excited that Microsoft is 
coming to the table.''

<HEADLINE> Cutler Named Top Salmon Strategist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Tuesday named Lloyd  
Cutler, an enduring legal powerhouse in the nation's capital, to be 
a top strategist in troubled salmon talks with Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler, 81, has served in five administrations, including as a  
special counsel to Clinton in 1994 and counsel to President Carter 
in 1979-1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian officials welcomed the appointment because it  
``demonstrates the seriousness with which the U.S. takes the 
Pacific salmon talks,'' said Michael O'Shaughnessy, a spokesman for 
Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Salmon Treaty, which governs the sharing of salmon  
stocks that swim through Canadian and U.S. waters, took effect in 
1985 but has been in limbo since 1994, when catch-sharing 
provisions expired. Attempts to renew the treaty have foundered on 
disagreements between Canada and individual U.S. states, especially 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler said in an interview Tuesday that he is simply responding  
to the White House's call for help ``one more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get asked by the White House do to something, you do  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he has a personal interest in the salmon issue -- he  
has two children and four grandchildren living in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Study: Teens Relying on Local Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Newspapers are the No. 1 source of local news  
for teen-agers, and second only to television as their source of 
the advertising, according to a study of young readers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers are heavy media consumers, according to a survey of  
teens 12 to 17 years old by the Newspaper Association of America. 
In 1,200 interviews done for the survey in 1998, 69 percent of 
teen-agers claimed to have read or looked into a local daily 
newspaper in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-six percent listened to the radio, 90 percent watched  
local TV, 80 percent used magazines, and 44 percent used the 
Internet during the last week. The poll report didn't give a margin 
of error. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked which medium best educates them about the local  
community, 62 percent of the teen-agers identified newspapers. 
Television was chosen by 21 percent, and radio, magazines and 
Internet by small percentages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must capitalize on every possible advantage in the area of  
local news,'' research director Anne Billups told publishers at the 
NAA's national convention Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers' interest in the news is strongest for local subjects  
and those relevant to their lives. High school sports, college and 
pro sports, fashion, health and fitness, and local community news 
were identified by teens as the most important subjects to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their interest in advertising is strongest for entertainment;  
followed by CDs, tapes and videos; music; clothing and electronics, 
the NAA study found. Television was the top advertising source for 
teens, followed by newspapers, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers were last among all types of media when teen-agers  
were asked what media are most interesting, exciting, enjoyable or 
entertaining.

<HEADLINE> CAI Wireless, MCI Affirm Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CAI Wireless Systems has agreed to an offer by  
MCI WorldCom to be purchased for about $483 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, MCI announced a tentative agreement to purchase CAI  
for $24 a share. However, in the agreement announced late Monday, 
CAI set the price at $28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom has been the only major telephone company without a  
stake in the lucrative and rapidly growing market for wireless 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI Wireless has been seeking a partner since it emerged from  
bankruptcy protection in October 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI operates six analog-based wireless subscription video  
systems in New York City, Rochester and Albany, Philadelphia, 
Washington, D.C., and Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI also owns wireless channel rights in Long Island, Buffalo  
and Syracuse, Providence, R.I., Hartford, Conn., Boston, Baltimore, 
Md., and Pittsburgh. In addition, CAI owns 94 percent of CS 
Wireless Systems Inc., a wireless operator based in Plano, Texas.

<HEADLINE>  Judge: Let Autistic Girl Play Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An 18-year-old autistic girl who ``dreams  
of earning an athletic letter'' must be allowed to play softball 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Garr M. King means that  
Anna Inskip can take the field today for the Astoria High School 
junior varsity game against St. Helens High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the judge's ruling is only a preliminary injunction,  
school officials said they might accept the judge's order 
permanently. ``I think we have enough guidance from the court to 
move ahead,'' school Superintendent Larry McMacken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Inskip, a junior, tried out for the junior varsity team  
this spring. She was not cut and officials let her practice, but 
they would not allow her to play in scrimmages or games for fear 
that her autism might cause her to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	She has participated in basketball, swimming and horseback  
riding in the Special Olympics. Her mother, Mary Young, said in a 
compliant filed April 16 that her daughter ``dreams of earning an 
athletic letter.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Weighs $13 Billion in Kosovo Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Senate Republican said today he is  
drafting a bill that would double President Clinton's $6.05 billion 
request to pay for the fighting with Yugoslavia and the resultant 
refugees. House Republicans prepared a similar measure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who chairs the Senate Appropriations  
Committee, said his measure would cost up to $13 billion. He said 
it would provide more than Clinton wants for the conflict, plus 
additional money to improve military benefits and beef up U.S. 
readiness worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact on military readiness of the pace of operations in  
and around Kosovo is significant, and those funds must be 
replenished,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens made his comment at a hearing at which Clinton  
administration officials defended the president's smaller request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration package does protect military readiness in  
the Balkans and around the world,'' said White House budget chief 
Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Monday, House Republicans prepared a $12.9 billion bill  
that also provides far more for the Pentagon than Clinton 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican plans position them as outdoing Clinton and  
congressional Democrats on defense spending, long a GOP priority. 
Though some partisan clashes may occur, many Democrats will 
ultimately be reluctant to oppose additional military funds at a 
time when American troops are in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans would spend billions more than Clinton for  
military compensation, construction, procurement, spare parts, 
maintenance, training and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked the military ... what they needed for their mission,  
for Kosovo and for their overall mission,'' said Rep. David Hobson 
of Ohio, a senior Republican on the Appropriations panel. ``What 
you see is a result of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats criticized the GOP for expanding the measure beyond  
the costs of the campaign against Yugoslavia, contending the 
additions amount to a ploy to help Republicans skirt tight spending 
limits in place for next year. They also accused the GOP of 
politicizing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this is structured so Republicans will try  
to paint anyone who votes against them as not being sufficiently 
supportive of the war effort,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, 
top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ``That's absolute 
nonsense. The president asked for every dime necessary, and our 
position is the troops should get every dime they need for the 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton, Republicans would pay for their bill by declaring  
an emergency, which under budget law would allow it to be financed 
using this year's expected $111 billion federal surplus. That 
surplus comes entirely from Social Security, which is collecting 
far more revenue than it is spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the chief differences from Clinton's request, the  
House GOP bill would provide: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.8 billion to improve military compensation, with details to  
be provided in future legislation. The president's proposal did not 
affect troops' pay or retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--$831 million for military construction, chiefly in Europe.  
Clinton made no such request. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.3 billion more than Clinton sought for spare parts, $927  
million more than Clinton for maintenance, $156 million for 
recruiting efforts, $300 million for training and $351 million for 
operations at military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Republicans would spend $566 million to help  
refugees and nations housing them, although the GOP would spend 
more than Clinton for the refugees and less for the countries to 
which they have fled.

<HEADLINE> Carradine Sues Time Warner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Kung Fu'' actor David Carradine and wife  
Marina Anderson didn't think much of a Jan. 11 write-up in People, 
so they sued for libel and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses People parent Time Warner Inc. of violating  
a ``gentleman's agreement'' for a ``nice'' story in exchange for 
the couple dropping a lawsuit against another of Time Warner's 
subsidiaries, Who Weekly in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, People wrote of alleged substance abuse and called  
Carradine ``washed up,'' ``unemployable'' and ``a drunk.'' The 
story also falsely stated that he was ``court-martialed out of the 
Army,'' said the couple's attorney, Neville L. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner magazine chief Norman Pearlstine met personally with  
the couple and ``profusely apologized'' for the Who Weekly piece 
that called Anderson a porn star, according to the lawsuit filed 
Monday. He had promised that a nice story on the Carradines would 
be done for People or Entertainment Weekly, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left Tuesday for Time Warner spokesman Ed  
Adler weren't immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Try To Solve Joseph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Vanbiesbrouck sits at his locker and  
shares thoughts on great playoff goaltenders. Ken Dryden comes to 
mind. So do Billy Smith and Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Vanbiesbrouck doesn't mention him, a new name is being  
added to that list in the series between the Philadelphia Flyers 
and Toronto Maple Leafs. Curtis Joseph is a big reason -- maybe the 
biggest -- that the Maple Leafs are in control of this series 
heading into Game 4 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at the guys that won and had the most influence  
on why they won,'' said Vanbiesbrouck, the Flyers goalie whose 
playoff prowess is being questioned as the Maple Leafs lead the 
series 2-1. ``In my eyes, probably a guy like Patrick has had as 
much influence as Billy. I think Billy's probably the guy that 
battled the hardest, and you could learn the most from. He stood up 
for what he believed in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph has been standing up to pucks in this series. Lots of  
them. He stopped 40 of 41 shots Monday night as Toronto beat 
Philadelphia 2-1. The odds already were against the Flyers when 
Eric Lindros was lost with a collapsed lung late in the season, and 
they're really up against it now. Philadelphia is 5-11 in 
seven-game series in which it has trailed 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned,'' Vanbiesbrouck said. ``We're down 2-1. It's  
not like we're not concerned. ... With momentum, you either grab it 
or you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With verbal sparring between Philadelphia coach Roger Neilson  
and Toronto coach Pat Quinn and vicious checks by Kris King and 
Steve Thomas in Game 2, these teams seemed to dislike each other 
more every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	But the burgeoning rivalry degenerated into a racial controversy  
when Philadelphia's Sandy McCarthy accused Tie Domi of using a 
racial slur. The NHL announced Tuesday that it cannot substantiate 
McCarthy's claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that will hopefully blow over,'' Domi said.  
``I've played with black guys in the league and I respect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most successful method of seizing momentum involves rallying  
around a hot goaltender, preferably one with an intimidating name 
like Cujo. His whole aura, from breathtaking saves to the rabid dog 
that adorns his mask, seems to have the Flyers shaking in their 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's my take on goaltending?'' said Joseph, asked about his  
electrifying style. ``I don't know. You play the percentages, 
maybe. Sometimes, the puck hits you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia was 0-for-5 on the power play in Game 2, including  
a comically inept two-man advantage in the first period. With 
Toronto's defense cowering in a three-man triangle in front of 
Joseph, the Flyers barely managed a scoring chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps unsure of themselves on offense without Lindros, several  
players had chances to skate in on goal and timidly backed away. 
</P>
<P>
	When they did get shots -- all 41 of them -- Joseph was stopping  
them every which way. His chest, glove, stick, shoulder and the tip 
of his skate all seemed to be part of the goal. He was showing 
everyone why the Maple Leafs signed him for $6 million last summer. 
Philadelphia got Vanbiesbrouck for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Cujo's game, playoff hockey,'' said Thomas, who  
incensed the Flyers with a hard check on Eric Desjardins in Game 2 
before scoring the game-winning goal Monday night. ``He proved it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers find themselves in a strange quandary. They've  
dominated much of the series, but are in danger of spiraling to a 
second straight first-round ouster if the Maple Leafs win Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanbiesbrouck held Toronto scoreless for the first 118 minutes  
of the series, but allowed two goals in the final two minutes of a 
2-1 loss in Toronto on Saturday. The two goals he allowed in Game 3 
were very weak -- Mike Johnson slid one between his skates on a 
partial breakaway, and Thomas flicked one of the right shoulder of 
a barely moving Beezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhat surprisingly, Vanbiesbrouck has a 27-36 playoff record  
with a goals-against average approaching 3.00. If there was ever a 
time to prove he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the 
other postseason greats, this is it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody would like to win a championship for your career to  
be complete,'' Vanbiesbrouck said. ``But there's a lot of great 
guys up there that had great careers that didn't win any. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure if you go to ask them, what's the one thing that  
you'd like to have, they'd probably sacrifice a lot of the stats 
for a championship.''

<HEADLINE> Vero Beach Trying To Keep Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida lawmakers voted Tuesday to try  
to make sure the Los Angeles Dodgers don't leave Vero Beach as 
their spring training site after more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Senate unanimously voted to send to Gov. Jeb Bush a  
bill setting aside $7.5 million to help Vero Beach buy the Dodgers' 
training facility, fix it up and lease it back to the team. The 
House had already passed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers first started coming to Florida for spring training  
51 years ago, when they were still returning to Brooklyn for the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	But like Los Angeles lured the Dodgers west, Fort McDowell,  
Ariz., near Phoenix, has offered the team a new spring facility, 
and Vero Beach needed to upgrade its stadium to entice the Dodgers 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers currently own the park and are the only team that  
trains in Florida that owns its own facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would allow Vero Beach and Indian River County to use  
local tax dollars to buy the complex and fix it up. The state would 
throw in $7.5 million over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokeswoman, Nicolle Devenish, said the governor hasn't  
taken a position yet on the bill (CS HB 519). 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit of the Dodgers being here is pretty obvious. It  
generates millions of dollars for the city,'' said Vero Beach Mayor 
Art Neuberger. He said he was pleased lawmakers recognized that 
importance and the extra money would help the city try to convince 
the team to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The local chamber of commerce estimated the team was worth more  
than $30 million to Vero Beach and lawmakers said 400 jobs might be 
at stake if the team moved west. Some tourists travel to Vero Beach 
just for the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I know there's a lot of  
them here,'' Neuberger said. ``People from the northeast who used 
to follow the Brooklyn Dodgers come down.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.Com Buys 3 Internet Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Online retailer Amazon.com has been doing some  
Internet shopping of its own, separately purchasing three privately 
held firms for $645 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon also announced plans Monday to enter the electronic  
greeting card business, further expanding the options available 
from its site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company said it will purchase Exchange.com, an  
online marketplace for rare, antiquarian and used books and music; 
Accept.com, an e-commerce company in Redwood City, Calif.; and 
Alexa Internet, another e-commerce company based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon said the Exchange.com acquisition will greatly increase  
its core book and music offerings and create auction and retail 
space for Exchange.com's independent dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange.com operates Bibliofind.com, which has more than 9  
million used and antiquarian book listings, and MusicFile.com, 
which offers more than 3 million recordings and music memorabilia 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	All three acquisitions are expected to close by June 30.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, Amazon said it will offer more than  
800 cards in 45 categories, all without charge or registration, 
some geared to annual occasions such as ``Kiss Your Mate Day,'' 
``Moment of Laughter Day'' and ``Hairstylist Appreciation Day'' -- 
all which take place this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the company's first completely free service and the first  
time Amazon has offered a product created in-house. 
</P>
<P>
	As with most e-cards, Amazon's offerings are designed for  
Internet viewing rather than for printing and mailing, said David 
Risher, senior vice president of product development. Card senders 
can design their own messages to accompany hundreds of 
illustrations, photographs and animations. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting card Web sites have proliferated in recent years. Many,  
like Hallmark's hallmark.com, charge as much as $2.50. Others, like 
industry leader Blue Mountain Arts of Boulder, Colo., charge 
nothing and try to make money from online advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's e-card site, accessible by link from the company's home  
page, also will be available at http://www.cards.amazon.com.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs New Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buyers of explosives would be subject to the  
same Brady law background checks as gun purchasers under new 
gun-control legislation President Clinton will unveil today. 
Negligent parents would also be held liable when their children 
commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his omnibus crime package, the president is renewing  
measures that died in the last Congress and is counting on outrage 
over the Colorado school shooting to push them through this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospects are good,'' White House press secretary Joe  
Lockhart said Monday. ``Unfortunately, oftentimes it takes tragic 
events to catalyze work here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional sources said White House officials were working  
late Monday on the explosives provision, which would aim to treat 
the sale of explosives the same way gun sales are treated under the 
Brady law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proposal, ``explosives'' would refer to dynamite,  
blasting caps and the like, not materials that can be blended into 
a volatile mixture. In Littleton, Colo., the student killers used 
homemade hand grenades and pipe bombs in their rampage through 
Columbine High School. In Oklahoma City, two tons of explosive made 
from commonplace fertilizer were used to blow up the federal 
building in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., praised Clinton's initiative  
cracking down on explosives but wondered if it was a problem too 
loosely defined to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about propane gas tanks and agricultural  
chemicals, I'm anxious to see how they define the component parts 
of this,'' Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, aides said, also is proposing:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory child-safety locks on all guns sold.  
</P>
<P>
	--Extension of an existing ban on juvenile possession of handguns  
to include semiautomatic assault rifles; also a ban on importation 
of all ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, an 
extension of current law banning imports of those made since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales.  
</P>
<P>
	--A lifetime ban on gun ownership for people who commit violent  
crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	--A three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with an  
additional two days if law officers need them to complete their 
investigation. Until last year, the Brady Act provided five days 
for police to conduct background checks on buyers if they needed 
that much time. Now, it limits them to three days, but most checks 
are instantaneous. Never before has there been a minimum, mandatory 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory prison sentences of three to 10 years and $10,000  
fines for adults, including parents, who allow children access to 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime is  
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to 
occur,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He added that the 
legislation's standard of reckless conduct would be ``a difficult 
standard to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised this provision long before the Littleton  
shootings and it is not meant to suggest that those killers' 
parents should be blamed, Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin championed a more limited liability -- for situations  
where a gun owner shows negligence by not safely storing firearms -- 
that garnered just 31 votes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Durbin said, ``with presidential leadership and  
public support, I think this Littleton, Colo., tragedy can 
galvanize the majority we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, who represents South  
Dakota, where guns are popular among ranchers and sportsmen, was 
skeptical about passing any new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that gun legislation is what we need,'' Daschle  
told reporters Monday. He suggested the school shootings were a 
societal problem stemming from parental and teacher neglect and 
violence in the media and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things we better be looking at,''  
Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democratic senator, Charles Schumer of New York, said he  
wants to plug an Internet loophole that allows gun buyers to 
circumvent the Brady law. ``The firepower that can be acquired 
simply by going online is chilling,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal would allow only licensed gun dealers to have Web  
sites trading in firearms, require those dealers to register with 
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and provide 
that all private transactions be handled through a licensed gun 
dealer to assure the waiting period and background checks mandated 
by the Brady law.	   Andrew Molchan, director of the National Association of 
Federally Licensed Gun Dealers, said the 7,000 gun dealers he 
represents support a lifetime ban on gun ownership for anyone who 
commits a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Clinton's package, Molchan said, ``is an  
unfortunate diversion and, in our view, a dangerous diversion that 
takes energy, time and thought away from the real issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody doesn't decide to walk into a school and murder  
several people because of lack of a gun lock or something,'' he 
said. ``It's a horrible, profound, moral issue.''

<HEADLINE> Sugar Futures Hit 14-Year Lows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures posted new 14-year lows Tuesday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as Brazil prepares to harvest a 
bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, natural gas rose, while orange juice futures  
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar prices have been in a virtual freefall the last few weeks  
amid signs global output may be even larger than last year's record 
world crop. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report from the American attache to Brazil, the world's  
largest sugar producer, predicted that country will begin in May to 
harvest a crop of 19 million tons, up from last year's record 18.3 
million tons. That would add to already ample supplies in storage, 
which have seen few takers amid monetary problems in Asia and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, another large producer, also was set to market a bumper  
crop, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make the situation worse, officials in Thailand, the world's  
fourth-largest grower, recently boosted local cane prices to 
support farmers there. That, however, likely will lead to increased 
planting, investors speculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for July delivery tumbled .18 cent, or 3.2 percent, to  
4.17 cents a pound. That was the lowest since June 1985, when it 
reached record lows of 2.3 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rocketed higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid fears there will not be enough supplies on hand to 
meet demand for the summer cooling season. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices have moved higher in past days following the  
American Gas Association's inventory report that showed a 
relatively slow pace of storage fills. 
</P>
<P>
	While natural gas demand for the winter season was weaker than  
normal, some companies saw unexpectedly strong demand because of 
cold snaps that have lasted into the early spring. That has put 
them behind of replenishing supplies going into the warm weather 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities buy natural gas to turn turbines that generate  
electricity, which in turn powers air conditioners and fans. Some 
companies now are buying natural gas on the spot cash market to 
cover their positions after mistakenly believing prices would fall 
as the weather got warmer. 
</P>
<P>
	May natural gas rose 3.2 cents to $2.331 for each 1,000 cubic  
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures fell sharply on the  
New York Board of Trade in a round of profit-taking following 
recent sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said the market remains fundamentally  
strong, however, amid a spell that has brought little rain to 
growing regions in Florida, the nation's largest citrus-growing 
state. A prolonged dry, hot spell could sharply reduce next year's 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	July orange juice fell 4.4 cents to 83.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Port Security Agency To Be Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is creating a  
special commission to study crime and security on the nation's 
docks and suggest improvements to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will be similar to one the administration created  
to study airport security, said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who 
suggested the new commission, which will bear his name. President 
Clinton will announce formation of the Graham Commission on Seaport 
Crime and Security on Tuesday, the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently ports handle 95 percent of the nation's trade. Over  
the next 15 to 20 years, cargo and passenger trade is expected to 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Graham's office said: ``Unfortunately, our port  
management systems are decades behind the rest of the world and 
decades behind our own airport management systems. Seaports have 
also become a nexus for problems of crime -- drugs, auto and cargo 
theft, illegal immigration -- and food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretaries of transportation and the Treasury, Rodney  
Slater and Robert Rubin, and Attorney General Janet Reno will head 
the commission.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Decries Gun Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaking as forcefully as her husband, Hillary  
Rodham Clinton led off the speakers at Tuesday's White House 
announcement of new gun-control legislation. ``It is criminal how 
easy it is for children in America to obtain guns,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who is considering a run for Senate in New York,  
was first on the White House program held one week to the day after 
the shootings at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton led her husband and an assembly of lawmakers in a  
moment of silence for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides said President Clinton's menu of new  
restrictions on gun, ammunition and explosives sales was in the 
works long before the Littleton, Colo., deaths. But in extensive 
remarks preceding her husband's, Mrs. Clinton linked the 
administration's initiative to the nation's outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us here are searching for answers to what happened in  
Littleton. I don't know that anyone will ever be able to explain 
fully the events of a week ago. Nor, I doubt, can we create a 
perfect set of solutions that, if followed, would have prevented 
what happened at Columbine High School,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that does not mean that we are either hopeless or helpless  
in the face of this tragedy. ... There are some tough things we 
must be willing to say, and some tough steps we must be willing to 
take if we are to stop the violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who, along with her husband, has close friends in  
the Hollywood community and has often tapped them for political 
contributions, lambasted popular culture for the way it -- through 
TV, movies, songs, video games and Internet sites -- ``romanticizes 
and glorifies violence.''

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Bilking N.J. Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A man with a history of preying on  
clergy admitted Tuesday he persuaded a priest to give him $1.4 
million in church money by falsely promising he would invest it, 
then lost it all gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Riggio faces a maximum nine years in prison when he is  
sentenced in June. Riggio, who pleaded guilty to two counts of 
theft by deception, has already spent 14 months in jail awaiting 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggio, 52, called Msgr. Federick Valentino, pastor of St.  
Bonaventure Church, in October 1996, and pretended to be a new 
parishioner who was $20,000 in debt to loansharks, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the money, Ryan called again, saying it would be  
difficult to repay it, but out of gratitude he would get the church 
a great investment through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Posing as Tom ``The Banker'' Barracus, Riggio persuaded the  
priest to continue sending cash to New York, supposedly for the 
great investment, until his arrest in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The scam came to light in December when Valentino tried to  
withdraw $30,000 in cash from a parish account. Fearing the priest 
might be an extortion victim, bank officials refused to allow the 
withdrawal without first notifying the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggio, who said he lost the money at Atlantic City casinos and  
at racetracks in New York, has pulled other scams in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted nine years ago in New York of bilking 52  
priests out of $130,000 by pretending to be a needy parishioner. He 
spent two years in prison on the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	After that he cheated a youth baseball league in Newburgh, N.Y.,  
of $80,000, paying his restitution in that case with money he took 
from St. Bonaventure, prosecutor Robert B. Leaman said.

<HEADLINE> Side Effects Limiting Chemotherapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side effects may prevent up to one-fifth of  
breast cancer patients from getting the full-strength dose of 
chemotherapy needed for their best chance of survival, says a study 
of the medical records of 15,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors prescribe the right amount, but may lower the dose  
mid-treatment or postpone chemotherapy sessions when women suffer 
serious side effects, the research found. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings may surprise doctors unaware that some efforts to  
ease side effects could have a larger impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a newer combination of chemotherapy drugs could  
give patients a better chance at tolerating the full dose, contends 
Dr. Garrett A. Smith of the University of California, San 
Francisco, whose patients were among those the study analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study should change practice patterns,'' he said.  
``Physicians all over the country who use the older (chemotherapy) 
regimen had a terrible time staying on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Project ChemoInsight was performed by Amgen Inc., which makes a  
treatment for a chemotherapy side effect called neutropenia -- a 
loss of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to 
serious infection. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is ``adjuvant chemotherapy'' given after breast tumors  
are surgically removed. Previous studies have found that the women 
who fare best receive at least 85 percent of the chemotherapy 
``dose intensity'' -- proper dose received during a certain amount 
of time. But side effects can prevent that. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen nurses gathered medical records from hundreds of  
oncologists to see how often that happens. About 20 percent of 
patients got less than optimal dose intensity, concludes data to be 
presented at an Oncology Nursing Society meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Neutropenia was the main culprit that prompted dose limiting.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are visiting doctors whose records were analyzed to  
discuss how their patients fared. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said his patients did well, and credits a newer  
chemotherapy cocktail known as AC, for adriamycin-cyclophosphamide. 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors believe AC is harder to tolerate than an older  
cocktail called CMF, but Smith said Project ChemoInsight found CMF 
patients were more likely to be undertreated because of side 
effects. He will present details at an oncology meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claudine Isaacs of Georgetown University in Washington,  
D.C., called the project important for illustrating what really 
happens to treated patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There certainly is a perception out there that AC is more  
toxic,'' said Isaacs. The study suggests ``in fact it's easier to 
give ... on time and at the dose intended, and that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She already tells patients that AC causes more nausea, but new  
anti-nausea drugs largely control that. AC also causes more hair 
loss than CMF and about a 1 percent risk of heart toxicity, but 
lasts just three months. CMF takes six months, causes mouth sores, 
diarrhea and may increase risk of premature menopause.

<HEADLINE> House Heads for Showdown on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Congress is ready to double  
President Clinton's request for $6 billion to help pay for the 
conflict with Yugoslavia, but a showdown looms on the House floor 
over his authority to widen the military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to meet at the White House today with lawmakers  
from committees that deal with defense and military spending to 
discuss costs of the escalating battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a measure backed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and other Republican leaders to require Clinton to receive 
congressional approval before deploying ground forces in Yugoslavia 
awaits a floor vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the only thing that is likely to pass,'' said House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other proposals, one demanding withdrawal of U.S. troops  
from the region, the other for a declaration of war against 
Yugoslavia, were expected to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration opposes the Republican advance-approval  
measure as an unnecessary restriction, even though it has said it 
does not plan to dispatch ground troops. The ground option is being 
reviewed by NATO's military commanders, however, and the United 
States is sending more troops and equipment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans readied legislation Tuesday that  
would double Clinton's $6.05 billion request to pay for the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee planned a vote Thursday on a  
$12.9 billion package for the fighting, refugees and worldwide 
Pentagon needs, including a 4.4 percent pay raise for troops. 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was 
drafting a similar measure totaling nearly $12 billion that his 
panel might vote on next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday it will call 33,102 reservists to  
active military duty, beginning immediately with 2,116 members of 
the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard to help in aerial 
refueling of NATO warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ended talks  
in Moscow on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, the Russian mediator for the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians did not indicate any major changes in their  
position,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must  
withdraw his Serb-led forces from Kosovo, permit the return of 
ethnic Albanians to the province and accept an armed international 
force of peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly objects to NATO's bombing campaign and to the  
idea of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary William Cohen  
indicated little interest in putting a peacekeeping force, in the 
event one is formed, under the command of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be an international peacekeeping force that is  
NATO-led and, at the core, NATO must be involved in its 
management,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were encouraged that representatives of  
the International Committee of the Red Cross had a second, longer 
visit with three U.S. soldiers being held in Belgrade as prisoners 
of war. The three were examined by a doctor, but the results were 
not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the administration's advice, a delegation of U.S.  
religious leaders led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson planned to leave 
today for Yugoslavia to meet with the three Americans and try to 
secure their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends it needs no congressional approval  
to prosecute the military campaign against Yugoslavia, which began 
March 24. Many lawmakers contend the conflict violates the War 
Powers Act of 1973, which requires the president to obtain 
congressional approval if he keeps troops in combat for more than 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at war,'' Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said, ``and  
Congress has not declared that. And that is unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House International Relations Committee voted 30-19 on  
Tuesday against a resolution by Campbell requiring Clinton to bring 
troops engaged in the military campaign home in a move that set up 
a showdown on the House floor today. Campbell invoked a provision 
of the War Powers Act that requires a vote by the full House.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Proves Destructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Proving more destructive than expected, the  
Chernobyl virus caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns 
around the world, though the effects were far worse overseas than 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	While experts were still tallying numbers, Turkey and South  
Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged Monday, and there 
were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. Officials said 
warnings there weren't heeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arguably, this is the most malicious computer virus,'' said  
Dan Schrader, director of product marketing at Trend Micro Inc., 
which manufactures antivirus software. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts disagreed over whether it was the most destructive  
virus ever. But many were caught off guard by the amount of damage 
and said it was much worse than the Melissa virus early this month. 
Before Chernobyl hit, several experts were quoted as saying they 
didn't expect it to cause much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States suffered far less than other nations, and  
experts credited widespread warnings and updated antivirus programs 
with helping avert problems in the corporate world. Home users were 
hit harder. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 student computers were wiped out at Princeton  
University about two weeks before term papers were due. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives  
were rendered useless,'' Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boston College, the virus affected only those students who  
did not install antivirus software distributed by the university 
last fall, spokesman Jack Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Pollak, spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response Team  
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said there were 
reports of at least 2,328 computers damaged in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the numbers could be higher, since no company or computer  
user is required to report a virus attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to have originated in Taiwan and attacks  
Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers. A company unknowingly 
distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet. 
When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other 
files on their hard drive. If an infected program was sent in an 
e-mail, the virus was passed on to the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turkey was caught unprepared,'' said Mustafa Ucoklar, an  
electronics engineer in Turkey, where the virus infected computers 
at banks, an airport and state-run radio and TV stations, according 
to Turkey's Radikal newspaper. ``The warnings were there, but 
nobody took any notice of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials also reported about 300,000 computers  
were hit in government offices, schools and businesses -- about 4 
percent of the nation's computers -- in the worst attack of its kind 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this  
virus,'' said Ahn Byung-yop, vice minister of information and 
communications. ``We need to strengthen our alert system and public 
education on computer viruses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader said the countries hardest hit have widespread use of  
pirated software and lack recent virus software. Chernobyl's 
existence has been known since last summer, and every major 
antivirus software package can detect and protect against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Melissa virus last month served as a ``very effective  
wakeup call'' in the United States, Schrader said. Many U.S. users 
aggressively updated their software and began to take computer 
viruses seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elsewhere it wasn't taken as seriously,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In India, at least 10,000 computer owners reported being  
infected. Businesses, banks and publishing houses in India were 
shut down and information worth millions of dollars was lost, the 
Indian Express newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that up to 10 percent of all computer users  
in the United Arab Emirates were affected; at least 10,000 
computers were struck in Bangladesh; reports in China varied from 
7,600 computers damaged to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the country's worst computer disaster,'' said Ahmed  
Hasan, general secretary of the Computer Society in Bangladesh.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A woman was sentenced to 10 years in prison  
for scalding her 8-year-old stepdaughter and leaving her untreated 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangie A. Innocent, 29, had pleaded guilty to aggravated abuse  
and causing great bodily harm. She was sentenced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Ms. Innocent beat the girl, Tekayiaha, with a

</P>
<P>
	Tekayiaha suffered second- and third-degree burns on more than  
30 percent of her body last August and had two broken hands. Her 
injuries went unreported for a week before the girl's grandmother 
noticed them. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cuban Bank Chief Touts Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare visit to Washington, the Cuban  
Central Bank president today outlined austerity measures Cuba has 
imposed since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- steps that in some 
ways parallel those often recommended by the pro-capitalist 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	President Francisco Soberon said subsidies to state entities  
have been reduced by 75 percent and that 19 state ministries and 
other national agencies have been shut down, almost 40 per cent of 
the total. In addition, Cuba has become far more hospitable to 
foreign investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba is one of an extremely small number of countries that do  
not belong to the IMF and its companion institution, the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But Soberon, nonetheless, came here as an observer for the  
semiannual meeting of the two institutions. He attended meetings 
Monday of an IMF subgroup of 24 developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Soberon spoke today before a group of bankers, academics,  
government officials and others at a session organized by three 
local private research groups. 
</P>
<P>
	He described how Cuba was forced to undertake a series of  
reforms in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main 
partner in trade and assistance. He said the number of independent 
farmers has increased to the 100,000 range and that Cubans who 
engage in once-forbidden self-employment total about 150,000. The 
budget deficit, he added, has been reduced to 2.5 percent of the 
total budget compared with more than 30 percent five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department normally does not grant visas to Cuban  
officials but makes an exception for those wishing to attend 
meetings of multinational institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. law requires the president to take steps to block any  
Cuban bid to join the IMF or the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Soberon said he's not sure whether Cuba has any interest in  
joining. He said the IMF generally offers the same formulas to all 
countries, regardless of differing situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of doubts about their policies,'' he said.  
``Each country requires a different approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Cuba would feel uncomfortable in an institution,  
such as the IMF, in which the United States has 15 percent of the 
voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggested that the IMF is insensitive to the social  
costs of its economic reform policies. The IMF has been known, he 
said, to claim success even though its policies have led to 
unemployment rates of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like someone to explain to me how you can have success  
with 17 percent unemployment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Opponents Calling Mailman 'Dirty' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone has always said he's not out  
to hurt anybody. It's just that fewer and fewer people around the 
NBA believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest victim is Joe Kleine, who needed 30 stitches and  
plastic surgery after Malone's elbow reconstructed his face Monday 
night. Afterward, Malone made no apologies for sending another 
opponent to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I play,'' Malone said. ``It's the way I'm going  
to play until I'm finished playing. That's just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz forward is having another standout year as the  
leading scorer on the team with the league's best record. But it's 
his trademark physical -- many call it dirty -- play that's getting 
the most attention as the regular season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	With a string of controversial incidents in past weeks, Malone's  
growing reputation as a bully might be the only thing that could 
prevent him from winning a second Most Valuable Player award. 
Ballots aren't due until the end of the regular season, and the 
growing backlash against Malone's tactics could sway a number of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's that possibility,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``But  
Karl isn't going to change what he does. He's just a very tough 
player, and he's not trying to do what happens sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kleine's lower lip might disagree. It was split nearly in two  
when Malone, who was going up for a shot, smacked Kleine in the 
face with his elbow. Malone ran to the other end of the floor, but 
Kleine followed him and gave Malone a hard shove in the chest, 
leaving a bloody handprint on Malone's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were divided on the incident after the game, with  
former Jazzman Chris Morris saying the elbow ``looked pretty 
vicious'' and Rex Chapman doubting it was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Karl does this stuff intentionally, he's the best disguise  
artist ever,'' Utah's Bryon Russell said. ``He wasn't trying to get 
anybody. He was just going up for a shot. Why would he want to get 
Joe Kleine?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kleine returned to Phoenix and won't be with team for the last  
two games of its road trip, Suns spokesman Scott Leightman said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, Malone is still a fearsome physical specimen, as he  
showed when he took off his bloody jersey on the court Monday 
before running to the locker room to change. He hasn't missed a 
game because of injury since the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's everybody else that seems to end up with a limp, a lump or  
a laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	But what were once isolated incidents around Malone have become  
more commonplace in recent years. Malone's history of controlled 
violence goes back to 1991, when he leveled Detroit's Isiah Thomas 
with an elbow that opened a 40-stitch cut above the point guard's 
left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone claimed the collision was unintentional, but he was  
suspended for a game without pay, one of the strongest disciplinary 
actions in league history at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I'd been shot in the head,'' Thomas said then.  
</P>
<P>
	Malone has been suspended twice in the last 12 months, and he  
could be facing a third stint on the bench after the Kleine 
incident. The league hadn't issued any ruling by Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't even the first time Malone had knocked a Phoenix  
center out of the lineup this year. Luc Longley missed seven games 
after hyperextending his left knee in a collision with Malone on 
April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked pretty bloody flagrant to me,'' Longley told the  
Arizona Republic after viewing a tape of the incident. ``There's a 
fine line between trying to draw a foul and going straight for 
someone's leg. It looked like he went for my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mailman's rap sheet over the last year is extensive. Malone  
threw what league officials called a punch at Houston's Othella 
Harrington in an April 11 victory over the Rockets and was 
suspended for Utah's next game. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 12 at Portland, Trail Blazers forward Jermaine O'Neal  
suffered a mild concussion when hit in the forehead by Malone's 
elbow late in Utah's 91-77 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Malone was suspended for a game after he knocked  
the Spurs' David Robinson out cold with another errant elbow. In 
announcing the suspension, the NBA's Rod Thorn said that although 
the league felt the elbow hadn't been intentional, ``players have a 
responsibility not to recklessly swing their elbows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: The latest incident won't change the way  
Malone plays. He scored his 28,000th point several weeks ago, and 
the Jazz won't have a shot at their first title if the Mailman 
stops delivering points or hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is the reason we're where we are in this league,'' John  
Stockton said. ``He's the epitome of the Utah Jazz.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They came with children in strollers,  
dogs on leashes and tears in their eyes. Some carried flowers, 
others brought signs and some walked quietly, empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	But they came.  
</P>
<P>
	By the thousands they came, to share their grief and their hope,  
to try to make sense out of something so senseless. Footprints upon 
footprints as young and old, those from near and those from far 
away, huddled Monday around a makeshift memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother grasped her daughter's hand, a father held onto his  
son's shoulder. Some cried, clutching each other. Others, red-eyed, 
stood quietly reading the outpourings that came from all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see all the people here,'' said Kenneth Dodson,  
whose niece, Linda, was married to David Sanders, the coach and 
teacher who died saving the lives of his students as two teen-age 
gunmen rampaged through Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen killed Sanders and 12 of their classmates before  
killing themselves in the massacre April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just came from David's funeral this morning and I think  
this helps,'' Dodson said. ``It's better to get it outside. It's 
hard when you keep it inside. This is a way to get it outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It started with 23 red tulips that were placed at the foot of a  
tree near the school shortly after the shootings, one tulip for 
each person believed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the number of dead shrank, the memorial grew.  
</P>
<P>
	Piles of flowers and banners, stuffed animals and paintings,  
cards and poems now cover the area the size of a football field in 
the corner of Robert F. Clement Park, which embraces Columbine High 
School on its eastern edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pictures and banners are smeared by rain and snow, some  
placed carefully in plastic covers. The messages are of simple 
love, peace and hope, others are eloquent poems. One issued a 
warning, ``SILENCE LEADS TO MORAL DECAY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen white crosses stand at one edge of the memorial, the  
victims' names carefully scripted on them in blue. A stone statue 
of the Virgin Mary is in front of them, a sea of flowers, stuffed 
animals and cards around them. People stop here, some pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 240-acre park there are remembrances for the  
victims, the students, the community. Flowers and messages are 
strung along the fence that surrounds the tennis courts next to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	A paper chain of bright colors and kind words is looped through  
the branches of the trees that line the main street near the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're very special to us,'' is written on one paper link.  
``I'm so very sorry,'' says another. 
</P>
<P>
	A snow angel is surrounded by candles, poems, cards. A  
dark-haired little boy kneels down and carefully takes a piece of 
paper out of a manila folder and places it near the angel. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the family of Cassie Bernall. We love you guys,'' it says  
in black ink. 
</P>
<P>
	A teen-ager uses a white candle to light the wicks of those  
whose flames have been extinguished by the wind. Off to the side a 
young man sits huddled, his arms clutching his knees as his friends 
try to console him. A young girl's sobs are audible. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims' vehicles have become shrines themselves.  
Notes and flowers cover Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's beat 
up brown Chevy pick-up. 
</P>
<P>
	John Spahlinger, the park superintendent who put loads of hay  
and woodchips around the edges of the memorial worn away by feet 
and rain, estimated at least 10,000 people visited on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said John Bryant, who drove from Phoenix on  
Sunday to be with the community in Littleton. ``It shows the need 
for answers. On the news, every time you turn around, it's `Why?' I 
think this helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Sternfeld, a photographer who captured communities'  
reactions to tragedy in ``On this Site: Landscape in Memoriam,'' 
agrees.

	``Going to where it happened gives you something to do with your  
feeling of helplessness,'' he said. ``Here is this indescribable 
tragedy, and unless you're a neighbor or a family to one of those 
people who lost their lives, what is there for you to do? If you go 
there, you can grieve with others.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in Favor of Valhol Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A judge Tuesday awarded the owner of  
Arkansas Derby winner Valhol the $300,000 first-prize money, 
clearing the way for the gelding's entry in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The distribution of the winner's share from the April 10 race at  
Oaklawn Park had been put on hold while stewards investigate 
whether jockey Billy Patin used an electrical device to make Valhol 
run faster. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of a check for $300,000 was faxed to a lawyer for Valhol  
owner James D. Jackson of Rockdale, Texas, by a deadline set 
Tuesday by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Sam Laser of Little Rock said the original check from the  
Oaklawn Jockey Club at Hot Springs would be picked up Wednesday in 
time to meet the Kentucky Derby deadline to enter Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won,'' Laser said after receiving the copy of the check and  
learning of the state's decision not to appeal the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Laser said that, after Jackson learned of the judge's decision,  
``he got teary-eyed. He said he can start feeling good again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of the winner's share from the April 10 race had  
been put on hold while stewards investigate whether jockey Billy 
Patin carried an illegal electrical device aboard Valhol in the 
race at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had argued that withholding the money would deny his  
horse a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to run in the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the money from the Arkansas Derby, it appeared Valhol  
wouldn't have enough earnings to qualify for one of 20 spots in 
Saturday's race at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Petitioner is entitled to the winner's share of the purse for  
the Arkansas Derby in the amount of $300,000,'' Pulaski County 
Circuit Judge John Plegge wrote. He gave the Arkansas Racing 
Commission one hour to pay Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of whether Patin used the electrical device still must  
be decided at a stewards' hearing by Oaklawn Park officials on May 
5. If stewards conclude that Patin used the device, they would seek 
the return of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the $300,000, Valhol ranked 24th in earnings. With the  
money, the horse ranked 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for entries for the Kentucky Derby is Wednesday. If  
Valhol runs in the Derby, Patin would not be the jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Freeland, an attorney for the Arkansas Racing Commission,  
had urged the judge not to release the $300,000. ``If you put that 
horse in the Kentucky Derby, that horse is tainted,'' Freeland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plegge, while admitting that he knew nothing about horse racing,  
expressed sympathy toward Jackson's predicament. At one point, he 
said to Freeland, ``You have absolutely no evidence that the owner 
has done anything wrong'' and yet the state is denying him a chance 
to get in the Kentucky Derby.

<HEADLINE> Breaking-News Guidelines Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Local broadcasters are being urged to develop  
their own blueprints for covering a big breaking story like the 
Colorado massacre, with an emphasis on doing everything to avoid 
putting lives in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	News directors and general managers at more than 1,800 TV and  
radio stations will receive guidelines in the mail this week on how 
to handle these news emergencies from the Radio and Television News 
Directors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group hopes station operators develop plans or at  
least talk about what they would do if thrust into the national 
spotlight like Denver broadcasters were last week when two gunmen 
killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't plan for everything,'' Barbara Cochran, RTNDA  
president, said Monday. ``You couldn't plan for a situation where 
kids hiding in a school would have cell phones. What you can do is 
have a dialogue in the newsrooms ahead of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's KUSA-TV was criticized for broadcasting a cell phone  
conversation with a Columbine student before the massacre had 
ended. Critics said the caller's life could have been endangered if 
a gunman had heard where the student was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters should always assume that a hostage taker or  
terrorist has access to their reporting, the suggested guidelines 
say. And stations should not divulge police tactics or SWAT team 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	News directors should ask themselves if the value of a live  
report on a hostage-taking situation ``is really justifiable 
compared to the harm that could occur,'' the guidelines say. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Boston-area TV stations have agreed to voluntary rules for  
covering such situations, including no live footage of victims or 
SWAT teams. In several communities, like Portland, Ore., and Tampa, 
Fla., broadcasters have self-regulated the use of news helicopters 
after negotiations with local police. 
</P>
<P>
	The RTNDA guidelines also call on stations to show care in  
interviewing family members of victims, ensuring that such 
conversations are ``not simply conducted for the shock value of the 
emotions conveyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps learning from past disasters, TV networks appeared in  
Colorado to seek out interviews of people who really wanted to 
talk, said Av Westin, a former ABC executive and now a Freedom 
Forum fellow at the Media Studies Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Westin is working with networks and local broadcasters to  
develop a ``fairness handbook'' for television journalists. Due by 
the end of this year, the handbook will deal with live coverage of 
events and questions surrounding hidden cameras, sourcing and other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is increasingly seeing that television is arrogant,  
television is pushy, television has cameras stuck in people's 
faces,'' he said. ``The public is beginning to regard the 
television as much an enemy as they used to regard a corrupt 
government.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks Compromise on Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate struggled Tuesday to come up with  
legislation that would prevent courtroom fortune-seekers from 
taking advantage of the Year 2000 computer problem without taking 
away the rights of those with genuine legal grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	The seriousness of the so-called Y2K issue was made clear on the  
other side of the Capitol, where health care experts told a House 
hearing that there were real concerns that biomedical equipment -- 
from dialysis machines to heart defribillators -- will not be ready 
on Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chief sponsor of the Y2K litigation  
measure, said he had made major concessions to Democrats wanting 
assurances that the bill wouldn't be used to fundamentally weaken a 
citizen's right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	But a final compromise eluded the negotiators, and McCain warned  
that the bill was on the verge of being ``compromised into 
meaninglessness.'' Complicating the issue were Democratic threats 
to attach amendments dealing with other issues such as the minimum 
wage and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation co-sponsored by McCain and Sen. Ron Wyden,  
D-Ore., would give companies up to 90 days to fix computer problems 
before a lawsuit can be filed, encourage mediation, cap punitive 
damages in most cases at three times compensatory damages or 
$250,000 and make it harder to file class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to stop a deluge of lawsuits arising from breakdowns  
occurring from computers that mistake the year 2000 for 1900. Some 
experts say this litigation could dwarf asbestos, breast implant, 
tobacco and Superfund environmental clean-up litigation combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Without congressional action, McCain said, ``the judicial system  
will be overrun and the nation's economy will be thrown into 
turmoil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, led by Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., claimed the bill  
was a business-inspired effort to weaken tort law and consumer 
rights to legal protections. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet some of the objections, McCain agreed the bill would be  
in effect for only three years and there would be no punitive 
damage caps when the defendant is the victim of intentional fraud 
or injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said their latest version also restores liability for  
company directors and officers and made other changes that were 
pro-consumer and pro-plaintiff. Other issues were still being 
worked out with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the Democrats' 
leading expert on the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In a House Commerce subcommittee hearing, the head of the agency  
that oversees Medicare said she was confident there would be no 
disruptions in billing and payments in the new year. But a greater 
unknown, said Health Care Financing Administration Administrator 
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, is patient care and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Willemssen of the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, agreed that Medicare, after getting 
off to a slow start, was finally confronting computer problems, but 
that local health providers were far more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually everything in today's hospital is automated, he said,  
and with eight months left to make sure that computers won't 
malfunction, ``the level of progress is not reassuring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Corlin of the American Medical Association said it's  
difficult to gauge the level of work on the Y2K problem because the 
industry is so fragmented and only a small percentage of doctors 
have responded to surveys. But ``if the studies are correct, 
malfunctions in noncompliant systems will occur and equipment 
failures can surely be anticipated.''

<HEADLINE> 200 Arrested in Car Theft Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI began a coast-to-coast crackdown on  
auto theft Tuesday with more than 200 federal and state arrests 
aimed at small organized rings in 22 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the arrests spanned the nation, more than 100 were in  
the San Antonio area. Federal and state agents rolled up separate 
theft rings, of five to 25 members, that stole cars to order, for 
chopping into parts or for shipment overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Later phases of Operation Sudden Stop are expected to produce  
additional arrests in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that the auto theft rate is declining -- down  
3.8 percent in 1997 and 16.5 percent since 1993, FBI Assistant 
Director Thomas Pickard said the recoveries of stolen vehicles also 
are down and only 14 percent of auto thefts result in arrests, 
``the lowest success rate for any major crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard attributed the low arrest rate in part to the FBI's  
``lack of focus on it due to violence in the cities.'' He noted 
that in the early and mid-1990s, the FBI and state and local police 
shifted agents from interstate theft work to high priority 
operations against violent street gangs and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, organized criminal groups turned their attention  
to interstate thefts, particularly motor vehicle theft,'' Pickard 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 1.4 million vehicles, worth $8 billion, were stolen and  
nearly 447,000 were never recovered. Pickard said the FBI and 
Customs Service estimate that 200,000 of these were shipped 
overseas for resale. 
</P>
<P>
	For millions of victims, the theft of a car is painful,  
expensive and inconvenient, Pickard said, but he noted these crimes 
``have an adverse effect on every insured driver through increased 
insurance rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI worked in task forces with the Customs Service; the  
National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit insurance industry 
group; and state and local police and U.S. attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	They used surveillance, informants, wiretaps and even set up  
undercover storefronts to buy stolen parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard said they found rings whose members came from  
traditional 1930s organized crime groups and others made up 
primarily of Russian or Asian organized crime figures. ``Many rings 
stand along ethnic lines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rings steal expensive cars to order for clients. Others  
serve chop shops that break the cars down for resale as parts. Some 
put new vehicle identification numbers on cars and ship them to 
other states for sale. Another batch ships the cars abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to San Antonio, authorities said arrests had  
occurred or were expected in the following cities: Cleveland; 
Columbia, S.C.; Detroit; Houston; Indianapolis; Las Vegas, Nev.; 
Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Mobile, Ala.; Oklahoma 
City; Salt Lake City; San Diego; San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
Springfield, Ill.; St. Louis; Tampa, Fla.; Pittsburgh; Omaha, Neb.; 
Sacramento, Calif.; and Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Announcement Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On Sunday, John Elway's football career will  
officially end, brought down by the sort of physical ailments that 
dog many 38-year-olds, let alone one who has been pounded for 16 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen confirmed Monday that Elway was  
leaving football because he ``felt in his own mind that he had some 
physical problems he didn't think he could overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamstring, back and rib injuries caused the usually durable  
Elway to miss all or part of six games last season. Of more 
concern, however, was a troublesome left knee. Elway played with a 
brace on that knee throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Limping around a golf course in California last weekend, he  
admitted he eventually will require an artificial knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen said a news conference to announce the retirement,  
already delayed several times, will be held Sunday at a time and 
location to be determined later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be very sensitive to the families involved in the  
Columbine (school shooting) situation,'' Bowlen said. ``We wanted 
to make sure we did not in any way interrupt the grieving process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Sunday probably is the time when we could put  
this tragedy behind us, and perhaps John's press conference could 
be received as sort of a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's Denver Post, Elway left no doubt about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he told the newspaper. ``I  
seriously considered coming back, but I just couldn't make it 
because of my knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen was in Australia nearly two weeks ago, promoting his  
team's Aug. 6 preseason game there, when he received a telephone 
message from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got the message, I knew what it was about,''  
Bowlen said. ``I called him back and basically it was a short 
conversation. He said, `Pat, I've decided to retire and go on with 
the rest of my life.' I told him I respected his decision and was 
really happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I couldn't get back until the following week, we  
originally decided to announce it on Wednesday (April 21). With 
what happened at Columbine (April 20), that was very much not 
appropriate. And it was just a matter of time before the press 
figured out what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, who said he will retire Elway's No. 7, insisted he would  
not lower his expectations for the two-time Super Bowl champions 
this season, despite the loss of the Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``John will be missed, for sure,'' Bowlen said. ``But our  
expectations are going to be the same. I think we've got a very 
solid football team. Bubby Brister is going to play well, and, of 
course, we have Terrell Davis and many other very good players on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had John come back for another  
year. I'd love to see him three-peat, do something that no other 
quarterback has done in history. But that wasn't to be. So we'll go 
forward. We'll be fine. I think we'll be a good football team, if 
not a great football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership void left by Elway's exit might be harder to  
overcome, Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves to talk about the comebacks and all the rest  
of those things, but there is much, much more to John's 
participation on this team than that,'' he said. ``His physical 
accomplishments are unparalleled, but my biggest concern right now 
is the man that John was -- the guy he was in the locker room and 
the stability he brought. Losing that is going to be difficult for 
us, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Bill Romanowski said he saw the retirement coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when he came back, he said that definitely was going  
to be his last year,'' Romanowski said. ``You have to believe what 
he said. In my mind, it's always been official. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl last year, John's  
intensity was unbelievable. I've never seen him like that. He 
wanted that game so badly. You just knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several other teammates, even when confronted with the  
evidence of Elway's decision, were in a state of denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to hear it come out of his mouth before I believe  
it,'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said. ``I just can't imagine 
football, much less the Broncos, without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, ``Until I hear it from him, he's still on the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, Elway's heir apparent, was reluctant to discuss his new  
status until the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, he does retire, I'm going to miss him,'' Brister  
said. ``Nobody will ever be John Elway. If he does retire, I hope 
we can keep the machine rolling.''

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Focusing on Web Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Once the nation's biggest toy retailer,  
Toys R Us Inc. is shooting to regain dominance -- if not on the 
sales floor, then on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus-based company hopes to leapfrog past eToys into the  
top spot among online vendors of toys, clothing and other 
children's products by the fall, the all-important holiday shopping 
season, chief executive officer Robert C. Nakasone said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will turn its Web sales operation into a separate  
subsidiary called toysrus.com, build a large distribution center in 
Memphis, Tenn., and possibly sell stock for the unit. Toys R Us 
will also take on a venture capital firm as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can see this, over time, becoming an important business for  
us,'' Nakasone predicted. ``We're going to be No. 1 in e-commerce 
in toys and children's products for the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison said  
that goal is feasible, given the company's name recognition and 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're late (focusing on e-commerce), but it's good  
that they're doing it now, and they have a strong chance of being 
successful,'' McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also seemed happy with the plan, pushing shares up  
$1.25 to $23.06 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us was passed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. as America's top  
toy retailer last year. It still claims to be the world's biggest 
retailer of children's products, with $11.2 billion in annual 
sales, but the company reported a $132 million loss last year 
because of a $508 million charge for store closings and 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has operated a Web site for nearly two years, but  
until last June it only supplied company information such as store 
locations. After beginning to sell toys on the Web, Toys R Us saw a 
jump in online visitors -- including a surge so strong during the 
holiday season that the Web page had to be taken down for a few 
days -- leading to the decision to improve the site, Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides making it easier to navigate and improving graphics,  
Toys R Us will also add some e-mail options, including notifying 
customers when out-of-stock merchandise again becomes available or 
reminding patrons when relatives' birthdays are coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	While Internet toy sales are only expected to total $52.6  
million this year, or 0.2 percent of all U.S. toy sales, those 
revenues are expected to increase tenfold to about $555 million in 
the next three years, according to Ken Cassar of New York-based 
research firm Jupiter Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any national retailer that does not embrace the Web will be  
missing significant opportunity and potentially risk watching their 
market share drop,'' Cassar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Mattel, the world's biggest toymaker and one  
of Toys R Us' biggest suppliers, announced that it would spend $50 
million to launch an Internet sales venture called Mattel.com in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Toys R Us subsidiary handling the Web sales will be  
located somewhere in Northern California's Silicon Valley, but a 
site has not been chosen yet. The improved site, which will also 
sell merchandise from the company's Kids R Us and Babies R Us 
clothing stores, should be operating by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Benchmark Capital of Menlo Park, Calif., the Silicon Valley  
venture capital firm that helped bankroll such Internet successes 
as the online auction house eBay, will partner with Toys R Us in 
the new venture and is making an undisclosed investment. 
</P>
<P>
	McGowan said the partnership gives Toys R Us ``access to smart  
people with good technology faster than they would have gotten 
there on their own.'' The plan to offer shares will help attract 
workers from the Silicon Valley looking for lucrative options on an 
Internet stock, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us operates 1,488 stores worldwide, down from its peak of  
around 1,500, according to company spokeswoman Rebecca Caruso. The 
current stores include 703 U.S. toy stores, 455 international toy 
stores, 212 Kids R Us children's clothing stores and 118 Babies R 
Us stores.

<HEADLINE> Oilers' Weight Suffers Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Doug Weight, the Edmonton Oilers' top  
center, was cut in the mouth and given a concussion after he was 
accidentally kicked in the face by a teammate's skate just five 
minutes into Tuesday night's playoff game against the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured when the Stars' Jere Lehtinen slammed into the  
Oilers' Ryan Smyth near the penalty box. Smyth's skate came up, 
cutting Weight's mouth. The accident resulted in 34 stitches and 
the concussion for Weight. 
</P>
<P>
	He was helped off the ice with a bloody towel wrapped around his  
mouth like a scarf and was taken to hospital on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a troubled season for Weight. He missed the first half  
of the season with a knee injury. He came back to finish sixth in 
team scoring with six goals and 37 points. He has scored one goal 
in the Dallas series. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Weight was another big blow to the Oilers' offense.  
Their top scorer, Bill Guerin, is playing just two weeks after a 
knee injury and Josef Beranek is out with a pulled stomach muscle.

	ROME (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti has lost a court battle and must  
pay $2.5 million in back taxes, according to news reports Tuesday.

	The tenor, said to be one of the world's highest paid  
entertainers, had argued that his official residence is in the tax 
haven of Monte Carlo. But an appeals court ruled Monday that he 
spends most of his time in Modena here in Italy, so he must pay the 
taxes required of a resident.

<HEADLINE> World Tunes in for Ellington 100th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This city of presidents is turning its  
attention to a duke as jazz lovers and historians observe the 
centennial of the birth of one of America's most prolific 
composers, Edward Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	The talents of Ellington, who put the country ``In a Sentimental  
Mood'' and implored folks to ``Take the A Train,'' are the focus of 
lectures, performances and other special events in the capital and 
around the nation. Most of the events are tied to his birthday, 
April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Kennedy Center in Washington and the Lincoln Center in  
New York have scheduled numerous concerts honoring Ellington. Other 
tributes include lectures at the Juilliard School, a series of 
ballets to his music by the New York Ballet and music festivals at 
venues from Iowa to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is starving for Ellington projects and Ellington  
works and Ellington evenings,'' said Mercedes Ellington, a 
choreographer who also has arranged works to her grandfather's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the interest may be attributed not only to the 100th  
anniversary of Ellington's birth but to the recent resurgence of 
swing dancing. Ellington enthusiasts, however, say it's mainly 
because people -- like the judges who awarded him a Pulitzer Prize 
this year -- are finally appreciating the Duke's genius. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulitzer board said Ellington's body of work ``evoked  
aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of 
jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the greatest all-around musician this country has  
produced,'' said John Hasse, an Ellington biographer and the 
American music curator for the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has produced a number of superb composers,  
many great band leaders and conductors, brilliant arrangers and 
orchestras and virtuostic soloists and accompanists,'' Hasse said. 
``But Ellington did all of those things and did them brilliantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington lived in Washington until his early 20s. He formed two  
of his earliest bands, Duke's Serenaders and The Washingtonians, 
here before moving to New York. There, he rose to fame during a 
time when radio had burst onto the scene and the recording industry 
was burgeoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington absorbed everything around him -- sound, ideas, images,  
colors, textures -- and channeled the sensations into his 
compositions, which included jazz, gospel and Big Band swing, as 
well as ballet and film scores and Broadway show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	He composed most of his music on a small Wurlitzer piano that  
accompanied him on tours and he nearly always wrote for the 
personalities in his orchestra, the Duke Ellington Band, rather 
than for specific instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``My band is my instrument even more than the piano,'' Ellington  
once wrote. ``I'm something like a farmer. He plants his seed and I 
plant mine. He has to wait until spring to see his come up, but I 
can see mine right after I plant it. That night. I don't have to 
wait. That's the payoff for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he died May 24, 1974, Ellington had published about  
2,000 compositions, but he wrote much more than that. Among his 
archives preserved at the Smithsonian are 200,000 pages of 
documents -- about half of which are unpublished music. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine acquiring a hundred thousand pages of  
unpublished Beethoven music?'' Hasse said. ``It's just incredible. 
I regard the Ellington collection as one of the Smithsonian's crown 
jewels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he died 25 years ago, Ellington continues to attract  
new fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``His stuff is not dated,'' Ms. Ellington said. ``People are  
still humming those tunes. ... It's just as new today as it was 
before.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Exec Urges China Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The liberalization of China's  
telecommunications industry will increase demand for 
microprocessors and boost electronic commerce in one of the world's 
largest markets, a senior executive of U.S. computer giant Intel 
Corp. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	James Jarrett, president of Intel China, said China Telecom's  
virtual monopoly over fixed lines was keeping telecommunications 
and Internet costs high, creating a barrier to profits in China's 
Internet sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the Internet service providers in China are not making  
money,'' Jarrett told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Line costs will come down once China Telecom is broken into  
parts, leading to lower Internet costs and spurring sales of 
computers and the microprocessors that drive them, Jarrett added. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks will improve and spread, driving ``the critical mass  
that gets e-commerce going,'' said Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use in China has soared in recent years. Users topped  
2.1 million in 1998, a fourfold growth in a year, and another 1.5 
million accounts are expected to be opened this year.

<HEADLINE> Pa. High Court Mulls Teen Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The state's high court is considering  
whether a woman violated Pennsylvania law when she accompanied a 
13-year-old girl to New York for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa M. Hartford was convicted in 1996 of interfering with the  
custody of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, whose stepson had been dating the girl, accompanied an  
adult neighbor who drove the girl and a teen-age friend to an 
abortion clinic 60 miles away in Binghamton, N.Y., in August 1995. 
Hartford also paid for the procedure with money supplied by her 
stepson, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	An appellate court ordered a new trial on the grounds that  
jurors received improper instructions from the judge, a ruling the 
state attorney general's office has appealed. Meanwhile, Hartford's 
attorney asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to examine 
constitutional issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, doctors may perform an abortion on a minor only  
if a parent or guardian consents to the procedure, or a judge rules 
that the child can decide on her own. But New York state's more 
permissive law allows minors to give informed consent to an 
abortion without parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing before the high court on Monday, state Attorney  
General Mike Fisher argued that Hartford interfered with the rights 
of the girl's mother to make medical decisions for her child. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violation is against the parent,'' Fisher said in an  
interview. ``The parent is the victim, and it's interfering with 
custodial right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford signed in at the clinic as the girl's stepmother and  
paid for the procedure, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	But an attorney for Hartford said the woman did not violate the  
law because she made no decisions on behalf of the girl, who is at 
least five years younger than Hartford's stepson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no participation whatsoever by Mrs. Hartford in this  
minor's decision,'' attorney Marsha Levick of the Juvenile Law 
Center told the court. ``I think that's key, that's paramount in 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girl chose to have the abortion after talking with teen-age  
friends, Levick said outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Levick said Hartford's stepson provided money for the procedure  
to Hartford, although it was never proved that he impregnated the 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaware of her daughter's whereabouts on the day of the  
abortion, the girl's mother reported her as missing to police. The 
mother learned later that morning the girl was at the clinic but 
didn't try to contact her or tell authorities, Levick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police filed charges after an investigation, she said.

<HEADLINE> Delta Pilots Sue Over Commuter Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With talks on a new contract looming, Delta Air  
Lines pilots have gone to court to try to stop what they say is a 
``bad faith'' action by the carrier's management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, just a few months before Delta and ALPA (the Air Line  
Pilots Association) are scheduled to start negotiating a new 
collective bargaining agreement ... management has told ALPA that 
it intends for the first time to operate some Delta shuttle flights 
without using Delta pilots,'' said the pilots' complaint in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Friday in New York says Delta ``has acted in  
bad faith'' by making plans to use Comair regional jets and crews 
on some flights that begin June 1 between Boston and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Delta pilots adamantly believe that the Delta shuttle  
flying is unique to Delta Air Lines,'' said Karen McGuffey, 
spokeswoman for the union, which represents about 9,000 Delta 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said Monday that based on a  
preliminary review of the pilots' complaint, the carrier ``believes 
it is without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that Delta is using Comair to beef up its new nonstop  
service because the smaller carrier had commuter landing rights at 
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport supplementing Delta's own 
slots in the tightly controlled airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta will operate five roundtrip flights with its own Boeing  
727 aircraft and crews, while Comair will fly three roundtrips with 
regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit involves a concern common to pilots at many major  
airlines about the increasing use of small, regional jets. The 
issue will figure into negotiations on a new Delta pilots agreement 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue was going to be on the table one way or the other,  
and this use of Comair RJ's on expanded shuttle flying has become a 
lightning rod for this issue,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline 
analyst for PaineWebber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Buttrick said most recent major-airline contracts have included  
restrictions addressing pilot job-protection concerns about 
expanding use of regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots who command bigger salaries flying larger planes worry  
that increased use of regional jets will come at the expense of 
growth of the mainline fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became a sticking point during negotiations marked by  
a brief strike in 1997 by American Airlines pilots.

	School Shooting Probers Eye 3 Teens  
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are focusing on three  
camouflaged teen-agers apprehended shortly after the Columbine High 
School shootings as possible co-conspirators who may have planned 
to join the carnage, Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said 
today. Stone declined to name the men, who have been questioned but 
not formally named as suspects. The three, who knew the two student 
gunmen and had previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia,'' have maintained their innocence. While the drama unfolded 
on April 20, the three young men in dark jackets were first 
detained for questioning. The men carried no weapons.

	Cops Say Girlfriend Bought Guns  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators said today that Dylan  
Klebold's girlfriend bought at least two of the guns used in the 
Columbine High School massacre at a Denver area gun show last fall. 
Columbine senior Robyn K. Anderson was interviewed by investigators 
and released without charges being filed, said a spokesman for the 
Jefferson County sheriff's office. Authorities have not called 
Anderson a suspect, but Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone told 
the Denver Rocky Mountain News it was conceivable she knew what 
Klebold and classmate Eric Harris had intended to do with the 
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Former Coach Feels Sorry for Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Del Harris, fired as Los Angeles Lakers coach  
two months ago, says he feels sorry for his former players and 
assistant coaches as they struggle toward the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may think I take delight in them losing, I don't,''  
Harris said on ESPN's `Up Close,' to be aired Wednesday. ``It would 
be like taking four years building a bridge, and then they took you 
off the project. You wouldn't hope that the first trucker who goes 
over the bridge falls in the river because you have something 
invested in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was fired on Feb. 24 -- the day after the Lakers lost  
their third game in as many days to fall to 6-6. He taped ``Up 
Close'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, considered prime contenders for the NBA championship  
during this abbreviated season, have lost six of their last eight 
games to fall to 27-19. With the playoffs less than two weeks away, 
they're fifth in the Western Conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris told ``Up Close'' host Gary Miller he had intended to  
step down as Lakers coach at the conclusion of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The irony of all this is that I had determined in my vision we  
would win a championship, and I would leave Los Angeles in any 
case,'' Harris said. ``I expected to finish this project and then 
move on since they didn't extend me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was in the final year of his contract when the Lakers  
fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did get fired last year, they should have extended me last  
year along with West, Kupchak and Rambis,'' he said, referring to 
vice president of basketball operations Jerry West; general manager 
Mitch Kupchak and current coach Kurt Rambis. ``When they extended 
Kobe (Bryant), they should have done that with the coach as well, 
or they should have fired me, one or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant signed a six-year contract extension shortly after the  
start of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the Lakers ``hung me out to dry all summer,''  
referring to the fact that he wasn't offered a contract extension 
during the lockout.

<HEADLINE> NHL Faces Another Racial Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- When Sandy McCarthy and Tie Domi mocked each  
other with playful gestures and trash talk, it seemed like typical 
tough-guy posturing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy says it was much more than that, accusing Domi of  
uttering a racial slur during the playoff game between Philadelphia 
and Toronto on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dropped an N-bomb on me,'' said McCarthy, a Flyers forward  
who is part black and part native American. 
</P>
<P>
	Domi flatly denied the accusation and accused McCarthy of  
spitting in his face. The Maple Leafs defeated the Flyers 2-1, but 
the incident threatened to embroil the league in another racial 
controversy in the middle of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spit in my face, so maybe he was looking for some excuse,''  
Domi said. ``I would never use those kind of words, and he knows 
that. He can say what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL supervisor John D'Amico said he would immediately notify  
commissioner Gary Bettman and Colin Campbell, the league's 
disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll phone them and tell them exactly what has happened, and  
it's up to them on how they want to investigate,'' D'Amico said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke declined to say whether he  
would ask for an investigation, which would be the league's fourth 
in a little more than a year as it attempts to cope with race 
relations in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the league look into it? Yes,'' D'Amico said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before a faceoff in the second period, McCarthy and Domi were  
talking trash to one another. McCarthy switched sides to be next to 
Domi, and they continued jawing. 
</P>
<P>
	Domi mocked McCarthy by shaking his knees and motioning his hand  
as if to encourage McCarthy to keep talking. 
</P>
<P>
	At the next stoppage, Domi skated away from a tussle in the  
corner, and McCarthy motioned to Domi and flapped his arms like a 
chicken. Domi merely rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Domi used the slur before the faceoff, while Domi  
insisted that McCarthy spat on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just before the faceoff, and I turned to fight him and  
he wouldn't fight me,'' McCarthy said. ``You speak words like that, 
you better be ready to defend yourself. It's the first time it's 
happened to me in my career, and I think the NHL should do 
something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi, renowned for his talents as a pugilist, said he was under  
strict orders from Toronto coach Pat Quinn not to fight in the 
playoffs. Pressed on whether he said anything that could have been 
taken as racial, Domi said, ``Absolutely not. And he knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their whole bench saw him spit in my face,'' Domi said. ``I  
showed the linesman, and I left it on my face and I showed the ref, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials, including referee Paul Stewart, told McCarthy and  
D'Amico that he didn't hear what the players said or see anyone 
spit. Stewart declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was there some, say, saliva around his chest or face area?''  
D'Amico asked. ``Yes, there was. So now the thing is, we have the 
tape. We'll look at the tape and see if we can see some kind of 
conversation between the two in the second period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has investigated several accusations of racial slurs in  
recent years. McCarthy was involved in one of them. While with 
Tampa Bay in 1998, he and Darcy Tucker of the Florida Panthers were 
cleared of accusations they made racial gestures at one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Simon and Craig Berube, then teammates with Washington,  
were found guilty of using slurs in separate cases. Both were 
suspended. Shortly thereafter, the league announced a 
``zero-tolerance'' policy on the matter. Berube now plays for the 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Flyers, Chris Gratton was accused of calling  
Florida forward Peter Worrell, who is black, an ``ape.'' Gratton 
denied it, and the Panthers did not ask the league to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy is a native of Toronto, while Domi was born in Windsor,  
Canada. The two clearly dislike each other, and have fought before. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 0-for-5 against me, and he knows that,'' Domi said. ``I  
don't have to prove anything to him and I don't have to prove 
anything to my teammates. That's all that matters.''

<HEADLINE> Littleton Says Goodbye to Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He stood on the church stage, a stranger  
to the young man he was eulogizing, his voice wavering, his message 
simple: ``Thank you for saving my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Nick,'' the teen-ager said, looking out at hundreds  
of mourners crowding the church. ``I'm a senior at Columbine. I 
don't know Dan. ... I don't know his favorite color. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nick Foss did know Dan Rohrbough was a hero. Last Tuesday  
the 15-year-old freshman was shot as he held an exit door open for 
others so they could flee two teens on a shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough died on the sidewalk, just steps away from safety.  
</P>
<P>
	The service for Rohrbough was one of four held Monday for  
victims of last week's Columbine High School massacre. Three were 
for students; one was for teacher and coach William ``Dave'' 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more funerals were planned today, one week after the carnage  
in which Sanders and 12 students were killed. The two gunmen then 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rohrbough's funeral at Grace Presbyterian Church, the Rev.  
Dwight Blackstock commended the boy's selfless act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel guilty,'' he advised other teens who escaped thanks  
to Rohrbough. ``Thank God. Just thank God. And thank Danny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough's father, Brian, also spoke tenderly of his son, a boy  
who would save an entire year to buy Christmas gifts and loved 
computer games, cooking and tinkering with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking down at the casket, which included teddy bears and  
poems, his eyes misty, he said softly: ``Daniel Lee Rohrbough, in 
life and death, I'm proud of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, 2,500 people filled the sanctuary and two  
overflow rooms at the Trinity Christian Center to honor Sanders, 
who spent 24 of his 47 years at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire echoed through the school cafeteria, Sanders led  
students to safety until he was himself shot in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running around and I remember seeing him jumping over  
the chairs and yelling, 'Everybody get down!''' student Lindsay 
Dowling told mourners. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many 
other people's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sanders lay dying, students pulled out his wallet and held it  
open so he could see pictures of his wife and three daughters. 
``Tell my girls I love them,'' he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral, daughter Angela Sanders read a ``letter to  
daddy'' in which she said she'd always remember their talks on the 
porch. It contained a postscript: ``The girls and I would like you 
to know that we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sanders' 10 grandchildren, Austin Sanders, a preschooler,  
also spoke of his grandfather and how ``he always made good bedtime 
snacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At another funeral Monday, some 2,000 mourners gathered at the  
West Bowles Community Church to honor Cassie Bernall, the 
17-year-old girl who professed her belief in God just before she 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cassie's response does not surprise us,'' the family said in a  
statement. ``It was for her strong faith in God and His promise of 
eternal life that she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor George Kirsten told mourners, including rescuers who  
lined one wall of the church and received a standing ovation, that 
Cassie died a martyr. ``She went to the martyr's hall of fame,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people packed into the worship area of Foothills  
Bible Church at services for Lauren Townsend, an honor student and 
captain of the girls' varsity volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Townsend, 18, also was a member of the National Honor  
Society and a candidate for valedictorian 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family recalled a motivated, somewhat shy senior who  
wanted to become a biologist like her 25-year-old brother, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say that Lauren was a victim,'' he said. ``I don't  
think of her in that way. The ugly thing that happened last 
Tuesday, they couldn't conquer her beauty.''
