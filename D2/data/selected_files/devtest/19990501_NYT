ISLANDERS TURN TO GORING TO BRING BACK THEIR GLORY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Reeling from their fifth straight season
without making the NHL playoffs, the Islanders named Butch Goring
as their new head coach Friday and dismissed Bill Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Goring, 49, who was an integral member of the Islanders teams
that won four consecutive Stanley Cups in the early 1980s, became
the team's sixth head coach in five seasons, getting the job only
two days after he was contacted by Mike Milbury, the Islanders'
general manager. Greg Cronin and Lorne Henning will remain as
assistants to Goring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream come true,'' Goring said at Friday's news
conference. ``I can't say that a day has passed that I haven't
wanted to step into Al Arbour's shoes. I'm going to coach this team
the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   After Goring's playing career ended in Boston in 1985, he was
named the Bruins' head coach and led the team to the playoffs for
the 1985-86 season before spending the next 13 seasons coaching in
the minor leagues. Most recently he was the coach and general
manager of the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League, a
former Islanders farm club. He was twice named the IHL's coach of
the year, both times after guiding the Grizzlies to championships
in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After Milbury called Goring on Wednesday, Goring immediately
flew from Edmonton, Alberta, where he had been scouting the NHL
playoffs, to New York for an interview. Within 30 minutes on
Thursday, Milbury said, he and Goring had agreed on a three-year
contract worth about $1.5 million. Milbury had played for Goring
briefly in Boston and has worked closely with him in cultivating
the Islanders' minor league talent for the past four seasons.
Goring had declined an assistant's job with the Islanders last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of years we've had trouble getting some
stability,'' Milbury said. ``This should solve that problem. We're
glad to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch is the right person for a lot of reasons,'' Milbury
added. ``He has been a champion as both a player and a coach. He is
an excellent communicator who knows how to develop young players.
And just as important, Butch has Islander blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Goring was not the only shake-up in the Islanders'
front office Friday. The team also named John Sanders as team
president. He replaces David Seldin, who had not been associated
with the team since January. Bob Brennfleck was named as senior
vice president for hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   Goring, who was considered the final piece of the Islanders'
championship teams when he was acquired from the Kings at the trade
deadline on March 10, 1980, was a gritty center with soft hands. He
was not the most talented player on the ice, but he had a
tremendous work ethic. That work ethic is what Goring said he will
expect from his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play for me, you have to play at both ends of the ice,''
Goring said. ``Everybody can back-check.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement formally ended Stewart's brief coaching
stint with the Islanders, but his future with the team had been in
doubt for weeks. He was promoted from assistant to head coach on
Jan. 21 to replace Milbury, who had resigned to focus on his
managerial duties.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was 11-19-7 with an undertalented team, but he might
have doomed any chance he had of remaining as coach when, after a
loss to the Rangers on March 29, he questioned his team's talent
and management's commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call this morning, Stewart said that he did
not believe the disparaging comments factored into his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's an amicable parting, and we decided to
explore other options,'' said Stewart, who hopes to get another
head coaching job in the NHL. ``There's no surprise; it was done
earlier this week. It's a difficult situation, we all know that. I
want to explore my opportunities as the Islanders did also.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring faces a difficult challenge. He takes over a team that
was stripped down at the trading deadline and could lose more
important players by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some problems here in the past,'' Goring said.
``I'm trying to be part of the solution.'' &QL;

FOUR OFFICERS IN DIALLO CASE RETURN TO WORK; TRIAL SET FOR JAN. 3
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with
murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after
attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3
trial date was set.
</P>
<P>
   They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other
officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building.
</P>
<P>
   But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of
division.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might
make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward
McMellon. Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the
officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of
interest now since he was representing only one of them and might
be forced to cross-examine the others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I
don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious
that Kornberg would like for me to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth
Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working,
adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or
badges.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments
Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what
police officials called administrative assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused
defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose
the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time
to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible
pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling
conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in,
like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of
brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. That case is set to begin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic,
ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding
that more would be forthcoming. The judge said the next court
appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's
death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such
high-publicity cases. Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays
to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case,
which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's
efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, off the case. Kornberg said later that if
Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate
trial for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of severing the cases is important because the
defendants will probably need one another's testimony to
corroborate their accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired
at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _
were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and
another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.

GAS-OUT BOYCOTT HITS STATIONS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES AREA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Many Los Angeles motorists turned their backs on
oil companies Friday for the Great American Gas-out, a one-day
boycott of gasoline to protest high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I'm walking today in protest,'' said Mary Beth
Haskin, 28, as she walked her dog at the Sepulveda Basin recreation
area in Encino area of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way to get the message across: Don't drive; don't
take the bus. Use your feet _ then see what the oil companies do,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Friday, stations across the San Fernando
Valley were fairly empty as the grass-roots cyberspace campaign
gained currency among frustrated drivers and spread beyond
California to drivers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet oil company officials predicted the protest would not hurt
business or drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   For gas station owners, including George Dekermenjian, the
boycott was another blow, as they are squeezed by oil companies on
one side and drivers on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy. My business is down 60percent today. It's been
down 25 percent since the prices went up,'' Dekermenjian said,
searching for any sign of activity at his Encino Shell Station.
``We usually sell 6,000 gallons per day, but now we're down to
about 4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 12:23 p.m. at Dekermenjian's Shell _ usually when the
station bustles with customers _ but the pumps weren't pumping. The
register was silent. Steam billowed from a fresh pot of coffee
that's usually emptied during the lunchtime rush.
</P>
<P>
   He gazed across his lot and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high prices upset us, too, and the people usually get mad
at us. But we have no control over it,'' Dekermenjian said.
</P>
<P>
   With a gallon of gas reaching the $2-a-gallon mark in some
areas, drivers say they're tired of what looks like price-fixing
among the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer is investigating allegations of
price fixing and other reasons for the high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Customers at local stations numbered in the handfuls instead of
hundreds, but some drivers just couldn't afford to stay away from
the black gold. They slinked up to the pumps out of habit or
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these companies are holding us for ransom, but I had
to buy gas today,'' said Nicole Raymond, 29, of Encino, explaining
she has to drive 100 miles out of town every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stock in Alaska oil, and I could lose money, but I
really feel the effects at the pump. The prices must go down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some hadn't even heard about the gas-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have bought today if I knew about it,'' said
businessman Chris Travisano, who often drives across the country.
``The prices in California are the most outrageous I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs of protest were visible across Los Angeles. City
Councilman Joel Wachs, who spearheaded the gas-out effort locally,
joined hundreds of protesters at Florence and Normandie avenues
while trying to get motorists to avoid the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to fool ourselves. This protest won't have a
big impact on the oil companies,'' Wachs' spokesman Greg Nelson
said. ``But the whole idea is to start small and build momentum to
where we can really have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Some took advantage of the day to generate some publicity. A
Shell station in Van Nuys partnered with KABC talk radio (AM 790)
and gave away free gas throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much we will eventually give away, but I've
got 20,000 gallons here,'' owner Tony Dahabrea said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies agreed that the gas-out wouldn't have an impact on
their business and would not likely produce an oversupply of fuel
that would lead to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   They remained unconcerned because prices, they say, are set in a
competitive market over which they have little control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the consumers are trying to say they are frustrated,
and we hear that,'' said Tosco Corp. spokeswoman Julie Igo,
representing the state's Unocal gas stations. ``This is a free
market at work and hopefully soon prices will drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Arco spokesman Richard Verches said California's driving habits
and fuel consumption are too strong to be shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protest will not drive prices down _ the market will,''
Verches said. ``If drivers really want to make a difference, they
should shop for the lowest-priced gasoline so the other companies
will fall into line.''
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer opened an investigation
into price gouging by oil companies when premium prices approached
$2 after hitting a seven-year low of $1.14 in Northern California
in February.
</P>
<P>
   California's gas prices are usually among the nation's highest,
partly because of environmental laws requiring reformulated fuel.
Recent OPEC cuts in crude oil production, fires at California
refineries and heavy travel during the Easter holiday combined to
drive prices higher still, the oil industry claims.
</P>
<P>
   The average price in California for unleaded regular self-serve
gasoline is up 42 cents from last month, to $1.64 per gallon,
industry analysts said.

 &HT;    `The Force' is looming and stronger than ever
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is a great disturbance in the
Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
$115 million prequel to the phenomenally successful ``Star Wars''
trilogy launched 22 years ago, hangs over an awestruck America this
May the way the Death Star once loomed above the peaceful planet of
Alderaan. It opens May 19 in 3,600 theaters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait to be zapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a little hectic, but I'm going for sure,'' said
Andrew Costen, 12, a student at Boca Raton Middle School. ``I've
been a fan for awhile. I got into `Star Wars' when I was 9. I own
the original version and the special edition on video. I'm saving
my `Star Wars' toys as an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas bookmakers are laying 20-1 odds the movie will beat
the $92.73 million opening weekend box office record set by ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997. Wal-Mart has bought $500
million worth of ``Star Wars'' merchandise, everything from action
figures to pencils to toothpaste. Sixteen of the store's 36
departments will have something relating to ``Star Wars'' for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Toymaker Hasbro reportedly paid $600 million to Lucas for the
right to reproduce his characters. Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried
Chicken have signed agreements to bring out ``Phantom Menace''
paraphernalia. Yo quiero Darth Maul?
</P>
<P>
   About 20 local theaters will begin selling advance tickets _ one
dozen to the customer, to prevent scalping _ a week to three days
before the film opens.
</P>
<P>
   Many new characters to learn
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, at Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood
Boulevard, about 30 people have been queued up for weeks, waiting
to buy tickets on this sacred spot, where the first ``Star Wars''
premiered 22 years ago. Because ``The Phantom Menace'' will open
two months later in Europe, hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of fans
from the Old World are expected to wing to America to see it
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first ``Star Wars'' movie personally directed by Lucas
since the original in 1977, and the special effects are reportedly
mind-boggling: Only about one-ninth of the film involves scenes
with just plain human beings doing just plain acting in front of a
camera. Electricity and computer graphics seethe through the rest
of it in an ion-storm, unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will have even more strange, pixilated names to memorize:
chiefly Darth Maul, a multihorned demon with a double-bladed light
saber; Jar-Jar, Mace Windu, Rune Haako, Nute Gunray, Darth Sidious,
Boss Nass.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the first bits of the plot of the movie are common
knowledge, thanks to a large article by Time magazine's movie
critic, Richard Corliss. (Time promoted the original ``Star Wars''
as ``The Movie of the Year'' on its cover in 1977, although Corliss
himself found the original film's story ``bad pulp, and so are the
characters of hero Luke and heroine Leia.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of ``The Phantom Menace,'' which takes place about
40 years before the first ``Star Wars,'' a greedy Trade Federation
has imposed a trade embargo on the planet Naboo. Jedi master
Qui-Gon (pronounced Kwai-Gone), played by Liam Neeson, and his
youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan, are sent to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Naboo, they are joined by a comic figure, Jar-Jar, whose head
vaguely resembles a duck-billed hadrosaurus and who owes something
to J.R.R. Tolkien's glottally challenged character, Gollum, in
``The Lord of the Rings.'' Jar-Jar takes the two Jedi to Amidala,
queen of Naboo, and they prepare to escort her to the bejeweled,
Art Nouveau dream-city of Coruscant, capital of the
weak-but-still-righteous Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Engine trouble diverts the mission to Tatooine, where Qui-Gon
bargains for spare parts with Watto, a globular creature with
hummingbird wings. Watto's 9-year-old slave boy, Anakin, interests
Qui-Gon, who senses the boy's spiritual precocity _ a sure sign of
the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Immaculately conceived
</P>
<P>
   Catholics may raise eyebrows at Anakin's origin: His mother,
Shmi Skywalker, apparently conceived him immaculately, by a pure
union with the Force. He has no fleshly father.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Qui-Gon makes a bet with Watto: If Anakin should win
a pod race against the tarantulalike braggart Sebulba, Watto will
hand him over to Qui-Gon and the lad will be free to pursue his
destiny as a Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing 10-minute-long pod race sequence is said to be one
of the most eye-smacking highlights of the movie and goes clear
back to Lucas' boyhood dream of becoming a race-car driver.
</P>
<P>
   Anakin is destined to become the iron-lunged Darth Vader, the
evil Jedi seduced by the dark side of the Force, and the father of
Luke Skywalker, the hero of the 1977 ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all Lucasfilm is saying for now. For the rest of the
movie, you'll have to pay your $8.
</P>
<P>
   But Jude Watson, a Flamingo Park fiction writer, has already
seen the whole script. She had to. She was commissioned to write
``Queen Amidala's Journal,'' a sort of prequel to the prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Watson has been sworn to secrecy. Anyway, ``Queen
Amidala's Journal'' is just one tiny building-block in the enormous
``Star Wars'' mythos, that by now has expanded like the Big Bang,
thousands of years in every direction from the original movie
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The copy I had was specially coded, so that if I photocopied
it, they'd know. If I revealed any details, they'd kill my
grandmother. I'm joking!'' Watson said. ``But they are very
security-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Amidala's Journal'' took her two months' hard work to
write, and she never even met Lucas. ``It was all done by phone and
fax. They check every detail out in California, to make sure you
don't get anything wrong. It is a very meticulously worked-out
universe,'' Watson remembered.
</P>
<P>
   What is it like, living ``A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very liberating,'' Watson said. ``I had written books for
girls before. This time I had to put on my tomboy hat and put in a
lot of light saber fights. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she go to the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. Not the first day, but I'll be there. No free tickets,
though. I'll have to stand in line like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Camping out a penitent act
</P>
<P>
   University of Florida English Professor Andrew Gordon is so
fascinated by the ``Star Wars'' mythology that he has written a
paper on it, available at his Web site
(web.clas.ufl.edu/users/agordon). Gordon says the special effects
in the movies are brilliant, but the real appeal of the films is
their adroit use of myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call `Star Wars' a steam-powered starship. The
appeal is not really the high-tech gloss or the special effects.
Plenty of science fiction movies have been made with great special
effects, but nobody goes back to see them after 20 years,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, what we have is an old-fashioned and reassuringly
conservative universe, a universe that makes sense, where there is
clear good and evil _ and good triumphs. You've got very old types,
like the Wise Old Man, the Beautiful Princess, the Elves and Animal
Helpers, the Black Knight, and the Hero who stands in for the whole
culture and redeems us.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth and science fiction blur into a kind of religion, Gordon
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science fiction is very close to religion. The religion of
Scientology was founded by a science fiction writer, L. Ron
Hubbard. Science fiction is an attempt to answer the basic
questions of the universe: Why are we here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Similarly, there's a very strong religious component to `Star
Wars.' George Lucas himself has said that he came up with the idea
of the Force, to get young people thinking about God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say these people who are standing in line for weeks
and weeks to see the movie are performing a religious rite, a
penitential process of self-purification, to show their worthiness.
It's like climbing the mountain on your knees to gain wisdom. You
voluntarily put yourself through discomfort to demonstrate your
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   And will Gordon see the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, sure. Got to. But I'm going to wait until the furor
dies down. I'm not going to stand in line.

Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997. Wal-Mart has bought $500
million worth of ``Star Wars'' merchandise, everything from action
figures to pencils to toothpaste. Sixteen of the store's 36
departments will have something relating to ``Star Wars'' for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Toymaker Hasbro reportedly paid $600 million to Lucas for the
right to reproduce his characters. Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried
Chicken have signed agreements to bring out ``Phantom Menace''
paraphernalia. Yo quiero Darth Maul?
</P>
<P>
   About 20 local theaters will begin selling advance tickets _ one
dozen to the customer, to prevent scalping _ a week to three days
before the film opens.
</P>
<P>
   Many new characters to learn
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, at Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood
Boulevard, about 30 people have been queued up for weeks, waiting
to buy tickets on this sacred spot, where the first ``Star Wars''
premiered 22 years ago. Because ``The Phantom Menace'' will open
two months later in Europe, hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of fans
from the Old World are expected to wing to America to see it
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first ``Star Wars'' movie personally directed by Lucas
since the original in 1977, and the special effects are reportedly
mind-boggling: Only about one-ninth of the film involves scenes
with just plain human beings doing just plain acting in front of a
camera. Electricity and computer graphics seethe through the rest
of it in an ion-storm, unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will have even more strange, pixilated names to memorize:
chiefly Darth Maul, a multihorned demon with a double-bladed light
saber; Jar-Jar, Mace Windu, Rune Haako, Nute Gunray, Darth Sidious,
Boss Nass.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the first bits of the plot of the movie are common
knowledge, thanks to a large article by Time magazine's movie
critic, Richard Corliss. (Time promoted the original ``Star Wars''
as ``The Movie of the Year'' on its cover in 1977, although Corliss
himself found the original film's story ``bad pulp, and so are the
characters of hero Luke and heroine Leia.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of ``The Phantom Menace,'' which takes place about
40 years before the first ``Star Wars,'' a greedy Trade Federation
has imposed a trade embargo on the planet Naboo. Jedi master
Qui-Gon (pronounced Kwai-Gone), played by Liam Neeson, and his
youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan, are sent to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Naboo, they are joined by a comic figure, Jar-Jar, whose head
vaguely resembles a duck-billed hadrosaurus and who owes something
to J.R.R. Tolkien's glottally challenged character, Gollum, in
``The Lord of the Rings.'' Jar-Jar takes the two Jedi to Amidala,
queen of Naboo, and they prepare to escort her to the bejeweled,
Art Nouveau dream-city of Coruscant, capital of the
weak-but-still-righteous Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Engine trouble diverts the mission to Tatooine, where Qui-Gon
bargains for spare parts with Watto, a globular creature with
hummingbird wings. Watto's 9-year-old slave boy, Anakin, interests
Qui-Gon, who senses the boy's spiritual precocity _ a sure sign of
the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Immaculately conceived
</P>
<P>
   Catholics may raise eyebrows at Anakin's origin: His mother,
Shmi Skywalker, apparently conceived him immaculately, by a pure
union with the Force. He has no fleshly father.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Qui-Gon makes a bet with Watto: If Anakin should win
a pod race against the tarantulalike braggart Sebulba, Watto will
hand him over to Qui-Gon and the lad will be free to pursue his
destiny as a Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing 10-minute-long pod race sequence is said to be one
of the most eye-smacking highlights of the movie and goes clear
back to Lucas' boyhood dream of becoming a race-car driver.
</P>
<P>
   Anakin is destined to become the iron-lunged Darth Vader, the
evil Jedi seduced by the dark side of the Force, and the father of
Luke Skywalker, the hero of the 1977 ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all Lucasfilm is saying for now. For the rest of the
movie, you'll have to pay your $8.
</P>
<P>
   But Jude Watson, a Flamingo Park fiction writer, has already
seen the whole script. She had to. She was commissioned to write
``Queen Amidala's Journal,'' a sort of prequel to the prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Watson has been sworn to secrecy. Anyway, ``Queen
Amidala's Journal'' is just one tiny building-block in the enormous
``Star Wars'' mythos, that by now has expanded like the Big Bang,
thousands of years in every direction from the original movie
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The copy I had was specially coded, so that if I photocopied
it, they'd know. If I revealed any details, they'd kill my
grandmother. I'm joking!'' Watson said. ``But they are very
security-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Amidala's Journal'' took her two months' hard work to
write, and she never even met Lucas. ``It was all done by phone and
fax. They check every detail out in California, to make sure you
don't get anything wrong. It is a very meticulously worked-out
universe,'' Watson remembered.
</P>
<P>
   What is it like, living ``A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very liberating,'' Watson said. ``I had written books for
girls before. This time I had to put on my tomboy hat and put in a
lot of light saber fights. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she go to the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. Not the first day, but I'll be there. No free tickets,
though. I'll have to stand in line like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Camping out a penitent act
</P>
<P>
   University of Florida English Professor Andrew Gordon is so
fascinated by the ``Star Wars'' mythology that he has written a
paper on it, available at his Web site
(web.clas.ufl.edu/users/agordon). Gordon says the special effects
in the movies are brilliant, but the real appeal of the films is
their adroit use of myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call `Star Wars' a steam-powered starship. The
appeal is not really the high-tech gloss or the special effects.
Plenty of science fiction movies have been made with great special
effects, but nobody goes back to see them after 20 years,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, what we have is an old-fashioned and reassuringly
conservative universe, a universe that makes sense, where there is
clear good and evil _ and good triumphs. You've got very old types,
like the Wise Old Man, the Beautiful Princess, the Elves and Animal
Helpers, the Black Knight, and the Hero who stands in for the whole
culture and redeems us.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth and science fiction blur into a kind of religion, Gordon
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science fiction is very close to religion. The religion of
Scientology was founded by a science fiction writer, L. Ron
Hubbard. Science fiction is an attempt to answer the basic
questions of the universe: Why are we here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Similarly, there's a very strong religious component to `Star
Wars.' George Lucas himself has said that he came up with the idea
of the Force, to get young people thinking about God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say these people who are standing in line for weeks
and weeks to see the movie are performing a religious rite, a
penitential process of self-purification, to show their worthiness.
It's like climbing the mountain on your knees to gain wisdom. You
voluntarily put yourself through discomfort to demonstrate your
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   And will Gordon see the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, sure. Got to. But I'm going to wait until the furor
dies down. I'm not going to stand in line.

TORRE NOT YET READY TO MANAGE YANKS; ZIMMER TO STAY ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ His doctor warned Joe Torre that his rate of
recovery from prostate cancer would be unpredictable, that he could
feel strong and vigorous one day and weary the next. Whereas Torre
once thought he might assume his role of manager on the Yankees'
current road trip, he said Friday that he was not ready and used
two weeks as a time frame for his return.
</P>
<P>
   It could be sooner, it could be later: Torre, still finding
himself tired at day's end in the seventh week since his surgery,
said he might manage next week, hopes he'll be back by the All-Star
Game break, and is sure he'll manage again this year. The exact
date? ``I don't know when I'm going to manage,'' said Torre, who
watched the Kansas City Royals beat the Yankees, 13-6, on Friday
for the first time since Aug. 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer continues to manage the Yankees in Torre's absence in
spite of the pain in his knees, and in spite of the fact that he
called a team meeting earlier this week to inform players he would
retire after Thursday's game. ``I'll be here until he decides to
come back,'' said Zimmer, who answered questions alongside Torre
Friday. ``Whether it be a day, a month, five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``Why don't you ask me again in two weeks _ that's
what I'm thinking about, and if it's ahead of that, then it would
be a nice pleasant surprise for me. I've never been through this,
so I don't know what the timetable would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will watch the Yankees here through the weekend, but is
uncertain whether he will accompany the team to Minnesota on
Tuesday. It's safe to say his mere presence at the ball park does
not inspire the Yankees, for they performed miserably Friday night.
Andy Pettitte was pounded (seven runs in three and one-third
innings), and his failure to cover first base was crucial to the
Royals' four-run rally in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City bashed five home runs and capitalized on a handful
of mental mistakes made by the Yankees, momentarily undercutting a
protest staged by about 2,000 fans; they were demonstrating against
the financial and competitive disparity between large- and
small-market franchises, and treated the Yankees as symbols of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fans greeted the Yankees outside of Kauffman Stadium
as the players arrived for the game, chanting their slogan, ``Share
the wealth.'' Bernie Williams, whose 1999 salary of about $9.5
million is about double what the Kansas City starting lineup will
earn this year, was targeted by fans who held up a sign noting
Williams' pay. Williams acknowledged that he tried moving swiftly
past the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of uncomfortable,'' Williams said. ``You can handle
the yelling when you're on the field and when it's about what you
do on the field, but this goes beyond the game itself. I thought I
was marching into the '60s somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans waved copies of dollar bills at the Yankees, and once
the game started, they turned their backs from the field while the
Yankees batted and then they departed, en masse, in the top of the
fourth inning. David Cone, a Kansas City native, debated with some
of the protesters during batting practice, but the wittiest retort
came in the form of a banner hauled by a plane: Share? O.K., You
Can Have Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   What Torre said about his plans is not really different than
what he said last weekend in New York _ that he feels great and is
working out regularly, but wants to regain his full energy and
acclimate himself to the demands of traveling before he comes back.
Torre never said he would manage this weekend in Kansas City, only
mentioning to Zimmer that he hoped to return on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Torre said he would join the team here after a
checkup in St. Louis on Thursday led to speculation _ from Zimmer
and others _ that Torre would manage against the Royals. Torre says
he's not ready for that. On many evenings, he said, he suddenly
feels very tired, as his doctor, William Catalona, said he might;
the Yankees usually play at night.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer and Torre had breakfast Friday morning, and Torre seemed
to convince Zimmer that whenever Torre returns, Zimmer should
merely take some time off, rather than retire.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Zimmer manage in pain, Torre said, ``hurts me.'' But he
knows he cannot let Zimmer's condition have an impact on his own
return. ``I can't have it put pressure on me,'' Torre said. ``I
think it'll affect both of us if I come back before that time when
I think it is right. Hopefully, they'll fit him with something that
takes pressure off his knee.''
</P>
<P>
   After some rest, Zimmer presumably would be in a better frame of
mind to decide whether he is going to retire and end his pro
baseball career after 51 years. ``Hopefully,'' Torre said, ``he'll
get to feeling good enough to want to sit next to me.''  &QL;

ACTING PRINCIPAL PAULY SHORE CONNECTS WITH SCHOOL'S OUTSIDERS

   LOS ANGELES _ ``Weasel. Weasel. Weasel,'' the students chanted
as they followed their principal en masse Friday at Canoga Park
High in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley _ and not one of them got
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They were trailing Pauly Shore, comedian from movies and MTV
fame, who was one of 200 volunteers in a districtwide Principal for
a Day program.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with the Los Angeles Unified School District had
entertainment industry figures and business and community leaders
becoming part-time educators, taking attendance, supervising lunch
and visiting classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these Spanish kids in Spanish class,'' Shore
said. ``They're bored. They all know it. Of course they're going to
get an A on every test. I said, `Leave. Bring back some French
kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the program is to create partnerships between
influential people and public schools, said Eiko Moriyama, director
of the LAUSD Adopt-a-School program.
</P>
<P>
   Some volunteers follow up with donations of money or equipment _
about $15 million a year, she said. Others send employees back to
the school to lend technical expertise or mentor students, or have
the children visit their businesses on field trips. That way the
students can see how their lessons translate to real-life jobs, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from the local media, universities, Dreamworks SKG,
Salomon Smith Barney, GTE, MTV, the Hamilton United Methodist
Church and various other organizations participated. Among them
were District Attorney Gil Garcetti; Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale; and actor French Stewart, from the NBC show ``Third
Rock from the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   As Shore breezed through Canoga Park High, star-struck students
shouted, ``Hey, buuuddy,'' and called for ``the weasel,'' Shore's
catch phrase and nickname from earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would listen to me as much as they listen to
him,'' said the school's real principal, Denny Thompson. ``He's
been really good listening to what the kids have to say, all
kidding aside. Kids really open up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore, star of ``Encino Man,'' ``In the Army Now'' and
``Bio-Dome,'' said classmates at Beverly Hills High School picked
on him before he graduated in 1986, so Friday he focused on the
kids at the margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to go right for the kids that no one ever talks to.
Once you talk to them and kind of make them laugh, that's all they
really need,'' Shore said. ``I have an understanding of where
they're coming from, how sad a lot of them are. That gets to me.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In what may be the most wide-open Kentucky Derby
in years, the designation of a favorite is less significant than
usual.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And usually it means virtually nothing. The Derby favorite has
not won the race in 20 years. The last to succeed was Spectacular
Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, trying to become the first trainer to win the Derby
in three consecutive years, is likely to find himself in the
favorite's role for today's 4:27 p.m. classic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his Indian Charlie was the betting choice and
finished third. Fortunately for Baffert, his stable included Real
Quiet, the 8-1 shot who won.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, whose entry of General Challenge and the filly
Excellent Meeting is likely to be the chalk for the 125th Kentucky
Derby, said, ``I'd rather not be the favorite. If you have a good
one, you really don't want to brag on him too much. You feel you're
going to jinx yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are other more valid reasons for wanting to avoid
being the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Nafzger, who won the 1990 Derby with Unbridled and has
Vicar here this year, pointed out that the trainer of the favorite
is sometimes pressured by the horse's owner to alter his methods.
The favorite is under such media scrutiny that the trainer is
constantly second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   The horse may sense the media pressure as well. In 1992, the
French-born Arazi, the Derby's last odds-on favorite, appeared
nervous as throngs of reporters followed his every move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention factor could have something to do with the
favorites losing,'' said Nick Zito, trainer of one of today's top
contenders, Stephen Got Even.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nafzger said, ``I don't care about being the
Kentucky Derby favorite. I want to be the favorite for the
Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Many racing analysts expect him to get his wish _ win today's
Derby and become the automatic favorite to win the next jewel of
the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar is the only colt in the field with more than one Grade I
stakes victory, as he took the Fountain of Youth and Florida Derby
back to back. Nafzger wasn't interested in winning the next Grade
I, the Blue Grass, because he feared wearing down the horse for the
start of the Triple Crown campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Grass, Vicar took the lead at the top of the
stretch. But with jockey Shane Sellers following orders not to
extend him, he finished third, which enabled him to avoid being the
Derby favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The media and public are inevitably drawn to the winners of the
Blue Grass and Santa Anita Derby, even though it has been eight
years since any of those champions went on to win the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Indian Charlie became the media darling after his
victory in the Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Santa Anita Derby took too much out of him,''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Santa Anita runner-up Real Quiet who proceeded to win the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors make the Derby especially difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the track surface is unusually deep. Some horses run
well on the hard-packed sands of Southern California but bog down
here. The Derby is for 3-year-olds, most of whom have raced only
five to 10 times in their lives, at tracks other than Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Indian Charlie ``couldn't get over the track at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Derby fields tend to be overly large. Today's race has 19
horses, after Friday's removal of Arabian import Aljabr because of
lameness.
</P>
<P>
   The more horses, the more likelihood someone besides the
favorite runs well, and the more likelihood of the favorite being
bumped off stride or jammed in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another ``X'' factor unique to the Derby: the
crowd of 150,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   With all the people and noise, the paddock can terrify a
3-year-old horse, favored or not. Many have become so unnerved,
they were beaten before the race began.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also can be a factor during the race.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jack Preston, co-owner of last year's Derby runner-up,
Victory Gallop: ``I've seen horses come out of the far turn and hit
that wall of sound from the grandstand and they just stop. You
never know if that will happen until you run the race.''

   The high school Allen Watson starred at 11 years ago is just a
few miles from Shea Stadium, and his family home in Middle Village
is close enough that dozens of his friends and family members sat
behind home plate Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In his first outing as a Met starting pitcher 12 days ago,
Watson said he had been distracted for a few innings by the
excitement of pitching in a park so near to so much that mattered.
After he gave up consecutive home runs and trailed by 3-0 to
Montreal after just eight pitches that afternoon, Watson didn't
even look to his father in the stands, figuring that the rough
outing had sent his father home early.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 40 friends and relatives left on Friday night. They
blew into their hands to stave off the cold and were rewarded with
a controlled and mature performance by Watson in the Mets' 7-2
victory over the San Francisco Giants, one of the teams he pitched
for before returning home to Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Watson tied a career high with eight strikeouts and gave up just
three hits and three walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's second victory of the season came over the team that
began the game with the National League's best record (it is now
16-8) and figures to be the Mets' primary competition for a
wild-card spot at the end of the season. He didn't look to his
father Friday night, either, but this time because he figured his
father was so anxious, he was outside smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets really nervous,'' Watson said. ``My mom doesn't even
come, so that tells you something. I want to do well for them, my
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson did so well that he is making himself a candidate to
remain in the rotation, even when Rick Reed returns from a calf
injury, probably next week. Watson had command of all of his
pitches on Friday, but particularly relied on a two-seam change-up
he had worked on with reliever John Franco. Given a 4-0 lead in the
first inning, Watson struggled just once, in the fifth inning as he
was running out of gas. But he allowed just one run, and then
struck out Ellis Burks and Jeff Kent, the third and fourth batters
in the order, to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a lead and he knew what to do with it,'' said
Manager Bobby Valentine, whose team improved to 14-9. ``For them to
get just one run with the middle of the order coming up was the key
to the game. ''
</P>
<P>
   Giants pitcher Shawn Estes was not nearly as composed as Watson.
He walked Rickey Henderson to open the first inning, then yielded a
single to Edgardo Alfonzo (whose four hits tied a career high) that
sent Henderson to third.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out Jon Olerud and with a 3-1 count on Mike
Piazza, Estes was called for a balk by Bob Davidson, the home plate
umpire, for what appeared to be a slight bobbing of his head.
Henderson came home at the same time as Estes. He stalked toward
home plate seeking an explanation but was pushed away first by
catcher Scott Servais and then by Manager Dusty Baker.
</P>
<P>
   But Estes remained rattled. He walked Piazza, then gave up a
double to Robin Ventura that scored Alfonzo. On four straight
pitches he walked Mike Kinkade to load the bases. On a 1-0 count to
Brian McRae, Estes threw a wild pitch and Piazza scored the third
run of the inning. Estes walked McRae to load the bases again. Rey
Ordonez's grounder to third base was fielded by Charlie Hayes, who
tagged Kinkade on the run but allowed Ventura to score to give the
Mets a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Estes settled down briefly after that, until Ventura smashed an
0-1 fastball into the right-field bullpen in the fifth inning for a
5-1 lead. But Watson had been threatened in the top half of the
fifth, too, and his artful escape from potential disaster with just
that one run scored served as the coda to his evening.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook yielded a home run to Servais in the sixth, but
after Cook walked two straight batters in the seventh, Turk Wendell
came in to strike out Kent, which, Valentine said, was virtually
the save. Wendell got an official save, too, his first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   It now seems less likely that RICK REED, who has been on the
disabled list since April 12 with a slight tear in his right calf,
will pitch Sunday _ either in New York or in a rehabilitation
assignment. Reed will throw on the side Saturday, Manager BOBBY
VALENTINE said, and General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said the team
would probably determine the rotation sometime this weekend. &QL;

 &HT;    Winning Derby requires big stable, good game plan
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Wayne Lukas showed them how.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Lukas won the Kentucky Derby with Thunder Gulch,
the trainer started three horses. The next year, when he won with
Grindstone, five Lukas entries were Kentucky Derby starters.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for other trainers to catch on. Quality you
need. Quantity helps, too. ``It's good to have a good horse,'' said
Lukas. ``It's better to have two.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the year of the tag team.
</P>
<P>
   The man of the hour today at Churchill Downs is Bob Baffert, in
a wonderful position to become the first trainer since the race
started in 1875 to win three straight Derbys. Baffert has three
among the top selections, General Challenge, Excellent Meeting and
Prime Timber.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert announced Friday morning that Excellent Meeting would
run in the Derby, not the Oaks on Friday, although she had been
nominated for the event for fillies. The Oaks went to heavily
favored Silverbulletday, Baffert's other top filly.
</P>
<P>
   But the theme of Derby No. 125 is the double entry, the 1-2
punch, or in Baffert's case, the 1-2-3 punch.
</P>
<P>
   Never have so many trainers reached game day for the biggest
event of the racing year with more than one horse in the starting
gate.
</P>
<P>
   There are 19 Derby starters.
</P>
<P>
   Aljabr, the less-regarded of two entries from Sheikh Mohammed al
Maktoum, was withdrawn Friday afternoon with the announcement that
the horse had become lame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 10 of today's starters are loners, horses without a
stablemate on the firing line. Nine starters are controlled by four
men, trainers Lukas, Baffert, Nick Zito and Elliott Walden.
</P>
<P>
   This opens up all kinds of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert could send his filly, Excellent Meeting, out to make a
fast pace, weaken the other horses trying to catch him and set the
race up for one of Baffert's other two headliners.
</P>
<P>
   That's not considered unethical. It happens in racing all the
time when two or more horses in a race are controlled by one
trainer or owner.
</P>
<P>
   But unethical developments do occur.
</P>
<P>
   In tag-team situations, who knows what horse might shut off
another, leaving the way open for his partner?
</P>
<P>
   Money goes to success, which is why so many of the best Derby
horses are with a handful of trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baffert is in a word-of-mouth phase,'' said Mike Pegram, owner
of Baffert's 1998 Derby champion, whose wealth came from a lineup
of fast-food franchises. ``The ultra-rich can't wait to get to him
with their horses. I'm talking about a group far above people on my
income level.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainers that have established themselves as long-time Derby
reliables, like Lukas, who has started the race 33 times in 18
years, draw big-money clients. Lukas starts Cat Thief today as well
as Charismatic. They come from the portfolios of two of his richest
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers like Elliott Walden, never a Derby winner but at the
top or near there in all three Triple Crown races last year with
Victory Gallop, attract horse-buyers quickly when they win top
races like the Belmont Stakes. Walden's entries are Menifee and
Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito is an example of just how quickly clients come to a
man with a reputation as a Derby trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, first in the Derby in 1991 and 1994, was abandoned last
year by his leading owner, a newcomer quickly discouraged when his
horses were injured. Practically out of the chase in 1998, Zito is
back this year with Adonis and favorite Stephen Got Even, both
owned by new investors to his stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing we do,'' said Ed Plesa Jr., the Calder-based
trainer who trains Derby entry Three Ring, ``is recruit, recruit,
recruit. We've got to find the horses. Then we've got to find the
owners to buy the horses. To win the Derby, you need national
exposure.'' Of the six Derby favorites at 10-1 or less in the
program odds, Vicar is the only one not part of a two-horse
project. The 1990s ends at the Derby as a team operation.

DEVILS HOLD OFF PENGUINS: 2ND ROUND IS IN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils and the Pittsburgh Penguins
finally put together a spirited match that was fast, tense and
entertaining. In the best game thus far in their mostly tepid
series, the Devils won, 4-3, Friday night at Continental Arena to
take a 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay scored twice for the Devils, with both goals
assisted by Bobby Holik. The Devils, who were eliminated in the
first round last season by Ottawa, can clinch the series on Sunday
in Pittsburgh. The status of Jaromir Jagr, the Penguins' captain
and superstar who missed his fourth consecutive game with a groin
injury, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We skated and we kept taking the body,'' McKay said. ``We set
the tempo last game, and we continued. We forced them to force
pucks over, and we played hard. We're playing with a lot of
aggressiveness. We're not dipsy-doodlers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had taken a 2-0 lead on a power-play goal by Scott
Stevens in the first period and an even-strength goal by McKay in
the second. But Pittsburgh tied the game before the second
intermission when Kevin Hatcher and Aleksei Kovalev both scored at
even strength, 13 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 3-2 lead at 1 minute 42 seconds of the third
period on an even-strength goal by Petr Sykora, who carried the
puck up ice, broke through the Pittsburgh defense, left it for
Patrik Elias and worked free near the crease in time to put Elias'
rebound past goalie Tom Barrasso. It was Sykora's third goal of the
series. McKay made it 4-2 at 14:04 by turning in Holik's pass from
close range.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:41 remaining, the Penguins went on the power play and got
a second extra skater when they pulled Barrasso. They cut the lead
to 4-3 at 19:13 on a goal by Kip Miller, set up by Kovalev, who
starred in Jagr's absence. Although they kept the extra skater on
ice for the remaining 47 seconds, the Penguins could not get one
more goal, even after Sykora took a double minor for high-sticking
with 5.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens gave the Devils a 1-0 lead at 16:12 of the first period
on the power play. He snapped a shot past Barrasso from the slot
after he took Lyle Odelein's pass in the neutral zone, cut from the
left to the middle and darted into empty space among Penguins
checkers.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, the Penguins tried to distract Devils goalie
Martin Brodeur. Aleksei Morozov kicked him, skate to skate, and
later, Matthew Barnaby slashed Brodeur's glove after a save, and
Brodeur slashed back. Each got minors. The pace of this one was
much brisker than previous games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils seemed in control of the game when they took a 2-0
lead at 11:47 of the second period on a goal by McKay, who knocked
in Holik's rebound after Barrasso lost track of the puck. But
Kovalev, the former Ranger, sparked his team to two goals in 13
seconds to tie it. The first, at 16:08, was by Kevin Hatcher, who
turned in Kovalev's feed from the left-wing circle to the slot.
Then Kovalev beat Brodeur from the slot on his second of two whacks
at 16:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary to sit in the bench and see those two goals,''
Sykora said ``But it shows how strong a team we have because we
came back in the third. We had time to go to the locker room and
regroup. We all stayed positive. It was positive meeting.'' Jagr
did not skate with his teammates at morning practice and stayed for
treatment in the medical room. As he left the building later, he
said he did not know when he would be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like, if I did play, there is a chance _ 60 or 70
percent _ that I'll get injured again and make it worse,'' Jagr
said. ``Even if I would help the team by playing tonight, I
wouldn't be able to play in the second round. It wouldn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he be able to play in Game 6 on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I feel now, I'm going to say no,'' Jagr said, ``but
everything can change. I thought I would be able to play today.
Obviously, it's changed. I'm not going to tell you definitely no.
But if I feel the way I feel now, I'm not going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEW BARNABY of Pittsburgh, who almost started a pre-game
brawl on Tuesday, antagonized the Devils fans by shooting a puck
into the home net at the end of warm-ups.

QUALIFYING IS ALL WASHED UP

<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ For some, Friday was a total washout. But for
Butch Gilliland, it was only a partial one. Gilliland, the Chino
Hills driver, will not get a chance to compete in two races this
weekend, as rain canceled qualifying for both the Busch and Winston
Cup events. Gilliland had already qualified for today's Winston
West California 200, but was hoping to get a shot at Sunday's main
event, the California 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very disappointing,'' Gilliland said. ``We had set such
high goals for this weekend. The good news is we are going to race
(today) and we are not going home. But we were really looking
forward to going in both races.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other drivers were left on the outside of Sunday's race
when NASCAR went to the automatic points qualifying system. The top
35 car owners will be joined by eight others who received
provisional spots in the 43-car field. That gives the pole to
points leader Jeff Burton, who will be joined on the front row by
Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the best thing to do, but a lot of guys are
left scrambling,'' said Jeremy Mayfield, who will start from the
outside of row 7. ``It left us with an hour to get some race set-up
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice for the California 500 is set for 8:30 this morning and
will last until about 10 a.m. The Busch race will begin at 11 a.m.,
with another hour of practice for the 500 set for 2 p.m. At 3 p.m.
the California 200 will begin. Five Busch racers also received bad
news when rain wiped out their chances of qualifying without their
even getting on the track. Included is former NFL head coach Jerry
Glanville, who is both the owner and driver of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket policy: Those who bought tickets for Friday can apply the
face value for today's events at the speedway, according to track
officials. Tickets can be redeemed at gates 12 and 14. Grandstand
tickets were available for Friday at $10 and $15. The price range
is $35 and $45 for today, which includes a musical performance by
Chris Isaak at 5:30 p.m. in the infield. A 20-minute fireworks show
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Me and my shadow: Les Richter, executive vice president for the
speedway, was shadowed by an NFL Films crew. The footage will be
shown in August on ESPN and ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of two pieces on the NFL connection with NASCAR,''
said David Plaut, one of the producers. ``It will be called
`Revving Up for the NFL season.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Richter played for more than a decade in the NFL after being
drafted out of Cal. A first-round draft pick, he was traded by the
Dallas Texans to the Los Angeles Rams for 11 players. A member of
the Collegiate Hall of Fame, Richter has not been listed on the pro
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will give him more exposure,'' said Plaut.
``We've talked to many people about him, including former teammates
Tank Younger and Don Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter's first association with racing was at Riverside
International Raceway, where he worked for Ed Pauley and Bob Hope.
They not only owned part of the track, but also the Rams. After his
playing days, Richter served as general manager at Riverside for 15
years before taking a position with NASCAR. He left NASCAR in 1995
to work for Roger Penske on the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Playing it safe: Bobby Labonte, fourth in the Winston Cup points
standings, will not drive in any more Busch Grand National races
this year. He has withdrawn as the driver of the No.18 Pontiac
owned by Joe Gibbs. Labonte, who was not scheduled to race at
California, drove with a broken shoulder to a third-place finish at
Texas on March 28 and reportedly does not want to risk further
injury. He was injured at Darlington (S.C.) at the fifth race of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Solid future: According to Randy LaJoie, the future of stock car
racing looks pretty good. LaJoie is speaking of the youthful
competitors in the Busch Grand National series. The names range
from NASCAR royalty Dale Earnhardt Jr., Adam Petty and Jason
Jarrett to those trying to make the transition to Winston Cup:
drivers such as Mike Dillon, Matt Kenseth, Kevin and Wayne Grubb
and Dave Blaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two thumbs up,'' said LaJoie, who has opted to race in the
Busch series in order to spend more time with his family. ``They're
very smart. And they are very talented.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason LaJoie likes the newer crop in the
series. ``The best thing I've seen about these guys compared to
some of the ones in the past is they will ask questions,'' LaJoie
said. ``The last couple of years, we've had guys coming through
here who thought they were smarter than the rest of us.''

RUMORS OF VIOLENCE KEEP STUDENTS AWAY FROM LOS ANGELES AREA
SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Daily News staff writers Patricia Aidem, Cecilia Chan and Paul
O'Donoghue contributed to this story 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite tight security at Los Angeles-area schools
Friday, hundreds of students stayed out of classes following rumors
that the Colorado high school massacre would trigger copycat
violence.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported on any campuses, but students and
administrators alike were on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to come to school today, but my grandpa made
me,'' said 15-year-old Terrin Caselli, a sophomore at Granada Hills
High School in Los Angles' San Fernando Valley. ``It makes me more
scared to know they're taking it so seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, fear and rumors disrupted campuses, prompting
President Clinton to promise a White House meeting on youth
violence. In Atlanta, the school superintendent said she would seek
a state law authorizing local school districts to arm
administrators with Mace, pepper spray or an electronic stun device
called a Taser.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, rumors of violence at Granada Hills
High School led 653 students out of 3,500 to stay home, about three
times the usual number.
</P>
<P>
   The campus added a Los Angeles police officer, while Los Angeles
police cruised the surrounding streets. Extra administrators walked
the halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students wanted to see the extra security today,'' said
Granada Hills High Principal Kathleen Rattay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the students realize this is just hearsay.
Nonetheless, they want to know what we're doing to ensure their
safety,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With no incidents on campus, Rattay said she hopes most students
will return Monday after having the weekend to calm their nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students returned to Taft High School in Woodland
Hills in the San Fernando Valley on Friday, a day after some 800
students stayed home because of rumored violence there. The
absentee count of 413 was above normal, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it will be in another day or two, but
everything seems to be fine right now,'' said Taft Assistant
Principal Jim Szabo.
</P>
<P>
   Many students blamed the hysteria on those few fellow classmates
who, for whatever reason, try to capitalize on the fear following
the attack last week at Columbine High School in Colorado. The
April 20 attack occurred on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Other Southland schools had similar experiences Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the 2,100 students at La Mirada High School
skipped school because of rumors, although district officials said
they had received no telephone call, letter or other specific
threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Antelope Valley northeast of Los Angeles, stories
circulating that attacks were planned for Friday, the 54th
anniversary of Adolf Hitler's suicide, led sheriff's deputies in
patrol cars to be posted in front of Highland and Quartz Hill high
schools in the morning as other deputies went to Palmdale High at
lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD school psychologist and crisis specialist Richard
Lieberman said it is not uncommon for children to respond to a
tragedy like that in Littleton, Colo., by either being
hypervigilant about their safety or lashing out in unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting the fool is one way kids respond to traumatic
experiences,'' Lieberman said of those who have sparked rumors on
school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several students said their classmates joked about the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at nutrition I overheard people saying, the day's not
over yet _ something could still happen,'' said Granada Hills High
senior Mike Falcon, 18.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the fear generated by a massacre, even hundreds
of miles away, can have a lasting effect, occasionally turning up
in sleeping and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tragedies like this do is shake children to their very
core feelings of safety and security,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 angry and concerned parents and students packed
Quartz Hill High gymnasium to question school and sheriff's
officials about school safety after hearing reports of a plot to
blow up the school.
</P>
<P>
   The students insisted it was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a safe campus,'' Quartz Hill High Principal Barbara
Willibrand told a crowd Thursday night. ``I know in my heart that
we do not have a problem on this campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reassurances, parents and students were still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel safe here because there's been things like
this before, and until it got a lot of attention they've never
really done anything about it,'' said junior Hanna Kaplar. ``These
threats have been going on for a while, and until the Colorado
shooting they didn't take it seriously.''

EARNHARDT JR. IS AHEAD OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HELMS  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Not only is Dale Earnhardt Jr. one of the
hottest young drivers in the country, he also might be one of the
smartest. Earnhardt Jr. was asked Friday morning whether he'd
prefer to have a few wins or the most points on the NASCAR Busch
Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fair question. Nine races into the season, Earnhardt
Jr. has no victories, but his 1,241 points have given him a
100-point lead over second-place Matt Kenseth. Earnhardt didn't
hesitate before answering: He'd rather have the points right now.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, when the qualifying for today's Auto Club 300
was washed out by rain, Earnhardt reaped one of the rewards of
being the series leader: He got the pole position for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the points lead at this point of the season is
definitely a much better situation than winning a race,'' said
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for today's race was determined by where the drivers
stand in points, so Earnhardt and Kenseth, the two leading point
scorers this season, will be starting from the front row.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who won seven races last season and captured the
Busch Series championship, has already inked a five-year contract
to join the Winston Cup circuit next year, so this is his last year
as a Busch regular. The 24-year-old is still learning to handle his
enormous fame, something that he said he wasn't entirely ready for
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first announced the Budweiser deal, it got kind of
crazy for a while,'' Earnhardt said. ``I didn't really know what to
expect. I wasn't really prepared for everything that happened.
We've made some adjustments and some changes and things have been a
lot more enjoyable since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was credited by several competitors Friday with
increasing the exposure for the Busch Series, which has seen its
points money more than double in the last year. The fact that he
hasn't won in nine starts this year speaks to the competitiveness
in the series. Earnhardt has a pair of top-five finishes and six
top-10 finishes so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot for our series last year. When he came in with
his name, obviously, it did a lot of good,'' said Elton Sawyer, who
will start from the third position today. ``Then he came out and
proved he should be here, not by just winning and leading laps, but
by winning the championship. I'm just going to ride along with him.
I don't want him to leave. I want him to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is already being groomed as the next big challenger
for Jeff Gordon, though he said he's not entirely comfortable with
that lofty expectation. He'd like to be viewed in the same way as
any other driver who is in his second full year of Busch series
racing, but he also realizes that with his name and his early
success, that's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never asked to be put in a situation like that, but I don't
back down from that, either,'' he said. ``It's a double-edged
sword. You have to take the good with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, another young Busch regular who has Winston Cup
aspirations, laughed when asked if he resented Earnhardt's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful every day I'm in this series,'' Kenseth
said. ``He should have gotten all that attention. He won seven
races and led the most laps last year. If we switched things around
and I won all those races and he still got most of the attention,
maybe then I'd be a little mad at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt seemed a little embarrassed by all the kind words
Friday and also seemed less than thrilled with some of the
questions asked by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten better for us race after race,'' he said.
``Hopefully, we'll pull off (a win) here in the next couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no time, of course, like the present.

LAWMAKER'S COMMENTS ON RACE, ETHNICITY, CALLED EMBARRASSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slavery wasn't that bad; Native Americans aren't very smart.
Just another day at the office for Rep. Barbara Blewster.
</P>
<P>
   The Dewey Republican's latest gaffe came in a recent
conversation in the House with fellow Rep. Leah Landrum, D-Phoenix,
one of two elected African-Americans in the Arizona Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum says she was offended by Blewster's remarks but not
surprised. This, after all, is the woman who earlier this year
compared homosexuality to ``bestiality, human sacrifice and
cannibalism'' and told another colleague she didn't look Jewish
because she doesn't have a hooked nose.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments have drawn notice around the nation, including
jokes on Howard Stern's radio show.
</P>
<P>
   And the hits just keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum objected to what she called Blewster's ``rude,
unnecessary'' comments on Native Americans and the history of
slavery in America.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, Landrum said, Blewster criticized Native
Americans, saying ``they were not smart enough to do what they need
to do to get ahead, and that even African-Americans are more
advanced than Native Americans, smarter (than Native Americans).''
</P>
<P>
   Blewster did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Blewster, who represents the towns of Prescott, Prescott Valley,
Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City, didn't stop there, Landrum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her comments had to do with Native Americans today and how
they're not as smart as what they should be,'' Landrum said. ``And
that slavery wasn't that bad, and not that many people lost their
lives. And after the Emancipation Proclamation, everything was
flowery and great.''
</P>
<P>
   Blewster, who is a member of the John Birch Society, is
beginning to attract attention back home, and some of her comments
are drawing fire.
</P>
<P>
   David Spence, a former Yavapai County GOP chairman who was one
of three Republicans who ran against Blewster in 1998, called
Blewster's comments ``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: She was elected by a populace who was
not aware of what she really stood for,'' Spence said. ``The types
of things Barbara is saying down there she was saying at town
halls, but not many voters were there, so no one heard it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence said he was particularly offended by Blewster's comment
to Rep. Barbara Leff, R-Paradise Valley, that she didn't look
Jewish because she didn't have a hooked nose. He's vowed to stop
sending money to the Yavapai County GOP until Blewster is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, she's not just saying it. She believes it,''
Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Sue Lynch, a Prescott Republican whom Blewster
replaced, called Blewster's statements ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are starting to say she's like Ev Mecham,'' Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said Blewster made the comments during a conversation on
a program that provides breakfasts at public schools. Blewster was
arguing that the program should be eliminated because parents
should spend more time with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said she told Blewster that some parents can't afford
food to feed their children and that the program provided meals to
kids who otherwise would have nothing to eat in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Blewster said there was always a way to put food on the table
and used American pioneers as an example. Landrum said she pointed
out that the pioneers often had help from Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Blewster then apparently implied that it was the pioneers who
made America great. Landrum responded that many people contributed
to the the growth of the United States, including slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who built this country. It wasn't
just one person that did all the work,'' Landrum recalls telling
Blewster.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a discussion of the economic situation of some
Native Americans and former slaves. Blewster argued that Native
Americans should pull themselves out of poverty today, just as some
Blacks did after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Blewster said, ``Even during the slavery days, that Booker T.
Washington pulled himself by his bootstraps. And if he could do it,
everybody could do it. Even after the Emancipation Proclamation,
people made it. No one was starving, no one was dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said she told Blewster that 6 million Africans died in
passage on slave ships, a point Blewster denied. Blewster argued
there weren't 6 million people in Africa at the time, Landrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers, including Basil Davidson in his book, ``The
African Slave Trade,'' estimate that 6 million to 16 million
Africans died on slave ships before they ever landed in the
Americas over nearly 300 years of slave-trading.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum, who was the victim of a racially motivated attack in
1991 in Tempe, said the nature of Blewster's remarks hit her Friday
as she watched the highlights of a funeral for Isaiah Shoels, an
African-American student who was killed in the Columbine High
School shootings in Littleton, Colo..
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Shoels was killed because he was Black and
because he was an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed the way they need to be,'' she said.
``It's still an issue. It needs to be addressed. It affects our
children all the time. It affects us all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said her conversation with Blewster was friendly. But
she cut it off when she realized she wasn't convincing her
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried my best to let her know, but I realized I wasn't
getting anywhere with this, and I told her, `This is one we really
can't discuss. You have your feelings on this, and I have my
facts,' '' Landrum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't always surprise me when people have certain
mind-sets. It bothers me, it disturbs me, but it's no surprise. And
that's really sad.'' &QL;

RELIGION COLUMN: A SURVEY'S SURPRISING RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pie in the sky bye-and-bye'' was the mocking refrain of
political revolutionaries who accused religion of pacifying the
poor with heavenly hopes instead of helping them with earthly
goods. Yet compassion toward the poor, with here-and-now almsgiving
as part of it, has been part of every major religious tradition. So
it is not surprising that three sociologists recently set out to
answer these questions:
</P>
<P>
   Does religion really matter when it comes to giving money to
help the poor? Are the Christian groups that are generally
associated with concern for the poor, namely, serious Roman
Catholics and liberal Protestants, the most generous in aiding the
poor? Do the giving habits of political and theologically
conservative Christians, especially those influenced by the
religious right, show an anti-poor sentiment?
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Regnerus, Christian Smith and David Sikkink, all
associated with the sociology department of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, re-examined data gathered in the 1996
Religious Identity and Influence Survey that had been financed by
the Pew Charitable Trusts. Among questions on ideas about morality,
gender, education and civic activities, this national telephone
survey asked respondents how much of their time or money they had
spent in various social and political activities: ``a lot,''
``some'' or ``none.'' One such activity was giving money to
organizations that helped ``the poor and needy.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in last September's issue of the Journal for the
Scientific Study of Religion, the sociologists make the data jump
through all the usual hoops: race, gender, education, age, income,
recent financial change, size of family, size of community,
political affiliation. To the latter they add whether respondents
had relied on the Christian Coalition or similar organizations in
deciding how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologists also analyzed the data according to church
attendance and how important respondents said religion was in their
lives. Respondents were divided into different religious
categories: fundamentalist, evangelical, mainline Protestant,
liberal Protestant, low-attendance Protestant, high- and
low-attendance Catholic, other religious (Jews, Hindus, Mormons,
Jehovah's Witnesses and similar groups whose respondents in the
sample were too few to analyze separately), and, finally,
nonreligious.
</P>
<P>
   And what did they find?
</P>
<P>
   First, religion apparently matters. The nonreligious were far
less likely to report giving ``a lot'' to organizations aiding the
poor than all the religious groups except low-attendance Catholics.
Control for demographic factors, and the nonreligious are
definitely at the bottom of the giving hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of religiosity apparently matters, too. The more
actively or intensely religious the respondents, the more generous
they were apt to be, regardless of their religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``other religious,'' the residual category containing
Jews, Hindus and similar groups, were considerably more likely to
give than even the highest of the major Christian categories. Also,
nonwhites and women reported giving ``a lot'' more often than
whites and men, and college graduates a little more often than
those without degrees. Democrats and Republicans finished nearly in
a dead heat, with Republicans winning by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Third, liberal Protestants and practicing Catholics do not
especially stand out in their generosity to the poor. By
comparison, evangelical Protestants appear mildly more generous.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, there is no evidence of an anti-poor mentality, at least
as measured by reported giving, among political and theological
conservatives. ``The conventional wisdom regarding the hostility of
politically and theologically conservative Christians toward the
poor appears incorrect, at least on this count,'' the authors
write.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised them even more, however, was that those who
looked to religious-right organizations like the Christian
Coalition for guidance in voting were more likely to report
``significant `pro-poor' giving habits.'' They were strikingly
likely to report giving ``a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The limits of this analysis do not escape the authors. From the
standpoint of the poor, attitudes toward government assistance, tax
relief and health care, or attitudes toward unemployment, economic
growth and unionization, may have far greater consequences for
well-being than personal charity.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the inevitable shortcomings of survey data. What
definitions exist in the respondents' mind of organizations that
help ``the poor and needy''? What do they have in mind by giving
``a lot''? The random differences can be assumed to cancel one
another out. But what if liberal Protestants or, for that matter,
college-educated evangelicals consistently had a more stringent
notion of what constitutes ``a lot''? Systematic differences among
religious, political or demographic categories in understanding
those questions would skew the results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, public debate about justice for the poor often
slides from what means will best accomplish what goals to ad
hominem judgments about the motives and attitudes of the debaters.
Whether politically and theologically conservative Christians are
right in their prescriptions for relieving poverty is a question
distinct from whether they are anti-poor, a la Ebenezer Scrooge, in
their personal outlook _ and, as with the transformed Scrooge,
giving habits are a reasonable test of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally,'' the three sociologists say in their
discipline's understated style, ``making the jump from economic
conservatism to declaring persons to be hostile toward the poor
seems unwarranted, according to our research results.''

BOMB SCARES ACROSS METRO PHOENIX, BUT NONE FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFRY NELSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bomb scares, school evacuations and increased police presence
swept across Valley schools on Friday, fueled by hoaxes, rumors,
anxiety and hype in the wake of the Colorado school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria High School, 85 percent of the students stayed away.
In Chandler, at least four schools were evacuated. In New River,
bomb sniffing dogs patroled the halls.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the end of the school day, nothing had happened, to the
relief of parents, students, police and school officials. However,
police did arrest one Chandler middle school student for bomb
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Some blamed the hysteria on irresponsible students, some blamed
irresponsible parents. Many blamed irresponsible media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been blown out of proportion by you guys,'' said Richard
Rivas, a Peoria parent who was dropping off his son at school
Friday. ``I don't mean any disrespect but the media has kept this
thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 major school districts reported threats of violence
in the form of bomb scares, Internet messages, drawings and
conversations that sent officials into a state of alert Friday.
Similar incidents were reported across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria Police spokesman Sgt. Shawn Gormley said his department
has received a year's worth of bomb threats in less than a week.
Other law enforcement agencies in the Valley reported similar
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened violence came just a week after the shooting
rampage in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead. Friday also was the
anniversary of Hitler's death. The combination kept many students
away from schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances by police that Peoria High School wouldn't
come under fire Friday, about 1,700 students _ 85 percent of the
students _ skipped school.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Fernando Fiferoa, who shook his head as he
watched a squad of Peoria Police bike officers and a team of
security guards patrol the entrances to his school Friday as if
guarding a top-secret military installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems kind of silly. I mean, nothing's going to happen,''
Fiferoa, a junior at Peoria High School, said. ``Everyone's staying
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Valley teens, the 18-year-old took advantage of rumors
of pending doom hanging over schools on Friday. He skipped classes
to hang out with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria High's concern began last weekend when a message sent out
over the Internet warned students not to attend that school on
Friday because there would be gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Police traced the message to a 17-year-old Peoria boy, who,
police say, had no intention nor ability to carry out the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a hoax, law enforcement and school officials all
across the Valley are taking each warning seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sitting up a little straighter, our vision sharper
and our hearing's a little better,'' said Jim Cummings, a spokesman
for Phoenix Union High School District.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said the district has investigated rumors of students
bringing guns to campus, students sporting black trench coats, a
riot and bomb threats, but all were false reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (students) are playing the media like a fiddle because
they know it will work up the interest and maybe they'll send a
live truck and maybe they'll let school out,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   But to ensure safety, the district will continue to investigate
each report, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New River, sheriff's deputies showed up in force at Desert
Mountain Middle School looking for weapons and using dogs to check
for bombs as students arrived for classes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was found, but deputies spent the day patroling the
hallways, said Sgt. Dave Trombi, a spokesman for the Maricopa
County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The action was sparked by an incident in which a 15-year-old
Desert Mountain student was taken into custody Thursday for
allegedly bringing an explosive device to school.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Allen, a sheriff's spokeswoman, said deputies received
secondary information that a group of students planned to bomb the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the Desert Mountain student said deputies and
school officials horribly overreacted in handling the matter. He
said there was no intent by his son to cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   In Apache Junction, bomb threats have become a daily occurrence.
There have been four in four days, most of them called in less than
half an hour before schools let out, said Carol Shepherd, district
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A letter was sent home to parents on Thursday, asking them to
talk to their children about the consequences of such threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's criminal that someone would use such a severe
tragedy as Littleton to tag on to,'' Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   But police responded to two bomb threats in the Scottsdale
Unified District on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a male caller used a pay phone about 7:30 a.m. to
call in a bomb threat at Supai Middle School, 6720 E. Continental
Drive. Police and Rural/Metro responded but did not find a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The second bomb threat was targeted at Desert Canyon Middle
School, 10203 E. McDowell Mountain Ranch Road. The school received
information Friday morning through a student who read about a bomb
threat on the Internet. It later was determined that the
information was three days old and school was not evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   At Kyrene Aprende Middle School in Chandler, however, hundreds
of students were evacuated to a nearby park Friday morning after
school officials found a note threatening a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took this one seriously and took the kids outside,'' said
Superintendent Brad Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Three children were being questioned about the note Friday
afternoon, and police were searching for a fourth student. It was
unclear whether an arrest would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrene de las Brisas Elementary School, next door to Aprende,
also kept kids outside as police searched the school.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ken Phillips of Chandler Police Department said Hamilton
and Chandler high schools also were evacuated because of threats.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security was present at Poston Junior High School in
Mesa after a note appeared on a bathroom mirror announcing a bomb
would detonate at 2 p.m. Friday. A bomb search was conducted but
none was found.
</P>
<P>
   Tension also ran high at Rhodes Junior High. A message on the
Internet stated someone at the school ``would die today,'' said
Judi Willis, Mesa Public Schools spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At the five Mesa high schools, some students didn't attend
classes as the rumors continued to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going in circles and swirling,'' Willis said. ``We need
to find the perpetrator (of the threats) whether it's real or fake
and treat them severely. I'm afraid we have a lot of copycat
hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students stayed home Friday based on rumor alone.
</P>
<P>
   At Horizon High School in the Paradise Valley district, 70
percent of the 2,600 students didn't show up for classes, although
a district administrator refused to blame the high absenteeism
entirely on rumors of bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horizon had an early dismissal today (Friday) that was planned
weeks ago,'' said Toby Spessard, an assistant superintendent in the
district. ``It could have been senior `ditch day,' too, obviously a
non-sanctioned event.''
</P>
<P>
   At Horizon, a Phoenix police officer was placed on campus this
week after someone made fliers threatening a massacre similar to
the one in Colorado, and three teachers were designated as hall and
parking lot monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Desert Vista High School in Ahwatukee Foothills,
more than 50 percent of the student body of more than 2,000 was
absent Friday, despite the school not documenting any threats.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also were pulling their students out of Tempe elementary
schools, said Tempe District spokeswoman Kathy Bareiss.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said media coverage contributed to the problem.

   ``Part of it is the media is making it out of control,'' said
Barrett, who asked that his schools' threats not be reported to cut
down on copy cat threats. ``There's an element of kids that loves
the attention, loves the excitement that's going to come with
it.'' &QL;

STOCK CAR RACING EXPANDS ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Stock car racing, specifically NASCAR Winston
Cup, has long been considered a province of the Southeast. The
sport has roots dating back to moonshine runners and races on the
beach. Of the current 34-race schedule, 19 events are held in that
particular corner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sanctioning body is located in Daytona Beach, Fla.,
the true hub of the sport is Charlotte, N.C. Virtually every
Winston Cup team is headquartered in the immediate area, and nearly
a third of the races are conducted within a few hours' drive.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not startling that 25 of the drivers who will run in
Sunday's NAPA California 500 are from Southern states. Of that
total, five _ Elliott Sadler, Rick Mast, Ricky Rudd, Jeff and Ward
Burton _ hail from Virginia and another four _ Dale Earnhardt Jr.,
Dale Jarrett, Kyle Petty and Richard Pressley _ are from North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that 12 other states will be represented
in Sunday's feature race at the California Speedway, including a
pair from California. Mike Skinner was born in Ontario and Ernie
Irvan is a native of Salinas. Other racers are from such diverse
locations as Maine (Ricky Craven), Colorado (Wally Dallenbach),
Vermont (Kevin Lepage) and Washington (Chad Little and Derrick
Cope). The Bodine brothers, Geoffrey and Brett, are from New York,
along with Steve Park. Jeff Gordon is among the four drivers from
Indiana, although he was born in California. Dick Trickle is among
four drivers from Wisconsin, while Jeremy Mayfield is one-third of
a trio from Kentucky. Rusty and Kenny Wallace hail from Missouri
while Darrell Waltrip is one of three from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days when I guess you could say me and other guys
from outside the South were a minority,'' said Park, who drives the
No.1 Pennzoil Chevrolet owned by Earnhardt. ``But if you walk
through the garage anymore, you can hear all kinds of accents.
Racing is a national sport and I hope it keeps growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Inc. has embraced that idea. In addition to
hiring Park, Earnhardt also selected Palmdale's Ron Hornaday as the
driver for his Craftsman Truck Series team. Hornaday is the
two-time defending series champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Earnhardt goes out and hires a guy from Long Island,''
said Park. ``That tells you there isn't any regional bias in this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was when Skinner was growing up. His journey to the
driver's seat of the No.31 Lowe's Chevrolet was an odyssey that
took him from the Golden State to the South. After his birth on
June 28, 1957 in Ontario, Skinner's family moved to various places
throughout the state, including Palmdale and Susanville, where he
raced on a half-mile dirt oval and won the first of his three
driving titles in 1976. However, the lure of racing was so great
that Skinner eventually moved to North Carolina in 1983. Wife Beth,
tired of hearing the talk, gave her husband an ultimatum: Race or
be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked so easy on television, I said to myself `I can do
that,''' said Skinner. ``But I found that it was a lot tougher than
I ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner landed a driving job with Gene Petty, Richard's cousin,
and won championships in late-model stocks. His style attracted the
attention of Winston Cup owner Richard Childress, who put him into
a Chevrolet truck when the series started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of people behind me gave me the opportunity to prove
myself, and fortunately, I did,'' Skinner said.

MCCAIN FORCES KOSOVO DEBATE IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has succeeded in
forcing a Senate debate on Monday over his politically explosive
``win at all costs'' Kosovo position.
</P>
<P>
   It was this very debate that leaders of both parties had hoped
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Friday that McCain used a parliamentary procedure
under the War Powers Act of 1973 to compel the Senate to take up
his resolution, which authorizes ``the use of all necessary
force,'' including ground troops, in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While he has bucked the GOP leadership before, McCain has
rarely, if ever, been so alone on a measure of such importance to
the nation and to his own political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the support of either party's leadership, McCain, a
former naval aviator running for president in 2000, is flying the
equivalent of a political solo mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's perfect for him. It's the old profile in courage,''
said Chris Madison, spokesman for Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who
co-sponsored the resolution with McCain but expects it to be
tabled, or killed, after Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) is going against his party, he's going against
what's popular. That's how you distinguish yourself in the middle
of a (presidential) campaign,'' Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of McCain's fellow Republicans oppose the resolution
because they are reluctant to hand President Clinton such
open-ended authority.
</P>
<P>
   Even Senate Democrats who might have been expected to back a
commander in chief of their party are publicly wondering whether
the measure's timing is premature.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign needs more ``time to function, time to work,''
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters Friday. ``I
believe that it is working.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain received no guarantee from Senate leaders that the debate
would last long or that his measure would receive an up-or-down
vote on its merits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a bipartisan group of 17 House members led by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., filed a lawsuit against Clinton in U.S.
District Court. They assert that the air campaign violates the War
Powers Act and want a ruling to force Clinton to withdraw U.S.
forces from the region or seek a declaration of war from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said the War Powers Act, which mandates a
congressional role when U.S. forces are sent to war, has been
``routinely violated'' by Democratic and Republican administrations
and congresses alike, and that the law needs to be clarified. But
McCain also says that it is up to the president to lead and that
you can't have ``535 commanders in chief,'' a reference to the
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Biden came up with the resolution during a
conversation after appearing on TV together several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed . . . that the president of the United States, if he
were to decide to use ground troops, would need congressional
authorization,'' Biden said in a recent speech. He and McCain also
decided that the president ``should never take anything off the
table once we are in a war,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As almost anyone with any war experience knows, you're never
supposed to show the enemy what you won't do to win,'' McCain said
in an April 13 speech in which he counseled against ``silence and
equivocation'' from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, even Biden is having some doubts about the strategy of
bringing the resolution to the Senate floor Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biden's view all along was, `Let's not bring it up right away,
because it probably doesn't have the votes,' '' Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Senate aides, McCain won a ruling this week from
the Senate parliamentarian to compel Senate action under the War
Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in what I view as a serious abrogation of the
Congress' constitutional responsibility and moral obligations, both
the Democratic and Republican leadership intend to limit debate to
little more than four hours,'' McCain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A debate on such a momentous decision should not be given such
short shrift by the leadership. I continue to ask that the time for
debate be extended until at least Tuesday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment on McCain's measure. Queries were
referred to two national security press officers, who did not
return telephone calls Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that he won't allow presidential politics to
influence his Kosovo positions and that he is basing his decisions
on conscience and his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, Biden's spokesman, predicted that the Senate will table
the measure, effectively evading responsibility. Tabling a bill
cuts off consideration but is technically not the same as defeating
it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's edict to ``use whatever force necessary'' runs contrary
to the sentiment of a deadlocked House, which voted Wednesday to
deny support for the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for Americans to unite behind the war
effort. &QL;

ANGELS PULL OUT VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ An eighth-inning rally helped the Anaheim
Angels pull out a 3-1 win Friday night over the Chicago White Sox
before 38,053 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at one entering the bottom half of the inning, the Angels
seemed to come together after Mo Vaughn was hit by a pitch with two
runners on and no one out on the first pitch by reliever Bill
Simas.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Tim Salmon, hit a sacrifice fly to bring home
Orlando Palmeiro for the go-ahead run. With Troy Glaus at the
plate, Randy Velarde stole third. White Sox catcher Brook Fordyce
overthrew on the play and Velarde came home.
</P>
<P>
   The other Angels run was on a Garret Anderson solo home run in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks went 72/3 innings, the longest outing
by an Angel starter yet this season. Mark Petkovsek (2-1) appeared
in relief and got the win, striking out Jeff Abbott to escape a
two-on threat in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival got three outs for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks gave up just five hits, while striking out four and
walking five. He threw 133 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Jaime Navarro (1-2) took the loss. Navarro
walked Palmeiro and Velarde, the first two batters he faced in the
eighth. He was pulled and replaced by Simas, who hit Vaughn in the
chest with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored first when former Dodger Paul Konerko, hitting
just .197 coming into the game, singled off Sparks with no outs in
the fourth to drive in Magglio Ordonez. As the White Sox leadoff
hitter in the fourth, Ordonez reached on a single, then stole
second before scoring. Sparks worked himself out of the inning by
getting the next three batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Sparks seemed sharp. The first two batters he faced
went down easily. Things got rockier though after he walked Frank
Thomas and gave up a single to Ordonez. Luckily, Greg Norton flied
out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel half of the inning was hardly more productive. With
one out Randy Velarde went the opposite way and doubled down the
right field line.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn advanced him to third with a groundout. Salmon followed
that with a powerful shot to left, but it was caught at the warning
track by Abbot.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' half of the second inning mirrored the first. Darin
Erstad reached on a double off the scoreboard in right center, but
his teammates were unable to advance him.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim threatened again in the fourth. Vaughn led off with a
sharp single to left. Then Salmon reached on a fielder's choice
that saw Vaughn cut down at second. Erstad and Glaus ended the
inning for the Angels two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to brighten in the fifth. Anderson's 387-foot lead
off homer on a 2-0 pitch evened the game at one. Later in the
inning, Orlando Palmeiro got to first on a walk, but he was
stranded there when Velarde flied out.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Angels were back to stranding runners. With
one out, Salmon got aboard on a double to left. Erstad hit into a
fielder's choice sending Salmon to third. Glaus, the next batter,
flied out to center ending the inning.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Jeff Bagwell's first home run at Pro Player Stadium was a
memorable one. It even had injured teammate Moises Alou grinning
after the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bagwell followed Derek Bell's lead as the two hit consecutive
upper-deck home runs in the seventh inning Friday night, and Sean
Bergman pitched the Astros' first complete game of the season in an
8-1 rout of the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker has pretty much seen it all in 3{ decades
in the baseball business. Or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you come to the ballpark. It doesn't matter what
two teams are playing; you never know when you're going to see
something amazing,'' Dierker said. ``Unbelievable. Nobody could
even remember even seeing two balls into the upper deck in the same
game _ let alone back-to-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's home run traveled an estimated 417 feet and brought the
entire Astros bench to the steps of the dugout for a better view.
</P>
<P>
   After Bagwell's shot traveled 450 feet, most of his teammates
and the 19,116 in attendance were in disbelief. Both home runs were
to left field and came off Brian Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good hitting ballpark,'' said Bagwell, who had
failed to homer in 27 previous games and 96 at-bats at the stadium.
``I can hit a ball that far every once in a while. It had been
awhile since I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in three games Bell and Bagwell have
homered back-to-back. And it was the first time consecutive
upper-deck homers have been hit in the seven years the Marlins have
played at Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   It all came in the unlikeliest venue for the Astros, who made
themselves comfortable with a home-cooked fish fry.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman provided the main course with his best outing of the
season, shutting down the Marlins after the first inning, and the
Astros' offense provided the trimmings with seven runs during a
three-inning stretch in the middle of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played well here at all (11-20 all-time),'' Dierker
said. ``I don't consider winning one game easily an end to the
problems we've had here. If we win two out of three this series,
that will be a pretty good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo also homered, and Paul Bako, filling in for
Mitch Meluskey, had three hits and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   That was far more support than Bergman needed.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up four straight one-out singles in the first
inning _ an out at the plate helped limit the damage _ Bergman
turned stingy with a mixture of sinkers and sliders. He closed with
eight shutout innings for his first complete game since last June
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went right after them with his best stuff,'' Bako said.
``He challenged them with his sinker. If it's not staying straight,
it's a tough pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``More than anything, he survived the early
innings when they were getting the hits, then he started to get
stronger as the game went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman (1-1) allowed nine singles, struck out five and walked
none. He faced 26 batters after the first inning, two more than the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   For Bergman, his fourth career complete game was redemption for
a frustrating start five days earlier in Cincinnati, when he
allowed five runs, six hits and four walks in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frustrated about how I pitched my last time out,''
Bergman said. ``I wanted to go out there today and have a good
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the beneficiary of several ground-ball outs that kept his
pitch count low. He needed just 99 pitches, one-fourth of those
during the first inning, and was aided by three double plays.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked into the dugout after the eighth inning, Dierker
approached and asked if Bergman wanted to stay in the game. Bergman
said yes and retired the Marlins 1-2-3 in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Down 1-0, the Astros tied the game on Hidalgo's fifth home run
of the season, off Brian Meadows in the second inning. Craig
Biggio's RBI single in the fifth put the Astros ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Then came four more runs in the sixth, three on one play, as the
Astros took command. Meadows (3-2), who had five strikeouts through
five innings, did the damage to himself, walking three Astros to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bako, who was hitting .191 for Class AAA New Orleans before he
was recalled Monday, had a two-run single, and Bill Spiers also
scored on the play when cutoff man Kevin Orie threw badly to third
base.
</P>
<P>
   Bako scored one pitch later when Meadows balked.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Bell continued a trend for the Astros with the
club's fifth back-to-back home-run performance _ in only 22 games _
tying the most in a season this decade.
</P>
<P>
   They also hit back-to-back home runs on five occasions during
the 1994, 1995 and 1998 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell has hit six of his seven homers in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than enough for Florida manager John Boles, who
first encountered the Astros' potent lineup during the second half
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're loaded,'' Boles said. ``The first three guys in their
lineup are pretty imposing and have been for a long time. What do
they call them, the Killer B's? I hate all three of them, but I
would like to have them. They're even better three years later.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE WOODLANDS _ David Duval came knocking, but it didn't look like
anyone was home.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Dick and Jo Kidwell were home. They were just relaxing
in their den _ feet propped, faces windblown, trying to rest, doze
and recover from a long day of watching the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been out there all day,'' Dick Kidwell would say later. ``I
had no idea what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   They should have opened the blinds.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Duval seemed ready to make a big run on the second day
of the SHO, the kind of awe-inspiring sweep through the back nine
that led him to the tournament championship a year ago, the
much-anticipated friendly course atmosphere treated Duval like it
did everyone on this day.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteriously. Mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who was trying to figure out the confusing conditions on
virtually every shot Friday, was one stroke behind the leaders
heading to the 15th when he smacked his driver well to the left.
</P>
<P>
   It went miles left, seemingly. It went way, way left _ over the
fairway, over the left rough, over the river and through the woods,
over the out-of-bounds stakes until finally settling into the
Kidwells' back yard.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Kidwells relaxed, what ensued was a mad rush of about
500 or more fans, scurrying across the Kidwells' yard, squashing
their St. Augustine, spilling beer and tipping over potted plants.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd gathered around Duval's golf ball like it was a
campfire, moving ever closer, peeking between elbows and knees
trying to catch a glimpse of the ball. It was like a golfing
equivalent to a stampede, or a mosh pit at a Goo Goo Dolls concert.
</P>
<P>
   Several among the throng marveled at how Duval had just hit a
shot like we all have on some ill-fated Sunday afternoon escapade.
Some of them stood on the Kidwells' patio furniture trying to get a
better look at Duval's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching it on TV,'' Dick Kidwell said. ``I had no idea
he was in our back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's where we put in the metaphor stuff:
</P>
<P>
   They all came a-knockin' Friday afternoon. Several of the best
golfers in the world came _ Duval, Vijay Singh, Tom Kite, Jeff
Maggert. But what they thought would be there in the second round
of the SHO wasn't home.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be an easy layout, but it wasn't. It was
supposed to be like throwing yard darts at the TPC greens, but it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The rough had been trimmed. The greens had been softened. The
players had been confident that scores would drop.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all windblown expectations, worn out by the end of
the day like the Kidwells, the greens, Duval and all those who
previously thought they would shoot record-setting scores at the
kinder, gentler TPC course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' said Duval, whose double bogey on No. 15 led
to a 5-under 139 total, good enough for a four-way tie for fourth.
``It was pretty obvious on the putting green that it was going to
be hard today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. All the big hitters had trouble gauging the winds and
greens that dried quickly and became faster almost by the moment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point that the ball just wouldn't stop,'' said
Joey Sindelar, who still managed to share the second-round lead
with Hal Sutton at 8-under. ``We knew off the bat that we were in
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were. Early in the day, John Daly struck a mammoth
drive on the par-5 13th but still decided to lay up after much
deliberation about the winds. Barely half a dozen players tried to
reach the 13th in two, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who began his memorable charge to the 1998 title with an
eagle on No. 13, also laid up there Friday. And only moments after
Duval went into the Kidwells' back yard on No. 15, D.A. Weibring
tried to fight the wind with his approach over the water on No. 17.
He bounced it high off the bulkhead and into the wet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Maggert, hanging on at 1-over for the day as the
shadows grew, trying to pull out another birdie. He bounced his
approach short and right and landed it only inches in front of the
bulkhead as the crowd gasped.
</P>
<P>
   They all gasped on this day. It was supposed to be easy, but it
wasn't. The red numbers were supposed to be bleeding off the leader
board, but the best anyone could muster was a pedestrian (for the
PGA, anyway) 68.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying score for making it to the final two rounds was
supposed to be 1 under par, or maybe even 2-under. But it was
1-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was swirling out there,'' said Jeff Gallagher, who stands
one behind the leaders at 7-under. ``A lot of times, you'd think
you were into the wind but you'd be downwind. You definitely found
yourself playing on the defensive out there once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they all found themselves in the water, or in the
rough, or maybe even in someone's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough day,'' Sindelar said. ``And if they don't water the
greens (Friday night), it's going to be tougher on Saturday.''

DODGERS BEAT PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wanted
to defy baseball logic. Closer Jeff Shaw was all for it.
</P>
<P>
   And in exchange for tempting fate, the Dodgers have a
season-long four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   After putting the potential winning run on base with an
intentional walk _ a baseball no-no _ Shaw struck out Ron Gant in
the bottom of the ninth to preserve the Dodgers' 4-3 win over the
Phillies on Friday at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' fourth straight road win is their longest such
streak away from Chavez Ravine since they won five straight on the
road in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain was telling me one thing and my emotions were telling
me another thing,'' Johnson said. ``You usually don't put the
winning run on. My brain won out _ but my brain also has too many
memories of (Gant coming through).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remembers Gant from their days together in Cincinnati.
These are different days. Gant fights himself at the plate and was
hitting .132 and has one hit in 13 at-bats with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Phillies pulled to within 4-3 on Scott Rolen's
two-run, two-out double off Shaw, Johnson strolled to the mound. He
proposed walking lefty Rico Brogna so the right-handed Shaw could
face the righty Gant.
</P>
<P>
   There was no debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gant struck out on three pitches. Shaw recorded his seventh
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swinging at a lot of bad pitches right now,'' Shaw said.
``Once I got ahead of him I expanded the strike zone. Any time
you're in a ballgame and you have a guy struggling, you go after
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The tense moments of what was nearly Shaw's first blown save
didn't overshadow left-hander Carlos Perez's outing. In dire need
of a quality start, Perez (1-3) allowed one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally important Johnson showed confidence in Perez to
pitch past the sixth inning. Perez's first two starts ended with
seventh-inning collapses in which he allowed four runs and took the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking before getting to the mound what happened to my
first two starts,'' Perez said. ``I knew this time nothing was
going to happen, nothing was going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Add a six-run, 32/3-inning fiasco that caused Johnson to skip
his spot in the rotation a week ago, Perez needed something good to
happen. Unlike his other outings, Perez was more successful deeper
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies had runners in scoring position in each of the
first five innings but could only muster a run on pitcher Paul
Byrd's second-inning single. Perez retired the last seven batters
he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed speeds all night and threw a fastball for strikes
when we needed it,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said of Perez.
``He set the offspeed up with his fastball instead of vice-versa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers built a 3-1 lead in the fifth inning against Byrd
(2-2) when Adrian Beltre singled in a run, Hundley scored on a wild
pitch and Beltre was safe at home on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Perez's ability to get out of the bottom of the
inning that catapulted him through the next two. The Phillies
loaded the bases with two outs. Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, a
Westlake High graduate, lined a pitch just foul down the left-field
line before hitting a pop-up foul to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos, at times, looked like he got a little tentative out
there, but that was a big one for him,'' said Johnson, who two
weeks ago questioned himself after allowing Perez to start the
seventh inning in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have helped him out in the seventh with (Alan) Mills
if I had to,'' Johnson said. ``I was having Mills go along with him
(in the bullpen). Hundley said he was still popping the ball. Our
bullpen is somewhat short so I needed to get a quality outing.''

BELTRE LIVING UP TO PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
saw Adrian Beltre play for a week last season and decided the club
didn't need another third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the season, the only reason Beltre isn't running
away with the Rookie of the Year race is the Dodgers rushed him
into 77 games last summer, ruining that chance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's one of the premier young players in baseball.
Beltre, 21, went 2 for 4 with an RBI in the Dodgers' 4-3 win
against the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday. It raised his average
to .355, and before popping out in the sixth inning he had hits in
six straight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything about this guy,'' said Dodgers
left-hander Carlos Perez, wishing not to jinx the success. ``He's
young and I'm happy for him to get one or two hits. If you start
talking about it...''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who had a career-high four hits Thursday in Milwaukee,
said there's nothing special going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the ball well and hitting the ball hard somewhere
each time,'' Beltre said. ``I've had good swings and I'm getting
good pitches to hit and just swinging at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is flourishing hitting deep in the order, batting either
seventh or eighth. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he's not
ready to move Beltre into another spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna possible for Monday: Johnson said rehabbing right-hander
Antonio Osuna could rejoin the Dodgers on Monday in Montreal if he
experiences no pain or stiffness in his elbow today.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, on the disabled list since April 21 (retroactive to April
18) was scheduled to pitch Friday for Single-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) another big test, and if he can pass that test we'll
have him Monday,'' Johnson said. ``I still feel a little short (in
the bullpen).''
</P>
<P>
   However, questions linger whether Osuna can pitch the rest of
the season with a bone spur in his elbow. It's going to cause
Johnson to use him in more of a long-relief role than with Alan
Mills in a dual set-up role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to modify the way I use him, I will,'' Johnson said.
``If I have to use him for more innings and give him more rest,
I'll do it that way. I'll take him in any role.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra hitting time: More than four hours before the first pitch,
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley was taking extra batting practice in
hopes of working himself out of his offensive funk.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley entered the series hitting .148 (8 for 54), but maybe
the extra work helped. He broke an 0 for 15 drought with a fifth
inning single and was 1 for 3 to raise his average to .158.
</P>
<P>
   Despite saying Hundley was 50 or 60 percent when the season
began, Johnson said he's not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not hurting, so if he's not hurting he's going to get
going,'' Johnson said. ``When you're out for a year and you miss
spring training, what the (heck). He's not Ted Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the issue of stolen bases. The Phillies had two and
Hundley has thrown out two of 24. During the three-game series in
Milwaukee, Hundley's dad, Randy, a former big-league catcher,
worked with his son. Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey, a former catcher,
also worked with Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing's not there, mechanics are not there,'' Johnson
said. ``With Randy, Demper (Dempsey) and Todd, they'll get it
right.''

ERSTAD JUST WANTS TO PLAY ANYWHERE IN LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As far as Darin Erstad is concerned it makes
no difference where he bats in the Anaheim Angels lineup as long as
he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins bumped Erstad from the leadoff spot
to fifth in the batting order. The caveat is that Erstad, playing
in place of Mo Vaughn at first, will return to the top spot when
Vaughn, currently getting at-bats as the designated hitter, returns
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do what I'm told. Play wherever,'' Erstad said.
``There's not much difference between leading off or batting fifth.
Unless there's runners on you get pitched to pretty much the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Big difference: Tim Salmon, a notoriously slow starter, had a
great night at the plate Thursday in the Angels' 17-1 destruction
of the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon went 2 for 5, scored a run, hit a home run and had two
RBI. Collins said Salmon, plagued by injuries last season, has
picked up some slack for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's stepping up,'' Collins said. ``His history has been that
of a slow starter. But, when we needed him to pick it up, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Being free of pain has helped, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great shape he feels good and he's glad to be back out
there,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's day: Todd Greene took on duties behind the plate Friday
because Collins is convinced Greene is uniquely qualified to handle
starter Steve Sparks' knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to of the three guys we have on this staff, the
one guy who can handle the knuckleball is Todd Greene,'' Collins
said. ``If Steve Sparks throws a quality knuckleball, (most
catchers) aren't going to throw anybody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's in the dirt or knuckling like crazy, you got to
concentrate too much on catching that thing and if you are worrying
about guys stealing, they are going to run,'' Collins added. ``It's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko update: It was about this time last season that Paul
Konerko was hailed as the Dodger of the future. In fact, Baseball
America named him the No. 1 prospect in the Dodger system.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 season finds the former Dodger wearing a Chicago
White Sox uniform. That's just fine with him, even if cold and
windy Chicago nights take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about getting back is getting out of the cold
and getting into some good weather,'' Konerko said.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko also likes the fact he's playing for a young team that
so far is holding its own in the competitive AL. Central. Going
into Friday's game the White Sox were in second place, four games
behind the Cleveland Indians and two-and-a-half games in front of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the losses we have it's just been other teams beating
us,'' Konerko said. ``We're not giving away games. As long as we
can do that we'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's batting just .197, Konerko wants to be a part that
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of us, myself included who haven't been
playing up to our potential,'' he said. ``If we do that it will
make it even better.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets were exposed. That's what made it hurt so much more
than even the embarrassing losses to the Clippers and Mavericks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were ready. They played hard. And next to the Jazz, the
Rockets looked like, well, the Clippers and Mavericks of the world.
For that matter, given the events and losses of the past two weeks,
that might insult the Clippers and Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz almost toyed with its past rivals, who only a year ago
ran almost neck-and-neck in their playoff series. But when Utah
pulled away for an easy 91-78 win Friday night at Compaq Center, in
its fifth game in six days, the Jazz sent the Rockets reeling in
ways even the humiliating losses to the NBA's lesser lights could
not.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to right themselves before the playoffs begin a week from
today, the Rockets stood next to a Western Conference contender and
came up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to get psychological; we just played
terrible,'' Rockets forward Charles Barkley said. ``Everybody has
to look themselves in the mirror and say, `I (stink).'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed and frustrated right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual enough for the Rockets to hold a
20-minute postgame meeting. They had fallen into a tie with the
Lakers in their race for the home-court advantage in the first
round of the playoffs, but the Lakers hold the tiebreaker. But more
than that, the Rockets saw how far they are from being ready to win
in the playoffs on any court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're ready right now,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``But if we make a commitment and stay together and have some
positive goals, we can do it. The only way out of this thing is
growing and getting closer together. It's never too late.''
</P>
<P>
   When Friday's game seemed to be getting close, the Rockets
rallied several times only to shut down with time running out. The
Rockets had come back from as much as 15 down to within five
heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They hardly had dominated that run back into the game, but they
scored 14 points in five minutes to end the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen had taken a defensive rebound the length of the
court to set up Sam Mack for a 3-pointer, then drove from one board
to the other for a tough layup.
</P>
<P>
   But after putting themselves in position to get a win they had
to have, the Rockets missed their first eight shots of the fourth
quarter and four free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed some easy opportunities,'' Pippen said. ``We had the
opportunity when the game was close and weren't able to take
advantage of it. They know what to do at crunch time. We made
mistakes. We missed easy shots. We turned the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon missed a drive, a jumper and a hook, had a
turnover and missed two free throws. He finished with 28 points but
had to take 23 shots, making nine, to get there. Barkley missed a
jumper and finished with 10 points, his high against the Jazz this
season.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley tried a 3, only to miss and end up forced to foul
Karl Malone on a breakaway, Malone completed a three-point play for
a 78-65 Utah lead with 4:11 left, finishing off the Rockets, who
still had not made a fourth-quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Malone finished with 25 points, 13 rebounds and five assists.
Jazz point guard John Stockton had his customary 11 points and nine
assists, with just one turnover. And the difference between the
reeling Rockets and the rolling-again Jazz was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They execute so well,'' said Antoine Carr, late of the past
two Jazz Western Conference championship teams. ``One thing we have
to learn, especially when it gets tight in the last five minutes,
we have to execute and do what the coach says, run the plays the
chief says. You can't have 12 chiefs and one Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we can win, if we play like things really
matter. But I'm used to being aggressive every game. Right now,
we're coasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Price hit a pair of 3s and Pippen, who finished with 15
points, hit one to stall the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more troublesome than the meltdown that had put them
in this position, the Rockets began to play carelessly down the
stretch, as if giving up, at least for the night, on more than just
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the way at the end of the game it got out of
hand,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Suddenly, we were just fouling guys in
the backcourt. It looked like we lost our poise.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked _ and after the game sounded _ as if they had begun to
lose their belief the mix could come together and work, hoping to
find that confidence in a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are not going right, you see a lot of problems
compound,'' Olajuwon said. ``Things become more and more difficult.
When you're down on each other, you're making mistakes. We're in
that stage of the game. We know we can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   But better would not close the gap, and not just the difference
between the Rockets and the Jazz, owner of the league's best record
and nine consecutive regular-season wins against the Rockets. After
dropping five of their past six games, the Rockets have a long way
to go to match their level of play of a month ago.

   ``We feel very strongly about our team,'' Pippen said. ``Even
though we're struggling on the court, we're very positive we have
what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a blind faith, the evidence impossible to find
elsewhere. &QL;

   KOSOVO-JACKSON (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The three captive
American servicemen held by Yugoslavia talked on Friday with Jesse
Jackson while the chairman of the military court monitored the
questions through a Yugoslav army interpreter and a military
cameraman recorded their answers. They said that they are being
kept in separate cells, have no contact with each other or with
other prisoners in the same facility, and had seldom walked outside
their cells during their monthlong imprisonment. But they said they
are generally well-fed and have no medical problems. By Susan
Sachs. With photos.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Washington) _ The Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, insisted in an interview released here Friday that
Yugoslavs were ``willing to die'' to defend their rights but at the
same time outlined what he described as a six point plan for
settlement of the war. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-APACHE (Washington) _ One night, maybe soon, the first
U.S. Apache helicopters are supposed to take off from a makeshift
base in Albania and fly into Kosovo to try to do what NATO's
high-flying jets have not done: eviscerate Yugoslavia's armored
forces. Such attacks carry enormous risk, though. And for that
reason President Clinton still has not approved their use in combat
in the Balkans. By Steven Lee Myers. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RAPE (Skopje, Macedonia) _ Sherife Alickaj, 18, is one of
a small group of ethnic Albanian women willing to say openly that
they were sexually assaulted by Serbian soldiers during the chaotic
exodus from Kosovo. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-BOMB (London) _ A nail-bomb ripped through a gay bar in
London's Soho district Friday night, killing at least two people
and injuring 73 and leaving the city on edge after two other bomb
attacks this month in minority neighborhoods. The police said
Friday that they believed all three attacks were linked to extreme
right-wing groups. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PROTEST (Beijing) _ Fearing that members of the Buddhist
Law movement might demonstrate again in coming days, China's
leaders issued a warning Friday morning to all government officials
and employees of state-run institutions not to take part in any
such protests. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REPORT (Washington) _ In what American officials
described as a move they hoped would ease relations with Iran, the
State Department dropped its designation of the Teheran government
as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. By Philip
Shenon.

<P>
   TENN-HEALTHCARE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ In one bold stroke,
Tennessee converted its Medicaid health benefits to managed care
five years ago and used the savings to cover people who couldn't
afford health insurance of their own or were too sick to qualify.
With 3 million people enrolled, its program, called TennCare,
became the most ambitious and generous government health plan in
the nation. But with TennCare's costs rising and Tennessee facing a
budget deficit, the program is facing retrenchment at the orders of
Gov. Don Sundquist. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Littleton, Colo.) _ Law enforcement
officials here acknowledged Friday that they did little to follow
up a complaint a neighbor made last year that one of the teen-agers
responsible for the killings at Columbine High School last week
``talks often of making pipe bombs and using them to kill numerous
people.'' By James Brooke. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-BACKLASH (Brookline, Mass.) _ It has always been
hard to be the one called a freak, geek, dweeb, weirdo. For many,
it just got a little harder. In scattered reports from around the
country, high school students who dress defiantly, or who are
computer lovers, or who qualify in any way as outcasts, say that
since the killings in Littleton, Colo., last week, they feel as if
they have become perceived not only as different but as threats. By
Carey Goldberg. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-GUNS (Denver) _ Gathering here for their annual
convention just a day after Littleton, Colo., finished burying its
slain children, officials of the National Rifle Association on
Friday rejected any suggestion that the gun lobby was responsible
for the shooting rampage that left 15 people dead, and insisted
that they would stand fast against any new gun control. By
Katharine Q. Seelye. With photos.

   TRUCK-EMISSIONS (Washington) _ President Clinton has approved
strict federal rules to control pollution from the tailpipes of
automobiles and end the special treatment for sport utility
vehicles for the first time since federal emissions standards were
drafted in the early 1970s. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   HOFFA-TEAMSTERS (Washington) _ Even now, little more than a
month after taking office, the Teamsters president, James Phillip
Hoffa, still has a touch of ``I-can't-believe-this-happened''
amazement in his manner as he sits in the office his father once
used. By Steven Greenhouse. With photos.

<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ America's extraordinary economic boom _
the second-longest so far in more than a century and a half _ shows
no signs of flagging. Despite a decline in auto production and
another sharp deterioration in the nation's trade balance, the U.S.
economy grew at a surprisingly robust 4.5 percent rate this winter,
the government reported. That is the sort of heady pace usually
associated with the first, not the eighth, year of an economic
expansion. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   BROKERS-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ The Justice Department has
opened a broad antitrust investigation into the practices of some
of Wall Street's largest securities firms in setting rates for
initial public offerings, federal officials and defense lawyers
said. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIAONE _ Disturbed by AT&AMP;T Corp.'s cable television ambitions,
America Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp. may back Comcast Corp. in
its fight against AT&AMP;T to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the big
cable television carrier. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-INVEST (Tosno, Russia) _ The economic collapse confirmed
the worst corporate fears about Russia: It is too unstable to
operate here. Companies such as Pizza Hut and Hershey have pulled
out, and many that had considered entering Russia shelved their
plans. Yet a number of Western multinationals _ Caterpillar,
Nestle, Lucent Technologies and others _ are coping with the
economic crisis by settling deeper into Russia rather than pulling
out. By Neela Banerjee. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Signs that a bustling economy might finally
produce a long-feared bout of inflation sent stock and bond prices
tumbling Friday. But the spring revival of cyclical stocks was
still strong enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average to a
gain of 10.2 percent in April, the biggest monthly gain in more
than a decade. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-STOCK-TRADING (Undated) _ In an attempt to combat
securities fraud among small over-the-counter stocks, the
Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed that brokerage
firms do more of the policing. The proposal has received a flood of
criticism from traders, investors and stock issuers. By Gretchen
Morgenson.

   LEWIS-COLUMN (Jerusalem) _ One of Israel's notable achievements,
in the 50 years since the state was reborn, has been the
development of a respected legal system. The Israeli Supreme Court
is known for protecting the civil liberties of citizens. Its judges
are esteemed around the world. That achievement is at stake in
Israel's upcoming elections. By Anthony Lewis.

become fodder for mainstream media accounts or occasional cocktail

O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERSON-RACE (Cambridge, Mass.) _ At times Orlando Patterson
seems to be mouthing the arguments of racial neoconservatives. An
African-American who teaches sociology at Harvard University,
Patterson asserts that problems in many black neighborhoods stem
less from white racism than from the breakdown of the black family.
In other moments, he sounds like a traditional liberal, insisting
slavery and the Southern sharecropping system are to blame for
breaking down the family structure. Such iconoclastic views have
helped turn Patterson, 59, into one of the most provocative
thinkers on the status of blacks today. By Steven A. Holmes. With

   COMICS-THREAT (Undated) _ Amid the nation's focus on violence
and video games, a look back at a time when when comic books were

   FBN-PATRIOTS-STADIUM (Hartford, Conn.) _ Five months after the
New England Patriots announced a startling plan to move to
Connecticut, the football team said Friday it was walking away from
the most lucrative stadium deal in professional sports now that
Massachusetts is willing to pay to keep the team.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   RAC-DERBY (Lexington, Ky.) _ Bob Baffert will take aim on
history with three horses in the 125th Derby: the entry of General
Challenge and Excellent Meeting, owned by Betty and John Mabee of
Golden Eagle Farm in California, and Prime Timber, owned by Marie
and Aaron Jones of Oregon. If he wins, he will become the first
trainer to win both races since Ben Jones won the Oaks in 1952 with
Real Delight and the Derby with Hill Gail. By Joseph Durso.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-DERBY-BET (Lexington, Ky.) _ At least for two minutes on
Saturday, Dallas Keen, Akiko Gothard, Dallas Stewart, Scotty
Schulhofer and Elliott Walden will be linked together in the 125th
running of the Kentucky Derby. Their horses have been lumped
together in the race's mutuel field. For horse racing aficionados
that means Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia determined
these five horses were the least likely to win in a crowded
20-horse field. For casual fans, however, that means a sort of
Sam's Club bargain opportunity. Think of it as buying in bulk _ a
$2 bet on No. 14 in the program brings five horses for the price of
one in one of the most wide-open fields in Kentucky Derby history.
By Joe Drape.

   OLY-ATLANTA (Atlanta) _ The organizing committee for the 1996
Atlanta Olympics will release some of the files pertaining its bid
selection process for the Summer Games. By Jere Longman.

<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The finishing touch was a bellyslide, a
glorious, impromptu glide along the ice with arms stretched in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter buried his goal and then rode the wave of his own
emotion, propelled in joy, finally gliding to a stop and being
piled upon by his Bruins teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Carter found the perfect wave, right here on Tobacco Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my Fleet leap, but I save that for home,'' said Carter,
moments after sliding in his backhand at 14:45 of the second
overtime, lifting the Bruins to a 4-3 victory and a 3-2 series lead
over the Hurricanes Friday night at Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the World Juniors, and one of my teammates, Martin
Gendron, slid just like that on his stomach. It's the first thing
that came to my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that, you just do it on instinct. It's what
came to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflexes and instinct begin to wane the longer overtime goes.
Legs turn to mush. The thinking process breaks down. What should be
an easy forehand tap pass can feel like moving a curling stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a heavyweight fight out there after a while,''
said Carter. ``You pick your spots. You aren't trying for the
knockout punch. You jab, and stick your move.''
</P>
<P>
   But the knockout punch, the one that certainly now has the
'Canes leaning over the ropes, dazed and bewildered, came on a
Carter-Joe Thornton combination 1-2 punch. Carter fed to Thornton,
and Thornton returned to Carter, and with a dash across the crease
Carter soon would be sweeping in his winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I scored on him, I went forehand on him,'' said
Carter, thinking of his previous goal in the series against
Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe. ``Maybe that's what he was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back of his mind, Carter was thinking about rule No. 1
for the scorer: when on a breakaway, go with your best move. This
was not his best move. If he had been barreling straight in on
Irbe, perhaps he would have gone with his reliable forehand lift.
But here he had an angle, a move with a view, and the approach gave
him an option.
</P>
<P>
   Carter held his shot, kept cutting right-left across the front
of the crease, Irbe locking onto his approach and moving laterally
across his shaded blue patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tracked me right across,'' said Carter. ``But I saw an
opening, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Right he was. Carter carried toward the left post, pulled the
puck to his backhand, and swept in the winner. Irbe was beaten to
the stick side, a spot that grew more vulnerable for the goalie as
the night progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe saw me,'' said Carter, who didn't have to holler for the
feed, Thornton knowing that his linemate was in full stride. ``I
passed to him, saw an opening, and hit the hole as hard as I can.
Joe made a great saucer pass over their guy and put me in full
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Can one play, one goal, make a team? In the years ahead, will
Carter cashing in against the 'Canes define what the Bruins do, who
they are, as the new millennium approaches?
</P>
<P>
   There is no knowing.
</P>
<P>
   We remember the Big, Bad Bruins for Bobby Orr's goal against the
Blues in the '70 Cup finals. Orr, to Derek Sanderson, back to Orr.
Puck behind Glenn Hall. A Stanley Cup in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's goal didn't even clinch a first-round series. The
'Canes come to the Fleet on Sunday for Game 6, with a chance of
sending it back here for deciding Game 7 Tuesday night. But if
there is any stock to be put in momentum, in having one spirit
lifted and another one flattened, then Carter's goal could be what
makes a young team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have waited a very long time for something like this,
a huge goal, a big break, for fate to come and kiss them on the
head instead of kicking them in their arses. Admit it. When the
game rolled into the second OT, you had visions of Petr Klima
swirling in your head. You thought of power outages and
transformers blowing. You remembered the old Garden, the last train
on the Green Line, the 27 years without a Stanley Cup, the decades
of dreams demolished on the roads between Boston and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   But for one night, with one sweet sweep, Carter's goal brought a
different ending. The Hub's hockey team hung in there, went long
into the night, and made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Carter slid, and slid, and slid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd lost it,'' he said. ``There's no way I would have
slept (Friday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Carter came to the Boston dressing room a dejected man at the
end of regulation. He blamed himself for Sami Kapanen's goal with
1:45 left, the goal that forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the sideboards, and I was sleeping,'' he recalled.
``(Paul) Coffey jumped by me at the boards and helped keep the puck
in the zone. That's what led to the goal. It was my fault. I came
in here the goat. I felt awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two periods later, the goat would be the hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not my best move, either,'' said a jubilant Carter. ``I've got
another in my bag of tricks. But I'll save that for another time.''

<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Twists and turns. Momentum shifts. Crazy
bounces. A million highs and nearly as many lows. It was
nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat, crazy. It was vintage playoff
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It took 94 minutes 45 seconds, and it wasn't decided until Anson
Carter took a pass from Joe Thornton and beat Carolina goalie
Arturs Irbe with a backhand shot to the stick side at 14:45 of
double overtime to give the Bruins a 4-3 victory in Game 5 Friday
night at Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Boston now has a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference quarterfinal, and can wrap up the series with a victory
in Game 6 tomorrow night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were full of relief and the Hurricanes were full of
disappointment and regret over missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go out there for another shift,'' said
defenseman Ray Bourque, who played 53:26 (57 shifts) out of a
possible 94:45. It was the most ice time he'd seen since Game 1 in
the Stanley Cup finals against Edmonton in 1990, a game that went
three overtimes. ``I didn't see it. I just had my head down and I
was trying to rest for my next shift. I got my head up and I see AC
going for a dive. It was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina very nearly ended it much earlier at 5:14 of overtime
No. 2. Martin Gelinas had a wide-open net and Byron Dafoe was out
of position, and Bourque got back first. Gelinas hit the puck, it
popped up, Bourque tried to whack Gelinas's stick, and Gelinas hit
the puck again and it bounced out of his reach and out of harm's
way. It appeared that Bourque had saved it with the shaft of his
stick, but Bourque said no. His stick actually missed the puck as
Gelinas hit it the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He double hit it,'' said Bourque. ``He hit it forward and then
he hit it backward. We caught a huge break. He had the whole net to
shoot at. I couldn't believe it. I've done that on the golf course
and then you look around and say, `Did I just do that?' He couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That play _ and Bourque's overall performance _ was special,
according to Carolina coach Paul Maurice. ``Ray Bourque played 52
minutes (last night),'' said Maurice. ``He actually took a shift in
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two periods belonged to Carolina. Throughout the
series, the Bruins have had a hard time coming out of the gate. The
Hurricanes have come out flying, dictating the play. Too often, the
Bruins have been back on their heels initially and then finished
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was no exception. Defenseman Steve Chiasson gave
the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead on the power play at 3:49. Then Ray
Sheppard made it 2-0 at 15:19 of the second, and the Bruins
appeared to be in deep, deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players that if we can't do better than this, we
might as well warm the plane up and get going, never mind the
period,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, too, was not happy. ``The first two periods we didn't
play too well,'' he said. ``We talked about going out and leaving
it on the ice and giving us an opportunity by going out and trying
to score one goal and get us back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was Bourque who scored it, starting the barrage of three
goals in a span of 1:52, causing a 180-degree swing. The Bruins
went up, 3-2, and it appeared until very late in regulation that
Boston wouldn't be touched.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's turnaround began in the first minute when Bourque beat
Irbe from the slot on a rebound of a Dmitri Khristich shot at the
34-second mark to pull Boston within 2-1. Only 1:03 later, with the
Bruins on the power play after Gary Roberts was called for boarding
Tim Taylor, sending him to the dressing room with a shoulder
injury, defenseman Darren Van Impe made them pay. He took a pass
from Bourque, dishing from the right point, and blasted a shot from
the left point that beat Irbe to the stick side inside the left
post.
</P>
<P>
   Then a neutral zone turnover less than a half-minute later by
defenseman Marek Malik sent the Bruins down the ice on a two-on-one
break. With only defenseman Glen Wesley back, left wing P.J.
Axelsson, flanked by center Jason Allison, scored an unassisted
goal when he beat Irbe with a shot into the top left corner for the
3-2 lead at 2:26.
</P>
<P>
   But then, bam! The Hurricanes tied it on a Sami Kapanen strike
with 1:45 left, sending the game into overtime. Kapanen took a
cross-crease pass from Roberts and beat Dafoe at 18:45.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had chances in the first extra period. Carolina had
one at the 2:21 mark when Wesley rattled a shot off the crossbar.
Then came Gelinas's chance, and that miss set up Carter's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give the players credit, they really came out and
battled hard to get the go-ahead goal,'' said Burns. ``Then it's a
long overtime. Everyone fought hard. When a guy like Ray plays 53
minutes, that's a lot of time on the ice. He saved the game for us
for sure. Gelinas will probably have trouble sleeping (last night).
He certainly missed that one. But that's what overtime is about.''

   NEW YORK _ A former paralegal at a New York law firm was
convicted Friday of bilking investors of $7 million in a forgery
scheme involving more than 200 documents said to be in the
handwriting of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence X. Cusack III was found guilty of creating the bogus
documents and then having them authenticated by experts. The most
explosive of the papers falsely linked Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe
and a Chicago mob figure.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, who had insisted that the papers were authentic and that
he was innocent, appeared stunned as the verdict was read in U.S
District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Denise L. Cote ordered that Cusack be confined to his home
in Connecticut until his sentencing on July 30. Cusack, 48, faces
up to five years in prison, but prosecutors said they would seek a
longer term because of the large sums lost to investors, the
misrepresentation of history and the tarnishing of Kennedy's
reputation. Cusack could also face millions of dollars in fines and
restitution orders.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack left the courthouse without comment. His lawyer, Robert
F. Katzberg, would say only that there would be an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's scheme fooled more than 100 investors, prosecutors
said, as well as several journalists, whom Cusack tried to use in
an attempt to publicize the materials and enhance their value.
</P>
<P>
   The government had argued during the trial that money was
Cusack's motive, and that appeared to have had an impact on the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the dollar signs _ period,'' said George Spencer,
foreman of the jury, which deliberated for one-and-a-half days.
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, who refused to give his name, said: ``We went
through a lot of evidence, and it was clear the documents were
frauds.''
</P>
<P>
   In presenting their case, the prosecutors, Paul A. Engelmayer
and Peter G. Neiman, offered voluminous evidence showing that
Cusack's claim that the papers were genuine was historically
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   One document, for example, was purported to have been signed by
Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe in 1960, in the Carlyle Hotel in New
York. But one of Kennedy's secretaries, Janet Des Rosiers, whose
signature also appeared on the document, denied ever having seen
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Des Rosiers also produced the flight logs of Kennedy's
airplane, showing that on the date the document had was said to
have been signed, Kennedy was campaigning in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Engelmayer said in his summation that Cusack ``tried to hijack
history in order to feed his own extravagant habits, and support
his own quest for luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented evidence that Cusack had been spending as
much as $50,000 a month on luxury cars and Gucci loafers.
</P>
<P>
   In Cusack's defense, Katzberg suggested that prosecutors were
focusing on Cusack's lifestyle because their case was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many pairs of Gucci loafers does it take for
somebody to be guilty?'' Katzberg mused in his closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Katzberg said that the documents might be fakes, but Cusack had
not made them, and he sold them believing they were genuine.
</P>
<P>
   But John M. Reznikoff, an autograph dealer who was helping
Cusack market the papers, testified that Cusack had tearfully
confessed to him that he had forged the documents after Peter
Jennings, the ABC News anchor, had challenged the papers'
authenticity in an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said Cusack then started to pace around the room,
saying, ``Can't we just give all the money back?''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Once again Mo Vaughn provided the spark.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of driving the Anaheim Angels to a win with his bat on
Friday night, it was Vaughn's body that got the big hit. It spurred
the Angels to a 3-1 win over the Chicago White Sox before 35,053
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the eighth inning, the teams were tied at one. White
Sox starter Jaime Navarro walked the first two batters he faced --
Orlando Palmeiro and Randy Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   As Vaughn was due up next, White Sox manager Jerry Manuel pulled
Navarro and brought in reliever Bill Simas.
</P>
<P>
   Simas plunked Vaughn in the chest with the very first pitch, a
cut fastball. Vaughn started out to the mound, but was restrained
by umpire Durwood Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   The stands erupted. Fans who came to see the post-game fireworks
show, thought they might see some on the field. Instead Vaughn made
his way to first, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he didn't charge the mound because he didn't want to
risk a three-day suspension. He also knew his teammates would be
fired-up
</P>
<P>
   `When I see a guy on my team get hit, I'm trying to knock
somebody's head off,` Vaughn said. `I'm sure my teammates feel the
same way. `Whatever motivates you you use,` Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Tim Salmon took a Simas fastball to deep center
and sacrificed home Orlando Palmiero for the go-ahead run. With
Troy Glaus at the plate, Randy Velarde stole third. White Sox
catcher Brook Fordyce overthrew his attempted pick off and Velarde
came home for the third and final run.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he saw the pitch coming at him the moment it left
Simas' hand.
</P>
<P>
   `I seen it coming toward me and I was steaming,` he said. `I
just said to myself, `I'll take it and do what I got to do.`
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Simas said he wasn't aiming for Vaughn. The pitch
simply got away.
</P>
<P>
   `Anybody that knows the game, knows that I wasn't trying to hit
him,` Simas said. `After it happened the umpire told me not to
antagonize him, but he was staring at me and I'm not going to turn
my back on him and give him a chance to charge the mound.`
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the hot Angel bats that produced 29 runs in two
previous games cooled off a bit as the team came up with just 5
hits in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks, who started the game for the Angels
went 7 2/3 innings, the longest outing by an Angel starter yet this
season. Mark Petkovsek appeared in relief and got the win.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks gave up just five hits, while striking out four and
walking five. He threw 133 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Jaime Navarro got the loss and dropped to 1-2
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams will meet again tonight in a 7 p.m. matchup that
marks the halfway point in a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored first when former Dodger Paul Konerko, hitting
just .197 coming into the game, singled off Sparks with no outs in
the fourth in the fourth to drive in Magglio Ordonez. As the White
Sox leadoff hitter in the fourth, Ordonez reached on a single, then
stole second before scoring. Sparks worked himself out of the
inning by getting the next three batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Sparks seemed sharp. The first two batters he faced
went down easily. Things got rockier though after he walked Frank
Thomas and gave up a single to Ordonez. Luckily, Greg Norton flied
out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm just happy with the way it turned out tonight,` Sparks
said. `This game was a good building block for me.`
</P>
<P>
   The Angel half of the inning was hardly more productive. With
one out Velarde went the opposite way and doubled down the right
field line.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn advanced him to third with a ground out. Salmon followed
that with a powerful shot to left, but it was caught at the warning
track by Chicago's Jeff Abbot.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel half of the second inning mirrored the first. Darin
Erstad reached on a double off the scoreboard in right center, but
his teammates were unable to advance him.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim threatened again in the fourth. Vaughn led off with a
sharp single to left. Then Salmon reached on a fielder's choice
that saw Vaughn cut down at second. Erstad and Glaus ended the
inning for the Angels with a pair of outs.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to brighten in the fifth. Anderson's 387-foot lead
off homer on a 2-0 pitch evened the game at one. Later in the
inning, Orlando Palmeiro got to first on a walk, but he was
stranded there when Velarde flied out.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Angels were back to stranding runners. With
one out, Salmon got aboard on a double to left. Erstad hit into a
fielder's choice sending Salmon to third. Glaus, the next batter,
flied out to center ending the inning. Manager Terry Collins
chalked up his team's early misfortune to good pitching by Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   `He was impressive,` Collins said. `We didn't drive in runs
because he pitched a good game.`

NATO SAYS NEW BOMBING IS THE STRONGEST EFFORT YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add last graf with NATO comment on Yugoslav Defense
Ministry as bombing target.) (af) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO Friday night unleashed what officials
described as the most aggressive bombing in the five-week air war,
hitting Serbian tanks and armored vehicles in Kosovo and bridges in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third day in a row of fierce attacks, taking
advantage of clear weather that forecasters expect to continue
through the weekend, according to the Pentagon. The Pentagon said
650 missions were scheduled for Friday, the most to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the best weather we've had since the operation
started,'' Maj. Gen. Charles Wald of the Air Force told a briefing
at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the State Department announced it would fly
the first of 20,000 Kosovo refugees to the United States next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the flow of refugees rapidly overwhelming resources in
Albania and Macedonia, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced that the Clinton administration was changing the rules to
transfer refugees to the United States. The new rules would allow
the first 400 Kosovar Albanians to go directly to Fort Dix, N.J., a
former Army training base, for processing and immediate reunion
with families around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three days, 19,500 refugees have arrived in
Macedonia. The assistant secretary of State for refugee affairs,
Julia Taft, said the administration and private groups had received
offers from 45,000 people to provide housing and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian-American families had already identified 1,800 refugees
who are their relatives and welcome in their homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the second day of the increased air effort,
NATO hit targets that included the Defense Ministry and Yugoslav
Army headquarters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we took the battle back to the heart of Belgrade,''
a spokesman for the allied military command, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe
Marani, told a briefing in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But Marani acknowledged that one bomb had malfunctioned and
missed its target in predawn strikes. Several civilian houses were
destroyed in the Vracar district, a mile from downtown, and
Yugoslav state media said at least four people had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry headquarters was hit for the first time, a
spokesman for the allies said, and an ammunition-storage area and a
television broadcasting antenna south of the city were also hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that allied plans had also pounded the
Pristina airfield on Thursday night with 5,000-pound ``bunker
buster'' bombs, the debut of that weapon in the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said allied planes were more successful striking
surface-to-air missile and radar sites on Thursday night,
reflecting better information and familiarity with the battlefield.
``We're getting better and better intelligence,'' he said, ``and
it's accumulating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican leaders moved to block a vote on a
bipartisan measure championed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that
would instruct President Clinton to use ``all necessary force and
other means'' against Serbia. The foreign relations committee sent
the measure to the floor without a recommendation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the minority
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, will move to put off the
legislation on Monday, Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other Senate Republican leaders had considered a
alternative, a bill to require the president to seek congressional
approval before deploying ground troops. But the ill will generated
by a debate on the war in the House this week dampened the Senate's
enthusiasm for open argument, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to postpone without prejudice any further debate on
involvement in the Balkans,'' Daschle said. ``We'll save that
debate for another day.''
</P>
<P>
   That day may arrive when the Senate takes up a measure to pay
for the war during the week of May 10, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., filed a suit Friday with a
bipartisan group of 16 other lawmakers that contended that just
Congress had the power to declare war and that the Clinton
administration was violating the Constitution by participating in
the Kosovo conflict without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, Gen. Hugh H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, arrived Friday and visited 3,800 American troops, telling
them that the NATO air campaign was beginning to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is conducting air operations over Yugoslavia both day and
night, virtually around the clock,'' Shelton said. ``Our military
strikes have taken a heavy toll on Milosevic's forces and his
security infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright appeared with the chief prosecutor of the
International Tribunal for War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia,
Louise Arbour. Judge Arbour said she was promoting a more
aggressive plan for arresting those indicted for war crimes in
Bosnia as a deterrent to Serb troops' committing atrocities in
neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has yet to agree to help make those
arrests, Judge Arbour said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is absolutely critical to see a very robust action on
the outstanding warrants. I think that could have a very immediate
impact, would be the demonstration that we have the capacity to
investigate. And we have partners who have the political will and
the operational skills to execute arrest warrants, even in hostile
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arbour declined to comment on a report that she was
planning to leave her post as chief prosecutor. Officials say she
is the prime candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada, a
position that will be vacant in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates and Clinton administration officials have
expressed concern that her departure would weaken the prosecutions
of war crimes at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Yugoslavia's Defense Ministry headquarters had not
been bombed before, a NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said: ``The
headquarters of the special police, which we attacked some time
ago, were a larger priority target. The Ministry of Defense is
important as well. It's really a question of trying to identify
locations which are the brain of these operations.''

GRAND SLAM ATMOSPHERE MERITS EQUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yes, in tennis the men play best-of-five. Yes, those
matches can prove more grueling and more epic than ``Braveheart.''
And yes, if tennis players were paid by the minute, the men should
get more, since a women's singles match can last just a little
longer than an episode of ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   (Are we allowed to talk about the scorched-earth aces served in
men's matches, where a ``rally'' is anything longer than a service
winner? Or those times during men's matches when a player tanks an
entire set to conserve energy for the next one? Just asking.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is a bigger point to be made here.
</P>
<P>
   When the old guard at Wimbledon rejected a bid by the Women's
Tennis Association this week to dole out equal prize money between
the men and the women, they failed to recognize a basic, glorious
fact about their lawn party.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the Grand Slams is that four times a year _ on the
red clay at Roland Garros, on the grass at Wimbledon, in the heat
and cacophony of New York and down under in the sun of Australia _
the best tennis players in the world, men and women, gather for
very special championship tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a Grand Slam a Grand Slam is that men and women share
equal billing and are competing for the same prestigious, coveted
titles. The presence of everyone is what makes these fortnights so
intriguing and more than warrants equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's the real difference between $728,000 for the men
and $655,200 for the women? If it's just a matter of principle, of
thinking men deserve more, then the principle is downright
Jurassic.
</P>
<P>
   STAYIN' ALIVE: The Nuggets were fine guests of the city Friday
night. Nick Van Exel and Antonio McDyess let the Sonics and their
fans have a nice time at KeyArena, meaning the Sonics are still
alive with three games to go in this nutball NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Showtime on Sunday. And we do mean Showtime, since the
Los Angeles Lakers appear to have regained a little of their lost
luster after beating the Blazers and taking to heart Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar's constructive jabs.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonic faithful, who want to see the fellas in the
postseason yet again, let's just hope there is no repeat of the
Sonics' national TV shellacking last Sunday at the Delta Center in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE ROSES: Got to love the fillies in the Kentucky Derby. We
want to see Three Ring set the pace with early speed, although
we'll have to put money down on Bob Baffert's Excellent Meeting,
even if it's an exacta box with the big boys, Menifee and Prime
Timber.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED DEMON? Word is the Mariners are looking to add more speed
to their lineup even with the welcome addition (unless you're Butch
Huskey) of Brian Hunter _ Mariner left fielder No. 9,999 (or
something like that) since Ken Griffey Jr. took over in center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with Hunter at leadoff, does that mean we will never see
Lou Piniella pencil in a lineup that starts off with David Segui,
Edgar Martinez, Griffey and Jay Buhner?
</P>
<P>
   Boy, would that be a relief.
</P>
<P>
   WHY WORRY: When Stan Williams went to the mound Friday night
after Jeff Fassero gave up two home runs to Toronto in the third
inning, what do you bet the pitching coach told the Mariner starter
to chill out. What's a 5-3 deficit to a team that came back from
6-1 to win 22-6 _ and take center stage on ``SportsCenter'' for a
day?
</P>
<P>
   And lo and behold, Griffey comes through with his second grand
slam in two days to give the Mariners a win.
</P>
<P>
   JOSE CAN YOU SEE: Speaking of Mariner left fielders: It's always
good to see Jose Cruz Jr. in the Kingdome, no matter the color of
his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC MESS: First, Johnson &AMP; Johnson announces it won't spend
money sponsoring the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. Then,
this week, the United States Olympic Committee's head marketing
man, John Krimsky, abruptly announces his resignation. Now the word
is that Salt Lake is shockingly behind its $850 million in
fund-raising _ thanks to the backlash over the International
Olympic Committee's goodie grab bag gluttony and Salt Lake's
willingness to grease palms, pocketbooks and bank vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake's new Olympic marketing slogan should be: Brother, can
you spare a luge _ and about $300 million?
</P>
<P>
   THOSE TIMBERCUBBIES: Deep down, the Sonics are praying that
Minnesota continues its slide and falls out of the playoff picture.
The T-Wolves posted a win Friday night, making every one of the
Sonics' last three games crucial. At least last season, the Sonics
were actually in the playoffs before the T-Wolves almost knocked
them off.
</P>
<P>
   INSPECTING THE GOODS: Maybe the Sonics didn't know Billy Owens
would get injured when they signed the free agent, but there is a
scale somewhere at the Sonics' training facility, no?
</P>
<P>
   THE LONGEST YARD, BRONCO STYLE: John Elway's retirement
announcement is such old news, it's almost time for him to announce
his comeback.

SONICS FLATTEN NUGGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On his first touch of the game Friday night, Vin Baker
drew an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he was just being aggressive. So to prove his point,
the next time he received the ball, Baker whirled past two
defenders and dunked with two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Baker did what he had to do, and so did the Sonics, defeating
the Denver Nuggets 111-101 at KeyArena to keep their playoff hopes
alive.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not well with Baker, who returned from a deep bruise
in his right knee but played only six minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is perhaps more frantic than anyone about this tiny fact:
The Sonics still need help to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (23-24) remain in ninth place in the Western
Conference standings _ one game behind Minnesota and Sacramento
with three regular-season games left.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, the Sonics need to sweep their remaining games
and need Minnesota to lose twice in order to make the postseason.
The Timberwolves own the tiebreaker should they finish in a tie
with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that is what Baker reminded Sonic brass of after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Furious about his lack of playing time, Baker met with Sonics
coach Paul Westphal, team president Wally Walker, co-captain Gary
Payton and Baker's agent, Eric Goodwin, immediately following the
game.
</P>
<P>
   That latest development kept the Sonics from opening the locker
room in a timely fashion for postgame interviews. Only a few
players were present when the locker room finally opened.
</P>
<P>
   No one would comment when they emerged from Westphal's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee feels good and this is a crucial point of the
season,'' Baker said before the game. ``I feel better. I wouldn't
be on the floor if I couldn't play. I'm ready to give the team any
minutes I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In his postgame conference with the media, Westphal said Baker
was not in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to play him a little bit more, but
circumstances didn't really warrant it,'' Westphal said. ``I don't
think he looked sharp, but I give him credit for doing everything
he can to get out there and help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to As The Sonics Turn. The Baker saga comes one day
after Payton and those close to the All-Star guard went into damage
control for comments he made following Wednesday's 35-point loss at
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Sonics is a tough home game Sunday against the
Los Angeles Lakers on national television. Fortunately for the
Sonics, they finish with a pair of games in which they will be
heavily favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics play Dallas at home on Tuesday and conclude the
regular season Wednesday in Los Angeles against the Clippers.
Minnesota, meanwhile, ends its home schedule tonight against the
Clippers followed by road games at Houston and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento has the easiest schedule of the three teams fighting
for the last two playoff spots. The Kings close with home games
against Phoenix and Vancouver and one road game, at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to continue to win,'' Sonics guard Hersey Hawkins
said. ``That's all we're concerned about. ... If we just keep
winning, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The way this season has gone, who knows if they will. Maybe they
won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play the same as they did tonight, you know, passing
the ball around ... yeah, they can get into the playoffs,'' Denver
center Danny Fortson said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt about whether the Sonics deserved to win
Friday night's game. They trailed only once _ 2-0 47 seconds into
the game. From there, the Sonics used a 17-5 run to take control.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a season-high 32 assists, the Sonics pummeled the Nuggets
with offensive balance. Detlef Schrempf's 28 points led six players
in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing out of position a lot, particularly with Vin
out of the lineup,'' Westphal said of Schrempf. ``Just this week,
he's guarded Karl Malone twice and Brian Grant and then Antonio
McDyess. He's really just done an amazing job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics jumped in front 60-51 by halftime. Their biggest lead
was 83-67 with 2:53 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Denver cut the Sonics' 14-point lead to 100-95 with two minutes
left in the game. But Dale Ellis hit a 3-pointer, Schrempf made two
free throws and Hawkins made a short jumper to complete a 7-0 run
and remove all doubt from the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Backup point guard John Crotty did not play because of a
mild concussion he suffered during Wednesday's game at Portland.
... The team activated guard Drew Barry from the injured list to
replace Crotty in the lineup. James Cotton was placed on the
injured list with the stomach flu. ... The Nuggets are wearing
black patches on their uniforms to pay tribute to the victims of
the Columbine High School shootings. ... Baker decided he was ready
to play after a strong practice Thursday.

GRIFFEY'S SLAM IN 8TH LIFTS M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Griffey Jr. lifted his arms in the air as he
rounded first base and smiled as he bounded into the Mariners
dugout. In April.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners center fielder is not one to show his emotions.
Maybe under a pile of jubilant teammates in playoff victories over
the New York Yankees, but not in games before school's out.
</P>
<P>
   This one was different. Griffey, owner of one career hit in nine
at-bats against nasty Toronto Blue Jays lefty Graeme Lloyd, came to
bat with the bases loaded and one out, trailing by two in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Lloyd's first pitch screaming toward right center, and
it had just enough lift to carry over the wall for a grand slam.
The slam was Griffey's second in two days, and the decisive blow in
an 11-9 Mariners win in the Kingdome Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just emotion from coming from behind,'' Griffey said.
``Anytime you come from behind, it gives the team a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, whose one prior hit against Lloyd was a homer, said he
didn't come up looking to hit the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to stay out of the double play,'' he said.
``That's the biggest thing in that situation, staying out of the
double play and giving your team a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey became just the 18th player in baseball history to hit
grand slams in consecutive games. He has driven in 11 runs in his
past two games, a new Mariners record. His ninth home run of the
year moved him past Yogi Berra into a tie for 47th on the all-time
list with Johnny Mize, at 359.
</P>
<P>
   All three base runners who scored on the grand slam had been
walked by Jays reliever Robert Person, who had stifled a potential
rally an inning before with 96-mph heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great arm,'' said M's outfielder Butch Huskey, a
former minor-league roommate of Person's who walked before
Griffey's blast. ``He just has control problems sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' patience was as much the result of a conscious
effort as it was of one pitcher's wildness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working the counts better than we were earlier in the
year, and it's starting to show,'' said M's manager Lou Piniella.
``(Hitting coach Jesse Barfield) and I have talked about it and
preached it, and it pays dividends if you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was hurt far worse by walks than the Mariners. Starter
Jeff Fassero walked six, a Mariner high this season, but only one
of his free passes turned into a run. Fassero was hurt more by the
long ball _ he surrendered four homers, also a season high for an
M's pitcher, and lasted only 42/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said he was fighting himself with mechanical problems he
couldn't pinpoint. But he also was surprised the Blue Jays lifted
several good pitches _ a slider at the shoetops to Carlos Delgado,
a low fastball to Shawn Green, a fastball away to Jose Cruz Jr. _
over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought three of their hits were fly outs, and I watched two
go out and one go off the wall,'' Fassero said. ``It seemed like
pretty light air for this place. It seemed like it was a little
warm; I don't know if the heaters were on or what. But they can
swing the bats. They're definitely a low-ball hitting team. I've
learned that. Give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fassero departed, the M's got strong relief from winner
John Halama (1-2) and closer Jose Mesa, who converted his sixth
save in six chances.
</P>
<P>
   Before Griffey went to work, the Mariners' offensive hero was
Rafael Bournigal. The newly acquired shortstop drove in a run with
a sacrifice fly in the second and singled and scored in the fifth.
In the sixth, with a runner on, Bouringal poked a pitch down the
left field line for his third home run in 849 major league at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Bournigal's double-play partner, second baseman David Bell, left
the game after colliding with Toronto catcher Mark Dalesandro on a
double-steal attempt in the first inning. Bell was bloodied on the
play and needed eight stitches to close a gash on his chin that was
so deep, trainers could see his chin bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being five feet away from him, and I don't remember
anything else until I was on the ground,'' said Bell, who was
thankful Dalesandro's mask had come off on the throw to shortstop
seconds before. ``I remember going, `What is he going to do?' And
the next thing I knew, I was out.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a headache, Bell said, ``I don't really feel that
bad.''

COMMENTARY: DISSOLVES ON CONTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the mayor of Rye, N.Y., was introduced, I had to
stop myself from yelling over to the blonde in black, ``Hillary,
turn back before it's too late!''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, after all, could have been home in
Washington playing first lady. She could have been lounging in the
silk splendor of the White House residence. She could have been
asking a steward to pour her some white wine and commanding the
chastened president to massage her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was being tortured at the kind of New York dinner
where the name ``Aaron Burr'' was the punch line _ repeatedly. At
the annual Democratic Jefferson-Jackson fund-raising banquet at the
Hyatt on Thursday night, Mrs. Clinton suffered through dozens of
introductions of minor state and local political figures and 14
speeches that felt like 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   She has another glamorous trip to Buffalo and Ellis Island
planned for this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. The lady definitely wants to be a senator. It was pretty
evident when she studied up on all New York's agricultural crops
and started referring to herself and the state as ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's undeniable. You could tell because she was laughing
at the jokes of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, most often
described in the press as ``funereal.'' You could tell because she
had put away her pastels in favor of the Manhattan uniform of
black. You could tell from the body language of Harold Ickes, who
was bounding around the ballroom with a cat-swallowed-canary grin,
rejected as White House chief of staff by one Clinton but relied on
as New York strategist by another.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, you could tell because she sounded more Bill than
Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's becoming her husband,'' said one former White House
official who knows her well. ``The evolution is now complete.''
</P>
<P>
   She started out in '92 promising ``Buy one, get one free,''
offering a team of two separate professionals with individual
strengths. She was all spine, where he was all flexibility. She was
an ideologue, where he was a shapeshifter. She was a ``we've got to
fight and jam it down their throats'' firebrand, where he was a
smooth-talking compromiser.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's her turn to try to be all things to all people. To
slide to the center. To bend that famous spine. She no longer
mentions a Palestinian state. She has revealed that she favors the
death penalty, ``with caveats.''
</P>
<P>
   Her after-dinner speech had little fire or even New York
politics in it. The pols were hoping for Rudy flambe. Instead of
red meat, they got polenta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we should have a national conversation about
and a national campaign against youth violence,'' a touchy-feely
Mrs. Clinton told the crowd. Like her husband, she now treats talk
as action and silence as a cause for horror. She thinks if you
listen to people, you understand them, and that everybody is right
in his or her own way.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that dissolved on contact, she urged ``a broader
conversation about what kind of nation we are, what kind of people
we want to be ... how we're going to work out our disagreements.''
She called for a new millennial ``attitude'' forged from ``bringing
people of different backgrounds and points of view together to come
to some common agreement about what we should do for the common
good.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded by saying she hoped that ``as we move forward in
the next several years in our political process, in all the large
and small ways we work with one another, we make common bonds with
one another, we reach compromise over all kinds of issues, we will
be guided by the overwhelming desire to play a positive role in
bringing people together to work on behalf of the kind of country,
state, city and, yes, world'' we want.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton began his presidency with a national conversation
and now Hillary is beginning her de facto Senate campaign with a
national conversation. If only she wouldn't. There is way too much
talk in this country, too much blather, too much media, too much
psychobabble.
</P>
<P>
   If she must have a national dialogue, she should make it about
how we cope with the schiziness of a president's wife running for
the Senate out of the White House. Or help us work through our
anger at the way the first lady is running a personal shuttle
service between Washington and New York, largely on our dime. Give
me some closure on that _ quick!

COMMENTARY: AMERICA'S LITTLEST SHOOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When's the perfect time to give your child a gun?
</P>
<P>
   That's a difficult question for some parents. Is it when your
son is 12 years old? When your daughter is 14? You have to be
careful. You can't hand out high-powered weaponry willy-nilly. Some
children just won't know what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the leading
trade association for the gun industry in the United States, has
been helpful on this matter. A pamphlet distributed some years ago
by the foundation (and which still represents the foundation's
philosophy) answers the perplexing question, ``How old is old
enough?''
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet, ``When Your Youngster Wants a Gun,'' says: ``Age
is not the major yardstick. Some youngsters are ready to start at
10, others at 14. The only real measures are those of maturity and
individual responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your youngster follow directions well? Is he
conscientious and reliable? Would you leave him alone in the house
for two or three hours? Would you send him to the grocery store
with a list and a $20 bill? If the answer to these questions or
similar ones are `yes,' then the answer can also be `yes' when your
child asks for his first gun.''
</P>
<P>
   I say, right on. If little Jimmy can run to the store with a
twenty and scamper back with the correct change, then by all means
he should have a gun if he wants one. You feel that way, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a joke. The gun manufacturers and distributors,
whatever they are saying about the massacre in Littleton, Colo.,
have been aggressively marketing their deadly products to the youth
of America for years. They have not done it secretly. Gun ownership
has been declining in the United States and the industry has been
openly in the hunt for new young shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry needs more customers and the gun lobby needs
more contributors,'' said Josh Sugarmann, director of the Violence
Policy Center, a research organization in Washington that favors
firearms control.
</P>
<P>
   The center released a study last week documenting the industry's
intensive efforts over several years to recruit teen-agers and
children into the gun culture. The title of the study, ``Start 'Em
Young,'' was taken from an article in the July 1998 issue of Gun
World magazine that giddily championed the association of children
and guns. A photo of an adolescent aiming a cocked revolver was
captioned, ``The author's son Steve would shoot this .22 single
action all day every day if he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The article was headlined, ``Start 'Em Young: There is no time
like the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently no child is too young. A photo in last month's issue
of the magazine Guns and Ammo shows a little kid with big glasses
aiming a big gun with both hands. The awkwardly worded caption
reads: ``The Freedom Arms Model 1997 chambered in .45 Colt is
comfortable to shoot as demonstrated by the author's seven-year-old
son. Keep in mind that it is still more powerful than the legendary
manstopping .45 ACP.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who like a little kiddie porn with their promotion of
``manstopping'' weapons, consider a magazine ad that showed a
smiling little girl, a toddler, in a bathing suit that is tugged up
suggestively in the rear. The little girl is holding a machine gun.
The copy beneath the photo says: ``Short BUTTS From FLEMING
FIREARMS.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, huh?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday I asked Bob Delfay of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation about the group's policies regarding children and guns.
He said: ``We feel the same way about introducing young people to
the recreational use of firearms that we always have. It's not only
an appropriate thing to do, it is a desirable and beneficial thing
for a responsible adult to introduce a responsible young person to
the recreational use of firearms. Many, many beneficial things can
come from that, and incidents like Littleton rarely, if ever, come
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, in one of its trade publications, has said to
the nation's gun manufacturers: ``There's a way to help insure that
new faces and pocketbooks will continue to patronize your business:
Use the schools. This is where most of your potential down-the-line
shooters and hunters now are.''
</P>
<P>
   The article concludes: ``Schools are an opportunity. Grasp it.''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: HOW JOHN ELWAY MADE A TATTOO DISAPPEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   His curse turned into his blessing. As the Denver Broncos'
quarterback in three embarrassing Super Bowl losses, it was as if
John Elway had a tattoo that read, ``Can't win the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Broncos were not the better team on any of
those three Super Bowl Sundays against the Giants, the Washington
Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers, he was the losing
quarterback. And the losing quarterback always gets the blame.
</P>
<P>
   But all that blame kept John Elway playing when his battered
body would have preferred to surrender. ``I would love another
chance,'' he said before the 1995 season. ``I want to retire a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with two consecutive Super Bowl rings, John Elway will
retire as a champion. Tattoos aren't supposed to disappear, but his
have. And for all of the arrows he has thrown with that archer's
bow of an arm, he made that tattoo disappear two seasons ago in
Super Bowl XXXII in San Diego by scrambling instead of passing.
</P>
<P>
   With the score, 17-17, late in the third quarter, Elway's
obsession to retire a champion was at stake. The Broncos had a
third-and-6 at the 12-yard line, but the Green Bay Packers had just
stuffed Terrell Davis for only a 1-yard gain. If the Broncos didn't
get a first down, they would have to kick a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the snap in the shotgun formation, Elway retreated beyond
the 20-yard line as he searched for a receiver. Finding none open,
he hurried upfield, then to the right, as he crossed the 10-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   In another situation, hoping to get the first down, Elway might
have run out of bounds. Or he might have slid, as quarterbacks do
and he usually did. But this was the Super Bowl; this was his
chance to ``retire a champion.'' For all he knew, maybe his last
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as safety LeRoy Butler and linebacker Brian Williams
converged on him, Elway dived for the first down. As the tacklers
hit him, his body whirled like the propeller of a helicopter and he
landed, sprawled, at the 4-yard line. First down.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Davis pounded into the end zone and the Broncos
were ahead, 24-17. The Packers would rally for a 24-24 tie but
after the Broncos had won, 31-24, with Davis scoring three
touchdowns, their teammates pointed to Elway's theatrical first
down as the play that turned the game. And his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him do that and then get up pumping his fist, I
said, `It's on,' '' tight end Shannon Sharpe said later. ``That's
when I was sure we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Broncos won, that's when the pro football realm was
finally convinced that John Elway was a champion. Until then, all
of his last-minute drives during the season and the playoffs had
been dramatic, and all those completions and all those yards and
all those touchdown passes had merely been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   All those stats hadn't been able to make that tattoo disappear
until the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, lifted the Vince Lombardi
trophy that night at Jack Murphy Stadium and said, ``This one's for
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the tattoo gone, some people sniped that Elway didn't
win until he had Terrell Davis, but that was only a reminder that
in his three earlier Super Bowl losses, he didn't have anybody like
Terrell Davis. Against the Giants, the Redskins and the 49ers, he
was out there alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best quarterbacks can't always do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if to show that the diamonds in his Super Bowl ring
weren't fake, Elway did it again, this time as a passer. Against
the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami, he completed 18
of 29 passes for 336 yards, including an arrow to wide receiver Rod
Smith for an 80-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be his last roundup. And his best. As a
champion, he's now going out as few of the National Football
League's best quarterbacks have.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the best quarterbacks inspired a championship team, if
not two or three or four title teams, relatively early in their
careers, but most didn't retire from the reigning championship
team. Joe Montana didn't. Terry Bradshaw didn't. Roger Staubach
didn't. Joe Namath didn't. Johnny Unitas didn't. Bobby Layne
didn't. Sammy Baugh and Sid Luckman didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the quarterbacks in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, only
Otto Graham and Norm Van Brocklin decided to stop playing after
having guided their teams to the NFL title in their last season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham led the Cleveland Browns to the 1955 and 1956
championships, then departed. Van Brocklin sparked the Philadelphia
Eagles to the 1960 title, then coached the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   And now Elway, sure to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he
is eligible for election in five years, has done what only Graham
did: go out on top with two consecutive NFL rings.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's not the best quarterback ever. To most historians,
Baugh, Graham, Unitas and Montana are on that ``best ever'' level;
take your pick. He's on the next tier, with several others; take
your pick. But he retired a champion.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all John Elway was trying to do in Super Bowl XXXII
when he spun like a helicopter's propeller going for that first
down and made a tattoo disappear. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: METS' FANS WILL ALWAYS HAVE 1969 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ron Swoboda loves the look on their faces. Well into
middle age themselves, with the attendant wrinkles and gray hairs,
they get this silly gaping smile on their faces when they realize
who he is, what he was part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovefest, man,'' Swoboda said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of us who think 1969 just might have been the most
bizarre year of our lives, or maybe of the century, Swoboda often
talks like a cast member of the musical ``Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The language comes back: ``Blows me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoboda remembers the year when white people wore their hair
down their backs, and blacks wore their hair in ballooning Afros,
when astronauts walked on the moon and John and Yoko sang for peace
in Vietnam - when it was not quite clear the center would hold _
and somehow or other the Amazing Metropolitans won the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a big deal,'' Swoboda said the other day. ``A big
doggone deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years have gone by, and it's maybe bigger than ever.
Every year, some team wins the Stanley Cup and the Super Bowl and
the NBA championship and the Final Four and the World Series and
the national college football championship and there are
celebrations in every ``Greatest Sports Town in This Country,'' to
say nothing of the now-obligatory videos and coffee-table books.
</P>
<P>
   Every championship, by definition, is historic. What the Mets
did in the year of Neil A. Armstrong and Jimmy Qualls and Richard
M. Nixon was unique. The Worst Team in the History of Baseball
turned around and won the World Series. You could - as Swoboda's
mentor, Casey Stengel, liked to say - look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Shea Stadium there will be an old-timers' game, mixing
aging members of the Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore
Orioles, who still cannot believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the old Mets will be there - the Glider, Buddy, Tug, Dr.
Ron, Cleon, Tommie, Sham, Krane, Tom Terrific. Children will
understand why that year was different from any other year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People remember,'' said Swoboda, himself 54, a baseball
broadcaster and businessman in New Orleans, and a living totem to
Mets fans of a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have gone on with their lives,'' Swoboda said.
``It's not like they are geeks with Mets jackets who live with
their moms. But the Mets mean something special to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoboda has had three decades to try to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were putting men on the moon,'' he said. ``We were killing
people in Vietnam. People were protesting and putting flowers in
their hair. If there was anything easy to hang on to, it was the
Mets. When we won the World Series, all things seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was layered with other things,'' Swoboda added.
``The National League jilted New York when the Dodgers and Giants
left. The Mets came back with Casey covering up that they were
losing 100 games a year. In short order, we were winning 100 games
in a year. It was unbelievable, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoboda spanned the bad years and the amazing year. He was a raw
20-year-old outfielder in the spring of 1965, Rocky on and off the
field, but an observer. The old manager liked him because Swoboda
personified Stengel's dream of the new Mets - ``They ain't failed
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoboda recalled: ``I would sit and listen to him. It would
sound as if he was speaking in Stengelese, but all of a sudden I'd
say, `Hey, man, this guy is telling a parable - and it's aimed at
me!'''
</P>
<P>
   By 1969, Casey was a revered ancient, and Gil Hodges was the
manager. Casey once said Hodges could ``squeeze your earbrows
off,'' which was probably true, and only Rocky Swoboda, true to his
nickname, dared challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young and full of yourself, you do things you
regret,'' Swoboda said the other day. ``Gil sometimes made me feel
he was rubbing our noses in his authority, but that was me, that
was my fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time early in 1969 he held a meeting and he
said, `You guys are professionals, you set your own curfew,' and
somebody suggested two and a half hours after the game, and Gil
said it was too long, and I popped up, `Gil, why don't you just
tell us?' I would do my thing like that. Why didn't I just shut
up?''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges squeezed the earbrows of an entire season, and Swoboda
made an epic catch in the World Series, and the Mets danced on the
moon. In the spring of 1972, Hodges, a cardiac patient, fell down
dead at 47. Swoboda, a Yankee by then, still wishes he had patched
it up a little more, but they are part of the same legend. Not all
championships are created equal. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TRAINING WITH THE INFLUENCE OF WHITTINGHAM  
 (EDITORS: COLUMN TO BE SUBBED AFTER THE KENTUCKY DERBY) 
</HEADLINE>
  jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The best eulogy Nick Zito could think of for
Charlie Whittingham was short and sweet, the antithesis of a
grizzled workaholic who plied his trade for 50 years, almost right
up until his death 11 days ago at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knew he was a horse trainer, nothing else, and he
stuck to it,'' Zito said. ``He didn't try to be something else, an
entrepreneur, or an actor, like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito, raised in Queens, N.Y., in the shadows of New York's race
tracks, laughed sarcastically, having raised a subtext that has
become unavoidable in his beloved profession, one in which the
stakes for success have been raised, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, D. Wayne Lukas had a run of six straight
Triple Crown victories and seven of eight, and then Bob Baffert
came along to win consecutive Kentucky Derbies the last two years,
along with the 1998 Preakness. Two striking, media-savvy profiles
were carved into the consciousness of a fading sport crying out for
a Rushmore of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert came to Churchill Downs Saturday hoping to become the
first trainer to win three straight Derbies, add to his growing
reputation as the man with the silver hair and a golden touch. The
news media backside crowds flocked to Barn 33 this week, where
Baffert's three contenders _ General Challenge, Prime Timber and
the filly Excellent Meeting _ were housed for Saturday's 125th
Derby running. Lukas, with two less-distinguished horses, Cat Thief
and Charismatic, appeared earlier in the week to be inducted in
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In the expanding universe of entertainment and sports, from the
R-rated professional wrestling to the made-for-television X Games,
it makes perfect sense that celebrity trainers who look as if
they've stepped off a golf course more than out of a smelly barn
become the marketing rage. This is a sport where the horses tend to
sound alike and the jockeys, for all their courage and skill, are
existentially in supporting roles. Trainers are the college
basketball and football coaches of thoroughbred racing. They
represent the Program, the continuum, as the horses pass in and out
of prominence every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any coincidence that Lukas, a former high school
basketball coach who counts Bobby Knight among his best friends,
insists that his growing stable of assistant trainers address him
as Coach? He refers to his ``system'' when he talks about all the
places he can't possibly be, and the men who implement his training
techniques at a half-dozen different tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, the system works,'' he recalled one of his assistants
raving into the telephone after one recent victorious race.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent dominance of Lukas and then Baffert suggests
anything, it is that the next wave of aspiring super trainers had
better be part entrepreneur, part actor, anti-Whittinghams. They
had better be good recruiters, and jugglers, too. Trainers have
always served different masters, the way a college coach works for
the school and the shoe company, but the magnitude of these
conflicts is growing, based on the sheer number of horses required
to keep up with the Lukases and Bafferts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses break down, they don't train well, don't run well in
the Derby preps,'' Baffert said Friday, looking country-club cool
in customary shades before his Silverbulletday won the Kentucky
Oaks. ``You need a lot of them if you want to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer realistic to stake one's Triple Crown season on
a horse or two, any more than it is enough for Mike Jarvis to count
on two or three recruits deciding on St. John's. You can't win, or
even be seen on horse racing's grandest stage, if you're not here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not mistaken, Charlie Whittingham came to the Derby
four times, won two and finished second once,'' said Zito. ``His
philosophy was don't come in here unless you've got a shot, and I
always believed the same thing. But there used to be, what, 4 Derby
preps and now there's 10. If you run strong in one of them, how do
you not come to the Derby?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I thought they were creating too much hype.
I was thinking that if you if you have all this stuff going on
leading into the Derby, what are you going to do for the Derby?''
</P>
<P>
   At 51, this trainer who learned from the old school has grasped
the sport's new math. He spread several horses around the Derby
preps, and when the two he had the highest hopes for faltered, he
still had Stephen Got Even, winner of the Gallery Furniture Stakes
at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., near Cincinnati, and Adonis, best
of what the racing people called a weak Wood Memorial in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, came to Churchill Downs looking for his third Derby
winner, though not with the three-straight splash of Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get all the glory,'' Zito said. ``I'll sneak in.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the Whittingham in him speaking, the old pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie never forgot where he came from,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas and Baffert are where no trainer has gone before.

RACING MAKES THE WIDE TURN FROM TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Ind., Ohio, Fla., Calif., Ky.)  
(jt) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Beneath the twin spires of Churchill Downs,
where tradition and history were being served again Saturday in the
125th Kentucky Derby, the winds of change were rustling and maybe
even howling as thoroughbred racing groped for new business
alliances and mergers to save the sport from oblivion in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the chief players in the trend toward consolidation are a
pair of former Marines who run race tracks 75 miles apart in the
heart of the bluegrass country where racing flourished as a way of
life long before casino gambling arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They are Tom Meeker, president of Churchill Downs and perhaps
the most aggressive strategist in racing, and Ted Bassett, chairman
of Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, who startled the purists
recently by allying his stately old track with gambling
corporations in a move toward rescuing Turfway Park in northern
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, the trend has been accelerated by Frank
Stronach, the Canadian horseman who purchased Santa Anita last
year. But Meeker and Bassett have taken the Eastern establishment
by surprise with their moves in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll ever see slot machines or casino gambling
at our hallowed track,'' Bassett said with exaggerated emphasis in
a recent interview in Lexington. ``But if they come someday to
Kentucky, why not Turfway? And you will see a more intelligent way
for Keeneland to deal with its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeker, who recently led Churchill's moves to acquire Hollywood
Park in California and Calder in Florida, said that racing has no
choice but to pursue mergers in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at American business today,'' he said in an
interview at Churchill Downs, ``there are a number of things
forcing businesses to consolidate. In the 1980s, the motive was to
improve shareholder value. In the 1990s, companies have joined to
develop better platforms for their products, especially in
telecommunications and banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In racing, we have moved from a little parochial business
where you did your business within 25 miles of your track. Now,
we're a national and even international market. We have an $8
billion simulcast market, interstate.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed willing to defuse the issue of casino gambling, which
alarms many traditionalists who prefer racing as a way of horse
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we support casino gambling,'' he said. ``But we don't
see it as an end-all. If it takes casino gambling to save the
business, we ought to get out of the business and get into a new
one. We see alternative gambling as part of the solution, but not
all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeker, a decorated officer who spent three tours of duty in
Vietnam and then returned home to Louisville to get his law degree,
became general counsel to Churchill Downs, and in 1984 succeeded
Lynn Stone as president. In the last few years, with racing
generally losing fans and business, he initiated a series of moves
that expanded Churchill's interests and startled the rest of the
racing world as it reached for new marketing strategies and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosier Park in Indiana was opened as that state's first
parimutuel race track along with its satellite betting facilities
in Fort Wayne, Indianapolis and Merrillville. Then Churchill bought
interests in Ellis Park and Kentucky Downs. And in recent months,
it bought Calder Race Course in Florida for $86 million, negotiated
to buy Hollywood Park in Los Angeles and reportedly opened talks
with Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came at a price. The board of directors authorized a
rise in the number of shares of stock to 50 million from 20
million, and obtained a $250 million line of credit. And the
company's stock lost about one-third of its value at one point. But
Meeker sees it all as part of the price of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get some leverage, where we can get more money to
deliver a better product to our customers,'' he said. ``It's a
natural evolution. You'll join race tracks to strengthen their
balance sheets and acquire more capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that mergers had a bottom-line focus, and it
sent tremors through people. Now, you're looking at the top line: 1
plus 1 equals 3. You have to go into this with the philosophy that
you need to get more capital, not cut less fat.''
</P>
<P>
   He reflected, and said: ``Fifteen years ago, when I came here,
we'd open the gates. We were the only show in town. One business,
one product. Now, we have casinos right across the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Bassett, who was a Marine officer in World War II, created
even more waves early this year when he joined the traditionalist
Keeneland track in Lexington with Harrah's Entertainment and the
Gtech Corp., which makes video lottery machines. For $37 million,
Keeneland took over operations at Turfway Park across the Ohio
River from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that 10 years ago, only New Jersey and Nevada
allowed casino gambling,'' Bassett said. ``Today, 30 states allow
it. Harrah's has 19 casinos around the country. They have customers
logged in their computers. They know what people like, even what
they eat and drink. Why not use their customer-relations smarts? We
might learn something. And Gtech makes the best use of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turfway has been on the block for two years, with no takers,''
he said. ``They run before each of our two meets, spring and fall.
So, why not take advantage of that and join the dates to keep the
horses running in Kentucky? The pool of talent is becoming
increasingly critical.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the financial dilemma that threatens to wipe out many
tracks in racing, especially small ones without Churchill's
resources or Keeneland's insight. But they at least have nudged the
trend to transform their business and survive into the next
century.

MARK WEISER, A LEADING COMPUTER VISIONARY, DIES AT 46 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (kd) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark D. Weiser, a computer scientist and the chief technology
officer of Xerox Corp.'s legendary Palo Alto Research Center, died
on Tuesday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   He died of liver failure resulting from cancer, his wife, Vicky
Reich, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the nation's high- technology heartland,
Weiser was widely viewed as a genuine visionary and computer
pioneer, and his ideas have influenced many of the world's best
computer scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he coined the term ``ubiquitous computing'' as an
alternative to hulking mainframe computers in rooms of their own
and then the personal desktop models that have prevailed in the
first two generations of the computer era. At the time, the
personal computer, which had been explored at the research center,
known as PARC, during the 1970s was in its ascendancy. But Weiser's
vision was a radical departure. Computers, in his view, should
disappear into all the objects that surround people in daily life
in both home and office.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the computer user should be unchained from the so-called
desktop metaphor that characterizes people's interactions with
nearly all personal computers, Weiser asserted. This came from an
idea he had while chatting with other researchers around a coffee
pot in a hallway of the research center.
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as Weiser's idea seemed in the late 1980s and early
1990s, it came to frame a new generation of experimentation at a
revitalized PARC in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And now, his idea of ubiquitous computing has in many ways taken
hold, what with so-called smart devices such as coffee pots,
printers and copy machines that can display whether they are full
or empty via an office network. In the research projects that
Weiser pursued at Xerox, office workers would be surrounded by an
invisible computational web that would offer communication and
informational resources transparently, unlike today's machines.
</P>
<P>
   He also challenged the computer industry to look at performance
in new ways long before it was fashionable. Rather than the
traditional performance measurement of millions of instructions per
second, or MIPS, Weiser focused on the greatest number of
instructions per joule of energy, pushing toward low-powered
portable computing.
</P>
<P>
   His approach to computer science was a blend of technology, art
and philosophy. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger's notion of
the cane as a transparent extension of the blind man's hand defined
Weiser's views on computers as tools that should disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time Weiser was developing his philosophy of tiny
computers in devices surrounding people in our real world, the
computing world was becoming captivated by ideas like virtual
reality, which submerges computer users into synthetic environments
created by powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when the world was being seduced by virtual reality, Mark
had this idea of embodied physicality,'' said John Seeley Brown,
PARC's director and a Xerox vice president.
</P>
<P>
   There are significant parallels between the impact of the
research that Alan Kay led at PARC in the 1970s and the research
Weiser guided two decades later. In each case it took the computer
industry more than a decade to catch up and adopt many of the
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the case of ubiquitous computing, there is an explosion
of activity in so-called Post PC-era devices. For example, a
next-generation Internet protocol has been designed to support
billions and billions of connected smart devices. Research in the
area is also under way at universities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Weiser was born in Chicago and grew up in Stony Brook,
N.Y., where his father was a professor of chemistry at the State
University of New York there. His love of computing began because a
girl he had a crush on in junior high school was taking a
programming class. Nothing came of his crush, but his romance with
computers lasted a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He met Ms. Reich, his future wife, while in high school, and she
remembers that many of their early dates ended in computer labs
with Weiser working with the punch cards that were then the
currency of mainframe systems.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the New College in Florida, where he studied
philosophy. But his money ran out in his second year and he left
school, moving to Ann Arbor, Mich., where he got a job as a
computer programmer. He began taking computer science classes and
excelled to the point that he was admitted directly into a master's
program at the University of Michigan. He received his master's
degree in 1976 and his doctorate in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser taught computer science at the University of Maryland,
College Park, and became associate chairman of the department in
1986. His early work was in ``program slicing,'' a method of
debugging computer programs by using the organization of
information in a program to look at only a subset of instructions
and data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he joined PARC's research staff and the next year became
manager of the center's computer science laboratory. In 1996 he
became PARC's chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   During his career Weiser formed several companies. One, called
Tacit, was started in 1994 to commercialize some of his ubiquitous
computing ideas. But it failed in part because Silicon Valley's
venture capitalists had become obsessed with Internet start-ups.
Weiser returned to Xerox in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An active participant in the San Francisco Bay Area's eclectic
culture, Weiser was a drummer in an avant-garde rock band, Severe
Tire Damage. Among the group's claims to fame is that it was the
first band to broadcast live over the Internet. The band ``opened''
for the Rolling Stones by inserting its broadcast onto the World
Wide Web immediately before the Stones were to begin. As the band
notes on its Web site, ``the press was generous'' in its reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser's sister also died this month from cancer. In addition to
his wife, he is survived by his mother, and two daughters, Corinne
Reich-Weiser and Nicole Reich-Weiser.

   KUKES, Albania _ March 24, the day NATO jets first dropped bombs
on Yugoslavia, was hardly the beginning of troubles for the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, or the starting point of their sorrowful
exile. In the months leading up to the assault, the Yugoslav army
and local police, often working in tandem, forced thousands of
Kosovars to flee their homes. Refugees in their own land, they
wandered from village to village in search of safety and shelter.
With the bombing, the Serbian government stepped up its tactics,
and , some 700,000 Albanians eventually left Kosovo outright, about
half of them crossing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The camps and shantytowns that have sprung up here are filled
with refugees who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey that
has lasted months. Among them is Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old
farmer from the ancient village of Zatric in the mountains of
southwestern Kosovo, who left his home with his seven children and
extended family eight months ago. His account follows.

   KUKES, Albania _ March 24, the day NATO jets first dropped bombs
on Yugoslavia, was hardly the beginning of troubles for the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, or the starting point of their sorrowful
exile. In the months leading up to the assault, the Yugoslav army
and local police, often working in tandem, forced thousands of
Kosovars to flee their homes. Refugees in their own land, they
wandered from village to village in search of safety and shelter.
With the bombing, the Serbian government stepped up its tactics,
and , some 700,000 Albanians eventually left Kosovo outright, about
half of them crossing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The camps and shantytowns that have sprung up here are filled
with refugees who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey that
has lasted months. Among them is Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old
farmer from the ancient village of Zatric in the mountains of
southwestern Kosovo, who left his home with his seven children and
extended family eight months ago. His account follows.

   I took my family and my father-in-law and went to Ratkovac.
After we left Pastacel, the Serbian forces came in and surrounded
the people. It was a massacre. There were 106 people who were
killed, including 14 people from my own village of Zatric who had
taken refuge in Pastacel. The next day, after the Serbs had gone, I
left my family in Ratkovac and came back to Pastacel and helped to
bury the victims.
</P>
<P>
   What we saw was terrible. It was a nightmare. They had separated
all the men into groups of 15 each and killed them all in one
place. The bodies fell in groups into a small stream. The stream
was running with blood. The bodies were piled one on top of the
other.
</P>
<P>
   We spent three days trying to bury them. We took the bodies from
the stream and brought them to the field. When the police came
back, we ran. Then we came back and, using shovels, we buried them
in the field next to the mosque. They were not buried very deep,
just enough to cover them. We couldn't hold a ceremony or even put
up a marker for them. The head of the mosque said a brief prayer,
but that was it.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the debate over NATO's bombing of Serbia, the
voice of the American anti-war movement has not been heard to any
great degree. Once it was so loud that it helped end the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be heard soon if the war widens. Many protests so far
have included mostly Serbian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the commencement of the bombing to jar me into
opposing it,'' said Tom Hayden, an anti-war leader in the 1960s and
'70s who now is a state senator in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden drew a parallel between the engagement in Vietnam and
that in Yugoslavia, saying the United States was ``in the shadow of
a prolonged and divisive and bloody war in a place no one had heard
of _ in one case Vietnam and in the other Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said more protests would occur if the bombing continued
and ground troops were sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictable sources of dissent are in the coalition''
supporting President Clinton, he said. ``It's a liberal war, a
Democratic Party war. People don't want to go against their own
president.'' Another reason is the lack of a draft, Hayden said.
And then there is Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``Nobody
likes Milosevic, making it initially difficult to get worked up
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the anti-war movement like Jane Sammon, an editor for
The Catholic Worker, say it is too soon to draw parallels with
Vietnam. ``Are you saying that a month into the Vietnam war that a
reporter from The New York Times was asking where the protests
were?'' she said. ``I don't think that, in the beginning of
Vietnam, that most people were jaded enough to think that America
could violate international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Sheehan, the New England coordinator of the War Resisters
League and chairwoman of War Resisters International in London,
said the Internet and e-mail enabled the movement against the
bombing in Serbia to grow faster than it did in the days of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ney, disarmament coordinator at the War Resisters
League national headquarters in New York City, said, ``There have
been a lot of protests by different groups.'' A rally in New York
at Washington Square Park, he said, demanded ``an end to the
bombing, no ground troops and an end to the expulsion of
Kosovars.'' The International Action Center is planning a march in
Washington from the Vietnam War Memorial to the Pentagon on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person that I talk to in the street is just overwhelmed,''
Ms. Sheehan said. ``As activists, we're overloaded.''

voice of the American anti-war movement has not been heard to any
great degree. Once it was so loud that it helped end the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be heard soon if the war widens. Many protests so far
have included mostly Serbian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the commencement of the bombing to jar me into
opposing it,'' said Tom Hayden, an anti-war leader in the 1960s and
'70s who now is a state senator in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden drew a parallel between the engagement in Vietnam and
that in Yugoslavia, saying the United States was ``in the shadow of
a prolonged and divisive and bloody war in a place no one had heard
of _ in one case Vietnam and in the other Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said more protests would occur if the bombing continued
and ground troops were sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictable sources of dissent are in the coalition''
supporting President Clinton, he said. ``It's a liberal war, a
Democratic Party war. People don't want to go against their own
president.'' Another reason is the lack of a draft, Hayden said.
And then there is Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``Nobody
likes Milosevic, making it initially difficult to get worked up
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the anti-war movement like Jane Sammon, an editor for
The Catholic Worker, say it is too soon to draw parallels with
Vietnam. ``Are you saying that a month into the Vietnam war that a
reporter from The New York Times was asking where the protests
were?'' she said. ``I don't think that, in the beginning of
Vietnam, that most people were jaded enough to think that America
could violate international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Sheehan, the New England coordinator of the War Resisters
League and chairwoman of War Resisters International in London,
said the Internet and e-mail enabled the movement against the
bombing in Serbia to grow faster than it did in the days of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ney, disarmament coordinator at the War Resisters
League national headquarters in New York City, said, ``There have
been a lot of protests by different groups.'' A rally in New York
at Washington Square Park, he said, demanded ``an end to the
bombing, no ground troops and an end to the expulsion of
Kosovars.'' The International Action Center is planning a march in
Washington from the Vietnam War Memorial to the Pentagon on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person that I talk to in the street is just overwhelmed,''
Ms. Sheehan said. ``As activists, we're overloaded.''

LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL NOT PENALIZED FOR MISSING WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Operating under lax attendance policies with no
penalty for absences, Los Angeles City Council members missed
between two to 21 weeks of meetings last year while still
collecting their full $107,000 salaries, a Daily News review of
city records shows.
</P>
<P>
   The tally doesn't include official vacation recesses, holiday
breaks and other periods when no council meetings were held _
totaling seven weeks in 1998, according to city records.
</P>
<P>
   Absenteeism goes beyond the council's three meetings a week.
No-shows are even more evident at council committee sessions, where
taxes and other policies are debated before a vote by the entire
council.
</P>
<P>
   Some members skip more than two-thirds of committee meetings _
not including many scheduled committee meetings that are canceled
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the reason, the council members incur no
penalties. In fact, there is no official or standardized tally of
attendance at either council or committee meetings. The numbers in
this story are compiled from handwritten records of individual
clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, absences have caused the City Council to adjourn four times
this year alone for lack of a quorum _ an average of once a month,
inconveniencing members of the public who traveled to City Hall to
speak out to their elected representatives and slowing work on
public issues.
</P>
<P>
   But whether council members are at City Hall or globe-trotting
or taking unexcused time off, they still get paid under rules that
give them freewheeling flexibility _ unlike even senior city
employees who get a maximum of four weeks of vacation and 12 sick
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Councilmen are being paid salary by reason of the office that
they hold,'' said Assistant City Attorney Anthony Alperin. ``It
doesn't matter whether they come to meetings. It doesn't matter
whether they do their job. As long as they hold the office, they
get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, for instance, six members were abroad on
city trips to Europe, Asia, Latin America and the East Coast during
a recess that officially was called to allow members time to study
the mayor's budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign field trips may be the most exotic part of the job,
but council members can miss regular meetings for any number of
reasons, ranging from lobbying state and federal legislators to
tending to personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Members representing Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley tended to
have higher attendance than average, the figures indicate. Still,
they missed an average of 12 council meetings _ a full month's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Under city rules, council meetings are canceled for lack of a
quorum if fewer than 10 members are present. The council has 15
members normally, but only 14 now because of a vacancy in the 7th
District. State Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, vacated the
council seat after his state Senate election last year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a council quorum on one day this year delayed
proceedings on the future of the Chatsworth Reservoir,
disappointing residents who had traveled from the Northwest Valley
for the hearing. It happened on a day when a group of disappointed
schoolchildren from the Valley visited City Hall to see how
government works.
</P>
<P>
   Council members say many of their missed meetings reflect
attempts to juggle their legislative roles with work in their
district, lobbying for city causes in Sacramento or the nation's
capital while also carrying out their responsibilities on state or
regional boards from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
the Air Quality Management District.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the absences last year and this year to date were
described by council members as being necessary for city business.
Other absences represent personal medical problems or family health
emergencies, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often see your job as to be there in the City Council
(but) sometimes other things are more important, even if you don't
get a quorum,'' said Joy Picus, a member of the council for 16
years until 1993, when she lost to Laura Chick.
</P>
<P>
   Picus said the council meets more often than other local bodies
such as the county Board of Supervisors, which convenes once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association in the San Fernando Valley, said the council's
staggered meetings on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays should allow
them to take care of personal or political business in between
scheduled sessions, and called the rate of absence ``shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paid over $100,000 a year to attend to city business
and be at the City Council,'' he said. ``Most people have to report
to work from 250 to 300 days a year. They only had to report to
work 139 days in 1998. Most of these people would be fired if they
worked for a company in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the city has a well-defined absenteeism policy for
municipal employees, with fixed numbers of sick and vacation days
and penalties ranging from reprimands to firing for excessive,
patterned or unexcused absences, said Personnel Department Director
William Fujioka.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: said Personnel Department Director William Fujioka.
</P>
<P>
   City workers are entitled to 10 to 20 days of vacation _ a total
of two to four weeks, depending on their length of employment,
Fujioka said. They also get 12 days of sick leave after one year of
service. Employees can take longer leaves for family medical
emergencies, but must use their sick or vacation time or take
unpaid days off.
</P>
<P>
   For council members, no such rules apply. While members must
request permission to miss a meeting ahead of time, such requests
are virtually never denied.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Councilman Richard Alatorre, mired in medical and legal
problems last year, missed nearly half of all council meetings _ 63
days in all, including 36 personal absences.
</P>
<P>
   Council President John Ferraro, who has frequently chastised
members for showing up late, would not say whether he also puts his
foot down about excessive missed meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, chair of the elected Charter Reform
Commission, said the charter proposal going before voters on June 8
does not contain any provisions regarding attendance. ``We felt
that was something the council should maintain control over,''
Chemerinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Frates, a fellow at the Rose Institute for State and
Local Government in Claremont, said most cities limit absences
through political pressure rather than through official policies or
procedures. But that approach may be more effective in smaller
cities, where council members know constituents as business
associates and neighbors, and suffer personal embarrassment for
missing a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives (attendance) more than anything else is
constituent concern and knowledge of it,'' Frates said. ``In a
larger city, the council member may be more anonymous to their
constituent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the council's work requires extraordinary
flexibility, and that the city's interests aren't served only in
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a 9-to-5 job,'' said Xandra Kayden, president of the
Los Angeles League of Women Voters. ``It's a question of leadership
and responsibility and carrying out the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's standing on issues from sports leagues to foreign
trade requires global travel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have expectations of the city and the region being a
leader in the Pacific Rim, it requires contact with the business
community and with other governments in other cities and other
countries,'' Kayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, with one of the highest attendance rates
for meetings of the council and committees, acknowledged the
difficulty council members face being everywhere at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to make choices between conflicting commitments all
the time, day and night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political watchdogs, however, questioned how much benefit the
public derives from some of the city business members conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of taxpayers would argue that those events and
meetings with lobbyists are superfluous, that they do not represent
a service to the community at large that elected them,'' said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems that when the weather gets nice in Europe,
council members are off in Paris studying transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   If council members can do their job in only a fraction of the
meetings, then maybe a full-time council isn't needed, Vosburgh
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those who have reduced attendance feel city business can be
conducted in the amount of time they spend in council chambers,
perhaps that's an argument for a part-time City Council and a
reduction in pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy being a member of the City Council. On the
other hand, not only do these people volunteer for these jobs,
they're lined up five deep at every election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers, director of government relations for the United
Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley, said he thinks
absences are less likely to disrupt city business as a whole than
to interfere with representation of individual council districts
and their local interests.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, he gives the council high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that by and large our City Council people are
pretty dedicated to performing their jobs,'' Powers said. ``I think
we're getting our money's worth with these people. They have big
jobs and I think they do a pretty good job.''

   KOSOVO-FUNERAL (Belgrade, Serbia) _ In one of the ordinary epics
of everyday life, they buried Tomislav Mitrovic Saturday. He was
60, with a wife, Lila; two daughters, Ivana and Jelena; a grandson,
Kosta; and a kind of adopted son, Dejan, the grown child of his
best friend, who had died years before. Mitrovic was a program
director for Radio Television Serbia, the state-run broadcaster
that gives the news much as President Slobodan Milosevic wants it
given. Mitrovic was on the overnight shift on April 22-23, when
NATO missiles hit the station to silence what the Pentagon

Milosevic's murder machine as his military.'' By Stephen Erlanger.

   KOSOVO-PEACEKEEPERS (Brussels) _ Russia appears to be moving

   WASHINGTON _ For an air war that many U.S. generals believe has
been run on the cheap, tactically, the bombardment of Yugoslavia
could go down as the most expensive military campaign, bomb for
bomb, in history.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
likes to brag that 90 percent of the bombs dropped in the 40-day
operation have been precision-guided, compared to only 9 percent in
the 1991 Persian Gulf war, reducing risks to civilians on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of keeping the civilian casualties low is steep.
Cruise missiles fired from ships and submarines run $1 million
apiece, and their heftier cousins launched off B-52s cost twice
that. A laser-guided, 2,000-pound bomb dropped from a radar-evading
F-117 costs $26,200, compared to unguided bombs pitched from B-1
and B-52 bombers, which run about $600 each.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the other day if NATO was using million-dollar
weapons to bomb $10,000 targets, like military trucks and small
bridges, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander, bristled.
``This is not a war that we're running on a checkbook budget,'' he
snapped. ``We're running this war to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the armaments money can buy, though, the air war
has yet to achieve its goal of forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw its
troops in Kosovo and allowing refugees to return with international
military escorts. Politics and the elements have conspired to level
out the allies' technological edge. Bad weather trumps a pilot's
ability to aim a laser-guided bomb, and Defense Secretary William
Cohen said last week there have only been about half a dozen days
free from rain and fog.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the skies cleared, NATO pinpoint accuracy didn't stop
the 40,000-strong Yugoslav army and special police from purging
most of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, or from
avoiding gruesome civilian casualties, like the two convoys and a
passenger train that were accidentally blasted to bits by allied
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NATO's political leaders have restricted the targets
pilots could hit and the tactics they use to hit them. Low-flying
ground-attack planes like the A-10, ideal for blasting tanks, have
flown few bombing runs for fear they are still too vulnerable to
Yugoslav missiles. Other high-flying jets have picked up many of
those missions, but it's difficult to distinguish a farmer's truck
from armored infantry vehicle at 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving me nuts,'' said Gen. George Joulwan, Clark's
predecessor as supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe.
``We're better than this. I really don't understand, unless someone
thought we could drop a few bombs and get off cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-hearted tactics, perhaps, but the costs have been anything
but. Entering the sixth week of a campaign many NATO commanders
thought would last only a few days, the Pentagon is running up
bills that approach $1 billion, and Congress is preparing to
approve the Clinton administration's request for $6 billion to
finance the war through September, if needed. It's far less than
the much larger Persian Gulf war, which lasted 44 days and cost $61
billion (most of which allies like Saudi Arabia paid for). The
Pentagon says this war is costing about $37 million a day, and
that's not counting the relief operation for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress prepares to add billions of dollars to the
administration's war tab to buy new bombs, missiles and other
weapons the Defense Department didn't request, some lawmakers are
criticizing the Pentagon's spendthrift ways in the Balkans. It's
costing $700 million to send 24 Apache helicopters and long-range
artillery from Germany to Albania, said Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania, a senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. He
said he's angry that every night, NATO launches 300 to 600 missions
to bomb perhaps two dozen targets or so. With clear skies predicted
for the next few days, both numbers are likely to increase. ``I
need to hear why so many planes are up and there are so few
targets,'' said Murtha, a gruff former marine.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that NATO hasn't had enough bases for the
more than 700 allied aircraft joining the air war. Only recently
did NATO negotiate with Hungary to allow fighter-bombers and,
equally important, the refueling planes that keep them aloft. Now,
the aerial refuelers have to fly from as far away as Spain, England
and France, burning up precious fuel that could keep fighters
flying.
</P>
<P>
   One seasoned F-16 pilot, stationed at Aviano air base in Italy,
said in an interview that the air space is so crowded that the most
dangerous part of flying in the Balkans is circling at night, along
with dozens of other fighter jets, at 500 miles per hour in
thunderstorms and lightning to get more gasoline from airborne
refueling planes. ``It's kind of like New York City traffic up
there,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Pentagon officials said, the Air Force
didn't plan ahead, as the Navy and Army did, to equip all its
aviators with night-vision goggles that cost $7,000 a set. ``It's
the difference between driving with your parking lights or
headlights,'' said the F-16 pilot, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are other mismatches between the high-cost mission and
tactical common sense. The combat debut of the B-2 bomber has been
notable, if for nothing else than its 31-hour (at $5,719 an hour)
round-trip flight to the Balkans from its base in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon might have stationed the stealthy B-2 in a friendly
country like Britain, and saved about $270,000 per mission, except
that the Air Force is squabbling with a California company over the
details of a contract to produce a mobile, climate-controlled
hangar that is needed to protect the bomber's sensitive,
radar-absorbing skin.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, NATO commanders are hoping just a few more of their
costly bombs will be needed to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in destroying more targets in Serbia than
is absolutely necessary,'' said Denmark's chief of defense, Gen.
Christian Hvidt, a former F-16 fighter pilot. ``We dislike using
power, really.''

<P>
   If much about the murderous assault by two students in
Littleton, Colo., seemed so alien and bizarre as to be almost
ungraspable, there was at least one part of the story that seemed
as familiar as Big Macs and oldies radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was the world of jocks and nerds, preps and geeks, winners
and losers that defined life at Columbine High School before the
killing of a teacher and 14 students, including the suicides of the
two gunmen. It was something that is burned like a tattoo into the
memory bank of most adults. It was high school.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and other school shootings in places like Pearl,
Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore.,
(Jonesboro was a middle school, the rest high schools) have been
viewed through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values
and parenting. Clearly, no single factor will ever explain any of
the incidents. But the fact that these horrors keep playing out in
the nation's high schools tracks closely longstanding and growing
concerns about the kind of educational and social environments they
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Many students, of course, have wonderful high school
experiences. And any view of high school life would do well to
remember the ways it mimics the world outside. But the most
comprehensive recent report on American high schools, ``Breaking
Ranks,'' by the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, concluded in 1996 that ``high schools continue to go
about their business in ways that sometimes bear startling
resemblance to the flawed practices of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like the high school bloodletting in films like ``Carrie''
or ``Heathers'' or the savage Darwinian hierarchy portrayed in
films like ``Jawbreaker,'' ``Varsity Blues'' or ``Cruel
Intentions,'' the images our culture presents of high school life
are so routinely destructive as to prompt warning flags that go
beyond spasms of horrific violence like Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, strutting jocks and imperious prom queens lorded over
high schools well before aggrieved teen-agers turned corridors into
killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Writing last week in the Internet magazine Salon, social critic
Camille Paglia described clique formation in high schools as ``a
pitiless process that has remained amazingly consistent for the
past 60 years.'' She then lamented the way high schools have become
anachronisms that warehouse students in the sterile regimentation
of a world of cubical classrooms and cramped rows of seats.
</P>
<P>
   And, though some elements of high school may seem eternal,
increasingly questions are being asked about an educational model
that has remained little changed since after World War I when high
school _ rather than work _ became the norm for Americans in their
mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar professional critique is that despite some
attempts at smaller, more experimental programs, high schools are
too big, too impersonal and too out of touch with the youngsters in
them. That perhaps was tolerable in days of two-parent families and
close ties to churches and social organizations. It is not now.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scales, a psychologist and senior fellow with the research
organization Search Institute, said the group's studies of 100,000
students from 6th grade through 12th found that only one in four
said they went to a school where adults and other students cared
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' report, for example, called for smaller
high schools or bigger ones broken down into ``houses'' or
``teams'' of no more than 600 students to create more intimate
environments, and an adult advocate responsible for each student.
Others call for team teaching arrangements that enable groups of
teachers to monitor individual students and teaching plans that
allow teachers to follow students from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was a 1,950-student school. Grades were not broken
down into smaller groupings, and the school was organized along
largely traditional lines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' recommendations are more common in middle
schools than high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the principal and the others talking about what a
wonderful school Columbine is,'' said Frank Smith, a professor of
educational administration at Teachers College of Columbia
University. ``But what it means is a wonderful traditional model
and a very expensive physical facility. In many ways, it's a
wonderful version of an outdated school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, a writer on new technologies, whose Web site has
attracted 4,000 posts in recent days from self-styled outsiders
terrified that the main effect of Littleton will be an effort to
further marginalize the marginalized, said what has most changed
the social dynamic of high school is technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's high school outcasts, he said, were truly powerless.
But youngsters drawn to the Internet and to the electronic culture
of violent games like Tribe, Doom and Quake find a life outside
high school that is exciting, engaging and intellectually
stimulating, where they have friends, community and power. Only in
school are they back at the mercy of the old kings and queens and a
world of teachers talking at them while they sit in cramped desks
just as students did when the radio was high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of school, these kids are empowered and stimulated,''
he said. ``And school then becomes a nightmare, dull and
claustrophobic and oppressive, where you have kids constantly
dumping on them for being different. These are not violent kids.
You look at the numbers, and it's absurd to say that. But what's
happening is making them very alienated and very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he says, is for schools to recognize and respect
the world of the online subculture with, for example, a gaming club
supported the way sports are, and more use of technology and less
traditional and more interactive teaching styles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others, most notably Bard College president Leon Botstein, say
the solution is not to make high school better, but to to get rid
of it. In his ``Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of
American Culture'' (Doubleday, 1997), he argued that children grow
up physically and mentally so much faster now that high schools
trap adolescents in an unreal, age-limited world of silly ritual
and mediocre education.
</P>
<P>
   ``High schools are outdated, obsolete and devastatingly
wrong-headed solutions to the education of adolescents,'' he said.
``We trap them in a world of jock values and anti-intellectualism,
like trying to cram a large person into a small childish uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposes that students graduate at the age of 15 or
16 and go to junior colleges, colleges, new institutions like
science or vocational academies or work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the issues are not limited to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, has been saying
for years that schools only address the intellectual needs of
children and not their psychological and developmental ones. The
current wave of school reform, with its relentless reliance on
standardized test results, only makes things worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that it is hard to single out high schools for
being status obsessed, hierarchical and savagely competitive when
that describes the world outside as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture outside the school, we like winners and
losers,'' he said. ``Look at pro athletes. We even like it when the
winners stick it in the face of the losers.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense high school may be so scarring because it is
students' first intense dose of the world to come. But Botstein
argues that at least in the world outside people can choose where
to eat or what work to do. In high school, he said, they are all
stuck in ``an artificial exaggeration of the worst values of our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most students' reaction to Littleton was not to
criticize the school, but to lament the destruction of a place they
loved. It is clear, though, that for those at the bottom, the
stresses and hurts are worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the electronic message board that the local school district
put up on the Internet in the wake of the shooting, one 1997
Columbine graduate wrote of the taunting she faced in school and
how much time her mother spent at Columbine ``trying to find
someone who cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ``I will be very disgusted if the administrators
find that the solution to the problem is to hire more security
guards. Hiring more security guards will only limit the means by
which kids can harm each other.''

school _ rather than work _ became the norm for Americans in their
mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar professional critique is that despite some
attempts at smaller, more experimental programs, high schools are
too big, too impersonal and too out of touch with the youngsters in
them. That perhaps was tolerable in days of two-parent families and
close ties to churches and social organizations. It is not now.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scales, a psychologist and senior fellow with the research
organization Search Institute, said the group's studies of 100,000
students from 6th grade through 12th found that only one in four
said they went to a school where adults and other students cared
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' report, for example, called for smaller
high schools or bigger ones broken down into ``houses'' or
``teams'' of no more than 600 students to create more intimate
environments, and an adult advocate responsible for each student.
Others call for team teaching arrangements that enable groups of
teachers to monitor individual students and teaching plans that
allow teachers to follow students from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was a 1,950-student school. Grades were not broken
down into smaller groupings, and the school was organized along
largely traditional lines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' recommendations are more common in middle
schools than high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the principal and the others talking about what a
wonderful school Columbine is,'' said Frank Smith, a professor of
educational administration at Teachers College of Columbia
University. ``But what it means is a wonderful traditional model
and a very expensive physical facility. In many ways, it's a
wonderful version of an outdated school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, a writer on new technologies, whose Web site has
attracted 4,000 posts in recent days from self-styled outsiders
terrified that the main effect of Littleton will be an effort to
further marginalize the marginalized, said what has most changed
the social dynamic of high school is technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's high school outcasts, he said, were truly powerless.
But youngsters drawn to the Internet and to the electronic culture
of violent games like Tribe, Doom and Quake find a life outside
high school that is exciting, engaging and intellectually
stimulating, where they have friends, community and power. Only in
school are they back at the mercy of the old kings and queens and a
world of teachers talking at them while they sit in cramped desks
just as students did when the radio was high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of school, these kids are empowered and stimulated,''
he said. ``And school then becomes a nightmare, dull and
claustrophobic and oppressive, where you have kids constantly
dumping on them for being different. These are not violent kids.
You look at the numbers, and it's absurd to say that. But what's
happening is making them very alienated and very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he says, is for schools to recognize and respect
the world of the online subculture with, for example, a gaming club
supported the way sports are, and more use of technology and less
traditional and more interactive teaching styles.

<P>
   BEIJING _ That the Communist Party is losing touch with the
masses is an open worry to leaders here. The latest shock to the
system came last week with the sudden demonstration by the
spiritual cult called Buddhist Law, a movement claiming tens of
millions of Chinese members. So what is party chief Jiang Zemin
doing to create a more relevant Communist Party for the 21st
century?
</P>
<P>
   Old habits, it seems, die hard: Jiang's top aides have been busy
mounting an old-fashioned ``rectification'' campaign to promote
ideological conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly
run the country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally,
to assure Jiang a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Stresses campaign, as it is known, is being waged in
party offices, government agencies and the army. The senior ranks
at universities, research centers and publishing houses are next.
Under the command to ``stress study, stress politics and stress
rectitude,'' officials are required to read specially prepared
textbooks including works by Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and, of
course, Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt officials will read and reread Jiang's speeches, which
are filled with abstruse rationalizations for economic reforms as
well as demands for social stability and party unity. A typical
Jiangism: ``Unwaveringly upholding the party's general line
requires properly handling the relationship between reform,
development and stability at all times.'' Such words hold the key,
or so officials hope, to discerning the proper line in a confusing
period.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of weeks, high officials in a given workplace must
participate in group discussions and write critiques of their own
errors in thought and deed _ whether they have put the interests of
the party ahead of personal gain. They are also instructed to write
anonymous critiques of their organizations and bosses for use in
additional group sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But even if party discipline improves, it is unclear how the
change will help China's rulers govern an increasingly diverse and
demanding society. Officials seemed bewildered by the giant
demonstration by the Buddhist Law movement, which wants official
acceptance, not Communist regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's campaign lacks the ferocity of drives dating from the
1940s, and participants describe the sessions as boring. But he is
using traditional methods to corral wayward cadres that are prone
to corruption and ideological wandering. According to a retired
official, he also hopes to identify loyal, promising officials for
future leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   With 21 traveling inspection teams monitoring compliance, the
Three Stresses campaign is going national. Supervising them is Vice
President Hu Jintao, who appears to be Jiang's favored successor if
he retires from party leadership as expected in 2002, and Zeng
Qinghong, Jiang's close adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has shown every sign that he aspires to enter the pantheon
of great Communist philosopher-leaders like Mao and Deng. Among
other things, three times in recent weeks he has had his
calligraphy printed, Mao-style, on the front page of the People's
Daily _ something he would never have dared to do a few years ago
when his status was less secure.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was widely dismissed as a caretaker when Deng installed
him as party chief in 1989, after the traumatic crushing of mass
protests in Tiananmen Square. But he seems to want credit as a
masterful contributor to the progress of the party and its guiding
thought _ the ``third generation'' titan whose essays and speeches
will find a place alongside Mao Tse-tung Thought and Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's aides are now at work compiling his speeches and
writings, possibly in time for October's celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.

 UNDATED: teaching styles.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others, most notably Bard College president Leon Botstein, say
the solution is not to make high school better, but to to get rid
of it. In his ``Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of
American Culture'' (Doubleday, 1997), he argued that children grow
up physically and mentally so much faster now that high schools
trap adolescents in an unreal, age-limited world of silly ritual
and mediocre education.
</P>
<P>
   ``High schools are outdated, obsolete and devastatingly
wrong-headed solutions to the education of adolescents,'' he said.
``We trap them in a world of jock values and anti-intellectualism,
like trying to cram a large person into a small childish uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposes that students graduate at the age of 15 or
16 and go to junior colleges, colleges, new institutions like
science or vocational academies or work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the issues are not limited to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, has been saying
for years that schools only address the intellectual needs of
children and not their psychological and developmental ones. The
current wave of school reform, with its relentless reliance on
standardized test results, only makes things worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that it is hard to single out high schools for
being status obsessed, hierarchical and savagely competitive when
that describes the world outside as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture outside the school, we like winners and
losers,'' he said. ``Look at pro athletes. We even like it when the
winners stick it in the face of the losers.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense high school may be so scarring because it is
students' first intense dose of the world to come. But Botstein
argues that at least in the world outside people can choose where
to eat or what work to do. In high school, he said, they are all
stuck in ``an artificial exaggeration of the worst values of our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most students' reaction to Littleton was not to
criticize the school, but to lament the destruction of a place they
loved. It is clear, though, that for those at the bottom, the
stresses and hurts are worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the electronic message board that the local school district
put up on the Internet in the wake of the shooting, one 1997
Columbine graduate wrote of the taunting she faced in school and
how much time her mother spent at Columbine ``trying to find
someone who cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ``I will be very disgusted if the administrators
find that the solution to the problem is to hire more security
guards. Hiring more security guards will only limit the means by
which kids can harm each other.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As legislation, the plan to overhaul the Social
Security system announced last week by two influential Republican
congressmen is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have concluded that their party cannot touch
Social Security without getting burned politically, and they have
made clear that they have no intention of allowing any Republican
legislation making fundamental changes in the popular retirement
system to come to a vote before the next election.
</P>
<P>
   But as a case study in politics and the development of
government policy, the new Social Security plan belongs in the
textbooks. It shows how when politicians dig beneath the surface of
a complicated topic, they often learn that their ideological
preconceptions are unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, particularly the most conservative ones, have never
much liked Social Security. Their feel the country would be better
off if the government's role in the pension system were minimal and
if workers could invest their retirement money at will in the
financial markets, draw benefits based on how well their
investments performed, and pass on to their heirs what was left of
their retirement savings when they died.
</P>
<P>
   So when the main Republican entry in the Social Security reform
sweepstakes was announced last week, many in the party who had not
been involved in its preparation were flabbergasted. Far from the
free-market approach that most Republicans say they favor, the
measure would strictly limit private investments, pay the same
benefits to retirees no matter where they invested their money and
leave nothing at retirees' death that could be willed to the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was lambasted by the conservative policy purveyors at
the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute and denounced by
many Republicans in Congress. ``I could never support anything like
that,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a committed conservative who
is chairman of the Budget Committee and a long-shot candidate for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsors of the plan _ Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
R-Fla., chairman of the Social Security subcommittee, both
conservatives to the core _ almost seemed surprised at the way
their proposal had turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it would work: The government would give workers
money through tax rebates and require them to invest it in private
retirement accounts. So far so good, from the conservative
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: The measure would also require that the
investments be precisely 60 percent in stock index funds and 40
percent in corporate bonds. When workers retire, they would have to
give their retirement accounts to the government, which would
convert the money into financial instruments called annuities that
would pay retirees a fixed monthly sum for the rest of their lives
and expire when they died. Workers would be guaranteed that their
monthly check would be at least as large as what they would get
under the current Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   This means workers would have nothing from the accounts to leave
to their heirs unless they and their spouse died before either
retired. And because the monthly payment retirees would be entitled
to under Social Security would almost always be larger than what
they would receive from their annuity alone, retirees' benefits in
practice would be the same no matter how the investments they had
made during their working lives had performed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had included such rigid government controls in his
plan, given his predilection for an investment-based approach to
Social Security, Shaw replied, ``There is no other way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Archer and Shaw had not mandated that investments be
exactly 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds. Then workers
might as well put their money in the riskiest ventures imaginable.
After all, their retirement benefits would be guaranteed if the
investment failed. In such a situation, the Social Security
actuaries would not have certified, as they did last week, that the
Republican plan would preserve the solvency of the system for the
next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   What if the plan did not require workers to surrender their
accounts for annuities when they retired? Then long-lived people
might exhaust their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be absolutely certain that no one, no one in
America, would become a ward of the state when they got old,''
Archer said. ``What became very clear as we went along was that as
long as the government is providing the money, it doesn't work
without government standards.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Republican dream of turning Social Security into
a mostly private system. Like countless other radical departures
(communism in Europe; Prohibition in the United States),
privatization of Social Security turns out under scrutiny to have
more drawbacks than benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what keeps those of us who study policy in business,''
said Donald Kettl, a political science professor at the University
of Wisconsin. ``Policy is almost always more complicated than what
it looks like in the headlines. If you worry about the mechanics,
then you lose the headlines,'' Kettl continued. ``And if you lose
the headlines, then you lose support.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the lesson of Bill Archer and Clay Shaw.

said Donald Kettl, a political science professor at the University
of Wisconsin. ``Policy is almost always more complicated than what
it looks like in the headlines. If you worry about the mechanics,
then you lose the headlines,'' Kettl continued. ``And if you lose
the headlines, then you lose support.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the lesson of Bill Archer and Clay Shaw.

   WASHINGTON _ Bettye Travis is 5 feet 5 and weighs 300 pounds. So
when the National Institutes of Health broadened its definition of
overweight last year using a gauge called body mass index, Ms.
Travis, 47, the proprietor of a cake- and candy-making supply store
in San Francisco, didn't bother to calculate hers. She said she
didn't need the government to tell her she weighs too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fat all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other people are fat, too, it turns out. By the
government's new definitions, more than one-half of all Americans
aged 20 to 74 are overweight and one-fifth fall into a new
category: obese.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Travis, a board member of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance, the expanded definitions are another
example of the way this thin-obsessed nation has turned love
handles into a medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   But to the pharmaceutical industry, the corpulence of America
means something else entirely: a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last week when Hoffman-LaRoche, one of the
world's biggest drug makers, received approval from the Food and
Drug Administration to sell Xenical, the first in a new class of
anti-obesity medications that work by blocking the body's
absorption of dietary fat. It is the first pill to be approved
since the government recalibrated its definition of who qualifies
as overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard relies on body mass index, which experts say
provides a better measurement of body fat than the traditional
height and weight charts. Until last year, men were overweight if
their body mass index was 27.3 or higher; for women, the cut-off
was 27.8. Today, anyone with a body mass index of 25 or higher is
overweight, by government standards. And a new category, obese, has
been added for those whose index is 30 or above. (For the record,
Ms. Travis' body mass index is about 50.)
</P>
<P>
   The government did not pick those numbers out of a hat,
nutrition experts say; studies show that people at those weights
are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
heart disease and other chronic disorders that contribute to
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say diet and exercise _ not drugs _ are the best
solution to a weight problem. But losing weight by dieting and
exercise is not easy, and with excess body fat increasingly being
viewed as a disease, the experts say, the drug industry cannot be
blamed for putting forth a pharmacologic fix. And of course, it is
lucrative: financial analysts say the market for Xenical, which is
expected to cost about $1.10 a capsule and $100 for a month's
supply, could approach $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Xenical is not dramatically effective; patients taking
it in combination with a reduced diet lost eight pounds more, on
average, than those taking dummy pills.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is intended for patients with a body mass index of 30,
or an index of 27 if the patient also has conditions that are
worsened by obesity, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol or
diabetes. But doctors will be able to prescribe the drug to anyone,
and Dr. David Williamson, who studies diabetes at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, said some obesity experts worry that
the government's body mass standards will prompt interest among
patients who don't really need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that when patients advocate to their physicians that
they want a drug, physicians will prescribe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Xenical also fits in with the broader emergence
of drugs designed to enhance life rather than cure disease. The day
after it was approved, the new fat-blocker took its place on
Internet sites selling Viagra, the medication for impotence, and
Propecia, the pill for baldness.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed promotion of Xenical comes as no surprise to Ms.
Travis. But, she said: ``It gives me a deep sadness. The world is a
tough enough place as it is without being told that you're fat.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Believe it: the Russians are hopping mad. For 8, 10
years now, they followed U.S. advice on how to become capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   They swallowed U.S. foreign-policy handouts urging that Russia
be ``integrated into Euro-Atlantic and global communities'' and
built into ``a modern, market-based economy.'' They gave up on
empire, cut up their missiles and ceded three of their clients to
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? More than $60 billion in new debt. A beggar,
rubber-ruble economy. A skeletal military. A short leash held tight
by the International Monetary Fund. And now, the leveling of their
one remaining friend in all Europe, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Washington came back again, beseeching Moscow to help
cut a deal to end the Kosovo crisis, and Russians wonder why. Most
of them now believe Washington gives lip service to free markets
and global partnership, but is secretly just as happy _ no, happier
_ to have Ivan face-down on the floor at last, one arm behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Could they be right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, not literally. It is easy to argue that America has
fumbled its policy of promoting a healthy, democratic Russia _
though the Russians have fumbled plenty all by themselves. Few
would make the case that, in the long run, the United States would
not benefit from a prosperous Russia that shares at least some of
its basic values.
</P>
<P>
   But there's the rub: nobody knows what Russia will be in the
long run. Russia may have lost a Cold War. But as the last eight
years have shown, it is no postwar Germany or Japan, no vanquished
foe to be occupied and rebuilt in the U.S. image. Quite the
opposite: the Russia that re-emerged from hibernation this spring
seems at times almost gleefully anti-American and, yearning for
empire, is considering new unions with Belarus and Yugoslavia
itself.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia is the country it seemed to be for 10 years after the
fall of communism _ a nation struggling to grow into a modern
democracy _ then the West has a long-term stake in its success. But
if the real Russia is instead the seething fury visible on the
nightly news, the glory-mongering defender of murderous
hypernationalism, then its success looms fearsomely as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States thinks of Russia mostly in the short run.
And even in the short run, it's not easy to noodle out whether U.S.
interests are best served by a Russia that is robust, or one that
is weak. For undeniably, Russia's current sallow state has given
the United States license to act in ways that would have been
unthinkable a decade ago, when two superpowers bestrode the world.
</P>
<P>
   The steady drip-drip of bombing runs by U.S. jets over Iraq
would be far riskier were Russia able to bolster its old ally,
Saddam Hussein, or wield more clout in the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's decline has shifted the balance of power further toward
America in the Middle East. It has opened potentially strategic oil
deposits in Russia's Caspian Sea backyard to U.S. companies, and
spawned a game of pipeline-building politics in which the effect of
U.S. policy _ and even perhaps the intent _ is to weaken Russia's
influence with other members of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's declaration by NATO that the alliance had
broadened its mission to battling proliferation and genocide
outside its borders would have been impossible were Russia a force
in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Russians complain bitterly, they acquiesced to
NATO's absorption of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic this
year only after being assured that the alliance was fundamentally
defensive _ and that Russia would have a voice, if not a veto, in
its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, of course, is the marquee example, the epitome of
the U.S. policy conundrum _ and the sum of all Russia's fears. Does
a weak Russia serve U.S. interests? Absolutely. Russians are
furious over NATO's decision to intervene in what they see as a
civil war. They are even more furious over Washington's turning a
deaf ear to their objections _ indeed, over the decision to
authorize bombing as Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was crossing
the Atlantic to meet President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But would a stronger Russia serve U.S. interests? The United
States seems to believe so; bogged down after 40 days of bombing,
Washington and its NATO allies have embraced Moscow as the best
hope for getting the Yugoslav strong man Slobodan Milosevic to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are exquisitely sensitive to the contrast. Western
leaders support Russia's mediation of the crisis ``for a very
simple reason _ they want to convince Russia to put pressure on
Milosevic to make him accept NATO's ultimatum, in order to stop the
military action and say that NATO has won,'' said Alexei Arbatov,
the deputy chairman of the defense committee in Russia's lower
house of parliament, at a seminar last week. ``This is not a
request for Russia to facilitate the peace process. This is
pressure on Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   From the U.S. perspective, ignoring a weakened Russia now seems
cost-free. Sure, Moscow still has 7,000 nuclear warheads, but
nobody thinks that even the craziest Russian nationalist is about
to fire them. But there's a long run in Russia, too, and a Moscow
that sees the United States as an its enemy can play some cards,
from weapons proliferation to cozying up to China. Nor can anyone
assume that Russia, with more oil than anyplace, will always be a
beggar.

</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Simes, a leading scholar of Russia who is president of
the Nixon Institute, a Washington-based foreign policy research
organization, says he understands why Moscow feels used. In his
view, the United States sincerely wanted to enlist Russia as a
strategic partner, but its decision to hang its entire policy on
President Boris Yeltsin and his team of reformers _ even as Yeltsin
became more autocratic and unpopular and the reforms were eaten
away by corruption _ left precisely the opposite impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when these individuals and those policies all collapsed in
August of '98,'' Simes said, ``I think the administration found
itself without a policy _ with a lot of frustration, with an
absence of new ideas and, if you wish, a perverse sense of
satisfaction that if Russia didn't quite live up to the
administration's expectations, at a minimum they were in such a
mess that they didn't have to take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Russians have sensed that on a variety of issues _
Iraq, Kosovo, arms transfers, Caspian pipelines. On all those
issues, the administration is talking about partnership, but in
each case its idea of partnership is that Russia would walk in
lockstep with administration policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and politically enfeebled, Russia has swallowed hard
and accepted U.S. policy on many of those issues _ even in Kosovo,
where Russia basically supported United States positions in the
United Nations. But on the other hand, Simes said, ``there's a
difference between impotence and acceptance of American policies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with Yugoslavia that that difference, long concealed under
a veneer of Russian-U.S. cooperation, has burst into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clash of civilizations,'' said Alexei Podberezkin,
the deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian
parliament's lower house, last week. ``They offer us an aggressive
and virtually Protestant model of democracy _ no, they impose it on
us. What is happening in Yugoslavia and what happened in Bosnia and
Croatia is an attempt to impose the Western understanding of
values, including democratic ones. But Russia may have other values
_ cultural, historical and democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Dobrokhotov, a former aide at the Communist Party Central
Committee in the 1980s and now an adviser to party chairman Gennadi
Zyuganov, put it more elegantly in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the actions in Yugoslavia, we've again found
our natural enemy,'' he said. ``The problem isn't Milosevic. This
is a geopolitical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more Russians agree, which underscores one of the
dangers of short-run policies: strung end to end, they become the
long run. Some Russians now argue _ and Simes said he fears _ that
with Yugoslavia, U.S. policy toward Russia may have crossed that
divide.

 MOSCOW: a beggar.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dmitri Simes, a leading scholar of Russia who is president of
the Nixon Institute, a Washington-based foreign policy research
organization, says he understands why Moscow feels used. In his
view, the United States sincerely wanted to enlist Russia as a
strategic partner, but its decision to hang its entire policy on
President Boris Yeltsin and his team of reformers _ even as Yeltsin
became more autocratic and unpopular and the reforms were eaten
away by corruption _ left precisely the opposite impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when these individuals and those policies all collapsed in
August of '98,'' Simes said, ``I think the administration found
itself without a policy _ with a lot of frustration, with an
absence of new ideas and, if you wish, a perverse sense of
satisfaction that if Russia didn't quite live up to the
administration's expectations, at a minimum they were in such a
mess that they didn't have to take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Russians have sensed that on a variety of issues _
Iraq, Kosovo, arms transfers, Caspian pipelines. On all those
issues, the administration is talking about partnership, but in
each case its idea of partnership is that Russia would walk in
lockstep with administration policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and politically enfeebled, Russia has swallowed hard
and accepted U.S. policy on many of those issues _ even in Kosovo,
where Russia basically supported United States positions in the
United Nations. But on the other hand, Simes said, ``there's a
difference between impotence and acceptance of American policies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with Yugoslavia that that difference, long concealed under
a veneer of Russian-U.S. cooperation, has burst into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clash of civilizations,'' said Alexei Podberezkin,
the deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian
parliament's lower house, last week. ``They offer us an aggressive
and virtually Protestant model of democracy _ no, they impose it on
us. What is happening in Yugoslavia and what happened in Bosnia and
Croatia is an attempt to impose the Western understanding of
values, including democratic ones. But Russia may have other values
_ cultural, historical and democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Dobrokhotov, a former aide at the Communist Party Central
Committee in the 1980s and now an adviser to party chairman Gennadi
Zyuganov, put it more elegantly in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the actions in Yugoslavia, we've again found
our natural enemy,'' he said. ``The problem isn't Milosevic. This
is a geopolitical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more Russians agree, which underscores one of the
dangers of short-run policies: strung end to end, they become the
long run. Some Russians now argue _ and Simes said he fears _ that
with Yugoslavia, U.S. policy toward Russia may have crossed that
divide.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late in the day on April 6, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson showed up at the White House with some bad news for
President Clinton: The leakage of nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons
labs was far worse than anyone thought. The Chinese _ whose prime
minister was on his way to Washington _ may have obtained computer
codes that are the key ingredient for simulating nuclear weapons
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of chilling discovery that would make for a good
Washington thriller. But real life is more complex. In a speech the
next morning, Clinton said Americans do indeed have reason to worry
about China, but not only a muscular China with the latest weapons
technology. Americans have as much to fear, he argued, from a weak
China whose ailing banks and bankrupt enterprises could undermine
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last few years from Japan's
long recession and Russia's current economic troubles, it is that
the weaknesses of great nations can pose as big a challenge to
America as their strengths,'' Clinton said. ``So as we focus on the
potential challenge that a strong China could present to the United
States in the future, let us not forget the risk of a weak China,
beset by internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal
activity, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the starkest moment yet in what has emerged as the
central foreign policy conundrum in Washington: In an age when your
military adversary can also rank among your biggest trading
partners, and when your military allies double as your fiercest
economic competitors, does America want weak global neighbors or
strong ones?
</P>
<P>
   That question is increasingly the subtext of daily debate in
Washington, fracturing the Democratic and Republican parties across
unusual lines, trapping lawmakers and pundits in circular arguments
about where America's true interests lie. It helps account for the
crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy. And the problem is made more
complex by the fact that the world stage is crowded by weak states
_ countries that are jockeying for global influence while
struggling to keep from drowning in debt, self-doubt and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, once masters of the art of converting
old-fashioned capital into political capital, have watched their
global influence decline faster than the price of an office
building in the Ginza. While Russia tries to flex old muscles in
the Balkans, it is submitting to the humiliation of having the
International Monetary Fund micro-manage its economy. (Last week,
spurred by fears that Moscow is feeling dangerously alienated from
the West, the IMF finally committed to $4.5 billion in new loans
for the nearly insolvent government, just enough to stave off
national default for another year or so.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spies who may be tinkering with the nuclear codes
are probably thankful for the fact that, unlike millions of others
who toil for the state, their jobs are going to be around for a
while. And then there are the Europeans, who are slogging through a
war in Yugoslavia just at the moment that their economies are
slowing and their new currency, the Euro, has fallen 10 percent.
This was supposed to be the year the continent focused on becoming
the next great economic superpower, linked by a single currency and
a huge market. Instead, one European finance minister visiting
Washington last week moaned, ``We're spending all our political
energy on a 600-year-old problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary moment that perhaps we haven't seen
since the '20s, or at least since the days of the Marshall Plan,''
said Kenneth Courtis, the chief Asian economist for Deutsche Bank.
``You have the world economy flying on one engine _ the United
States. And almost everyone else is dealing from a weak hand.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think this would leave Washington filled with joy, and
often it does. After all, that single engine still has its
afterburners lit: The government reported Friday an astounding 4.5
percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, once again beating
virtually every forecast. It's hard to imagine any country
threatening America's sole-superpower status for decades. It's even
harder to recall that only a decade ago Washington was still
preoccupied with Japan's buying spree in Hollywood and on Wall
Street, and wringing its hands about the successes of Asian-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration of U.S. supremacy sometimes obscures the far
more complex risks of managing world affairs amid global economic
and political fragility. And the truth is that Washington is still
a lot more comfortable containing an easily identifiable enemy than
managing a system where cracks on one side of the globe can radiate
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that weakness comes in many forms. There
is Russian-style weakness, an inability of the state machinery to
make the country function, to keep control. Whatever temporary
pleasure Americans derived from watching the Russian military
threat fall apart has been tempered by the fear that economic chaos
has put its nuclear expertise up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War we knew that Russia's nukes were under
strict control, but we were terrified of the people controlling
them,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University
professor who has written about the new challenges of managing a
global system in which leaders are overwhelmed by the forces around
them. ``Now the fear about Russia is that nothing is under anyone's
clear control _ not the taxation system and not the
atomic-industrial complex.''

</P>
<P>
   And then there is Japanese-style weakness, a subject President
Clinton will be carefully dancing around Monday as Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi arrives for an official visit. In Tokyo the problem
isn't a collapsing state; it's a chronic inability to get political
consensus, whether the issue is bolstering security in Asia or
remaking the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi will be arriving with the news that the lower house of
Parliament has finally passed legislation that would allow it, in
theory, to act like a real ally of U.S. forces should a military
emergency break out in the Pacific. But the bill was stripped of
several key elements, including one that would let Tokyo
participate in enforcing international sanctions, and the Pentagon
still fears that if North Korea lashes out, Japan may sit on its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern is whether Japan's seven-year
recession is finally ending, as the Japanese insist. If not,
Japan's troubles could choke off Asia's fragile recovery and force
the United States to continue taking in a wildly disproportionate
amount of the world's exports. Sooner or later, that will cost
American jobs, which is why Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned
again last week that America's soaring trade deficits are ``not
politically sustainable.'' But in Japan's case, as in Russia's,
Washington has few levers to pull.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Washington is never quite sure with whom it should be
negotiating. Obuchi has scant control over the pace of Japanese
reforms. That power is in the hands of the country's scared
corporate heads, its much-criticized bureaucrats and its workers,
who are terrified by the rising unemployment rate and know that
they have few options if they lose their job.
</P>
<P>
   If Boris Yeltsin was once committed to reforming the Russian
economy, he has given it up. It is notable that ever since Russia's
currency devaluation and default on some of its debt last August,
the Clinton administration has cut back on providing free advice
about the wonders of making the transition to a market economy.
``It would only stoke their resentments further,'' one senior State
Department official said. ``We're wiser to shut up about reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least there is some agreement in Washington that a
stronger Japan and an economically stable Russia are in the
country's interests. Raise the subject of China, and it's a
different story. On Capitol Hill these days, China is once again a
power to be contained.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of nuclear espionage bolster the arguments of
conservatives who say the Clinton administration has been blinded
by big business and big donors, and that it buried the evidence of
transgressions at Los Alamos because they threatened the policy of
engagement. Add their voices to those of human rights groups who
are horrified by China's recent crackdowns, unions that fear trade
deals, and Taiwan supporters who want more protection from the
mainland's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are Clinton and many of
America's China experts, who see 100 million jobless wandering the
Chinese countryside, failing state-owned enterprises and insolvent
banks that _ at the government's insistence _ keep those
enterprises afloat. And there are Russia-like symptoms: arms
proliferation, the rising power of organized crime, a military in
business for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of integrating China into the World Trade
Organization _ the deal Clinton walked away from earlier this month
_ is that it would help the Chinese pull off the feat that the
Russians couldn't. It would force China to deal in a Western legal
system, to open up, to let a billion Web users bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A nice theory, but the reality is that Washington wants China,
like Russia, to be strong on Washington's terms. Washington wants
to encourage Chinese economic strength and discourage military
strength; it wants nations to independently find their own way to a
market economy _ as long as it runs strictly according to Western
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Washington wants strong economies run by leaders who
will shrink their military power and act weakly beyond their
borders. But Washington is not likely to get what it wants.

ALF RAMSEY, 79, COACH OF ENGLAND'S '66 WORLD CUP TEAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Brazil)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alf Ramsey, who in 1966 coached England to its only World
Cup soccer championship, died Wednesday in a nursing home near his
home in Ipswich.
</P>
<P>
   He was 79 and had been confined to the nursing home, said Pat
Godbolt, his former secretary with the Ipswich Town team, since a
stroke during last year's World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey was an autocratic coach, or manager, as the English call
the position. But as Kevin Keegan, the present coach of the England
national team, said: ``He was quite simply the greatest manager
England ever had. He was a smashing man and was loved by his
players.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1955, Ramsey played for Southampton and then
Tottenham Hotspur. He also played fullback for England alongside
the legendary Sir Stanley Matthews in 32 international matches.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine years, he was coach of Ipswich Town, leading
the team from the Third Division to the championships of the Second
Division in 1960 and the First Division in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963 to 1974, he coached England to 69 victories, 17
defeats and 27 draws. In the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley
Stadium in London, his team scored a 4-2 overtime victory over West
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted the following year for giving England what Prime
Minister Tony Blair Friday called ``the greatest moment in its
sporting history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey's 1970 England team was eliminated in overtime in the
World Cup quarterfinals. His team failed to qualify for the 1974
finals, and he was dismissed in 1974. In 1977, he briefly coached
Birmingham City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alf Ramsey gave all of us in the football business the
greatest moment we have ever had as players, as coaches, as
managers, as fans and as officials,'' said Sir Bobby Charlton, the
star of the 1966 team. ``He was professional to his fingertips and
as popular with the players as any manager I've ever seen. He was a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mullery, a midfielder for England's 1970 World Cup team,
called Ramsey ``the best manager England have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullery also told this story: ``Once, when England were playing
Brazil in the great Maracana stadium, I was meant to be marking
Pele. Alf saw me looking nervous and said to me, `If you were not
good enough to play against this fella, you would be back home
watching it on the telly.' It helped me, and I went out and played
one of the best games I have ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey was proud of his World Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overriding memory of my life in football is the joy I
brought to my team and to the country,'' he once said. ``I only

TEODORO GARCIA, 110, A FIGHTER AGAINST PANCHO VILLA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Texas)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teodoro Garcia, a reluctant Mexican lieutenant who battled the
rebel Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution and is believed to be
the last soldier in the army of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, died
last Saturday in a retirement home in Texas City, Texas. He was
110.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last Federal,'' said Manuel Urbina II, a professor
of Latin American history at the College of the Mainland in Texas
City, and an expert on the survivors of the Mexican Revolution.
``There are a few, very few, who fought with Villa and others, and
who are still alive because they were 11-, 12-, 13-year-old boys,
or they fought with later factional governments during the
revolution. But Garcia was the last who fought with Diaz.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was born into a family of prosperous landowners on Jan.
7, 1889, in Sacramento, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, about 100
miles southwest of Laredo, Texas. Although he sympathized with the
poor, he made an offhand promise to a friend that he would join the
Federales, a name for Diaz's army, if they ever passed through
town. When they did, a few weeks later, the young Garcia felt that
as a matter of honor, he had to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Federales _ the name now refers to the Mexican
federal police _ was also somewhat expected of Garcia. His family,
after all, had about 40 peones on its hacienda, and Diaz was
battling civil insurrection. As it turned out, Garcia fought on the
losing side. Diaz, in power since 1876, was overthrown in 1911 by
Francisco Madero, with the help of Villa, the revolutionary leader
in the north of Mexico, and Emiliano Zapata, the leader in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Factional fighting continued until 1917, when the revolution
ended and a constitution was accepted. During this period, Garcia's
family was stripped of much of its land and possessions, and, as
the political winds shifted, the family drifted back and forth over
the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1920, feeling increasing pressure, Garcia, with his
wife, children and parents, fled permanently to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They settled first in San Antonio, where he was a building
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Garcia and his family moved to Texas City,
an oil refinery town near Galveston, on the Gulf of Mexico. His
house was one of many destroyed in April 1947 when an explosion of
a ship at a nearby pier killed more than 500 Texas City residents.
He rebuilt his house, and houses for two of his sons and several
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia grew older, he became something of a minor celebrity,
rousted by reporters and academics every 5 or 10 years or so, when
it was time to mark an anniversary of the start of the Mexican
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, at a reunion of survivors of the revolution, he said he
bore no grudge against Villa and those who had uprooted his family.
In fact, at the reunion, he dined with Villa's bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``How beautiful it is to be friends and sit together for
dinner,'' Garcia told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the questions focused less on the revolution and
more on Garcia's longevity, which he attributed to hard work, low
stress and clean, healthful living.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was proud of the fact that he quit smoking _ at 95,''
Urbina said. ``And quit drinking _ at 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's wife, Ignacia Zertuche, preceded him in death, as did
his sons, Joe Garcia, Mario Garcia, Lee Garcia, Ramirio Garcia, a
daughter, Olivia Valdez and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Lucy Robles of Texas City; 13
grandchildren; 29 great-grandchildren; 28
great-great-grandchildren, and 9 great-great-great-grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the bombing of Cambodia and the national
anguish over Vietnam that spurred Congress, over Richard M. Nixon's
veto, to enact a law that it hoped would prevent any other
president from waging undeclared war.
</P>
<P>
   The War Powers Resolution of 1973 was a masterpiece of deadlines
and trip wires, all carefully constructed to keep a president in
check. It called for consultation with Congress in matters of war.
It required the commander in chief to notify Congress quickly when
U.S. troops were being sent to face possible hostilities. And it
said troops had to be removed from foreign territory within 60 to
90 days unless Congress explicitly approved their mission.
</P>
<P>
   But the law could do nothing to change the essential nature of
Congress. Lawmakers rarely like to take an assertive stance on war
_ and most particularly not before the chances of success or the
poll ratings become clear. If anyone wanted proof of this it came
last week when Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., ignored the entreaties
of the House leadership and used the Vietnam-era legislation to
force the House to take a stand on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A philosophical muddle devoid of practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   The House refused to declare war. It would not ratify the
bombing already underway against Yugoslavia. Nor would it pull out
the troops in order to stop the bombing. Then it demanded the right
to vote again before President Clinton could widen the conflict to
ground troops. The next day, a House committee proposed to give the
president more than twice as much money as he wanted for the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signals being sent around the world are confusing,'' said
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
fumed that the House action was a ``low moment in American foreign
policy and the history of this institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over how the president and Congress should share power in
matters of war is as old as the Republic. Presidents have sent
forces abroad more than 100 times; Congress has declared war only
five times: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the
Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Article II of the Constitution makes the president commander in
chief. But Article I puts responsibility for declaring war solely
in congressional hands, and Congress, most notably in 1973, has
spasmodically tried to keep it there. But in practice, it has long
been content to cede most of that authority to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' war powers were rarely seriously challenged until this
century. But the nuclear age and the Cold War led presidents to
assume more power. In 1950, Harry S. Truman found a new way to
side-step Congress: he used United Nations resolutions instead of a
declaration of war by Congress to send troops to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the past quarter of a century presidents and
Congress have almost seemed to conspire to find ways around the war
powers law.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, after all, have never conceded that the law is
constitutional. And Congress, for fear of being accused of giving
aid and comfort to the enemy, has always shied away from pulling
back troops once confronted with a fait accompli by a president.
``Even though the law is still on the books it has basically been
ignored,'' said Peter Spiro, an associate professor at Hofstra
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, presidents have used semantic tricks to
minimize the role of Congress in military engagements and get
around the deadlines for congressional ratification. Troops are
sent into foreign conflicts that presidents insist are not
``hostilities'' under the definition of the war powers law.
Presidents assert they have satisfied the requirement to
``consult'' Congress by informing a select circle of Congressional
leaders of actions already underway.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan told Congress of the invasion of Grenada two
hours after he had ordered the landing. He told congressional
leaders of the bombing of Libya while the aircraft were on their
way. And he did not report formally to Congress when he increased
the number of military advisers in El Salvador in 1981 because he
argued there was no imminent threat of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Though Congress did vote on the Persian Gulf war, it did so only
in January 1991, just days before U.S. bombs began to fall on Iraq.
For months as half a million U.S. troops assembled in Saudi Arabia,
Congress was slow and cautious, taking little action beyond
complaining to President Bush that he needed congressional
approval. And when Clinton sent troops to Haiti, his administration
argued that no congressional approval was needed because there was
no war _ the troops had been invited.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who acknowledges ``there's a natural inclination not
to want to go on record on a controversial matter until and unless
you have to,'' believes that the war powers law may have actually
done the opposite of what its drafters intended, actively
discouraging Congress from taking stands on wars. He said
presidents and Congress often view the 90-day time limit the law
sets for a deployment without congressional approval as a grace
period during which Congress does not have to take a stand.
Afterward, with U.S. soldiers under fire, a vote against war is
politically untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Across the years, some dissident members of Congress have turned
to the courts to try to test the president's power to wage war
unilaterally. But they have been rebuffed because in each case
Congress had failed to pass a resolution ordering the president to
remove the troops.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the House on record against declaring war in
Yugoslavia, Campbell is taking another stab at recapturing
Congress' theoretical war-making authority by seeking a court
ruling to stop U.S. participation in the air war against
Yugoslavia. He may or may not get a decision before the fighting
stops.

sent into foreign conflicts that presidents insist are not
``hostilities'' under the definition of the war powers law.
Presidents assert they have satisfied the requirement to
``consult'' Congress by informing a select circle of Congressional
leaders of actions already underway.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan told Congress of the invasion of Grenada two
hours after he had ordered the landing. He told congressional
leaders of the bombing of Libya while the aircraft were on their
way. And he did not report formally to Congress when he increased
the number of military advisers in El Salvador in 1981 because he
argued there was no imminent threat of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Though Congress did vote on the Persian Gulf war, it did so only
in January 1991, just days before U.S. bombs began to fall on Iraq.
For months as half a million U.S. troops assembled in Saudi Arabia,
Congress was slow and cautious, taking little action beyond
complaining to President Bush that he needed congressional
approval. And when Clinton sent troops to Haiti, his administration
argued that no congressional approval was needed because there was
no war _ the troops had been invited.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who acknowledges ``there's a natural inclination not
to want to go on record on a controversial matter until and unless
you have to,'' believes that the war powers law may have actually
done the opposite of what its drafters intended, actively
discouraging Congress from taking stands on wars. He said
presidents and Congress often view the 90-day time limit the law
sets for a deployment without congressional approval as a grace
period during which Congress does not have to take a stand.
Afterward, with U.S. soldiers under fire, a vote against war is
politically untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Across the years, some dissident members of Congress have turned
to the courts to try to test the president's power to wage war
unilaterally. But they have been rebuffed because in each case
Congress had failed to pass a resolution ordering the president to
remove the troops.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the House on record against declaring war in
Yugoslavia, Campbell is taking another stab at recapturing
Congress' theoretical war-making authority by seeking a court
ruling to stop U.S. participation in the air war against
Yugoslavia. He may or may not get a decision before the fighting
stops.

   BOSTON _ They seem to be the disappeared, the missing, the lost
in action of the new welfare era.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more states track down former welfare recipients to
assess how their well-being has been affected by stricter
eligibility rules and more stringent work requirements, the
question of those not accounted for looms ever larger.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of the question are not trivial; the group of
people neither working nor on welfare amounts to more than
one-quarter of former recipients, state officials have said in
several preliminary reports.
</P>
<P>
   And in the information wars between advocates for the poor who
contend that recent welfare changes are too harsh and state
officials who present them as working well, the ``missing''
category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of the unaccounted-for: those who simply
could not be found by trackers and those who have stayed off
welfare but are not working. Not on welfare but not working either?
What, then, are they living on? How do they survive?
</P>
<P>
   When Massachusetts issued its first detailed, long-term report
on how former welfare recipients seemed to be doing in mid-April,
Claire McIntire, the state's commissioner of transitional
assistance, immediately hailed as good news its findings that a
majority were working and only about 20 percent were back on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But her ``very first question'' to her staff, she said last
week, was, ``What is happening to the other 25 percent?'' So she
asked researchers to get back to her about how those who were
neither working nor on welfare were getting by.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was piecemeal. Of all the households that remained
off welfare, 75 percent had an adult member working, the
researchers found. The rest could be broken down like this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Just over 6 percent were in the process of re-applying for
welfare or other assistance;
</P>
<P>
   _ About 2.5 percent were getting some form of Social Security
payment;
</P>
<P>
   _ About 12 percent had been working in recent months but were
not at the time of the survey;
</P>
<P>
   _ The remaining 5 percent or so had other explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not characterize them as missing,'' Ms. McIntire said.
``We know they're still around, and they have other means by which
they are supporting themselves and their families. And if they do
not, we want them to come back to us and we will help them get back
in the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions draw vehement challenges from the advocates for
the poor who see the Massachusetts report more as cause to worry
than to rejoice. Unfamiliar with the official breakdown Ms.
McIntire had ordered internally, they had their own ideas of what
was happening with the missing 25 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that some have probably moved in with former
spouses and boyfriends, of whom some are probably abusing them,''
said Randy Albelda, a University of Massachusetts economist, citing
the high percentage of welfare recipients who have suffered
domestic abuse. ``Some people are probably going underground and
doing illicit and illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But basically, Ms. Albelda said, ``We don't know what's happened
to people, and it's going to get worse because the people who went
back on welfare will have no welfare to go back to'' now that time
limits in Massachusetts are kicking in. ``They're our missing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates also point out that the people who could not be
found at all for the survey, or refused to answer, are likely to be
worse off than those who answered, and that respondents were likely
to be less then honest because they were told that the information
they provided could be forwarded to their case workers.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, there is a growing push to fill the holes in
the welfare puzzle. Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare policy for the
National Conference of State Legislatures, said that, in the
simplest terms, the states made changes in their welfare programs,
their case loads dropped much faster than they had expected and the
immediate question became, ``What happened to those families?'' Two
key questions, he said, are, ``How many are working and how many
are in desperate circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   That broad picture is now emerging. State reports have tended to
show that about two-thirds of former welfare recipients get jobs
and about one-fifth find themselves even poorer than before.
</P>
<P>
   So now, Tweedie and others said, efforts to track the families
that left welfare are getting more advanced, and officials are
beginning to ask follow-up questions about how former recipients
who have not found work are supporting themselves, and what exactly
are the barriers that keep them from getting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, said Jan Van Vleck, a state expert on post-welfare
tracking, the latest survey asked the question, ``If you have not
identified any forms of support, could you let us know how you are
living?''
</P>
<P>
   One way many are likely to be living, Tweedie noted, is by
depending even more on family than before. A New Jersey study of
certain former recipients, he said, found that as they were leaving
welfare, 38 percent said they planned to get a job; but only about
half of those people actually did. And just 23 percent said they
would depend on family support, but then a full 47 percent actually
did.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that such family support may not be sustainable for
long, he said, because the families that former recipients depend
on are usually poor as well.

WITHOUT ELWAY, BRONCOS COULD BECOME ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are excruciating draft day decisions, ones that keep
personnel men in the National Football League awake for days
afterward. And then there are the no-brainers. One day in 1983,
Ernie Accorsi had an easy choice to make. No advanced degrees
required.
</P>
<P>
   On the draft board of the Baltimore Colts, staring at Accorsi,
singing to him, was a baby-faced quarterback out of Stanford named
John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the easiest decision I made in football,'' said Accorsi,
then the Colts' general manager and now the Giants' general
manager. ``It was like drafting Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi would pick Elway, then be forced to trade him to Denver
after Elway refused to play in Baltimore. Elway and Accorsi, one of
the smartest personnel men in football, would cross paths again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elway who practically single-handedly beat Accorsi's
Cleveland Browns with the Drive in the 1986 American Football
Conference championship game. ``That's a game John will probably
always remember,'' Accorsi said, ``and one I would like to
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The cannon-armed Broncos quarterback went on to one of the most
brilliant athletic careers in any sport, with five Super Bowl
appearances, including victories in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of those rare players who can change the course of a
team, and I think he changed the course of a league,'' Accorsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's career comes to an end Sunday, when it is expected he
will officially announce his retirement after 16 seasons. And in
retirement, Elway's impact could be just as great as it was when he
was on the playing field. Nature abhors a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be a number of quarterbacks scrambling to fill the
void left by Elway, and plenty of teams hustling to take advantage
of what is perceived as a now weakened franchise in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   With Elway gone, the landscape of the division he dominated _
the AFC West _ is wide open. Elway's backup, Bubby Brister, was 4-0
in games he started in place of Elway last season, but because of
injuries, Brister has not played a full season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Brister healthy is the biggest challenge for coach Mike
Shanahan. If Brister goes down, the Broncos will be in trouble. The
second-year quarterback Brian Griese is not ready yet, and Chris
Miller, who signed on as a free agent during the off season, has
not played since retiring because of severe concussions in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the defending Super Bowl champions could come
from almost anywhere in the conference. In the AFC West, the
Seattle Seahawks have the talent, and a great coach in Mike
Holmgren, to beat the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to Denver will probably come from the AFC
East, perhaps the most powerful division in football and one with a
stellar cast of quarterbacks. Buffalo has Doug Flutie, and
Indianapolis has a mature Peyton Manning and a vastly improved
defense. Miami has a motivated Dan Marino, since time is running
out for him to win a championship, and New England has Drew
Bledsoe, who would love to take over Elway's title as football's
most prolific passer.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has always beaten up on New England, especially at Mile
High Stadium, and Elway played some of his best football in those
games. When the Patriots heard of Elway's retirement, the team
probably broke open a bottle of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are the team most prepared to knock off the Elway-less
Broncos. They almost did it in the AFC title game last season,
jumping to an early lead before being torched by Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have loaded up on free agents in the off season, to add
depth and firepower. One Jets player said he and other players have
talked frequently in recent days about how they are now the team to
beat.
</P>
<P>
   For the Broncos, the man in charge of keeping the barbarians
from storming the gate is Shanahan. The former coach of the year
still has lots of talent to work with in wide receivers Rod Smith
and Ed McCaffrey, tight end Shannon Sharpe and running back Terrell
Davis, who rushed for more than 2,000 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver definitely loses something with Elway's retirement,
one element being a psychological edge. Teams knew that almost no
lead they earned was safe because in the wink of an eye, Elway
could come back. Brister, through no fault of his own, does not
inspire that kind of fear. ``It will be different for us, without
John,'' Shanahan said. ``There is no question that the Denver
Broncos will never be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the league, of course, isn't exactly misty-eyed.  &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD _ In the hierarchy of values in Hollywood, money
dominates. But no one likes to talk about it. While it's perfectly
normal to discuss marital infidelities, drug addiction, sexual
dysfunction and other intensely personal matters, money is,
curiously, not mentioned because everyone is so obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   But now two of the dominant players in town, Michael Eisner,
chairman of Walt Disney Co., and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worked for
him for 10 years as chairman of Disney studios, are not only
talking about money _ they're publicly attacking each other over
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not one but two golden Hollywood rules have been broken. The
town is not only mortified but fascinated by the odd legal battle
now going on in a Century City law office as if passing a car wreck
on the 405. No one can quite believe it's happening.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the issue is Katzenberg's contention that he's
owed at least $250 million, and perhaps double that, from Disney in
profits from projects he helped create from 1984 to 1994 including
``The Lion King,'' ``The Little Mermaid, ``Aladdin'' and ``Good
Morning, Vietnam.'' In 1994 he quit in anger when Eisner failed to
promote him to No. 2, president of Disney Co. Katzenberg went on to
found Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. Disney has
acknowledged that Katzenberg deserves some bonus payment but
nothing close to the amount he's seeking.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the case pits two very rich moguls against one another
_ not exactly the stuff of high courtroom drama or even a good
movie.
</P>
<P>
   At another level, though, the Katzenberg-Eisner clash has
elements of almost Shakespearean drama. The two men, who were both
raised on Park Avenue in New York, were virtual brothers for nearly
two decades. Their fallout was personal, even destructive to
themselves. The case, said Katzenberg's lawyer, Bertram Fields, was
``about the personal animus of one man'' _ Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the case seems to be about the outsize animus of both men
toward one another, a raging hatred that has led them to break the
Hollywood code of behavior that decrees that no one talk about
money and no one hurl public abuse at each other. (Private abuse is
quite another issue.)
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and Katzenberg will, of course, survive the case and, no
matter what happens, will remain extraordinarily rich. But their
reputations, at least for the moment, are damaged by the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, with Katzenberg on the stand, he was depicted
by the Disney lawyer, Louis Meisinger, as a studio executive whose
live-action films were $231 million in the red when he left the
company _ a sharp rebuke to Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also released letters that sought to diminish Katzenberg.
To assure his profits, Katzenberg wrote a letter that ordered
Fields to be ``an absolute killer.'' Following an acrimonious
contract negotiation in 1988, Katzenberg wrote Eisner: ``You've
been great. You've handled my crap with extraordinary patience and
understanding. I'm deeply appreciative and do love you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Fields asked his client, Katzenberg, to confirm
that he received $100 million in compensation during his years at
Disney. Fields also asked if Eisner had received $1 billion during
the same period, and Katzenberg answered yes _ before retired Los
Angeles County Superior Court Judge Paul Breckenridge sustained
Meisinger's objection.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Eisner, who is scheduled to appear in court this
week, was depicted by Katzenberg and Fields as duplicitous. At the
same time Fields said that the Disney senior executive vice
president, Sanford Litvack, and Irwin Russell, a Disney board
member and Eisner's personal attorney, made misleading and false
statements about Katzenberg's contract. The three ``came up with a
story,'' said Fields. ``Each story is patently untrue. I don't say
that lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubby and highly secretive world of Hollywood's power
elite _ in which Fields himself is a member in good standing _ such
public accusations would have been unthinkable. Until now.

   A Red Alert for America's Forests
</P>
<P>
   Red maples, long seen as the poor relations of the maple family,
are taking over America's Eastern forests.
</P>
<P>
   Once confined to swampy areas, red maples have gained a foothold
on drier upland soil, thanks to a decline in forest fires, which
have been suppressed during the last century. The fires used to
destroy the trees while sparing dominant species like oaks, with
their thick bark and deep, extensive root systems.
</P>
<P>
   The red maples, which can thrive under almost any set of upland
conditions, show remarkable aggressiveness and resilience, getting
the jump on other species by dropping their seeds in spring rather
than in autumn, and using chemicals in their leaves to repel gypsy
moths, which devour oaks and elms.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found that red maple saplings today tend to
dominate the carpet of young trees and shrubs under the forest
canopy, and when existing oaks and related species like hickory die
or are cut down, the red maples will replace them.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to miss these arboreal invaders. Their foliage is
green in the summer but turns brilliant scarlet or crimson in the
fall. In the winter, the buds and many twigs are red. In the
spring, so are their flowers and the whirlybird seed pods that hang
from drooping red stems.
</P>
<P>
   If the maples succeed in driving out oaks, a variety of small
creatures, from birds to nut-eating animals to insects that live in
oak bark, will go with them. The result could be a less vibrant
ecosystem, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   One way to change the trend would be to restore fire to the
woods, as is often done today for conservation reasons. But the way
things are going, scientists say, the oaks and other species that
have dominated the region's forests for 10,000 years may one day be
lost in a sea of red.

   An Import That Japan Likes
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. This isn't another Viagra joke.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, though, that Viagra's wonders never cease. The
latest evidence? The pill has inspired Japanese bureaucrats to move
with, relatively speaking, lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: the low-dose birth control pill has for years
dominated the contraceptive market in the United States and
elsewhere. Among industrial nations, only Japan failed to approve
it. The application has been languishing for a decade there _ a
molasses-like timetable that is apparently typical of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   When these sober bureaucrats caught wind of Viagra, though, they
flew into action, giving it the go-ahead in a head-turning six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Could the difference have anything to do with the ministry
consisting of 198 men and 6 women? Absolutely, critics say. ``Japan
is a male-dominated society,'' said Tomoko Adachi, a Tokyo
gynecologist. ``Many Japanese women do not even want to have
Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said urologist Takaaki Minami, ``Many women who have
gone through menopause say that Viagra will be a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuisance or no, Japanese men are jubilant. Shigeharu Kobayashi,
an insurance executive, said, ``I'm 60 years old, but I think I'm
16.''

   Court Rejects Theory In Espy Prosecution
</P>
<P>
   With a narrow interpretation of the federal gratuity statute,
the Supreme Court made it substantially less likely that someone
could inadvertently cross the line between bestowing gifts on a
public official and committing a crime. The unanimous decision
rejected the theory behind an independent counsel's prosecution of
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and of an agricultural
cooperative convicted of giving him tennis tickets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   The court said such gifts were illegal only if linked to an
``official act,'' hoped-for or accomplished; merely cultivating
good will is not a crime.

   Justices to Rule on Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   It was far from a victory in the tobacco wars, but it was the
best the Clinton administration could hope for from the Supreme
Court. The justices agreed to decide whether the Food and Drug
Administration has the authority to regulate tobacco products as a
drug. While a ruling is perhaps a year off, the court thus kept
alive the prospect of federal regulation of smoking, which appeared
dead last summer when a federal appeals court ruled that Congress
had never given the FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes.

   More Damage in Spy Case
</P>
<P>
   Government officials now say a scientist already suspected of
spying for China may have given away secrets to virtually every
nuclear weapon in America's arsenal. Mainly in 1994 and 1995, the
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, downloaded computer codes from a classified
system at the national laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., and
transferred the data to a widely accessible computer network at the
lab, officials said. Senior members of Congress expressed outrage
over the government's failure to monitor Lee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Eases Some Sanctions
</P>
<P>
   Trade sanctions were once a preferred method of punishing
nations linked to terrorism, like Iran and Libya. But a two-year
Clinton administration study has concluded that sanctions on food
and medicine tend to backfire, doing little to counter terrorism
while depriving innocent civilians. As a result, the White House
announced that as a general rule, food and medicine will be exempt
from sanctions. An early beneficiary will be Iran, which will
probably be allowed to import $500 million worth of U.S. grain and
sugar.

Central Council to abandon the idea of pronouncing the West Bank

Israeli elections. He told the council that U.S. and European
officials, and some Arab leaders, had asked them not to make a
unilateral declaration at this sensitive moment in order to avoid
rupturing the peace process.

   Indian Parliament Dissolved
</P>
<P>
   India is heading toward its third general election in three
years following the collapse of the Hindu nationalist-led
government that had ruled the nation for the past year. The
fractious ruling coalition narrowly lost a vote of confidence two
weeks ago, and when President K.R. Narayanan concluded that the
equally fractious opposition parties had failed to muster a new
majority, he dissolved the Parliament to make way for fresh
elections, which must be held within six months.

   ``We are becoming a nation of gamblers,'' said Richard Leone,
one of the nine members of the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission. Leone proposed inserting that declaration into the
commission's forthcoming report, which will be delivered to
Congress and President Clinton on June, 18. The commission is
expected to recommend changes to state lotteries, a ban on Internet
betting, tighter regulations for Indian casinos and a moratorium on
gambling expansion.

   U.S. Birth Rate at New Low
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, federal officials have announced a
steady decline in the teen-age birth rate. Now officials say the
rate has dipped so sharply that it has helped push the nation's
overall birth rate to the lowest point since the government began
keeping records in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, there
were 52.3 births for every 1,000 teen-agers in 1997, a drop of 16
percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Every state reported a decline, and the drop was most pronounced
among Puerto Rican and non-Hispanic black teens.

   The 1997 session of the Arkansas General Assembly was widely

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ He is a head of state now, no longer a
renegade colonel plotting a coup d'etat. At his insistence, a cowed
Congress has given him the authority to rule by decree, and voters
here last week convoked a Constituent Assembly that seems likely to
greatly expand his powers and term of office. But three months
after he was sworn in as president, Hugo Chavez continues to
perplex and unnerve Venezuelans, not to mention the rest of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that Chavez, a 44-year-old former
paratrooper who in 1992 led a bloody but failed attempt to
overthrow the elected government of this South American nation, is
the most intriguing political figure to emerge in the region in
years. His speeches, railing against privilege and corruption and
promising a peaceful ``social revolution'' that will redeploy
Venezuela's vast oil wealth to improve the lives of the masses,
have electrified a citizenry that had grown cynical and despondent
about the prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez has also engaged in behavior that can only be
described as bizarre coming from a head of state, and has
demonstrated little understanding of _ or patience with _ the
normal give and take of politics as conducted in a democracy. A
former associate who has broken with the president calls him ``a
Jekyll and Hyde'' figure with pronounced authoritarian tendencies,
and Chavez himself seems to take pride in baffling all who would
demand consistency, either intellectual or deportmental, from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are designing something completely new here, and from the
ideological point of view I absolutely refuse, and will refuse to
the grave, to let myself be labeled or boxed in,'' he said
recently. ``I cannot accept the notion that politics or ideology
are geometric. To me, right and left are relative terms. I am
inclusive, and my thinking has a little bit of everything,
especially at this moment in which paradigms are being shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's recent threats to dissolve Congress and the Supreme
Court, institutions he calls ``worm-eaten and decadent,'' and to
send his supporters into the streets can be viewed as an exercise
in bare-knuckles political brinkmanship. As tactics, they are
perhaps coarse, and summon unsettling memories of past military
strongmen in the region like Juan Peron. But they have proven
effective and are hardly surprising, given that Chavez came to
maturity in a military environment where orders were given and
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   It is far more difficult to explain the friendly letter Chavez
wrote recently to the terrorist Carlos the Jackal, a Venezuelan
serving a life sentence in a French prison whose acts include
murder, hijackings and the kidnapping of OPEC oil ministers in
1975. Venezuela is a member in good standing of the oil cartel,
whose recent success in scaling back production to push up gasoline
prices could not have occurred without the cooperation of Chavez's
Government. But that did not prevent Chavez from addressing Carlos
the Jackal as a comrade in arms in the same unnamed cause.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply human solidarity,'' said Chavez, who was clearly
offended that his motives were being questioned when the existence
of the letter surfaced and there were criticisms of his conduct
here. ``I was in prison for two years, and I know it is
heartwarming when one receives a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of his public pronouncements have a left-populist
flavor, Chavez has discomfited the Jewish community and others here
by cultivating a friendship with an obscure Argentine writer,
Norberto Ceresole, who maintains the Holocaust never occurred.
Ceresole espouses a neo-fascist doctrine that calls for bypassing
political parties in favor of a ``leader-army-masses'' triangle,
and many observers claim to see traces of that philosophy in
Chavez's harsh attacks on Venezuela's two main political groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trusts no political party, not even his own,'' the
amorphous Fifth Republic Movement, said the ambassador of a
European country. ``He sees himself as embodying the desires of the
masses and having a direct link to them, and so his vision of
democracy sees no need for intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would surely prefer a more
conventional political leader in charge of a country that in recent
years has become the United States' principal source of imported
oil. Chavez was in fact banned from traveling to the United States
after the 1992 coup attempt. But the ban was lifted after he was
elected president in December, and he visited Washington before
taking office in an effort to patch things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is past history,'' a State Department official said
earlier this year. But recently there have been signs of tension in
the relationship with Washington. Granted, the Clinton
administration expressed no objections to the referendum here, in
which more than 80 percent of voters endorsed Chavez's call for an
assembly to write a new constitution. ``The important point for the
United States government is that the process of reform move forward
in a democratic fashion,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a visit by an assistant secretary of State
scheduled for late April was postponed indefinitely after
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel, a prominent
journalist who is well-known for his anti-American outbursts,
accused Washington of exerting ``elements of pressure'' to thwart
Chavez's efforts to transform Venezuelan society. What drew
Rangel's wrath was the latest of numerous U.S. statements
expressing support for Chavez so long as he respects ``democratic
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, whatever autocratic ambitions Chavez may harbor
are constrained by countervailing institutions and a balance of
powers that has been put in place during more than 40 years of
democracy. But the constituent assembly, which is scheduled to
begin six months of deliberations in July, is likely to change all
that, and Chavez maintains that, despite a recent Supreme Court
ruling to the contrary, the 131-member assembly will have the power
to dissolve the legislative and judicial branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   To amused applause, a satirical revue that has been drawing
packed houses here since shortly after Chavez was elected suggests
that his long and increasingly frequent speeches on television need
subtitles to explain what he really means. Venezuela, a comedian
remarks, is living through a ``state of transition,'' which he
defines as ``going from one mess you know to another that is
completely unknown.'' When he says that, though, the response is
not applause, but nervous laughter.

</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ If much about the murderous
shootings in Littleton, Colo., seemed alien and bizarre, at least
one part of the story seemed familiar: the world of jocks and
nerds, preps and geeks, winners and losers that defined life at
Columbine High. The incident and others like it have been viewed
through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values and
parenting. But the fact that such horrors keep playing out in high
schools tracks longstanding and growing concerns about what kind of
educational and social environments they provide. By Peter
Applebome. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ The central U.S.
foreign-policy conundrum: In an age when your military adversary
can also rank among your biggest trading partners, and when your
military allies double as your fiercest economic competitors, does
America want weak global neighbors or strong ones? The question
helps account for the bizarre crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy
these days, and is complicated by the fact that the world stage is
crowded with weak countries jockeying for global influence while
struggling with economic woes. By David E. Sanger. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Moscow) _ If Russia is the country it
seemed to be for 10 years after the fall of communism _ a nation
struggling to grow into a modern democracy _ then the West has a
long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead
the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering
defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms
fearsomely as a threat. So the U.S. thinks of Russia mostly in the
short run. By Michael Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ To the pharmaceutical industry,
the corpulence of America means a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government. That was evident last week when
Hoffman-LaRoche received FDA approval to sell Xenical, the first
pill to be approved since the government recalibrated its
definition of who qualifies as overweight. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-MISSING-REVIEW (Boston) _ As states track down former
welfare recipients to assess how their well-being has been affected
by stricter eligibility rules and work requirements, the question
of those not accounted for looms ever larger. They amount to more
than one-quarter of former recipients. And in the information wars
between state officials and advocates for the poor, this `missing'
category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield. By
Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-FEUD-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ In the hierarchy of values
here, money dominates. But no one likes to talk about it. While
it's normal to discuss intensely personal matters, money is not
mentioned because everyone is so obsessed with it. But now two key
players here, Disney chairman Michael Eisner and his former deputy
Jeffrey Katzenberg, are not only talking about money but they're
publicly attacking each other over it. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As a case study in
politics and the development of government policy, the Republicans'
new Social Security plan belongs in the textbooks. It shows how
when politicians dig beneath the surface of a complicated topic,
they often learn that their ideological preconceptions are
unrealistic. By David E. Rosenbaum
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PARTY-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Communist Party chief Jiagn Zemin
and his aides are worried that the party is losing touch with the
masses, so they are trying to create a more relevant party via an
old-fashioned `rectification' campaign to promote ideological
conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly run the
country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally, to
assure Jiang a place in history. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kosovar camps and
shantytowns that have sprung up in Albania are filled with refugees
who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey. Among them is the
account of Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old farmer who left his home
with his family eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ANTIWAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ In the debate over NATO's
bombing of Serbia, the voice of the American anti-war movement has
not been heard to any great degree. Once it was so loud that it
helped end the Vietnam War. But it may be heard soon if the war
widens. By Irvin Molotsky.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-WARCOSTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For an air war that in the
eyes of many U.S. generals has been run on the cheap, tactically,
bombardment of Yugoslavia could go down as the most expensive
military campaign, bomb for bomb, in history. It's costing more to
kill fewer people. By Eric Schmitt. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-WAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Debate over how the president
and Congress should share power in matters of war is as old as the
Republic. A look at the history of the debate, with particular
focus on the War Powers Act. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ For Venezuelan voters, a nervous
honeymoon. Three months after he was sworn in as president, former
renegade Hugo Chavez continues to perplex and unnerve Venezuelans,
not to mention the rest of Latin America. By Larry Rohter.

struggling to grow into a modern democracy _ then the West has a
long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead
the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering
defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms
fearsomely as a threat. So the U.S. thinks of Russia mostly in the
short run. By Michael Wines. (`i' category)

<P>
   There are excruciating draft day decisions, ones that keep
personnel men in the National Football League awake for days
afterward. And then there are the no-brainers. One day in 1983,
Ernie Accorsi had an easy choice to make. No advanced degrees
required.
</P>
<P>
   On the draft board of the Baltimore Colts, staring at Accorsi,
singing to him, was a baby-faced quarterback out of Stanford named
John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the easiest decision I made in football,'' said Accorsi,
then the Colts' general manager and now the Giants' general
manager. ``It was like drafting Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi would pick Elway, then be forced to trade him to Denver
after Elway refused to play in Baltimore. Elway and Accorsi, one of
the smartest personnel men in football, would cross paths again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elway who practically single-handedly beat Accorsi's
Cleveland Browns with the Drive in the 1986 American Football
Conference championship game. ``That's a game John will probably
always remember,'' Accorsi said, ``and one I would like to
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The cannon-armed Broncos quarterback went on to one of the most
brilliant athletic careers in any sport, with five Super Bowl
appearances, including victories in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of those rare players who can change the course of a
team, and I think he changed the course of a league,'' Accorsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's career comes to an end Sunday, when it is expected he
will officially announce his retirement after 16 seasons. And in
retirement, Elway's impact could be just as great as it was when he
was on the playing field. Nature abhors a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be a number of quarterbacks scrambling to fill the
void left by Elway, and plenty of teams hustling to take advantage
of what is perceived as a now weakened franchise in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   With Elway gone, the landscape of the division he dominated _
the AFC West _ is wide open. Elway's backup, Bubby Brister, was 4-0
in games he started in place of Elway last season, but because of
injuries, Brister has not played a full season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Brister healthy is the biggest challenge for coach Mike
Shanahan. If Brister goes down, the Broncos will be in trouble. The
second-year quarterback Brian Griese is not ready yet, and Chris
Miller, who signed on as a free agent during the off season, has
not played since retiring because of severe concussions in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the defending Super Bowl champions could come
from almost anywhere in the conference. In the AFC West, the
Seattle Seahawks have the talent, and a great coach in Mike
Holmgren, to beat the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to Denver will probably come from the AFC
East, perhaps the most powerful division in football and one with a
stellar cast of quarterbacks. Buffalo has Doug Flutie, and
Indianapolis has a mature Peyton Manning and a vastly improved
defense. Miami has a motivated Dan Marino, since time is running
out for him to win a championship, and New England has Drew
Bledsoe, who would love to take over Elway's title as football's
most prolific passer.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has always beaten up on New England, especially at Mile
High Stadium, and Elway played some of his best football in those
games. When the Patriots heard of Elway's retirement, the team
probably broke open a bottle of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are the team most prepared to knock off the Elway-less
Broncos. They almost did it in the AFC title game last season,
jumping to an early lead before being torched by Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have loaded up on free agents in the off season, to add
depth and firepower. One Jets player said he and other players have
talked frequently in recent days about how they are now the team to
beat.
</P>
<P>
   For the Broncos, the man in charge of keeping the barbarians
from storming the gate is Shanahan. The former coach of the year
still has lots of talent to work with in wide receivers Rod Smith
and Ed McCaffrey, tight end Shannon Sharpe and running back Terrell
Davis, who rushed for more than 2,000 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver definitely loses something with Elway's retirement,
one element being a psychological edge. Teams knew that almost no
lead they earned was safe because in the wink of an eye, Elway
could come back. Brister, through no fault of his own, does not
inspire that kind of fear. ``It will be different for us, without
John,'' Shanahan said. ``There is no question that the Denver
Broncos will never be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the league, of course, isn't exactly misty-eyed.  &QL;

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Look around the sprawling Chaparral High
School campus at lunch time, and the social geography of the 1,850
students is clearly mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   The football players and their friends have the center table
outdoors, at what everyone calls the ramada. In back of them, the
picnic tables are filled with popular students, too: an attractive,
preppy array of cheerleaders, lesser jocks, and members of the
student government and the All Stars, a service club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't dare come sit out here if you didn't know the
people,'' said Lauren Barth, a sophomore cheerleader. ``But once
you're in with the girls, everyone is really friendly to you. When
I made cheerleader, it was like I was just set.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in the cafeteria, there are more braces and glasses and
hair that doesn't quite have a shape. These tend to be students
with less social status, the skateboarders, the nerds, those who
say they are just regular, the freshmen who have not yet found
their place in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other lunchtime domains: a bunch of art students
eat in the studios, some band members gather by the music building,
and dozens of drama students _ and others attracted by their
nonconformist clothes and easy acceptance _ in the theater
building.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the choices, a few students still have no niche,
eating upstairs or alone outside the library, or just wandering,
their heads low as they pass clumps of noisy schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Like Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and hundreds of
other large, well-regarded suburban high schools, Chaparral, here
in this affluent suburb east of Phoenix, is a pleasant place, where
parents, teachers and students take justifiable pride in their Ivy
League acceptances, their sports teams, their theater productions
and their vast array of extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with big-city schools, these schools look homogeneous:
the majority of the students are white, middle class, dressed in
the same handful of brand names. But the reality is far more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been lost on those who run the good suburban schools
that the most horrifying violence has been at their kind of places,
not at inner-city high schools filled with disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   They speculate about possible structural explanations, pointing
out that the most troubled urban high schools long ago geared up to
prevent violence, with metal detectors and tough discipline codes.
Then, too, the nation's dropout rate has declined sharply since the
1960s, especially in suburban schools. Poor urban schools still
lose many of their problem students to the streets; suburban
schools still have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the kids who were really having trouble,
the misfits, would leave,'' said John Kriekard, the principal at
Chaparral. But now, ``we serve all kinds of kids and we have to try
to be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a microcosm,'' he said. ``Put 1,850 people together,
adults or adolescents, and there are bound to be some tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others also emphasize the central role schools play in
suburban life: ``In big cities, there are lots of places where kids
make connections, where they have pieces of their lives,'' he said.
``But in a place like this, we're pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence has always been a time of identity formation, with
inclusion and exclusion, trying out new ideas, styles and friends.
And good looks, athletic prowess, academic achievement and money
have always helped to define the social terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But schools mirror changes in the society around them, and high
school principals from Vermont to California say that the larger
world is now handing them a declining level of civility, fewer
shared values, less parental support, increasing competition _ and
a few students who act out so seriously as to disrupt the whole
school.
</P>
<P>
   Some research on high schools has found that where students fit
in the school landscape determines how they see it. Carol Miller
Lieber, a former principal who directs high school programs at
Educators for Social Responsibility in Cambridge, Mass., says many
students entering high school already see themselves as losers.
</P>
<P>
   She cites a study from a suburban Chicago high school finding
that students who see themselves as outside the winners' circle
have far more negative views of a school than either the teachers
or the most successful students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these big high-powered suburban high schools, there's a
very dominant winner culture, including the jocks, the
advanced-placement kids, the student government and, depending on
the school, the drama kids or the service clubs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the winners are a smaller group than we'd like to think,
and high school life is very different for those who experience it
as the losers. They become part of the invisible middle and suffer
in silence, alienated and without any real connection to any
adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with Chaparral students confirm the research: the
popular students who lunch outside were far more likely than the
ones sitting inside to say that they love the school, and feel
connected to at least one teacher.
</P>
<P>
   A group of freshmen eating inside nodded vigorous agreement as
Catherine Hodge discussed her sense of Chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this school and I don't know anybody who does,''
she said. ``A lot of it is that football is such a big part of
school and so many people take the whole popularity thing out of
control. And it's like most of the teachers have been teaching for
20 years and don't seem to care much. They all teach the same way,
but all kids don't learn the same way. I wish it was a little more
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Many educators see school size as a real barrier to
personalization, arguing that students at schools with more than
1,000 students _ that is, most American high schools _ find it
easier to slip through the cracks, and harder to form close
relationships with teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too big,'' said Chaparral's Kriekard. ``I think the
optimal size is something under 1,000. We do very well at serving
the extremes, the motivated, gifted students and the
special-education students. But the hardest to identify, and
satisfy, are unmotivated, gifted kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chaparral, where violence is almost unheard of, the Colorado
shootings came the week after a student assaulted a baseball player
with brass knuckles, and some members of the baseball team
retaliated by smashing the attacker's car with their bats.
</P>
<P>
   The principal had smelled trouble brewing: ``We do know enough
about who's who so that a week beforehand, when we saw the
assaulter talking to the sophomore athlete table, not the place
he'd usually be, we went out and asked what was going on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kriekard says the incident was a fight over a girl, but many
students describe it in more tribal terms, as a reflection of
low-level, but long-simmering tensions between athletes and others
_ the same discomforts that apparently helped spark the Colorado
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Chaparral's athletes do not see it that way. ``I don't see the
team treating people badly, or people resenting us,'' said Grant
Simpson, a sophomore football player. ``It's true that if you mess
with someone, you're messing with all their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Chaparral students, the Littleton shootings came as
a forceful reminder of what group grudges can lead to. ``Brass
knuckles isn't supposed to happen here and it did, so you sort of
think maybe anything can happen here,'' said Jillian Sitto, a
freshman who loves Chaparral and is running for class secretary in
next week's student government elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me to death because people are so cliquey here, and
there's so much emphasis on who you're friends with. I looked
around and tried to think if I could imagine kids feeling so angry
here and I could. There are kids who get picked on a lot. It's
usually a whole lot of little little comments that add up. I try to
be nice to everybody. And after the shootings I tried to be really
really nice, because you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   She said students get excluded at Chaparral for all kinds of
differences, from being overactive, to being fat to being perceived
as homosexual. And, she said, although she likes the few Gothic
drama students she knows, many of her friends are wary of them,
unsure whether the dark clothes signal Satanism, separatism, or
just a different sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   The drama students, meanwhile, are defensive these days, annoyed
at being sought out by reporters, and scrutinized by schoolmates.
To an outsider, the drama building seems the most accepting of
diversity, a place where top students mingle with a few special
education students, and those who are seriously involved in the
school's ambitious schedule of student-written, student-staged
productions co-exist easily with those who just come for refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be accepted by the drama kids, because we're all
so different,'' said Melissa Fischer, a self-assured A student who
says she is happy at Chaparral, wants to be a doctor, and is active
in theater production, choir and Unitown, the club that promotes
diversity. ``This is my place, the group I identify with. There's
us in here and them out there. But I find Chaparral a pretty easy
place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked what she would like to change about the
school, she named the cliques, saying her aversion went back to
middle school, when the popular, preppy students would not accept
her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some students do cross social lines, maintaining varied webs of
friendship. Scott Kirschenbaum, who writes a music column for the
local newspaper, heads several of Chaparral's clubs, and will
attend Yale next fall, has actively sought to know a lot of
different people. By almost any measure, he is one of the school's
successes _ but even he is critical of Chaparral's social climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaparral's very competitive,'' he said. ``To be on top, you
have to finagle. There's a lot of back stabbing. You can't be
flawed, or your friends will kick you out of the group. You know
how when you're applying to college, they tell you to think about
what kind of place you're looking for? Well, I wish somebody would
do that at Chaparral, would sit down and think about what kind of
place it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Columbine coverage by news organizations, he said,
he was struck by how much it seemed like Chaparral _ and how one of
the girls killed was captain of the debate team, as he is. ``I kept
thinking how much her life was like mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other honors students perceive Chaparral as intensely
academic. Jeremy Hamerman, a junior on the debate team who is
planning a college major in political science or philosophy (``Do
you know who Kant is? He's very good.'') then graduate school at
Harvard or Stanford, reads 100 pages a night, currently ``The
Brothers Karamazov'' and ``The Prince'' (``I have to prepare
because other people are preparing, somewhere'').
</P>
<P>
   And he is utterly dismissive of the school's jock culture.
``I've been friends with some of them forever,'' he said.
``Sometimes I sit with them in their pointless little world.''
</P>
<P>
   His Chaparral experience is worlds away from that of Billy Muna,
one of the boys who come to the drama building for lunch, though
they take no part in the theater program.
</P>
<P>
   A junior who spends much of his day in a class for students with
emotional difficulties, Muna is not outlandishly dressed, but his
gray turtleneck and black pants, his slightly browner skin, and
some diffidence, subtly mark him as an outsider. But he finds the
hall where the group sits to be comfortable turf. ``I really was a
problem kid when I started Chaparral,'' he said. ``If someone
didn't talk to me in a nice way, I'd fight. Then I got really
interested in playing guitar, and now the school is growing to me.
I still feel kind of uncomfortable here; the kids have so much
money. I think of myself as somebody different. And since the thing
in Colorado, we get looks from everybody. After those shootings,
they talked about the warning signals, and they're describing kids
like us. What am I supposed to do with that?''

WAR IN BALKANS STRETCHES PENTAGON'S RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war in the Balkans is stretching the Pentagon's
longstanding global strategy, which calls for dedicating enough
forces to the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula to fight and
win wars in both places at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, the Navy shifted its only aircraft carrier in
the western Pacific, and its 75 combat jets, out of the region
indefinitely to help wage the Yugoslav campaign. The Pentagon
briefly suspended enforcement of the no-flight zone over northern
Iraq when fighter-bombers and radar-jamming planes were dispatched
to the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's fleet of refueling planes has been spread so thin
that President Clinton last week ordered the first of 33,000
reservists called up to sustain round-the-clock bombing runs. And
the Air Force general who commands U.S. combat planes says the
military is running dangerously low on its most potent cruise
missiles and satellite-guided bombs fired from B-2 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be really touch and go,'' Gen. Richard Hawley,
head of the Air Combat Command, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with two full-blown regional military crises at the same
time has been a centerpiece of Pentagon planning since the end of
the Cold War. The strategy calls for waging two overlapping ``major
theatre wars.'' That has meant conflicts in the Persian Gulf and on
the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody anticipated we'd be doing a war in Europe,'' said
Zalmay Khalilzad, a Pentagon official during the Bush
administration. ``In the midst of Kosovo, should something develop
in both the gulf and North Korea, there would have to be some
extremely tough choices made.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, critics have derided the strategy's underlying
assumptions, dismissing the likelihood of two simultaneous wars and
the idea that a shrinking American military could move large
amounts of weaponry and materiel quickly enough to a far-flung
second front.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Balkans conflict intensifying, and allied forces
waging a low-grade air war in northern and southern Iraq, the
strategy does not seem so far-fetched anymore.
</P>
<P>
   If a crisis arises on the Korean peninsula, Pentagon officials
have put scores of bombers and fighter planes in the United States
on alert to fill in for forces sent to Yugoslavia. The aircraft
carrier Constellation in San Diego, not due to sail to the Pacific
until June, is on 96-hour notice to deploy earlier, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and North Korea have shown no signs of trying to exploit
NATO's preoccupation with the Balkan crisis, American intelligence
analysts say. Nonetheless, Pentagon officials are anxiously
watching both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told Congress last month: ``Suffice it to say that what we have
going right now in Kosovo is a major theater war worth of air
assets. It has strained the force in the Pacific theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The strains would worsen if the United States and its NATO
allies reversed their opposition to invading Kosovo with ground
troops. In that event, 100,000 to 150,000 American soldiers could
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   These worries have prompted grumbling from some senior regional
American commanders, and top officers at the military's Joint Staff
in Washington, about the impact of a request from Gen. Wesley
Clark, an army general and NATO's military commander, for 300
additional American aircraft and more bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kind of looks at this saying, `You got to be
kidding,''' said one senior Air Force general. ``Clark has
advertised this to be a major regional war, and he's making the
prophecy come true. It seems to be a lot of aircraft for the amount
of air space he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force munition ship normally based at Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean, which supplies aircraft bound for the gulf or the
western Pacific, was ordered diverted last week to the
Mediterranean to supply the war effort there.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also risks running out of its prewar supply of
some 900 joint direct attack munitions, the satellite-guided bombs
dropped off the B-2 bomber, before the next scheduled shipment from
the manufacturer in May, Hawley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had already said it had fewer than 80 of its
3,000-pound cruise missiles that are launched off B-52 bombers.
Congress approved an emergency request to convert 92 nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles to conventional payloads, but even so, those will
not be ready before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff are closely watching the strains the
Yugoslav campaign has put on forces earmarked to defend the gulf
and Korean peninsula. The burden is especially heavy on limited
numbers of highly specialized reconnaissance, surveillance and
radar-jamming planes, as well as the transport ships and planes
that would have to rush American forces from one conflict to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Yugoslavia, Shelton says, now means there is a
much higher risk that any second regional war would be protracted,
with significant casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they both happen bing, bing, that's the worst case,'' said
an officer on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said virtually all
American peacekeeping, humanitarian and training exercises would be
sharply reduced or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressional Republicans, who have long complained that
the administration has shortchanged the military's budget at the
same time it piled on new humanitarian or peacekeeping operations,
now say the United States should curtail its involvement in
overseas missions, reverse the decade-long trend of a shrinking
military, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 1.4 million-member active-duty military is two-thirds
the level of the Cold War armed force of the 1980s. Since then,
demands on the Army, Navy and Air Force from overseas missions have
increased by 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come that we should pull out of some of these
commitments or enlarge the force and better equip them,'' said Rep.
Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who heads the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some military commanders say the war in Yugoslavia will only
worsen this strain. ``We are seeing an increase in stress on the
forces left behind in the states, those that would augment next,''
said Hawley. ``They are seeing a decline in readiness and I expect
that will become more aggravated the longer this operation
continues.''

ON CONFLICT'S FRONT LINE, HUNGARY FEELS ANXIETY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ At night, Attila Chikan's mother, a woman in
her 70s whose generation recalls World War II, hears the bombers
over Yugoslavia, even though, her son says, ``from where she lives,
it's physically impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   For the generation of Chikan, 55, Hungary's economics minister,
the war over Kosovo is a sharp contrast to memories of vacations in
Yugoslavia in the 1970s, when Tito's reform Communism inspired
restless young Hungarian economists.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, a professor of economics, is also in touch with
students. That generation, he said, ``doesn't understand the war,
from the point of view of rationality.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, Hungary has gone from a front-line member
of the old Warsaw Pact in a Cold War to being a front-line state in
NATO's first hot war, and the experience is straining the nation of
10 million _ politically, economically, militarily, and
individually.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the first NATO tankers began flying from Hungary, and
attack aircraft will soon use its air bases for their sorties. A
sense of anxiety hangs over Hungary, a sense of support but not
enthusiasm for the war, and even that is not felt uniformly through
the generations of a nation that persistently finds itself sitting
astride the fault line between East and West. The war erupted less
than two weeks after Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic joined
NATO. Hungary's willingness to aid the war effort has angered
Russia, its former ally.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Moscow by the Hungarian foreign minister was canceled
and Moscow recalled its ambassador for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   The war threatens the Hungarian economy, which only recently
began recovering from the financial shock of last year's Russian
economic meltdown and which is faced with slowing growth in western
Europe, now its major trade partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, its people are quick to point out, is the only NATO
state bordering Yugoslavia, and there are misgivings over the fate
of the Hungarian minority in Serbia's Vojvodina region, north of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Vojvodina Hungarians, some fleeing military conscription in
Yugoslavia, others uncomfortable with the regime of President
Slobodan Milosevic, are fleeing to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   They are joined by a wave of Serbs, not impoverished masses like
many of the Albanians from Kosovo who have flooded Albania and
Macedonia, but middle class people and members of the political
opposition, disillusioned after years of peaceful dissent as much
by NATO's bombs as by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Sztojan Vujicsics, a Hungarian writer of Serb descent (in some
of his writings he uses the Serb spelling of his name, Stojan
Vujicic), said Hungarians are intent on fulfilling their
obligations to NATO. ``But they don't want to destroy
Serb-Hungarian relations, which are very ancient,'' he said. ``The
war will end, with all its consequences. But neighbors are
neighbors, and we will continue living here.''
</P>
<P>
   After five weeks of airstrikes, with NATO appearing to stumble
politically and militarily, he said, ``a dilemma is arising both
among intellectuals and the common people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is rising anxiousness,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in this corner of Europe, Vujicsics' family reflects
Hungary's complex historical weave. In the 17th century, his
forebears fled Turkish expansion in Serbia. Ever since, his family
has remained here, in the heart of a sizable Serb community. Now he
welcomes the latest wave of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Horvath is the son of Hungarians from Novi Sad, in northern
Yugoslavia. Shortly after the bombs began falling there, he and his
wife left for Budapest, where he has family. They managed to cross
the Yugoslav border on a technicality involving a German visa
Horvath had obtained for academic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hungarian is his mother tongue, Horvath, 32, speaks
fluent Serbian. Indeed, in 1987, when he was barely 20, his first
thin volume of Serbian verse was awarded Yugoslavia's most
prestigious young poets' prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary could have been an intermediary,'' he said, over
coffee, with bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   He is no friend of Milosevic, but the bombs, he said, are
destroying civil society in Yugoslavia. ``The land is destroyed,
there is no money, no economy,'' he said. He does not intend to
return when the war ends.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Yugoslavia, Hungary is flourishing, and he and his
wife quickly found work teaching. Like some other Yugoslavs, ethnic
Hungarian and not, they have found the Hungarian government fairly
uninterested in their lack of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, growth here was 5.1 percent, and at least 4 percent
is expected this year, double the rate in western Europe. The
Budapest stock market, battered last summer by the Russian crisis,
has sprung back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Laszlo Koszonits, managing director of Mahart,
Hungary's river shipping company, looks out over the Danube from an
office a block away, he sees that it is empty of ships. Earlier
this month, NATO bombs destroyed bridges over the river in Novi
Sad, paralyzing traffic on one of Europe's longest inland
waterways, a vital artery for the Balkans, central Europe and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four ships and 24 barges _ 20 percent of our total capacity _
are stranded,'' he said. Revenues this year are projected to be a
third to a half lower than last year's $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise liners no longer ply the Danube from Vienna to the Black
Sea, hurting tourism. The Dunaferr steelworks, down-river at
Dunaujvaros, is scrambling for alternative carriers for the iron
ore it hauls up from the Black Sea and the steel rolls and sheets
it ships out, said Mihaly Schneider, the marketing director, at an
increased cost that makes the steel less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, said Koszonits, `'the West paid to destroy those bridges,
and the West will have to pay to rebuild them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials fear the war's effects on tourism, which
accounts for 9 percent of the economy. And Moscow's anger could
lead to cuts in oil and gas supplies, which come mainly from
Russia, and would cost more to replace.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO membership has increased Hungary's attractiveness to
foreign investors, the effect could be neutralized if investors
perceive the war-torn region as inherently unstable.
</P>
<P>
   There are no signs this is happening yet. Nokia, the Finnish
phone company, is building a big research center here, and the
German car maker, Audi, plans a $600 million factory. But the
longer the war lasts, the greater the risk becomes. ``I think it
grows exponentially, because of the increasing mistrust of this
area.'' Chikan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas Wachsler, the state secretary in the Defense Ministry,
said Hungary has sent a 35-member medical team to Albania, and its
military planes are airlifting food and other supplies for the
refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   But to protect its minority in Yugoslavia, Budapest has told
NATO that Hungarian troops will not get directly involved in the
war, and that there is no way Hungary could be used as a staging
base for a NATO ground invasion of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to avoid Hungarians under the NATO flag fighting
against Hungarian conscripts under the Yugoslav flag,'' Wachsler
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jozsef Kasza, the ethnic Hungarian mayor of Subotica, the
largest Hungarian city in Yugoslavia, recently warned Hungary's
prime minister, Viktor Orban, against ``toying with the fate'' of
the Vojvodina Hungarians.
</P>
<P>
   With the expulsion of the Kosovar Albanians, said Wachsler, the
Hungarians are Yugoslavia's last minority, ``which is of primary
concern to the Hungarian government, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, there are no signs that Belgrade is moving
against the ethnic Hungarian minority. Indeed, Hungarian newspapers
have reported promotions of ethnic Hungarian officers in the
Yugoslav Army, in an apparent bid for loyalty, although Wachsler
said he could not confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in Hungary show 55 percent of the people supporting the
airstrikes, and 75 percent backing NATO membership, up from 60
percent at the time of accession in March. Yet two-thirds back the
ban on using Hungarian troops in action.
</P>
<P>
   With the dismemberment of the old Hungary by the Trianon Treaty
of 1920, Hungarian minorities remain not only in Yugoslavia, but
also in Slovakia and Romania. Governments in both those countries
now include Hungarian ministers. More than anything else,
sensitivity to minority rights appears to steel Budapest's resolve
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Janos Martonyi, the foreign minister, said that ``patience and
determination'' were required.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we cannot allow it when a government decides to
massacre one part of its population based on religious or ethnic
issues,'' he said. At the end of World War II, he said, ``there was
fundamental agreement that that could never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to understand that NATO just cannot lose,'' he
said.

<P>
   Transplant surgeons who once concentrated on vital organs like
hearts, livers and kidneys are branching out, transplanting an
array of body parts with surprising success, and possibly heralding
a day when tissues not essential to life are routinely given to
others.
</P>
<P>
   To the astonishment of many experts, the two men recently given
new hands in Lyon, France, and Louisville, Ky., are progressing
well, without rejection crises. With less publicity, surgeons
elsewhere have successfully performed experimental knee, larynx,
trachea, femur, nerve and muscle transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The newer transplants are believed to be few _ no central
organization keeps a tally and there is no way to know how many
people would benefit from them if they prove successful in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as word of the early successes spreads, doctors are
beginning to stretch their imaginations. Leading transplant
surgeons envision a future where they can put new faces on burn
patients; give a woman new breasts, or even a uterus; transplant
penises; and reconstruct jaws and neck tissues for patients with
cancer, gunshot wounds, dog bites or accident injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the new, non-vital transplants raise disturbing ethical
questions. With rare exceptions, transplant recipients must, for
the rest of their lives, take powerful anti-rejection drugs, whose
side effects include increased risks of infection, diabetes, cancer
and other conditions. Who should decide if the risk is worth the
reward? Who should pay for the procedures? If they prove effective,
will people be willing to donate their tissues for nonessential
operations?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is second only to cloning as an ethical issue,'' said Dr.
Rollin K. Daniel of Newport Beach, Calif., who was part of a team
that performed experimental hand transplants on baboons in the
1980s at McGill University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The new transplant operations are generally experimental and
must be approved by an ethics committee before they are carried
out. Many of the newer procedures failed when they were tried years
ago. Improvements in surgical techniques, drug therapies and tests
to monitor rejection crises have paved the way for the revival, but
until scientists learn more about the new procedures, no one can be
sure whether they will revolutionize medicine or end up as
footnotes in medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, a few doctors in fields like orthopedics and
transplantation who were not aware of each other's work have begun
sharing information, learning about advances in other specialties
and trying to apply them to their own fields.
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons are expressing tempered excitement at the
explosion of possibilities. Success with the hand transplants, for
example, could even lead to radical procedures like face
transplants in a burned child, said Dr. John H. Barker, head of the
Louisville team's research program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tickled to death just because we can now give something
that looks like a jaw back to somebody,'' Barker said. ``But it
does not look very cosmetically pleasing at all.'' With the new
transplants, ``we could tackle things that are very difficult to
reconstruct, like the tongue,'' he said. ``There is nothing that
you can steal from anywhere in the body that will make a tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Transplants are being considered as new treatments for disease.
For example, researchers are testing whether a thymus transplant
can restore an immune system destroyed by the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the thrill of breaking new medical ground is an issue
that gets far less attention: How to manage rejection of a
transplanted tissue that is not essential for life in an otherwise
healthy person. The underlying assumption is that the drugs can be
stopped, the donor part can be amputated, and the patient's health
will not have been significantly harmed. But some critics question
how well such a patient's body would respond after having been
immunosuppressed for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   For life-saving heart, liver and other organ transplants, ``you
can always justify upping the doses of the medication because the
alternative is death,'' said Daniel, the Newport Beach surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is: Are you ever justified to put a patient's
life at risk on an on-going basis with immunosuppression just to
justify a quality of life transplant?'' Daniel said. ``If suddenly
the transplants start failing, who will be there for the patient?
At what point are you going to draw the line to ask: `How much
damage have you done?' and say that it is not worth a life to save
this transplant?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ramon Llull, a plastic and transplant surgeon at the
University of Pittsburgh who went to Germany to learn about knee
transplants, argues that non-vital transplants could be worth the
risk. Immunosuppressing drugs are used to treat some cases of
non-life-threatening conditions like psoriasis and rheumatoid
arthritis, he pointed out. ``If so, why can't we use the same
therapy for nonessential transplants?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Review boards vary in their willingness to approve human
experiments. But once approved, it is the patient who decides
whether to accept the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' views should be given more weight in deciding whether
to proceed with an experimental operation, said Dr. Thomas E.
Starzl, the surgeon who in 1963 performed the world's first liver
transplant. ``The relationship between doctors and patients is too
much like that of a warden in a prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the costs of the new operations could become a point of
contention. For now, most of the transplants, which can cost
$200,000 and more, are experimental, require long periods of
supervised rehabilitation, and are financed by private research
funds, often with time donated by doctors. If the operations become
standard, it would be up to insurance plans as to whether they
would be covered, as transplants of vital organs generally are now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties, patient demand drives much of the
effort. There are plenty of patients who say they are willing to
take large risks to get a new hand, joint or voice to restore their
physical and psychological well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say you can live without a voice,'' said Dr. Marshall
Strome, who gave a patient a new larynx in Cleveland in January
1998. Yet, he said, ``One of the first candidates was a gentleman
who had been 10 years without his larynx following cancer and, as
president of the Lost Voice Club, was telling people how easy it is
to live after having a laryngectomy.''

   HANDS
</P>
<P>
   The first hand transplant _ performed in Ecuador in 1964 _ was a
dismal failure, rejected in two weeks. Thirty-four years later,
last September, an international team of surgeons in Lyon announced
they had given another man's hand to a 48-year-old Australian,
Clint Hallam. Surgeons in Louisville, Ky., did the same on Jan. 24
for Matthew Scott, 37, of Absecon, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The operations were undeniably feats of surgical virtuosity,
requiring the joining of nerves, muscles, bones and so on. But in
interviews, other transplant experts sounded more appalled than
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``operation is dangerous and irresponsible,'' said Susan E.
Mackinnon, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis
who has done research on nerve transplants for 20 years. She added:
``All it's going to do is save a limb, it's not going to save a
life. I wouldn't save a limb for immunosuppression for life.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington University, Mackinnon contended, the ethics
committees that govern experiments with humans would have rejected
a proposal to do a hand transplant without more compelling evidence
of success in animal experiments. Other critics contend that the
teams should have started with patients who lost both hands because
they had the most to gain in a successful experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons who performed the hand transplants reject such
criticism. They proceeded with great care, they said, noting that
ethics committees at two separate institutions approved the
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Louisville team, Dr. Warren C. Breidenbach, said
his surgeons devoted three years to preparation, including
experiments in which they gave pigs new limbs for up to four
months, at which point they killed the animals to study the
transplantation. Moreover, he said, even before seeking surgical
candidates, they announced their intent to perform the procedure
and solicited comment at scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Both patients are gaining strength and function in their new
hands. But it will be at least a year from the transplant before
either man can learn what degree of sensation and other nerve
function will return. Since the transplant, relations between
Hallam and his doctors have become strained, and Hallam said in an
interview that he is planning to hire his own team of physical
therapists to speed up function of his new hand.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, Scott, who lost his hand more than 13 years ago in
a fireworks accident, threw out the first ball at the Philadelphia
Phillies home opener. Last week, Scott left Jewish Hospital in
Louisville to return to his job in paramedic management and
teaching at a community college. He now can grasp thin objects such
as a poker chip from a table; turn a door knob; use a computer;
pick up a glass to drink; and hold hands with his young sons, a
hospital spokeswoman said. He will continue supervised physical
therapy in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Even at best, the new hands will never be the same as the
natural hands, the transplant surgeons said.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the novel work of a German surgeon, it is
unlikely that Hallam and Scott would have new hands.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, the surgeon, Dr. Gunther O. Hofmann, transplanted
a knee to an accident victim who otherwise would have undergone
amputations or walked with a rigid leg.
</P>
<P>
   That patient, and three other men after him, sought knee
transplants and accepted the risks of immunosuppression drugs
because they wanted to continue to be athletic.
</P>
<P>
   Now the men, aged 17 to 47, have resumed working, surfboarding
and participating in other sports, Hofmann said in an interview
from his clinic in Murnau, near Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Like hand transplants, the knee operations involve transplanting
several types of tissue at the same time _ arteries, veins, bone,
bone marrow, cartilage, ligaments and muscle. Unlike the hand, they
do not involve skin and nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Hofmann, who said his clinic is the largest
trauma center in southern Germany, was a critical factor in the
decision to proceed with the hand transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann's team, which also has performed three experimental
femur transplants, has established strict medical criteria for
selecting patients for knee transplants ``because we are aware of
the problems with a non-vital transplant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only people who have destroyed their knee joint and knee cap and
lost the ability to straighten a leg are eligible. The injury must
have occurred within the last six months. The team will not operate
on any candidate for an artificial knee joint or other procedure to
repair or reconstruct the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hofmann estimated that he would have performed 50 knee
transplants by now, except for difficulties in finding enough
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The four men who received new knees have varying limitations in
movement, but all are vastly better off than without a transplant,
Hofmann said.
</P>
<P>
   One, a German dentist, has resumed full-time practice in Spain.
A second, Elmar Deugebauer, works for UPS in Germany and does heavy
lifting. ``He should not, but he does,'' Hofmann said. The two
other men, who had to change careers because of their injuries, are
in business school. One had had 30 operations before the knee
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Llull, the plastic and transplant surgeon at the University of
Pittsburgh who went to Murnau to examine the knee patients, said he
was ``astonished'' when he visited Hofmann's clinic. ``They had
fabulous results,'' Llull said.
</P>
<P>
   The UPS worker was so enthusiastic about the surgery that he
drove 700 miles to show off his knee to Llull, who had the patient
walk up and down stairs. The only abnormality he detected was
slight swelling, Llull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann said he was not aware of any other group that has
attempted knee transplants, in part because few orthopedic surgeons
have had experience with transplant surgery. ``Everyone is waiting
for the first five-year results of our program,'' he said, because
``we have had problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann was referring to a fifth transplant patient, a
32-year-old woman who had undergone two major operations that
failed to reconstruct her damaged knee. She suffered two severe leg
infections, which Hofmann's team thought it had controlled before
performing the knee transplant. But three weeks after she began
taking the anti-rejection drugs, the infection recurred. To beat
the infection, she had to stop taking the immunosuppressant drugs,
but her body then rejected the new knee. With no working knee
joint, she will walk with a rigid leg.

   Each year, millions of people worldwide benefit from the most
successful of all transplants _ blood transfusions. Tens of
thousands can see through new corneas or benefit from bone and
cartilage transplants used in knee, hip and other orthopedic and
reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Dr. Claus K. Herberhold of the University of Bonn took
the success with cartilage transplants a step further, performing
the first trachea transplant in an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 130 people have been given windpipes to
replace tracheas that were narrowed or malformed from birth
defects, destroyed in accidents, or scarred after having breathing
tubes in the windpipe for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   No failures have been directly related to the operation,
Herberhold said. It has given the gift of normal breathing to
people who used to feel like they were trying to breathe through a
straw. Still, largely because the initial reports were published in
German, it was almost 20 years before a trachea transplant was
performed in this country, by Jeffrey P. Jacobs of All Children's
Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs only learned of the technique because he had gone to
London to train in heart surgery with Dr. Martin Elliott at the
Great Ormond Street Hospital. In 1994, Elliott, who had heard from
colleagues about Herberhold's work, modified the technique for a
5-year-old patient. Instead of making a horizontal incision in the
neck to reach the trachea, as Herberhold did with adults, Elliott
made a vertical incision and split the breast bone to reach the
lower end of the child's trachea. Meanwhile a heart-lung bypass
machine maintained the child's circulation and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   As with cartilage transplants used in orthopedic surgeries, the
trachea, which is made of fibrous cartilage, is treated with
chemicals to destroy foreign materials known as antigens that could
trigger rejection reactions. The tissues are transplanted without
their blood supply, which also lowers the risk of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The transplanted cartilage acts as a sheathing to allow it to
merge with the body's own cartilage. A plastic stent is temporarily
inserted to prevent collapse of the trachea.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few weeks, cells from the recipient start growing
along the inside lining of the new trachea. The cells have
hair-like projections that help brush away infectious agents and
particles that trickle down the trachea. With time, the new trachea
appears normal when doctors use a tube to look at it. The
transplanted cartilage does not seem to grow. But because the
long-term growth potential of donated trachea is not known,
surgeons use an oversized trachea just to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   After Jacobs returned to Miami, in September 1996, he and
Elliott performed the first trachea transplant in the United
States, on a teen-age girl. With the permission of federal health
officials, Elliott brought a donor trachea from England.
</P>
<P>
   Until her operation, the girl had severe breathing problems and
often could not go to school. ``The operation turned the girl's
life around,'' Jacobs said. Now she plays volleyball and softball.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he has done three additional cases, plans a fourth
this week, and that three surgeons in Boston, Iowa City and
Philadelphia each has done a tracheal transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue banks in Miami, London and Bonn now collect tracheas.
Herberhold said he was working with a company, Biodynamics, in
Erlangen, Germany to make tracheal cartilage more widely available.
THE LARYNX  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim Heidler was going about 40 miles an hour on his motorcycle,
eager to get to a firefighting class in 1978, when he ran into a
cable strung between two trees. The cable severed his esophagus,
crushed his larynx and caused serious internal bleeding. Surgeons
operated for eight and a half hours, and were forced to leave him
with a permanent hole in his windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   In recovering, Heidler developed hepatitis, and a
life-threatening staphylococcal infection nearly led to amputation
of his legs. After two years and 27 operations, he was released
from the hospital, but he could not speak on his own.
</P>
<P>
   About two months after the accident, Heidler began using an
electric voice box, or electrolarynx, a device also used by
thousands of accident victims and laryngeal cancer patients. But it
was hard to use. ``People were trying to figure out how you're
talking and were not paying attention to what you are saying,''
said Heidler, now 40 years old and living in Duncansville, Pa. ``It
has that robotic voice to it, and you almost have to watch the
person's lips to understand.'' When on the telephone, he said,
``People just think they are talking to a computer, and they just
don't pay any attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Heidler heard a news report about a trachea transplant
in a young girl. A friend, a nurse, wondered whether something
similar could be done for him and learned that Dr. Marshall Strome,
a Cleveland surgeon, had conducted 12 years of research on animals
to develop a larynx transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The only other laryngeal transplant ever performed was a partial
one, on a 62-year-old man with laryngeal cancer in Ghent, Belgium,
in 1969. The man spoke, but he died of the cancer soon after.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1998, as Strome removed the dead man's larynx, he was
not sure it would fit Heidler because it was much larger and shaped
differently than his patient's.
</P>
<P>
   The operation took 12 hours. Because of the injuries and repairs
made 19 years earlier, Strome had to transplant the larynx and a
group of adjacent tissues. They included 70 percent of the throat
and two glands in the neck: the thyroid and parathyroid. He also
connected a key nerve, known as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, on
one side. The one on the other side had shriveled and could not be
found at surgery, Strome said.
</P>
<P>
   Strome told his patient it would be six weeks before he would
let him use his new voice. But three days after the operation,
Strome said he ``couldn't stand it any longer.'' He strolled into
Heidler's room, put a glove on to cover the hole in Heidler's neck,
and said: ``I want you to breathe out and say hello or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidler said that with his head and neck so swollen, he thought,
``no way.'' But though the words were raspy, he was speaking again.
``Hello,'' he said. ``Hi, Mom.'' By last summer, Heidler was
singing. More recently, he has sung hymns in church, but cannot get
high tones yet.
</P>
<P>
   His words are clear, though still a bit raspy. But vocal quality
depends not just on the larynx but also on the size and shape of
the mouth, throat, sinuses and so on. So Heidler's voice resembles
neither that of the donor (a singer whose voice is preserved on
tape) nor Heidler's old one.
</P>
<P>
   Because Strome is working in uncharted waters and the only
information comes from animal experiments, he is not sure how much
he can lower the dose of immunosuppressant drugs, which he would
like to do to decrease the risk of infection. Reflecting on his
role as a human guinea pig, Heidler said, ``The only difference
between me and the rat is I can talk and the rat can't tell you how
it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Strome said he had five patients who want a new voice. But they
cannot afford the $200,000 estimated cost, and insurance companies
will not pay for the experimental procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Debates over the ethics are valid, Strome said. ``But what about
the folks who don't want to live their life without a voice?'' he
said ``Shouldn't they have the opportunity to have it done, if they
understand the risks?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Susan Mackinnon's harsh criticism of hand transplants largely
reflects her experience with the nerve transplants that she does to
help repair injuries in young people.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach is unusual because she aims to produce a temporary
transplant. The donor nerve is used to form a scaffolding to bridge
a missing segment of nerves, which is intended to last long enough
for the recipient's body to regenerate its own nerves. That usually
occurs at a pace of about an inch a month.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the recipient takes the standard immunosuppressive drugs
for the time it takes for the nerve to regenerate _ about two years
_ not for the lifetime required in other transplants. Then the body
can safely reject the donated nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve transplants are intended to avoid amputation of a limb.
Mackinnon, who is a professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery
at Washington University in St. Louis, said she has been very
strict in selecting the eight recipients of the nerve transplants
that she has been performing since 1988 when she worked at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient's nerves were damaged accidents. Their ages ranged
from 3 to 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   One transplant failed, showing that ``even a small nerve can
reject,'' Mackinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   In repairing severed nerves, Mackinnon first tries to join the
ends, or fill a gap by taking a piece of nerve from the leg or
elsewhere in the patient's body.
</P>
<P>
   But some injuries require larger sections of nerve than the
patient can spare. It is in such cases that Mackinnon has used
nerve transplants to bridge the gap temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it appears a transplant of a spinal cord is beyond
reach because it contains thousands of nerve connections.
</P>
<P>
   The human nerve transplants are born out of Mackinnon's 20 years
of research on regeneration and immunology on rats and primates.
Mackinnon first performed a peripheral nerve transplant on a human
in 1988, and she then waited five years before doing another
``because nerves grow slowly, and it takes a long time to know
what's going on,'' she said. With experience, she has found that
for unexplained reasons cooling the nerve for a week improves the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Her technique has been picked up by doctors at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston and at Children's Hospital in Boston. In the
summer of 1997, they were considering a similar transplant on a
girl who had severe nerve damage in her arm. A few hours after she
celebrated her first birthday, the girl's father suddenly died. The
girl's doctors, led by Dr. Joseph Upton, took nerves from the
father's arms and legs and gave them to his daughter. She is
``doing fantastically well,'' Upton said, but cautioned, ``it will
take time and growth to more objectively determine the degree of
function provided by the transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, doctors at Baylor took a nerve from a father's leg
and a week later transplanted it into his 1-year-old son to repair
a paralyzed hand. The doctors are hopeful that the boy will have
hand sensation and movement in a year.
THYMUS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are trying to broaden the uses of transplants in
treating disease and are focusing on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The thymus is a gland deep in the neck and upper chest that
helps regulate immune function. Usually, the gland is largest in
childhood and shrinks with age.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians first performed thymus transplants, apparently
successfully, in the late 1960s to treat babies who were born
without a thymus from a rare condition called DiGeorge syndrome.
However, experts say they cannot completely interpret the results
today because of the inadequacy of the tests used to detect
DiGeorge syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, researchers experimented with thymus transplants
for AIDS patients, using thymus discarded during infant heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than transplanting the gland, Dr. Richard Hong at the
University of Wisconsin developed a technique to transplant thymus
into muscle. Doctors at five medical centers in the United States
conducted a trial involving 50 adult AIDS patients. But the thymus
therapy failed. Hong has since found that transplanting pieces of
donor thymus in the omentum (an apron of fat that covers the
intestines) is easier than into muscle in children with DiGeorge
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hong, now at the University of Vermont in Burlington,
teamed with Dr. Andre J. Nahmias of Emory University in Atlanta to
do experimental thymus transplants in four children dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The transplants were performed before the introduction of the
more effective anti-HIV drug combinations. Three of the four thymus
transplant recipients died of AIDS. But the first recipient, a boy,
improved and is doing well.
</P>
<P>
   As newer research shows that a shrunken thymus remains more
active later in life than previously believed, scientists are
focusing more on the damage that HIV, the AIDS virus, does to the
gland. Nahmias said his team is continuing thymus transplants in
monkeys in the belief that the transplants might have a beneficial
role among the substantial number of AIDS patients in whom the new
drug cocktails fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nahmias said he was ``convinced that up to 15 percent of adults
have HIV that hits the thymus and kills off the cells, and that
leaves nothing else but a thymus transplant to replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke University scientists have used a variant of the technique
to transplant thymuses to five adults with AIDS. But in each case,
the thymus was rejected, although all five are alive. The approach
is also being tested by researchers in Australia.

   MUSCLE
</P>
<P>
   Heart transplants may be routine these days, but surgeons are
trying other twists on muscle transplants that show promise for
reconstructive surgery after cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for skin cancer had left James Crook, 56, with a
5-by-5 inch area of bare skull in 1996. Doctors at Washington
University in St. Louis wanted to use Crook's own muscle to cover
the area, but they could not because earlier surgery limited the
potential donor sites, and heart failure made him too high a risk
for surgery. So gauze covered the exposed skull for two months
while Dr. Timothy R. Jones, a plastic surgeon, searched for a
muscle donor.
</P>
<P>
   Crook was an unusual candidate for a muscle transplant because
he was already taking immunosuppressant drugs to preserve a donor
kidney. The first kidney transplant failed after one and a half
years due to a viral infection. But a second transplant had worked
well for four and a half years. The skin cancer was a common
complication of the anti-rejection drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After finding a suitable donor, Jones took the deceased's
muscle, put it on the bare area of the scalp, and connected blood
vessels in the muscle and Crook's neck. Then the surgeons took skin
from Crook's leg to cover the bare scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't need the muscle to function as muscle, but to
provide a blood supply to nourish the skin while it healed over the
bare skull,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we cared about was that the muscle transplant would allow
the overlying skin to stay healthy, and we doubted that Crook would
mount much of a rejection to the donor muscle,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But even rejection of the donor muscle would have benefited
Crook because a chronic rejection reaction can produce blood vessel
growth and scar tissue that would anchor the skin. If so, the skin
would live because it was Crook's tissue and it would be nourished
by the growth of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle transplant succeeded, but Crook's heart condition
worsened and he died about 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard in South Africa became the
first to successfully transplant a human heart and set off a me-too
fever among cardiac surgeons around the world. Experience soon
taught surgeons greater respect for the complexity of overcoming
the immune system's power to reject donated tissue. But now the
excitement about the hand transplants has some surgeons planning
similar transplants at their own centers.
</P>
<P>
   The next world first in transplant surgery could come from Rome,
where a plastic surgeon plans to apply to health officials to
transplant a penis. The surgeon, Dr. Nicolo Scuderi, said that
three people have requested a penis transplant. Two are women who
want sex change operations. The third is a man who had his penis
amputated in a sex change operation to become a woman but who now
wants to return being a man.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the recipient of such a transplant would
be capable of having an erection.
</P>
<P>
   With this as with other procedures, critics say contend that
researchers are moving faster than animal experiments justify. Wait
a few years, they say, for perfection of strategies now being
studied in hopes patients will escape lifetime immunosuppresant
drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists are studying chimerism, a common
reaction to transplantation in which there is two-way traffic:
cells from donor tissue migrate to the recipient's skin, and the
patient's own cells migrate to the transplanted tissue. They can
persist in harmony for years. A hope is to manipulate the chimeric
reaction to reduce the risk of rejection reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategies involve taking cells or tissue from a donor,
treating it in a laboratory, and then injecting the material into
the recipient to prime the recipient's body to later accept a real
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy involves bolstering a recipient's immune
defenses to counter rejection such as by developing antibodies
against one or more antigens. Antibodies are proteins that the body
forms to defend against triggers in foreign tissue known as
antigens. The hope is that the specially developed antibodies will
block recognition of specific antigens and allow the recipient's
body to tolerate a graft.
</P>
<P>
   For all her caution, Mackinnon, the Washington University
surgeon who criticized the hand transplant, foresees a new era.
``We are quite close to dramatic changes,'' she said.

<P>
   MAAGAN MIKHAEL, Israel _ When Lamija Jaha and her husband were
driven out of their apartment and herded with thousands of ethnic
Albanians to trains that would take them from Pristina, the capital
of Kosovo, she took a memento of her dead father in her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging into exile on that first day of April, she had no idea
that the simple souvenir from her lost home _ a copy of a
certificate bearing her father's name _ would help pluck her family
from the Balkan flames and bring it to this kibbutz on the northern
Israeli coast.
</P>
<P>
   That piece of paper would take the Jaha family, in a way, full
circle. It was the copy of a certificate, issued by the Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, commending her parents, Dervis and
Servet Korkut, both Muslims, for risking their lives to save Jews
during World War II, and honoring them as ``righteous among the
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Mrs. Jaha's parents lived in Nazi-controlled
Sarajevo, where she was later born and her mother remains today.
Not only did the Korkuts hide several Jews from the local pro-Nazi
regime, but Dervis Korkut saved the precious Sarajevo Haggadah,
concealing it in his home and thus keeping the 14th-century volume,
the best-known illuminated Hebrew manuscript, intact.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Mrs. Jaha who was expelled from her Kosovo home and
herded onto a crowded train in scenes that have evoked comparisons
with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Macedonia, Mrs. Jaha showed her father's
commendation to the Jewish community in the capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   They helped Mrs. Jaha and her husband, Vllaznim, to join a
planeload of Kosovar Albanian refugees accepted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years after her parents sheltered Jews in their
home, she found shelter in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to express how much this means to me,'' Mrs.
Jaha, 44, said in an interview at a hostel in Maagan Mikhael, where
the 115 refugees are being housed. ``My father did what he did with
all his heart, not to get anything in return. Fifty years later, it
returns somehow. It's a kind of a circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaha's father was a museum curator and a prominent figure
in Sarajevo, an expert on the ethnic history of Bosnia-Herzegovina
who knew several languages and took a special interest in Jewish
contributions to the cultural mosaic of his country. In published
articles, he wrote about the culture and art of Bosnia's Jews,
defending them against anti-Semitic attacks and asserting that they
were an integral part of Bosnian society.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of Jews were rounded up and shipped off to
concentration camps, Korkut took the deadly risk of hiding several
in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mira Bakovic, a Jewish survivor who was traced by Yad Vashem,
recalled that the Korkuts put her up for half a year after she
sneaked back to Sarajevo following a stint as an anti-Nazi partisan
fighter. Taken in by Korkut, who knew her father, Mira was
presented to visitors as a housemaid with the Muslim name Amira.
She served guests, including German officers, veiled according to
Muslim custom.
</P>
<P>
   Mira Bakovic died last year at age 76, but her son, Davor
Bakovic, 50, who immigrated to Israel from Yugoslavia in 1970 and
lives near Jerusalem, greeted Mrs. Jaha when she and her husband
arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing discovery,'' Bakovic recalled. ``I felt as
if a sister had appeared from a faraway place. I felt close to
these people even though I didn't know them at all. The circle of
my life had become linked with Lamija and her family. To me it
proved that people can't be divided up into nations and sects.
They're human beings who can touch each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was also a revelation for Mrs. Jaha, whose parents
kept quiet about what they had done during the war. She said that
her father, who died when she was 14, never mentioned to her that
he had sheltered Jews, and that her mother told her briefly about
it only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father didn't do it so he could tell us about it later,''
Mrs. Jaha said. But in the end, ``anything my father did brought me
good.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Jahas, Israel is a new beginning after days of hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the crush at the Pristina train station, they climbed through
a window to get into a packed passenger car. Two bags in which they
had tucked mementos of their life _ family photos, a picture of
Korkut, his books, a daughter's diary _were lost in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Dumped on the Macedonian border in darkness, the Jahas marched
along the tracks into a teeming no man's land where they spent 11
hours before gaining entry with a small group of refugees at a
Macedonian checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful attempt to get permission to go to Sweden,
where her brother-in-law lives, Mrs. Jaha went to the offices of
the Jewish community in Skopje and showed the certificate awarded
to her parents. A few years ago, her mother had been evacuated from
Sarajevo in a convoy organized by Jews there during the Bosnian
war, and Mrs. Jaha hoped she might get similar help. The president
of the Jewish community in Skopje, Victor Mizrahi, promised help.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was willing to go to Israel on a refugee
flight organized by the Jewish Agency, an organization that usually
brings Jewish immigrants to Israel, Mrs. Jaha readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that it was no problem, and that we wanted to go
somewhere safe,'' she recalled, noting that she was unconcerned by
the occasional outbreaks of Arab-Israeli violence. ``The problems
here are nothing compared to the situation in Kosovo. You can find
terrorism all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jahas' two children, Fitore, 20, and Fatos, 16, were
smuggled out under false Serbian identity to Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
and later to Budapest, Hungary, before their parents' expulsion.
They were brought to Israel on a separate Jewish Agency flight that
carried Serbian Jewish youngsters who had fled the NATO air attacks
to Hungary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reunited in Maagan Mikhael, living in white stucco guest rooms
overlooking the kibbutz's fish ponds and the Mediterranean, the
Jahas feel ``like we're on vacation, not refugees,'' Jaha said. The
Jewish Agency has provided Hebrew classes and lectures for the
refugees, sightseeing trips, three meals a day and medical care.
There are also plans to start employing the newcomers at the
kibbutz and in neighboring industries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees, who have been accepted by Israel for six
months, say they would like to return to Kosovo, but the Jahas say
they have resolved to leave the Balkans and settle in Israel. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally assured Mrs. Jaha that her
family can stay, and in recognition of her parents' deeds, the
family is eligible for Israeli citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big thing for us, because we have no home, we have
nothing, and we've come to a country that won't turn us back,''
said Mrs. Jaha. ``We have left our house for good. We wanted to go
far away, where we and our children could live without war.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jaha, an economist, and her husband, an electrical
engineer, say they plan to find work and permanent housing after
learning Hebrew, and their daughter, a college student, is
determined to resume her computer studies at an Israeli university.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this for the children, not for us,'' Jaha said of
the decision to stay in Israel. ``We lived one life. Now we're
beginning another.''

REJECTED SUITORS SAY BELICHICK WILL SUCCEED PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It appears that the Jets' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick,
was much more popular in recent months than most people knew. As
teams began firing their head coaches during the off season,
Belichick's name was among the first they turned to on their
Rolodexes, as he quietly became one of the most pursued men in the
coaching derby.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fact that he is not leaving the Jets may speak volumes
about the future plans of Belichick and his boss, Coach Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Several National Football League team officials, speaking at
length for the first time about their pursuits of Belichick, said
they believed he could have had almost any open coaching job he
desired. But Belichick rebuffed all advances.
</P>
<P>
   Nine head coaches were hired after last season, and based on
interviews last week with officials of a majority of those teams,
Belichick was either the leading candidate or among the top three
candidates for almost every job. The only two teams not interested
were the Baltimore Ravens (the owner, Art Modell, had a rocky
relationship with Belichick when both were in Cleveland) and the
expansion Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Belichick's actions so revealing? Team officials say
that when they contacted Belichick or a representative, they were
told that Belichick was grateful for the interest but that the plan
was for Parcells to coach the Jets for one last season and then
Belichick would take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told pretty much point-blank'' that Belichick was going
to coach the Jets after this coming season, said one general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been speculation that Belichick would take over
as coach next season for Parcells, who is also the general manager.
But the words of these team officials, all of whom spoke on the
condition of anonymity, seem to take the idea beyond speculation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two league officials said Belichick received a $1
million bonus from the Jets this off season. Those officials
believe the bonus was given so that he would not leave the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick will actually take over the Jets depends on
Parcells, who can be both predictable and hard to figure out.
Parcells may be set to retire, but what would a tough loss in a
conference title game next season do to his thinking? Would it make
Parcells, a great competitor, want to come back for another try?
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is one of the most intriguing coaches in the game. In
Cleveland, where he amassed a 37-45 record, he was seen as a
brilliant tactician who lacked the people skills to deal with the
news media and other members of the Browns' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Belichick's reputation for having a great football mind has
grown, to the point where some executives believe he is among the
smartest coaches in the game. Concerns about his sometimes gruff
personality have apparently eased. Teams that checked out Belichick
were told that most Jets players loved to play for him; and NFL
officials know the stories of how Belichick will lock himself in a
room and break down film for hours.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick and the Jets were to part ways in the near future,
he would be the most attractive coaching candidate around, the way
Mike Holmgren was after he left the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick probably will not be going anywhere. One reason is
that Belichick would most likely be given the same amount of
control that the owner, Leon Hess, has given Parcells. That is an
attractive reason to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Belichick would inherit a franchise on the rise. While it
is true that the Jets sacrificed a chunk of their future, in draft
picks, to get Parcells from New England _ the Jets did not have a
first-round pick in this year's draft _ Parcells will leave the
Jets in great shape over all.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are definitely the team to watch next season. Parcells
has made a number of personnel moves geared toward making it to a
Super Bowl immediately, and the team's road to a championship got
easier with the retirement of Denver Broncos' quarterback John
Elway. It is hard to believe that Bubby Brister will be able to
approach the level of excellence Elway sustained for so long in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is definite: Belichick would rather plan a game
against Brister than Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a Shock Absorber
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Miller, who left the NFL nearly four years ago
because of multiple concussions, is now the third quarterback with
the Broncos behind Brister and the second-year player Brian Griese.
This time, though, Miller is taking extra precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, he will use a specially designed helmet that
absorbs shock better than the helmets he used when he played with
the Atlanta Falcons and St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is major concern about Miller's health, and the
Broncos plan to watch him closely.

FOR SOME, CLOSING THE DEAL CAN BE TOUGH GOING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the last three outs that determine if a manager will
whisper those three little words to his closer. Not that the relief
pitcher is looking for his manager's love, but he does want his
respect, as well as that of his teammates' and that of his team's
opponents. The best way to get all of that is to get the last three
outs. But it's easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that easy,'' Bruce Bochy, the San Diego Padres'
manager, said. ``By far it's the toughest three outs to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The past couple of weeks have demonstrated that more vividly
than most stretches of the season. Nearly everybody who is anybody
in the closing business failed in trying to save a game, including
Trevor Hoffman, who last season had Bochy cooing 53 times in 54
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you're shocked,'' Bochy said of Hoffman's
uncharacteristic failure against the Mets last Wednesday, ``but it
happens so quick there's no time to agonize.''
</P>
<P>
   Called on in the ninth inning to protect a 3-2 lead, Hoffman
gave up a leadoff single to John Olerud, and Mike Piazza crashed
the next pitch over the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to get that first guy,'' said Hoffman, generally
considered the best in his business. ``I just didn't make quality
pitches on either batter I faced. It showed. Two hits, two runs,
game over. There's no room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   With that performance, the 31-year-old right-hander matched his
blown save total of last season. This failure was worse, however,
because the Padres lost. Last season, when he squandered a 4-3 lead
over Houston on July26, he allowed the Astros only to tie the game.
The Padres won it in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Saves have their critics. There are those who feel a save is
given too generously and say that some managers help their closer
pad his save total by bringing him in with a three-run lead when a
save is highly likely. Bobby Thigpen had such assistance from Jeff
Torborg, the Chicago White Sox manager, when he established the
major league record with 57 saves in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy acknowledged that a closer falls into some easy save
opportunities and said, ``At times it can be a little misleading.''
But he added, ``He's going to have to get some tough ones, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his blown save, Hoffman said: ``A lot of people
don't put a whole lot of credence on saves. But it's not so much a
given. Games are important late. You never really know the
importance of those last three outs until you need them. Yet they
dictate how your club goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres won the first game of the series, and Hoffman
suggested that had he held the second-game lead, they might have
carried that momentum into the third game Thursday and won that as
well. Instead, they lost two of three.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, John Wetteland turned a 6-5 Texas lead into a 7-6
Yankee victory in the ninth inning. Two days earlier, Wetteland's
eminently capable successor with the Yankees, Mariano Rivera,
allowed Toronto to score the tying run in the ninth. The Yankees
won in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   That same day Mike Timlin, Baltimore's closer (with the Orioles,
that term might be an oxymoron), took a 10-8 lead over Oakland and
gave up a game-losing three-run home run to Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Closers are sometimes asked to maintain ties in the top of the
ninth, giving their teams a chance to win in the bottom half of the
inning. Last Sunday, as Rivera and Timlin lost leads, Roberto
Hernandez of Tampa Bay and Ugueth Urbina of Montreal were assigned
to maintain ties, and both failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez gave up two runs for a 6-4 Seattle victory;
Philadelphia scored four runs against Urbina and, after the Expos
rallied for two runs, won by 8-6. Ten days earlier, Rivera failed
to keep his team tied, allowing the Orioles two runs and a 9-7
victory, and just the other day Billy Wagner of Houston made a 5-5
score disappear by allowing Arizona to score five runs in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina had a shaky week. Six days before the tie game, he
relieved against Colorado in the ninth with a 10-8 lead and the
Rockies scored three runs and won, 11-10.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City
also encountered double-barreled trouble recently. Beck blew
ninth-inning leads on successive days against Milwaukee, the Cubs
losing the first game in nine and winning the second in the 10th.
The Royals lost to the Chicago White Sox and the Anaheim Angels
when each team scored three ninth-inning runs against Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special pitcher, a special mentality,'' Bochy said.
``You've got to be tough for two reasons. You have to get the outs,
and if you don't, you have to be ready to go the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   And with recent developments indicative of the life of a closer,
sometimes the next day doesn't turn out any better.

 UNDATED: any better.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rojas Brings Up the Rear
</P>
<P>
   If closers are not immune to rude treatment, neither are other
pitchers. Before last Thursday, only one American League pitcher,
Justin Thompson of Detroit, had been battered for seven runs in one
inning, the Yankees wreaking havoc on the young left-hander on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday another young pitcher, Roy Halladay of Toronto,
and Heathcliff Slocumb of Baltimore each gave up seven runs in one
inning, Halladay in the first inning, Slocumb in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The inning turned out to be Slocumb's last with the Orioles;
they released him the next day. As for Halladay, who in his first
20 innings this season had not permitted an earned run, Andy Sheets
of Anaheim hit a grand slam for the last four runs against him.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, Mel Rojas, the relief pitcher who did not like
pitching in New York, found that working for Detroit isn't so great
either. Returning to Seattle after being traded to the Tigers,
Rojas was rocked for the last five runs in the Mariners' 11-run,
fifth-inning eruption, then for six more runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. brought the scoring to a climax against Rojas in
the fifth, swatting a grand slam, then produced the sixth and final
run in the sixth with a solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 runs Rojas gave up recalled Chan Ho Park's feat for the
Los Angeles Dodgers April 23 against St. Louis. Park also gave up
11 runs _ but in one inning, the historic one in which Fernando
Tatis slugged two grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn Against Johnson
</P>
<P>
   If good pitching is supposed to beat good hitting, why does Tony
Gwynn have more hits against Greg Maddux (35), Tom Glavine (28) and
John Smoltz (28), Atlanta's throttlesome threesome, than against
any other active pitchers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because those guys are around the plate more than
anything,'' Gwynn said. ``I always give them the benefit of being
the guy in charge. I'm like a counterpuncher. I try to counter what
they do. They're all around the plate, so you know you don't have
that far to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is another story. Gwynn, a left-handed batter,
wishes the left-handed pitcher were fictional, but once this season
and once last he has seen the reality that is Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny Neagle is a guy I never saw the ball off of,'' Gwynn
said, discussing the pitchers who have been most difficult for him.
``He was always No.1, but I think he's getting bumped. Having faced
Randy Johnson twice, I have not sniffed the ball off of him yet.
He's punched me out four times in eight at-bats, not counting the
playoffs, which makes it like 6 in 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 36 hits from 3,000 (through April 30) seldom strikes out.
While Johnson struck him out twice last Sunday, Gwynn has struck
out only four other times in 85 (through April 30) times at bat
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only struck out three times in a game once,''
Gwynn said, recalling a game against the Dodgers' Bob Welch about a
dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Johnson, Gwynn said: ``The first two times up I
punched out and it was 0-2 the third time. It's hard not to panic.
It's hard not to say, `Well, I guess this is going to be the second
time.' But he ran a fastball in on my hands and I beat it into the
ground. I was like, `Yeah, I hit it, I put it in play.' That's the
first time in a long time I was satisfied just to put the bat on
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gwynn also felt that Johnson could have struck him out for
the third time if he had wanted to. All he had to do, the San Diego
star said, was throw a slider instead of a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous at-bat, Gwynn said, Johnson threw a slider, the
likes of which he had not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear it broke that much,'' he said, holding his hands a few
feet apart. ``When I started to swing, I thought I was on it and it
just kept on going, and I struck out again. When you face Randy
Johnson, everybody talks about his heater, but it's his slider
that's hard to hit. It's got tilt, that kind of an angle, and it's
got that much break.''
</P>
<P>
   Oldest Trick on Henderson
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson was able to laugh about it afterward in the
Mets' clubhouse, and that was just as well because it was humorous.
Donne Wall, a San Diego relief pitcher, picked him off first base
last Thursday, and he did it by first faking a throw to third,
where Rey Ordonez stood, then turning and throwing to first. It's a
move that rarely works, but it got the game's greatest base
stealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know he had that move,'' Henderson said. ``I usually
know he has it. I saw him motion and I just had my mind made up I
was going to go. The weakest play of all got me. In a way it
embarrassed me. The oldest trick, the weakest play in the world got
you.''

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Earlier this year, Rosemary Nelson,
a prominent civil rights lawyer, spoke at a ceremony honoring a
colleague whose killing in 1989 has long symbolized the danger of
practicing criminal law in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her portrait shares space with his on a memorial mural in a
Belfast housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson, 40, was killed March 15 by a bomb placed under her
car. The service she had led Feb. 12 marked the 10th anniversary of
the shooting death of Patrick Finucane at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases bear sinister similarities, chief among them the
charge by legal and human rights groups here and in the United
States that British security forces and the local police, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, made them targets for killers by accusing them
of sectarian sympathies, threatened them with death through their
clients and may have colluded with the Protestant paramilitary
groups responsible for the two killings.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the European Parliament and concerned U.S.
members of Congress have joined the legal and rights organizations
in calling for an independent investigation into the deaths. And
Britain has come under increased pressure to end the emergency
regime that governs law enforcement in Northern Ireland under which
suspects are denied the legal rights common to other Western
societies.
</P>
<P>
   As often occurs in sectarian killings in Northern Ireland, Mrs.
Nelson and Finucane (pronounced Fin-OOO-kin), were killed
deliberately in the apparent safety of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen burst in on the Finucane family during Sunday lunch and
fired 14 shots into his body as he sat at the dining room table
with his wife and three children. The magnet bomb that killed Mrs.
Nelson was placed under her sedan while it was parked in her
driveway, and the explosion that killed her occurred on her street,
50 yards from the school where a sister was teaching and the
youngest of her three children, Sarah, 8, was on a recess break.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the Belfast-based Committee for the Administration
of Justice and the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights that have investigated the Finucane case over the years
turned up evidence that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
told Protestant paramilitaries that he was a militant for the
Catholic cause, that police knew of the plot to kill him and did
nothing to stop it, and that one of the Protestant underground
group's most notorious killers was a British agent.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the 1989 killing, Home Secretary Douglas Hogg,
Britain's top law enforcement officer, had told the House of
Commons in London that some Belfast lawyers were ``unduly
sympathetic to the cause of the IRA,'' an inflammatory charge in
the combustible politics of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever been charged in the case. Britain has conducted
two confidential judicial investigations and says it is unwilling
to reopen the case without new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No lawyer in Northern Ireland can forget what happened to
Patrick Finucane nor dismiss it from their minds,'' Mrs. Nelson
told a Congressional subcommittee in Washington last September.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of
Judges and Lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, studied the consequences of
the Finucane killing last year and concluded that his death had had
a ``chilling effect'' on lawyers here. ``Solicitors informed the
Special Rapporteur that the murder led them either to give up
criminal practice entirely or to alter the manner in which they
handled terrorist-related cases,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report on the police in Northern Ireland, the
United Nations official said that the Royal Ulster Constabulary had
in general ``engaged in activities which constitute intimidation,
hindrance, harassment or improper interference.'' He expressed
particular concern that the police regularly ``identified
solicitors with their clients and their clients' causes as a result
of their discharging their functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson opened her practice in Lurgan, 18 miles southwest of
Belfast, only a month after Finucane's death. She did not set out
to represent people involved in the conflicted province's sectarian
clash, but she found them coming to her after being turned away by
other lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One case she took on was that of Robert Hamill, 25, a Catholic
man who was beaten to death by a mob of 30 men as he walked through
Portadown, a Protestant stronghold, in May 1997. She then
challenged the arrest of a man detained in the killing of two
policemen in Lurgan in June 1997, and succeeded in gaining his
freedom. She became most widely known for taking up the cause of
the residents of Garvaghy Road, a street intersecting Catholic
housing projects on the outskirts of Portadown that is the scene of
annual violent encounters over the insistence of the Protestant
Loyal Orange Order to conduct its traditional parade there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She began to get regular death threats in the mail and over the
phone, and clients told her repeatedly that police officers
interrogating them told them she was a paramilitary herself and
that she would be killed. They said police officers told them that
a disfigurement on the side of her face had come from an IRA bomb
she had been carrying. In fact, it came from an operation to remove
a birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, people suspected of ``terrorist'' activity
can be detained for up to seven days without charge and cannot have
access to their lawyers for the first 48 hours. Lawyers are barred
from that week's questioning. It was during such periods of
detention, Mrs. Nelson told various investigating bodies, that
officers made their menacing comments about her to her clients.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was roughed up and insulted by police officers
during the Garvaghy Road march of July 1997 when, as the lawyer
retained by the residents, she sought explanations from ranking
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Commission for Police Complaints took up her
reports of death threats and completed its report nine days after
her death. The panel is known for seldom finding fault with police
practices, but it listed 16 ``serious concerns'' about the Nelson
inquiry. These included statements that police officers were
hostile, evasive, disinterested and uncooperative, that one arrived
for a hearing late and inebriated, that others read from prepared
statements and that some police witnesses showed an ``ill-disguised
hostility to Mrs. Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the sensitivities of the Nelson killing, Sir Ronnie
Flanagan, Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
announced the day after her killing that the investigation would be
led by a constable from England and aided by the U.S. FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfast-based Rosemary Nelson Campaign, the international
rights groups that have been monitoring the treatment of lawyers
here and the U.S. congressmen are insisting on an investigation
that will be international, armed with subpoena power and
completely independent of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Even
though 14 of the investigating squad are not from the constabulary,
the 40 other members are, which may deter witnesses from coming
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland peace settlement of last April called for
an end to emergency powers in the province and created a Human
Rights Commission, a Criminal Justice System Review and an
Independent Commission on Policing, headed by Christopher Patten,
the last British governor of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson expressed fear over the continuing death threats but
felt that testifying openly before investigating panels here and
abroad would offer her protection.
</P>
<P>
   Her killing was ``not just an attack on the peace process,''
said Paul Mageean, legal officer of the Committee for the
Administration of Justice, where Mrs. Nelson was a board member.
``It was an attack on the whole notion that you can make change
through peaceful, legal means.''

LEGISLATOR'S HEAD SCARF UPSETS TURKISH TABOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When Turkey's newly elected Parliament
convenes for the first time Sunday, it may face its first crisis
even before members take their oaths of office.
</P>
<P>
   A newly elected deputy from the Islamic-oriented Virtue party,
Merve Kavakci, says she will insist on taking her oath while
wearing her head scarf. That would probably lead to a confrontation
with the political establishment, which is strongly secular.
</P>
<P>
   The head scarf has become an inflammatory symbol in Turkey.
Powerful military and civilian leaders consider it a sign of
religious militancy and anti-secular beliefs. Some women, however,
say their scarves are simply an expression of fidelity to Islam and
have no political implication.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish women are free to wear their head scarves in public, but
are not allowed to do so in courtrooms, at public universities or
at official gatherings. Ms. Merve will be the first woman to seek
to wear one in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has sent emissaries to leaders of
the Virtue party in an effort to head off a confrontation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want there to be any tension when Parliament opens,''
Ecevit said. ``She can cover her head as she wishes in her private
life and in her private work in Parliament, but when she is in the
parliamentary chamber or in committee rooms, we expect her to
conform to established rules and traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtue party leaders have said they are unable to overrule Ms.
Merve's decision. ``She gave the election authorities a picture of
herself in a head scarf, and they did not object,'' said one of
them, Abdullah Gul. ``It is up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Merve, 31, said wearing the scarf is her
democratic right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people who campaigned for democracy at their campaign
rallies were real democrats, they wouldn't be trying to block me,''
she said. ``Banning head scarves is a form of pressure. It shames
all political parties. If the deputies maintain their opposition to
head scarves, in the next election they will be buried at the
polls. I'm not going to take off my head scarf, and I'm not going
to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Merve is one of two women elected to the new Parliament who
wear head scarves. The other one, Nesrin Unal, a member of the
rightist Nationalist Movement party, has said she will remove hers
when in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to serve the people,'' Ms. Unal said. ``I don't
want a confrontation over the head scarf issue. That would create
tensions that would harm Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The central event Sunday was to have been President Suleyman
Demirel's decision about which political leader he would ask to
form Turkey's next government. But it is universally assumed that
he will give the job to Ecevit, and attention has been focused
instead on the prospect of a clash over Ms. Merve's head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   The first session of Parliament is traditionally presided over
by the oldest deputy, in this case 86-year-old Ali Reza Septioglu.
By coincidence, Septioglu was in the same position when Parliament
convened in 1991 and another female deputy, Leyla Zana, caused
pandemonium when she sought to take her oath in Kurdish instead of
Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   Septioglu ordered Ms. Zana removed from the chamber. She was
later arrested, tried and imprisoned on charges of supporting
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Septioglu has not said precisely what he will do
Sunday, he has asserted that he ``will apply what the law
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the head scarf reflects one of the fundamental
conflicts in modern Turkey. For years, Turkish leaders have warned
that allowing full political freedom here would plunge the country
into chaos by giving separatists and religious fundamentalists the
chance to spread subversive doctrines. But others say Turkey has
matured politically and is stable enough to survive the expression
of all points of view.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was unexpectedly brought to the top of the political
agenda earlier this week when the country's senior judge, Ahmet
Necdet Sezer, called for repeal of laws restricting freedom of
expression.

 &HT;    Columbine shootings harken back to Bath school bombing
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATH, Mich. _ On a faultlessly beautiful May morning in 1927 _ a
day so beautiful it seemed to embody all the hopes of spring _ a
failing farmer named Andrew Kehoe decided the time was just right
to murder every child he could in this small village just north of
the state capital of Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of dynamite explosions prepared in advance with
diabolical precision, Kehoe managed to kill 45 people, including
himself, and nearly destroy a school building with hundreds of
pounds of alarm clock-rigged dynamite he had secreted in the
school's sub-basement. Another 60 people were injured, some left
permanently disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a half-hour after the first explosion _ a detonation so
powerful that you could hear it 60 miles away in Mount Pleasant _ a
weirdly grinning Kehoe tooled up to the disaster scene in his newer
model Ford Model T pickup truck, beckoning Bath Consolidated School
Superintendent Emory Huyck to approach. Dozens of elementary school
students were already dead or dying nearby and rescue workers
feverishly tried to save those still trapped in the collapsed
school. Kehoe then executed his final act of wild, murderous rage,
detonating the truck packed with dynamite and shrapnel and killing
himself, the superintendant and two bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Before Oklahoma City, before Littleton, Colo., before the latest
wave of bizarre, terrorist-style schoolhouse killings shook the
foundations of an American cultural landscape awash in violence,
there was the horror of Bath, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Today the incident is so faintly remembered and obscured by time
that major U.S. newspapers including The New York Times erred when
initially describing the Littleton, Colo., high school massacre as
the deadliest school slaughter in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only a handful of elderly residents are alive to recall
Kehoe's bizarre wrath. All say there are no easy explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were an era without today's familiar suspects _
ultra-violent Hollywood revenge fantasies, blood-engorged computer
games, and firearm glorification.
</P>
<P>
   But there were ominous hints to Kehoe's madness, hints that made
Kehoe something other than just another brooding Midwestern farmer
squeezed by a fast-approaching Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The date was May 18, 1927, just days before lucky Lindbergh
conquered the Atlantic Ocean. Kehoe, local farmer, prickly school
board treasurer and meticulous handyman who always wore a clean
shirt, was about to make history. Until a fuel-fertilizer bomb in
1995 destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma
City and killed 168 people, Kehoe's actions would stand as the
worst single act of peacetime terrorism in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Critic turned terrorist
</P>
<P>
   Today Bath Twp., pop. 6,387, remains a rural hamlet little
changed in 72 years. Kehoe's once model farm is nothing but open
field and woods. In a quiet corner of the modern Bath School stands
a display case containing fragile memories of what is known as the
``Bath School Disaster.'' A few photographs, newspaper clippings, a
school child's autograph book, portraits of child victims. Just
across the street is a park where all that remains of the old
school is the preserved cupola with American flag flying, some
concrete benches, a memorial plaque and lingering memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history and you hope to learn from it,'' said Barb
Wilkins, 57, who helps her husband Gene run the museum. In light of
recent events, she reflects, ``it seems the wrong people are
learning too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Barb's mother, Lillian Reed, lost all her teeth in the
explosion. She was 13. ``It gives you chills from head to toe,''
Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Local histories for sale in Bath _ notably the 1980 book,
``Mayday. The History of a Village Holocaust'' by Grant Parker, and
``The Bath School Disaster'' by M.J. Ellsworth _ paint Andrew Kehoe
as a familiar enough Midwestern type: something of a loner, born to
a large, prosperous Tecumseh Irish-Catholic farm family, one of 11
children his father had with three wives.
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe showed an early fascination for mechanics and electricity,
taking courses at Michigan State College in East Lansing. For some
time, he worked as an electrician in the St. Louis area before
returning to Michigan. In 1912, he married Nellie Price, also from
a large Irish farm family.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, the couple purchased an 80-acre farm in Bath
from Nellie's uncle's estate for $12,000. But farm product prices
were plunging and to add to the plight, locals in 1921 approved a
property tax hike to fund consolidation of the area's one-room
school houses into a single handsome two-story school district
building for 314 students.
</P>
<P>
   The tax hike on Kehoe's smaller-size 80-acre parcel took its
toll. Kehoe made his last mortgage payment that year. He would
remain in default to the estate's executors, a fact unknown to
local neighbors who saw in Kehoe a community leader. Residents,
many still sore at the tax hike, elected the handsome, blue-eyed,
steel-haired man to the school board in 1924 to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Like a duck to water, Kehoe took to the job of board treasurer _
a role critics hoped would suit him and keep school spending in
line.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, Kehoe's technical skills made him an everyday
sight at the school. His frugality extended to voluntarily fixing
for free anything mechanical that went wrong. It gave him
unrestricted access to the school _ a fact that in hindsight sent
chills down the spines of survivors. Also in ominous hindsight,
Kehoe seemed more happy when tinkering than farming. He showed a
cruel streak, shooting a neighbor's fox terrier who barked
persistently.
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe became an energetic school board squabbler. He tried
unsuccessfully to eject the strong-minded Army veteran
superintendent and then tried to cut his vacation time. He
successfully cut annual payments to the janitor. Kehoe pointedly
eyeballed the school's bus driver when he daily passed by the Kehoe
farm on his appointed rounds, timing him with a pocket watch. The
busy treasurer seemed to take particular pride in personally
handing out checks on payday. Meanwhile, he seemed to lose interest
in his farm as the politics of the board and community seemed to
turn against him. In the spring of 1926, he lost a run for township
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Kehoe's wife's family began foreclosure
proceedings. By this time, Nellie Kehoe, plagued by ill health,
spent much of her time hospitalized. Kehoe began taking out-of-town
trips, buying hundreds of pounds of explosives. The 55-year-old
Kehoe eventually amassed perhaps 600 pounds of a World War I
concoction called Pyrotol.
</P>
<P>
   No one guessed how he planned to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Day of rage
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May, Kehoe had packed the sub-flooring and crawlspaces of
the school with enough explosives to kill everyone there. He set
the alarm clock detonator for 9:45 a.m. _ a time well after school
began. Willis Cressman, 87, recalls seeing the familiar fix-it man
at the school at the start of the day, taking note of the entering
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him that morning,'' Cressman recalled. ``He greeted us
and smiled at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe returned to his farm after stopping at the post office to
mail a package containing his meticulous accounting of school
finances, including a lengthy explanation of a 22-cent discrepancy.
By the time explosions rocked the school, it's believed Kehoe had
already murdered his wife. Back at the farm, Kehoe triggered
explosives he had packed into farm buildings. The farm exploded in
a tremendous roar. His wife's charred body was found the next day
amid the rubble. Kehoe had dumped her in a hog chute. Seeking to
have the final word, he attached a carefully stenciled wooden sign
to a farm fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals are made, not born,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Cushman, 83, was 11 when her school blew up. She didn't
hear the explosion. She only felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The papers went up on our desk and then everything went. I
blew high in the air....and came down more or less. My hair was
full of plaster.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls a scene of utter panic, with parents frantically
looking for their children. One little girl's body hung lifeless
from a coat hook on a door. ``Parents were crying and almost crazy
looking for their children,'' she said. ``We had no idea what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, perhaps because of a wiring glitch, 504 pounds of the
explosives planted at the school didn't detonate and were later
removed by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   When Kehoe drove up to the schoolyard for his grand finale, he
realized his plot had only gone so far and he'd succeeded in
destroying only a portion of the school that he hated.
</P>
<P>
   When Kehoe detonated his truck, startling the confused crowd
with yet another terrifying explosion, Willis Cressman, then 17,
was only 70 feet away. ``I knew it was time to get out of there,''
he recalled. He had hurt his feet badly jumping from the second
floor of the school after the explosion. He limped home but was
otherwise unharmed. Body parts were hanging in trees and nearby
cars were in flames, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Chester McGonigal, 87, was in the 10th-grade that year. ``We had
40 funerals in two days,'' he said. ``Saturday and Sunday, the
roads were packed. It was an awful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For locals here, the massacre at Columbine High School rekindled
memories of that spring day in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The town's pharmacist, Brian Stoddard, said sales of books about
the disaster have picked up sharply in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold about 25 in the past week,'' he said. ``It's not
forgotten.''

But He fails again this Sunday to brighten a preoccupying
somberness. America is at war with Serbia, which for the people of
St. Sava means their home is at war with their homeland. As they
have seen it portrayed by NATO, the U.S. and the media, the complex
and bloody history of the Balkan Peninsula, where Serbians defied
authoritarian rule in both World Wars to stand with America and its
Allies, has been simplified into the political equivalent of an
afterschool special. Good versus evil. Here, in one of America's
largest colonies of American Serbs, they want to tell the
complicated version of the fight over Kosovo and show how unfair it
was for NATO to choose sides in a decades old conflict burdened
with a record of atrocities by both. They are desperate advocates

   HAITI-TROOPS _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ In February, Gen. Charles

bring the hoped-for stability, he said, but they are in danger from
the very people they are supposed to be protecting. Yet the troops
remain. As President Clinton tries to rally support for a
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, it would be embarrassing for the
administration to accept the general's call for a pullout. We spend
a day with the 500 or so U.S. troops that quietly continue a
five-year U.S. occupation of Haiti. The impoverished nation still
resents the last U.S. incursion, a 19-year occupation that ended 65
years ago. Just last fall Haiti's Parliament passed a law to make
the presence of foreign troops illegal. In Washington, members of
Congress also are questioning the U.S. presence, which costs $22
million a year. They say the money is a waste since most of it goes

   SCHOOLS-WORSTEVER _ BATH, Mich. _ Before Oklahoma City, before
Littleton, Colorado, before the wave of bizarre, terrorist-style
school house bloodbaths shook the foundations of an American
cultural landscape awash in techno-violence, there was Bath,
Michigan. There, on May 18, 1927, just days before lucky Lindbergh
conquered the Atlantic, a man described variously as homicidal
farmer, angry school board treasurer and meticulous handyman,
detonated hundreds of pounds of explosives he had secreted in the
subflooring of the local school, blowing 45 people - mostly
elementary school children - into oblivion. The small town just
outside Lansing was never the same. Today the incident is so little
remembered that major U.S. newspapers including the New York Times
erred when describing Littleton as the mostly deadly school
incident in American history Simmering, lonely hate and targeting
children for mass murder are nothing new. The angry farmer did his
deed because he resented increased taxes for the school. (Bennish,

   N.C.-BANK-ROBBERS (Charlotte, N.C.) _ Even though bank robbery
has been declining nationwide, the crime has become remarkably
common here. The state's banks, credit unions and savings
institutions were robbed 289 times last year, a 38 percent jump
from 1997, one of the highest increases in the country, according
to the FBI. In bank robberies per capita last year, North Carolina

CANAL'S FINAL RETURN COLORS VOTE IN PANAMA

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The ``Trautenbels,'' a 484-foot cargo
ship, was ushered from the Pacific Ocean into the Panama Canal by
tugboats, and by two electric towing locomotives into a water lane.
Steel gates snapped shut, enclosing the ship in a chamber, inside
which it was lifted by rising water, a process repeated twice more
at different points for a voyage up to 85 feet above sea level,
across mountains now flooded by artificial lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal is a fascinating feat of engineering, a
U.S.-made 50-mile passage that carries more than 13,000 ships and
190 million tons of cargo a year between two oceans. At the end of
this year, the United States will permanently relinquish the canal
to Panama _ along with about $4 billion worth of property.
</P>
<P>
   The canal and the prospects for an economic boom based on the
property Panama will inherit are by far the most important issue
looming over Sunday's presidential election, a contest between the
son of Gen. Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the Panama Canal Treaty
with President Carter in the late 1970s, and the widow of a
president ousted by Gen. Torrijos. The winner, whose tenure is
constitutionally limited to one five-year term, will preside over
the Dec. 31 handover.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is so hallowed that the candidates, locked in a tight
race, agreed that it could not be the subject of electoral
mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Panamanians' fervent desire to use the handover to
help eradicate high unemployment and poverty rates and help this
country of 2.8 million people toward a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
   The next administration faces the challenge of disposing of the
valuable real estate the United States is leaving and replacing the
jobs and income earned from the U.S. bases, which has run to as
much as $350 million a year. It must also operate the canal, which
brings about $545 million a year in tolls, oversee its expansion
and prevent deforestation of the watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed the election to be a close match. In Panama's
clique-ridden politics, Martin Torrijos, 35, is trading heavily on
the memory of his father, who died in a 1981 plane crash. And his
opponent, Mireya Moscoso, 52, is the widow of Dr. Arnulfo Arias,
who was elected president three times and deposed by the military
each time, the last only days after taking office in 1968, in the
military coup that installed Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Although both have been active in the political scene in the
'90s, each has sparse experience in government. Their political
platforms have broad similarities. Both oppose privatization of
certain state-owned services and promise honest government in a
country with scant tradition of same.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos has served as deputy minister of government and Justice
in the administration of the current president, Ernesto Perez
Balladares, and is the candidate of the governing Democratic
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both Panamanians and Americans have fears that future
governments may divert canal money for their own benefit, and
Balladares did little to assuage them when he packed the Panama
Canal Authority, the agency that is supposed to govern the canal's
operations starting next year, with relatives and cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the governing party have also been allowed to rent,
with an option to buy below market value, some of the best of the
reverting properties.
</P>
<P>
   Public outrage over the actions was cited here among the factors
leading voters last September to reject a constitutional amendment
that would have allowed him to serve a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Panama Canal was completed in 1914, the bulk of its
revenue has usually been invested in maintenance and modernization.
While the handover of the 569-square mile U.S. canal zone has been
seamless so far _ 95 percent of its more than 7,000 employees are
Panamanian, working under a Panamanian administrator _ there is
great uncertainty about the fate of the valuable property that
comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 4,000 Americans, mostly Army and Air Force personnel,
remain of the 10,000 military personnel once stationed here. When
they leave at the end of the year, Panama will be left with the
task of somehow transforming the U.S. military's property into the
centerpiece of a longed-for bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to the plans, or dreams, then barracks,
hospitals, schools, airstrips, churches, houses, offices and
manicured lawns will become private housing, hotels, a university,
sports centers, and industrial parks at the center of an envisaged
export boom that will see ports teeming with new trade.
</P>
<P>
   Already, $1 billion has been invested by Panama and other
countries, from Spain to Taiwan, mostly in tourism and
maritime-related services, Panamanian officials say. The old School
of the Americas, for instance, where Latin American military
officers trained, is turning into a luxury hotel. Part of the
Albrook Air Force Station has been sold to American former canal
workers for a retirement community of 147 families.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the really valuable property _ nine military bases _
will only be transferred over the next eight months. The future of
that real estate hinges on the ability of Panama to attract more
investors, said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, administrator of
Interoceanic Region Authority, created in 1993 to manage the
property reverting to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property is going to be worth what we make it produce,''
Barletta said. Some properties that have already reverted are
fallow and deteriorating, even as others are being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the economic questions posed by the handover, some
Panamanians worry about losing the U.S. military, whose presence
has served as a deterrent against incursions by Colombian
guerrillas. Now, the border with Colombia will be guarded only by
police, for Panama has no army.

NATO SEES MOSCOW EASING ITS STANCE ON PEACEKEEPERS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Russia appears to be moving toward agreeing
to a U.N. Security Council resolution that would authorize an armed
international military force in Kosovo to allow refugees to return,
even if Yugoslavia continues to refuse one, NATO officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia continues to say publicly that it would veto any
Security Council resolution with a peacekeeping force that did not
have the consent of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, NATO
diplomats said there was movement behind the scenes in Moscow if
not yet in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the information I have is that they are prepared to accept
a force under those conditions,'' a senior NATO official said.
``They have said privately that they would participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the allies had not yet heard from Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian special envoy to the Balkans, since
Chernomyrdin's six hours of talks with Milosevic on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement timed to coincide with his meeting with the
Russian envoy, Milosevic said in an interview made public on Friday
that he might be willing to accept a U.N. contingent in Kosovo, but
he dismissed the idea of a ``force'' and rejected any notion of
NATO troops on Yugoslav soil. NATO rejected his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade shows concrete and constructive intentions which can
become a basis for further progress,'' Chernomyrdin said in Moscow
on Saturday, although he left Belgrade with no sign of a change in
the Yugoslav position. Chernomyrdin said Saturday that he would
talk with Vice President Al Gore about his talks in Belgrade and
would travel to France and London next week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's fresh hope of constructive Russian involvement in the
Kosovo crisis comes after the reopening last weekend of the special
diplomatic channel between Gore and Chernomyrdin, who had
established ties before Chernomyrdin was dismissed as Russia's
prime minister last spring.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, suggested reactivating
the channel in a telephone conversation with President Clinton last
weekend, Clinton decided to send Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott to Moscow, a NATO official said. Talbott briefed NATO
officials here Thursday on the results of his soundings.
</P>
<P>
   The view from NATO now, according to one senior official, is
that with all of Yugoslavia's neighbors now supporting allied
bombing to stop Milosevic's campaign of repression of the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, Russian support for a Security Council
resolution under chapter seven of the U.N. charter would be a clear
signal to Belgrade that it could not hold out any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter seven allows the international organization to send
peacekeeping forces into areas of conflict even when the combatants
do not consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment chapter seven is approved, the situation for
Milosevic is completely changed,'' the NATO secretary-general,
Javier Solana, said in an interview with The New York Times on
Saturday. ``Then there would be the beginning of a negotiation, and
the deployment of a peacekeeping force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an isolated country now,'' Solana said of Yugoslavia and
its leader. ``Serbia used to be a country surrounded by friends. If
the Russians go to the Security Council, that would lift the final
block. And everybody, including Russia, is absolutely convinced
that without troops on the ground, this problem has no solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana also said that he expected that NATO ambassadors would
soon approve a plan to allow allied warships in the Adriatic to
board and search oil tankers and other ships making oil deliveries
to Yugoslav ports, further depriving Yugoslav military and police
forces of the fuel they need to carry out their operations.
</P>
<P>
   But, Solana said, with a petroleum embargo on Yugoslavia by all
15 European Union countries in effect since Friday, and 90 percent
of the rest of the oil-producing world also declaring a halt to
deliveries there, the NATO ship inspections would be mostly
symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Only Russia among major oil-producing countries had so far not
agreed to stop oil supplies, Solana said. Most Russian oil to the
Balkans is delivered through a pipeline to Slovenia, and Slovenia
has agreed to the embargo. In Moscow, Chernomyrdin said Russia
would ignore any embargo not approved by the Security Council, but
officials there said they were unaware of many deliveries of
Russian oil to Yugoslavia by ship.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the economic pressures on Yugoslavia, Clinton on
Saturday toughened sanctions to bar most trade with its Serb
republic. Previous sanctions had barred the sale of arms and
restricted financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to oil, the new executive order would also prohibit
sales of all other goods except food and medicine. Sales to
Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro, whose government has leaned
toward NATO, would be exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the sanctions would ``diminish the Belgrade
regime's ability to continue its campaign of repression and
defiance, while allowing needed supplies to reach victims of its
reckless and brutal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   With clear weather over the Balkans, allied warplanes are flying
about 600 missions a day. Heavy bombing overnight destroyed nine
radio and television transmission towers across the country and
seven highway and railroad bridges, spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied aircraft also bombed tanks, armored personnel carriers,
command centers, fuel dumps, mortars and artillery, and military
airfields in Kosovo, according to Col. Konrad Freytag, a spokesman
for the allied military command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military radio relay network is essential to Milosevic's
ability to direct and control the repressive activities of his army
and special police forces in Kosovo,'' Peter Daniel, a NATO
spokesman, said. ``Every day, because of this, Milosevic is less
and less able to stay in touch with his forces and keep them
supplied.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Allied military spokesmen said Saturday that they as yet had no
information to offer on a report from Yugoslavia that 23 passengers
had been killed Saturday afternoon when NATO bombs hit a bus in
Kosovo, in the town of Luzane, 12 miles north of the capital,
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The command also said that rebel Kosovo Liberation Army forces
in Kosovo were putting up ``strong resistance'' to the Yugoslavs in
a corridor along a road near Suva Reka, north of Prizren in the
southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
   With the bombing now in its 39th day and every prospect that it
will continue, with more than 1,000 allied warplanes, right into
summer, the allies hope that Russian pressure on Yugoslavia will
finally get Milosevic to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has not yet said publicly that ground troops are
needed to solve the problem in Kosovo, although it had agreed to be
part of an international peacekeeping force led by NATO if
Milosevic had accepted the peace plan for Kosovo that was worked
out in Rambouillet, France, this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, NATO countries have said they hoped to get Russia to
use its influence on Belgrade to get Milosevic to agree to withdraw
his military and police forces from Kosovo, and let peacekeepers in
to allow more than a million Kosovo Albanian refugees to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is clear that while NATO continues to bomb, it expects
Russia to use leverage of its own on Belgrade by letting Milosevic
know that Russia, too, is ready to support the imposition of a
peacekeeping force in Kosovo to stop the continuing violence
against civilians there.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's expectation also reflects the fact that if increased
bombing and diplomacy cannot bring Milosevic to accept reason, the
alliance has no other option readily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not reasonable, we'd have to enter in force. For that
to happen, we'd have to damage the country much more than we have
done,'' a senior official said. Asked what would happen if
Milosevic decided to take his country down with him under the
bombing, like Adolf Hitler in World War II, the official said, ``I
cannot see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say there is no doubt in any allied country about
the need to keep bombing until Milosevic agrees to let the refugees
return to Kosovo. ``We have to reverse the ethnic cleansing,''
Solana said. ``The people who have been forced out need to return.
For that, you need a secure environment, and for that you need
international troops, and you need Serb forces to withdraw. This is
the objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the allies all still believed that bombing alone
could bring about that result, Solana said: ``We think at this
point, yes. You have to keep bombing until the brain of the whole
operation, which is Milosevic, is convinced that it is time to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the leaders of 19 NATO countries at the summit in
Washington, plus 40 countries in the European-Atlantic Partnership
Council, all agreed that this is the moment when the international
community should say this kind of behavior at the end of the 20th
century is unacceptable,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit was very important,'' Solana continued. ``I think
that Belgrade maybe expected that the coalition would not hold, but
the leaders are absolutely committed to the policy. We will
succeed, there's no doubt about that. This has to be the real end
of the old era.''

CLINTON SAYS RULE ON EMISSIONS WON'T IMPOSE UNDUE COSTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. Mich., Okla., Texas)   (rk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defending his new plans for cleaner air against
criticism from the oil industry, President Clinton said Saturday
that proposed regulations on gasoline and tailpipe emissions would
not impose excessive costs.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, the president said that the new
rules were designed to avoid creating hardships for businesses or
consumers. ``The proposal would achieve a dramatic reduction in air
pollution for the 21st century, and it would do so in the most
cost-effective and flexible ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil lobbyists and their congressional allies began criticizing
the proposals on Friday, as the administration began a series of
briefings. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's
lobbying arm, held a press conference on Friday afternoon to say
that the plan would unnecessarily raise gasoline prices in rural
areas with no air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., from the oil-producing state, said
in a statement that he had begun drafting legislation to devise a
more cost-effective approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate's clean air subcommittee,
faces a difficult task. The Clean Air Act of 1990 gives the
administration the legislative authority to act, meaning that the
new rules will take effect unless Congress can agree on a way to
change them.
</P>
<P>
   And the administration has an unlikely ally if a battle does
develop in Congress: the auto industry, which wants cleaner
gasoline to simplify the task of designing cleaner automobiles,
particularly sport utility vehicles, which emit up to three times
as much air pollution as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous administrations, the Clinton administration has
pursued an unusual strategy that seems to have weakened oil and
auto industry lobbyists by dividing them. After decades of
piecemeal regulation of the two industries, the administration is
proposing for the first time a single set of rules to cover both
fuel that goes into auto engines and the waste gases that come out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than fighting the administration for less stringent
emissions standards, the auto industry has allied itself with
environmentalists in demanding cleaner gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Cooper, the president of the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, based in Washington, said that the industry
generally supported the new rules because of the sulfur provisions,
even though the rules include a requirement that big sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks start meeting car pollution rules for
the first time by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry wants the administration's help in meeting
this tough requirement by forcing the oil industry to eliminate as
much sulfur as possible, Ms. Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry had proposed that only Eastern states and
California be subject to strict sulfur regulations, while Western
states with lesser air pollution problems be allowed less stringent
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies will have to spend several billion dollars to
install more sulfur-removing equipment at refineries, and some
refineries might switch to producing lubricants rather than go to
this expense, said William O'Keefe, the executive vice president of
the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's lobbying
group.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the oil companies, the administration will allow
two dozen small refineries an extra two to four years to comply
with the sulfur rules, Carol Browner, the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, told reporters on Friday. While
the American Petroleum Institute estimates the extra cost from
removing sulfur at six cents a gallon, Ms. Browner put it at one or
two cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the auto industry against the oil industry may have
longer-term benefits for the Clinton administration. The oil
industry is an implacable foe of the administration on many issues
and is largely based in Texas, where George W. Bush, the
front-runner among likely Republican candidates for the presidency
next year, is the governor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the auto industry in Michigan, while leery of
Vice President Al Gore's enthusiasm for the environment, is less
hostile to Democrats than the oil industry is and the United
Automobile Workers Union is a powerful force in Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are also likely to be popular with
environmentalists and public health advocates.  &QL;

FOR O'NEAL AND IVERSON, SCORING TITLE TAKES A BACK SEAT TO
PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson were recently asked what
it would mean to win the National Basketball Association's scoring
title, each responded in an unselfish, thoughtful manner, the kind
that makes coaches proud and footwear executives queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means nothing to me,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if winning the most valuable player award mattered,
he added: ``That doesn't mean anything to me, either. Just winning.
Right now, my team ain't winning, so nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said: ``If it happens, it happens. But I want to win
games. I want to get to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In six games over the next four days, the two young stars _ who
by virtue of their talent, force and flair have been enlisted to
carry the NBA into the post-Michael Jordan era _ can kill an
outdated perception they dubiously share. It is the one that says
O'Neal and Iverson are more about themselves than their teams. To
dispel it, all they have to do is occasionally pass and, most
important, win.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, O'Neal was averaging 26.3 points a game
for the Los Angeles Lakers; Iverson was averaging 26.2 points for
the Philadelphia 76ers. They were neck and neck, and it would be
natural for the game's most powerful big man and its most
breathtaking point guard to dominate the ball in their respective
teams' final three regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   As the final games on Wednesday approach, one can almost hear
the players' entourages egging them on.
</P>
<P>
   The league can only hope that the two players first listen to
their own words about putting winning ahead of self. O'Neal's
Lakers are battling the Houston Rockets for home-court advantage in
the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. In their final
three games, the Lakers travel to Seattle Sunday, play host to
Dallas on Monday and finish with Portland at the Great Western
Forum on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's 76ers could finish anywhere from fifth to eighth place
in the Eastern Conference, depending on how they do at Detroit
Sunday, at Charlotte on Tuesday and at home against Detroit on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their teams need those victories more than O'Neal and Iverson
need points to assure themselves of an individual honor.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of his nearly two-year hiatus, Jordan led the
league in scoring from the 1986-87 season through last year. O'Neal
has already won the scoring title once, averaging 29.3 points a
game at Orlando during the 1994-95 season when Jordan was playing
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, they have nothing to prove. O'Neal's only job
should be to dominate a game on defense and help his team resurrect
a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   Feuds with Coach Larry Brown aside, Iverson has been awesome. In
the MVP voting, he will most likely finish in the top five. He
almost made his first appearance on David Letterman's show last
Wednesday, only to be bumped at the last minute by Dustin Hoffman.
It would be understandable if Iverson's head were spinning. But he
should take time to reflect on these last three games of a
resilient season for the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if both teams shore up their playoff seedings and nothing
is at stake on Wednesday, then a bit of showtime is in order. And
for what it is worth, O'Neal probably has an edge based on the fact
that neither Seattle nor Dallas believes in defense.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial Call for Knicks
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Knicks expected any favors, but they were as
shocked as anyone Wednesday night when Referee George Toliver
whistled Allan Houston for a controversial dead-ball foul in the
final seconds of a game New York would go on to lose, 76-73, to the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is that call a rarity in the league, it is never seen
when a team is holding a 1-point lead in the final seconds of a
game. Toliver's call led to one free throw and helped prevent the
Knicks from tying the game when Latrell Sprewell hit a running
3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, team officials were irate for other reasons than
merely bad officiating. When Toliver was relieved of his duties as
an NBA official nearly two years ago _ another casualty of the
Internal Revenue Service's crackdown on league referees who
downgraded first-class tickets to coach fares and pocketed the cash
_ the Knicks helped him out financially.
</P>
<P>
   They called Toliver and asked him if he would like to referee
scrimmages during the team's post-season training camp in
Charleston, S.C. Toliver, confined to home detention as part of his
sentence, gladly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a lot, but we helped him out,'' said one team
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We didn't do it
with the idea he would repay us during the season if he ever got
his job back. That's ridiculous to even think that way. We just
thought he was a good guy and we needed an official.'' Chicago
Comes Up Empty
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1969, neither the Bulls nor the
Blackhawks are headed toward the post-season in Chicago. If Madison
Square Garden is likely to be dark and empty for most of May and
all of June, think about those poor souls who used to inhabit the
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks struggle to the make the playoffs and try to
provide their owners with some sort of dividends after the Rangers
faltered, Michael Jordan's old team mercifully ends its rebuilding
season on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after their first title, the 12-35 Bulls are about to
finish with the worst record in the Eastern Conference. And it is
not only the fans who are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes that Walt Disney World vacation for the family,''
said Tyrone Jackson, a United Center security guard who worked the
Jordan detail for seven years, including three seasons at the old
Chicago Stadium. ``We'll have to figure out something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bulls' championship run began, Jackson has been able
to take his wife, Lynn, and their three children _ Brittany, age
10, Donald, 8, and Tyrone Jr., 6 _ on annual vacations. Having made
$80 for each playoff game at the United Center _ roughly $2,000 in
extra income each post-season _ he misses Jordan, Scottie Pippen
and friends more than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad if he had stayed another year,'' Jackson said.
``At least we'd be working. The air stays clean around the
neighborhood. Everything just smells better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all in the Windy City are still mourning. Bill Gleason, the
76-year-old sportswriter for The Daily Southtown, said most
observers had been resigned to the Bulls' having a dreadful season.
A third-generation White Sox fan, Gleason added that many of
Chicago's teams had essentially prepared Bulls fans for the
letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing more than Chicagoans expected,'' Gleason said.
``We are accustomed to that kind of thing here. We don't get as
goofy about it as New Yorkers do.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAGERSTOWN, Md. _ Out here in western Maryland, more than an
hour's drive from any big city, diversions are where you find them.
For decades, area residents have enjoyed a fair share of them
watching minor league baseball in Municipal Stadium, a tidy little
ballpark of 4,600 seats on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the stadium is home to the Hagerstown Suns, a Class
A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Suns pass the summer
playing teams in the South Atlantic League with names like the
Greensboro Bats, the Hickory Crawdads and the Savannah Sand Gnats.
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, a baseball game is not enough to entice fans,
even with modest ticket prices of $7, $5 and $3. So, like
executives of minor league teams elsewhere, Winston Blenckstone,
the Suns' owner, counts heavily on promotions, like Little League
Home Run Derby Nights in June when the Suns play the Asheville
Tourists, and Seat Cushion Giveaway Night for an August game with
the Piedmont Boll Weevils.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular specials in recent years has been Church
Bulletin Day. Each Sunday that the Suns play at home, up to six
family members get in for a total of $6, provided they have a
bulletin from their church. It is the team's way, Blenckstone said,
of promoting family values, and typically 100 fans with bulletins
show up on those days.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the offer is under assault as religious discrimination,
an accusation that leaves Blenckstone scratching his head in
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minor league baseball is all about promotions,'' he said last
week, as a game with the Augusta Green Jackets was about to start.
``If you take away one kind, who's to say someone else won't object
to Little League Night or Senior Citizen Night or Scout Night?''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge came after Carl Silverman, 43, a professed
agnostic from nearby Waynesboro, Pa., who occasionally attends Suns
games, brought his two young daughters to a game last year on
Easter Sunday. Silverman asked for the discount afforded
churchgoers and was refused. He thought that was wrong, inasmuch as
the city of Hagerstown owns the stadium, and he took his case to
the Maryland Commission on Human Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission investigated and found ``probable cause'' that
the promotion violates state antidiscrimination laws. Silverman and
the team were given a hearing date, June 28, before an
administrative law judge to determine if the team is violating the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It irked me that if you bring a church bulletin, you are
treated better,'' Silverman said. ``You get a better deal.'' He is
asking only that the team discontinue the church-bulletin
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, who was born Jewish, describes himself as an agnostic
and free thinker who ``rejects all religion as being a brand of
mental illness.'' He also describes himself as a ``house dad,''
caring for his children while his wife, who was reared as a
Lutheran but does not practice the faith, works as a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the team is only the latest of Silverman's
efforts to separate matters of church and state. Several years ago,
he waged a successful battle with his local school district to keep
the Gideons from distributing Bibles throughout the public schools,
and he forced the state of Pennsylvania to remove crosses from two
state parks.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging the Suns, he has won the help of the American
Civil Liberties Union, which has agreed to represent him at the
hearing. ``Not many facts are in dispute,'' said Dwight Sullivan,
one of Silverman's lawyers. ``It all boils down to whether the
discount offering, which was made at a public facility, is a form
of religious discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   After operating minor league teams for 13 years with no
complaints, Blenckstone said he was astonished that a state agency
might judge him to be discriminating. The team, he said, used a
liberal interpretation of the promotion, accepting bulletins from
synagogues and mosques, as well as churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say church, we mean any house of worship,''
Blenckstone said. ``We're just trying to tie in the assets of the
community with family values. I don't think there's anything
unhealthy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman disagreed. ``They're claiming any house of worship,''
he said. ``That still discriminates against atheists, agnostics,
humanists, pagans and lots of others, even Christians who do not go
to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman insisted it was strictly a matter of principle. Asked
about a sign in front a restaurant near the stadium that offered
drink specials to women on ``Ladies Nite'' each Wednesday, he said:
``I'm not out to fight other people's battles. I'm interested in
what violates the law, the religious aspect, in particular. If
other people want to fight other battles, great. The Church
Bulletin Day is my battle.''

EX-KHMER ROUGE TORTURER, NOW A CHRISTIAN, COMPARES HIMSELF TO ST.
PAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Cambodians know him as the cruelest of the
Khmer Rouge torturers, the author of such directives as ``Use the
hot method, even if it kills him'' and, in the margin of a list of
17 children, ``Kill them all.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own mind, he is St. Paul, a persecutor who renounced his
past and became a Christian evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   Kang Kek Ieu, better known by his revolutionary nickname, Duch,
was the head of the Khmer Rouge secret police and the commandant of
Tuol Sleng prison, where at least 14,000 people were tortured and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power, he
converted to Christianity and devoted himself to spreading the
Gospel and to helping refugees who fled the brutality of his
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my biography is something like Paul's,'' he told Nate
Thayer, an American reporter who recounted his strange story in an
article last week in the Far Eastern Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sorry about the killings and the past,'' said Duch
(pronounced Dook), who is now 56 and had been living quietly and
anonymously in western Cambodia. ``I wanted to be a good communist.
Now in the second half of my life, I want to serve God by doing
God's work to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sought to make it clear that he had not tortured and
killed for the fun of it. Indeed, he portrayed himself as a harried
bureaucrat, constantly concerned about the quality of his product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not get any pleasure about my work,'' he assured Thayer,
speaking in broken English and in French. ``All the confessions of
my prisoners _ I worried, is that true or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as extraordinary as his personal story is the fact that,
for the past two years, Cambodian authorities have known where he
is, according to Thayer, and have made no move to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Cambodian Justice official said Thursday that even now
that Duch's whereabouts have been revealed there were still no
plans to put him in custody, as a defendant or a witness against
other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plan to summon him to Phnom Penh as a witness in Ta
Mok's case,'' said Ngin Sam An, the investigating judge in the case
of the only Khmer Rouge official to have been arrested, the
commander Ta Mok. ``There are also no plans yet to charge him
separately with crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk Chhang, a researcher who has prepared evidence against
Khmer Rouge leaders at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, called
Duch a ``very essential'' witness against the people who are
responsible for the deaths of more than a million people when they
held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the key to the conviction of Khmer Rouge leaders. His
testimony can show that they were aware of what was happening,''
Youk Chhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen has resisted international demands that
other Khmer Rouge leaders be arrested, saying he fears this could
cause a violent reaction among their followers, who now live in
semiautonomous areas in the north and west of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea are prominent among these leaders.
The two men surrendered last December and were given a guided tour
of the country before returning to the security of the remote Khmer
Rouge-controlled town of Pailin.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Duch implicated both men, as well as Ta Mok,
as leaders who ordered the torture and killings he carried out at
the prison known as S-21. ``The first was Pol Pot,'' he said,
naming the Khmer Rouge leader who died a year ago. ``The second was
Nuon Chea, the third Ta Mok.'' He added: ``Khieu Samphan knew of
the killings, but less than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The overriding rule at Tuol Sleng, Thayer quoted Duch, was a
simple one: ``Whoever was arrested must die.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge from power in
1979, Duch fled with other Khmer Rouge leaders into the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   According to his own account he left the movement in 1992 and
became a teacher. Then, under assumed names, he worked until a few
months ago with United Nations and private relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that time that he converted to Christianity, he said.
``After my experience in life I decided I must give my spirit to
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duch, whose thin face, large teeth and prominent ears made him
one of the more recognizable faces in photographs of the Khmer
Rouge, said he was fully prepared to face trial. ``I have done very
bad things in my life,'' he said, the first Khmer Rouge leader to
make that admission. ``Now it is time to bear the consequences of
my actions.''

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Asked to write his name, Johnathan Rodriguez, a
lanky first- grader at the Orlo Vista Elementary School here, bent
over his desk and seized his pen with the intensity of a surgeon
about to use a scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   He had no trouble with the Johnathan, but when it came to
writing Rodriguez, he got stuck after the o. Teresa Sanders, his
teacher, completed the word for him.
</P>
<P>
   This lesson would normally have little meaning for anyone other
than Johnathan. But in Orlo Vista, the ability of Johnathan and his
schoolmates to write and read could seal the fate of this and other
public schools across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Orlo Vista is one of four schools that the Florida Department of
Education has listed a being critically low performing. Last year,
less than the required 33 percent of its students scored higher
than average in nationally standardized reading and mathematics
exams, and less than a third got a passing grade in a writing
program. If this year's test results, which are expected in the
summer, show that students have again failed to meet state
standards, the Education Department could mark Orlo Vista itself
with an ``F.''
</P>
<P>
   The grade is far from symbolic. Under a plan known as the A plus
education package, approved by the Legislature, Florida will offer
students from public schools that fail to meet its standards two
years in a row a chance to study in a private or public school of
their choice. Students opting to change schools will receive
vouchers worth about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will also allow the state to effect sweeping changes in
a school that fails just one year. State education officials will
have the authority to change the curriculum, dismiss or retrain the
principal and staff, and provide financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Precise guidelines of the A plus education package, which has
been a top priority for Gov. Jeb Bush since taking office last
January, have yet to be drawn up by the state Education Department.
Yet the plan has drawn criticism from public school officials here
who fear that they might lose their best students, and the money
that follows them, to private schools that are not held accountable
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between a main street and a side street, Orlo Vista
Elementary is set in a low-income neighborhood of small bungalows
and spottily paved roads. Patricia Ramsey, the school's principal,
estimated that 90 percent of the students come from families whose
incomes are below the poverty level. To measure the ability of such
a student body through standardized testing, she said, is to ignore
the gaping holes that their disadvantaged background has ripped in
their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the same raw material coming in the door of
every school, it's not like a manufacturing company and at the end
of the process we can do quality control and say, `This passes'''
Ms. Ramsey said. ``Looking at where a child comes in the front door
and how far a school takes them, how much they grow _ that's what I
want to be held accountable for.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, by many measures, Ms. Ramsey and her staff have had
to struggle. Originally built to have 400 students, Orlo Vista now
has 700. To accommodate the extra children, trainer-style
structures have been erected as makeshift classrooms in the
school's small grounds, depriving Orlo Vista of its playground.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is served at the school for the students that do not
get any at home. And language and mathematics difficulties aside,
even kindergarten can prove a challenge for children who, teachers
say, fail to receive even the most basic instruction at home. ``A
lot of times we have children here that do not know colors,'' Ms.
Sanders said. ``A lot cannot label parts of their bodies, they
don't know zoo animals.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, keeping track of the students progress has been
difficult, for Orlo Vista has a turnover rate amongst the student
body of 50 percent every year, compared with an average of 31
percent for the state at large.
</P>
<P>
   So how to gauge the progress of the students, particularly when
only the fourth grade at Orlo Vista took the tests that put the
school on the state's critically low performing list?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramsey laughed bitterly. ``It's like testing water,'' she
said.

WALTER J. CUMMINGS, APPELLATE JUDGE SINCE 1966, DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Conn., Fla., Mass., Wash.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Walter J. Cummings, who at 36 became the youngest
solicitor general of the United States and went on to be one of the
longest-serving federal appellate court judges in the nation's
history, died on April 24 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in
Chicago. He was 82 and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1966, Cummings was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson
to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago,
and served until his death. In his nearly 33 years on the bench,
Cummings wrote more than 2,700 opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the judge's more notable opinions was one in 1972
reversing an action by Judge Julius J. Hoffman of U.S. District
Court in the ``Chicago Seven'' case. Hoffman had cited some of the
defendants in the case for contempt of court in the tumultuous
trial that came to symbolize the domestic disruptions that erupted
in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, all the defendants were found not guilty of charges of
conspiring to incite a riot two years earlier, during the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago. But five of them were
found guilty on a lesser charge of crossing state lines with the
intent of inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's courtroom became a raucous setting in which the
defendants and their lawyers were repeatedly excoriated from the
bench while the defendants, among them Abbie Hoffman, David
Dellinger and Jerry Rubin, sneeringly referred to Hoffman as ``
Magoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered another defendant, Bobby G. Seale, a leader of
the Black Panthers, to be bound and gagged after Seale called him a
``pig'' and a ``racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the trial, Cummings found that Hoffman's conduct was
``deprecatory and often antagonistic'' toward the defense, and
ordered a new trial before a different judge.
</P>
<P>
   Although some counts of contempt were eventually upheld against
the defendants, no fines or sentences were ever imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Cummings also participated in important decisions
requiring steel companies to stop polluting Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In writing judicial opinions, the judge was concerned about
matters of tone and style. Dissenting from the majority opinion in
a 1993 case holding that the Boy Scouts of America may exclude
applicants who refuse to swear that they will carry out their
``duty to God,'' Cummings declared that although the majority might
have reached ``the correct result,'' it had done so ``in a most
unfortunate fashion by imparting a stingy and narrow reading'' to
the applicable statute.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Joseph Cummings was born in Chicago on Sept. 29, 1916, to
wealth and social position. His father, Walter J. Cummings Sr., was
a railroad-car manufacturer, the first head of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and chairman of the Continental Illinois National
Bank &AMP; Trust Co., now part of BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Cummings attended the St. Albans School in
Washington and the Chicago Latin School, and received his
bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1937 and his law degree
from Harvard University in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by the armed services in World War II because of poor
eyesight, he became an assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General in
1940, and later was a special assistant to the Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he practiced law in Chicago until 1952, when he
was chosen by President Harry S. Truman to be solicitor general,
making him the youngest to hold that post. In 1953, after Truman
left office, Cummings returned to private practice in Chicago; the
next year, he was named to the appellate court. He served as chief
judge of the Seventh Circuit from 1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he married Therese Murray, who died in 1968. Cummings
is survived by three sons, Walter J. Cummings III of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., Keith Murray Cummings of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Mark
Farrell Cummings of Chicago; a brother, Edward, of Washington, and
two grandchildren.

MICHI WEGLYN, 72, WRITER ON INTERNMENT CAMPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michi N. Weglyn, author of an acclaimed book about
the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during
World War II, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side
of Manhattan. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   She had cancer, said Si Spiegel, the executor of her estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weglyn's book, ``Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of
America's Concentration Camps'' (University of Washington Press,
1976), was praised by an American ambassador to Japan, Mike
Mansfield. He called it ``a conscience-wrenching book of major
significance,'' and said that ``every American concerned with human
liberty should know of this bleak period of our national history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weglyn herself was interned in one of the camps as a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Freidel, a professor of American history at Harvard
University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that
Japanese-Americans in the western United States, numbering over
100,000, ``became the scapegoats for the attack on Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Years of Infamy' gives an appalling view of the privation,
neglect and even brutality that the bewildered Japanese-Americans
underwent in the camps,'' he wrote. Ms. Weglyn's account, he said,
``based largely on government documents, is decidedly grimmer than
most earlier books on this disgraceful subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years Ms. Weglyn worked in behalf of former internees
who had not received compensation from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weglyn was born in Stockton, Calif., to Tomojiro Nishiura,
who was a farmer, and the former Misao Yuasa.
</P>
<P>
   She attended Mount Holyoke College in 1944 and 1945 and Barnard
College in 1947 and 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 60s, under the name Michi, Ms. Weglyn was a
designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Walter Weglyn, died in 1995. Surviving are a
sister, Tomi Fujita, and a nephew, Walter Fujita, both of Los
Angeles.

HEINZ L. FRAENKEL-CONRAT, CHEMIST WHO DISSECTED VIRUS, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Germany, Scotland)   By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Heinz L. Fraenkel-Conrat, whose research in biochemistry
allowed scientists to peer into the innermost workings of viruses,
died on April 10 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland,
Calif. He was 88 and lived in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fraenkel-Conrat, a professor emeritus at the University of
California at Berkeley, made scientific history in the mid-1950s,
when he dismantled a tobacco mosaic virus and then put it back
together again, still living.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment garnered Dr. Fraenkel-Conrat, who disdained
publicity, considerable attention along the lines of ``life created
in a test tube,'' recounted in the 1959 book ``Virus Hunters,'' by
Greer Williams. But for scientists, the value of Dr.
Fraenkel-Conrat's work lay in its proof that the genetic
information controlling viral reproduction was contained in the RNA
at the core of each piece of a virus.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an entirely happy discovery for Fraenkel-Conrat,
who had sided with those scientists who believed that the tobacco
virus' infectivity was contained it its protein coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a protein chemist,'' he told Williams when he was being
interviewed for the book. ``I hoped protein was the determining
factor. It was against my personal inclinations to have a greater
interest in nucleic acid.''
</P>
<P>
   While other scientists before Fraenkel-Conrat had taken viruses
apart in an effort to understand how they worked, he was the first
to put one back together _ in effect, making the world's first
synthetic virus. His goal was to determine which part of the virus
infected tobacco plants.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, according to ``Virus Hunters,'' required some
exacting work. The scientist used a common household detergent to
strip away the hides of one set of viruses, and a different
solution to remove the cores of another set. Then he took the virus
parts up to the greenhouse on the top of his laboratory and,
keeping them separate, rubbed them on the leaves of tobacco plants.
</P>
<P>
   None of the plants were infected.
</P>
<P>
   When Fraenkel-Conrat mixed the two solutions together, however,
he found that the virus re-formed. When he placed the newly whole
virus on tobacco plants, they became infected. (Later, he found
that, if handled correctly, the delicate RNA alone was sufficient
to infect the plants.)
</P>
<P>
   Fraenkel-Conrat worked often during this period with his wife,
Dr. Beatrice B. Singer, who survives him. Dr. Singer is a
biochemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat was born in Breslau, Germany, and received
his medical degree from the University of Breslau in 1933. He
earned a doctorate in biochemistry at the University of Edinburgh
in 1936. That same year he moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1952, and won numerous awards,
including an Albert Lasker Award for Basic Research in 1958, which
he shared with Dr. Alfred D. Hershey and Dr. Gerhard Schramm for
their work with nucleic acid. Fraenkel-Conrat also received two
Guggenheim fellowships.

WILLIAM BROWN, 89, ARCHITECT WHO OVERSAW BUILDING OF LEVER HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Tenn., Mass., Ohio., N.H., Calif.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Brown, an architectural administrator who supervised the
creation of 20th-century landmarks like Lever House on Park Avenue
in Manhattan and the city of Oak Ridge, Tenn., died on April 4 at
his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, the architecture and
engineering firm, Brown drew inspiration from masters like Mies van
der Rohe and Le Corbusier and collaborated with leading architects.
</P>
<P>
   As an administrative partner, he coordinated the enormous detail
that went into carrying out modern architectural projects like
Lever House.
</P>
<P>
   Lever House, which was completed in 1952 in collaboration with
one of the firm's design partners, Gordon Bunshaft, is credited
with significantly changing the direction of corporate architecture
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from drawing upon modernist esthetic principles, the
building incorporates advanced structural concepts, including a
sealed design that depends on mechanically driven climate controls,
novel materials for the interior and exterior, and automated window
washing.
</P>
<P>
   While at Skidmore, Owings during World War II, Brown supervised
the design and construction of Oak Ridge, conceived as an instant
city of 80,000 required to build the first atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The project represented a significant change in the Skidmore,
Owings' scale of operation from a small architectural practice to
one capable of providing citywide architectural, engineering and
planning services.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrace Plaza Hotel in Cincinnati, completed in 1948, was
another step forward for the firm, and again Brown played a crucial
role. The firm handled everything from exterior and interior design
to the commissioning of artists like Joan Miro, Alexander Calder
and Saul Steinberg for special projects.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington Courthouse, Ohio, Brown graduated from Ohio
State University and earned a master's degree in architecture from
Columbia University in 1935. He joined Skidmore, Owings in 1939,
became a partner in 1949 and retired in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is survived by two sons, Peter, of Santa Barbara, Calif.,
and David, of Sharon, N.H., and four grandchildren.  &QL;

TRIAL TO BRING BACK MANY PLAYERS IN CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ In a federal courtroom here Monday, Kenneth
Starr's prosecutors will begin the trial of the first and only
person to be charged with a crime related to the sprawling sex and
perjury investigation that led to President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr's prosecutors took sworn testimony from at least
111 people, including Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, the
defendant in this case is a little-known Richmond woman named Julie
Hiatt Steele, whose role in the matter is so peripheral that her
name does not appear in the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being an odd epilogue, Ms. Steele's trial offers another
chance for many of the scandal's main players to be heard yet
again. The witness list includes Ms. Lewinsky; Mrs. Tripp; Kathleen
Willey, the former White House volunteer who accused the president
of making an unwanted sexual advance, and Michael Isikoff, the
Newsweek reporter who wrote the first comprehensive story about the
Lewinsky investigation. On Friday, the judge presiding over the
case refused to quash subpoenas seeking Isikoff's notes and
testimony and unpublished material from Ms. Willey's March 1998
interview with the CBS News program ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele is charged with lying in an affidavit and statements
to investigators about her knowledge of whether the president had
made an unwanted sexual advance to Ms. Willey. She had described
this knowledge to Isikoff and later denied it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in April, Ms. Steele, 52, said that Starr's
prosecutors were vindictively trying to punish her for refusing to
verify Ms. Willey's account and ``help them prove'' that the
president had groped Ms. Willey just outside the Oval Office in
November 1993. If convicted, Ms. Steele, who is divorced and has an
8-year-old adopted son from Romania, faces a maximum of 35 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is about either one of us,'' Ms. Steele
said in an interview Friday. ``It's about Ken Starr overreaching
and doing everything he can to get the president. I got in the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Steele's defense team, led by a Washington lawyer,
Nancy Luque, will try to portray Starr as an overzealous prosecutor
who singled out Ms. Steele after she criticized Starr's motives in
televised interviews. Ms. Luque said that Starr's prosecutors tried
to threaten the legality of Ms. Steele's adoption of her son, Adam,
and that prosecutors asked Ms. Steele's adult son, her brother and
others about the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy to put Starr and his motives on trial was used with
success by Susan McDougal's defense lawyers in her recent trial in
Little Rock, Ark. Ms. McDougal was acquitted of obstructing justice
in April. Prosecutors charged Ms. McDougal after she refused to
cooperate with Starr's grand jury investigating the Arkansas
financial dealings of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele testified at Ms. McDougal's trial about her view of
Starr's tactics, and her story apparently helped persuade some
jurors that Starr was determined to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that the judge presiding over Ms.
Steele's trial will allow defense lawyers to attack Starr. Judge
Claude Hilton of U.S. District Court in Alexandria has told the
lawyers that he will not allow the trial to veer away from the
facts that are central to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion to dismiss, Ms. Steele's lawyers accused Starr's
office of seeking an indictment ``based solely upon a credibility
test between Ms. Steele and Kathleen Willey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did so fully aware of Ms. Willey's record of lies and
misrepresentations in connection with the Jones vs. Clinton case,''
the motion contended.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele said: ``I'm being prosecuted for calling a liar a
liar and Ken Starr knows it and he has covered it up every step of
the way. It is despicable. It is a great injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that blunt outspokenness that infuriated Starr's
prosecutors late last year, Ms. Luque said in court papers. Defense
lawyers intend to introduce letters that show that Starr's
prosecutors had considered Ms. Steele a witness, not a target, of
their inquiry last summer, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   David Barger, a prosecutor in Starr's office who will try the
case, did not return telephone calls in late April. A spokesman for
Starr, Edward Page, said that the local rules prohibited him from
commenting on any aspect of the case. In his congressional
testimony in November, Starr angrily denied that his prosecutors
did anything inappropriate in their investigation of Ms. Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's refusal to back up Ms. Willey's account of an
encounter with the president was apparently a big factor in Starr's
decision not to include information about Ms. Willey in his
impeachment report to the House of Representatives in September.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele initially told Isikoff, the Newsweek reporter, that
Ms. Willey told her of the alleged sexual advance just after she
said it happened. But Ms. Steele later disavowed that account and
gave an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit
denying that Ms. Willey had ever told her of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Ms. Willey's encounter with the president, Ms.
Steele said that she had spoken with Ms. Willey about the incident,
but that Ms. Willey ``never said anything to suggest that Clinton
made sexual advances toward her or otherwise acted inappropriately
in her presence,'' according to an affidavit she signed on Feb. 13,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele later said that she had claimed knowledge of the
incident only as a favor to Ms. Willey, who she said had asked her
to lie to Isikoff to corroborate her account. Since then, she has
repeatedly refused under oath to confirm Ms. Willey's account.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied that he ever made a sexual advance to Ms.
Willey, both in his grand jury testimony and in his deposition in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It appears from some of the documents in the court file that
Starr's prosecutors may try to prove that Ms. Willey was groped by
the president inside the White House. They have entered into
evidence the videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony, as well
as a transcript of his testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Gecker, the Richmond lawyer who represents Ms. Willey,
did not return phone calls in late April. Several weeks ago, he
said that Ms. Willey would have no comment before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial could hinge on jurors' judgment of the credibility of
the two former friends from Richmond, Ms. Willey and Ms. Steele,
whose friendship began, just as it ended, with threats and hurt
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1978, Ms. Steele and her husband moved to Richmond
and entered into a contract to buy Ms. Willey's four-bedroom
Colonial-style house for $117,000. But 12 days before Christmas,
the Willeys broke the contract and Ms. Steele sued for breach of
contract. The lawsuit was dropped after Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey
became friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only person I knew in Richmond,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have ammunition that could raise doubts about the
other's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Ms. Willey, who is steeped in debt, tried to sell
her story of her encounter with the president to a book publisher,
and to The Star, the supermarket tabloid. She also wrote a series
of flattering letters to Clinton after the alleged groping
incident, but she has said that she maintained communication with
the president because she wanted a job in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele says she told a lie to Isikoff on Ms. Willey's
behalf, and she has conceded that it was a mistake to sell a
photograph of Ms. Willey and Clinton to The National Enquirer for
$7,000. Prosecutors suspect that she no longer supports Ms.
Willey's account because she is trying to help the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But she called that laughable, saying that she never voted for
Clinton and that she comes from a family of Republicans. ``My
mother had volunteered for Nixon's campaign in Kentucky,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although their friendship has ended, Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey
have crossed paths several times around Richmond. In September
1997, Ms. Steele said, Ms. Willey confronted her at the Ukrops
supermarket and ``started yelling and screaming at me.'' It was
shortly after Ms. Steele had sold the photograph to the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Steele says, she wishes their friendship had ended long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that every single time she did a terrible thing to
me, I forgave her,'' she said. ``I confused forgiving and
forgetting. I was right to forgive, but I was wrong to forget.''

GIAN-CARLO ROTA, 66, PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND PHILOSOPHY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Conn., Mass.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gian-Carlo Rota, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology whose work bridged the upper realms of mathematics and
philosophy, died on April 19 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was
66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, MIT officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rota dealt with abstract matters like probability, phenomenology
and combinatorial theory, or combinatorics. His interest in
philosophy centered on the existential thoughts of two 19th- and
20th-century German philosophers, Edmund Husserl and Martin
Heidegger.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, Rota was the only professor of applied mathematics and
philosophy, a dual position to which he was appointed in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Combinatorics in higher mathematics is the study of permutations
and combinations of elements in finite sets. In an interview with
MIT News last year, he gave this definition of his field of study:
</P>
<P>
   ``Combinatorics is putting different-colored marbles in
different-colored boxes, seeing how many ways you can divide them.
I could rephrase it in Wall Street terms, but it's really just
about marbles and boxes, putting things in sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rota added that some of his best students went to Wall Street.
``It turns out that the best financial analysts are either
mathematicians or theoretical physicists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rota wrote several books and contributed to many more. His
latest, ``Indiscrete Thoughts'' (Birkhauser, 1997), was a
collection of essays that limned the lives of notable
mathematicians. His purpose was to debunk ``the myth of monolithic
personality'' in his profession, although not all of his subjects
were pleased with their portraits.
</P>
<P>
   He was co-author of ``Discrete Thoughts'' (Birkhauser, 1986) as
well as books on combinatorial geometrics, computer science and
ordinary differential equations.
</P>
<P>
   Gian-Carlo Rota was born in Vigevano, a town in northern Italy
about 20 miles southwest of Milan. He came to the United States in
1950 and graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in
1953. He received an masters degree in 1954 and a doctorate in
mathematics in 1956 from Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at New York University, Harvard University, MIT and
Rockefeller University before rejoining MIT in 1962 as a full
professor of mathematics. He was a fellow of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences and of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Rota's survivors include his sister, Ester Rota Gasperoni of
Paris. His marriage to Teresa Rondon-Tarchetti ended in divorce.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving storm will gradually move away from the Southeast
coast, but clouds and some showers will linger near the shoreline
from North Carolina to Georgia. Gusty winds from the northeast
combined with overcast skies will keep temperatures far below the
seasonal average. Clouds will dissipate during the day over the
interior Carolinas and Georgia as drier air arrives on northerly
breezes. Farther west, the interior Southeast will have abundant
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will promote another day of plentiful
sunshine from the northern Mississippi Valley to the Northeastern
states. Breezes from the south will boost afternoon temperatures
far above seasonal levels from the Great Lakes to the eastern
Dakotas. Most of the Northeast will be mild, but midday and
afternoon sea breezes will keep coastal areas cool.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will be common from central Texas to
the western Plains and central Rockies. A jet stream disturbance
moving northeast from the Texas panhandle will enhance the risk of
strong thunderstorms from western Nebraska to the Red River Valley
in Texas and Oklahoma. High wind gusts and hail will accompany some
of the storms.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will precede a front as it moves from eastern Montana to
the western Dakotas. Behind the front, brisk onshore winds will
bring cool and showery weather to the Pacific Northwest, especially
near the coast and Cascades. Meanwhile, most of the Southwest will
be drier and milder than recent days with ample sunshine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seeds of Drought
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of summer drought are often planted in the spring.
April was the driest on record in Mobile, Alabama, a reflection of
exceptional dryness in much of the Southeast. The Northeast, where
Boston had its second driest April, also had areas of sparse
rainfall. Reliable predictions for those areas of the nation that
will have drought this summer are impossible. Patterns of spring
rainfall can markedly alter the drought probabilities, but, in many
past years, areas that have been unusually dry at the start of the
growing season have greater risk of summer drought. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret report to top Clinton administration
officials last November warned that China posed an ``acute
intelligence threat'' to the government's nuclear weapons
laboratories and that computer systems at the labs were being
constantly penetrated by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investigators waited until March to search the computer of a
scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory who had been under
investigation for nearly three years, suspected of spying for
China. And it was not until April that the Energy Department shut
down its classified computer systems to impose tighter security
over their data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in February, the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, tried to
delete evidence that he had improperly transferred more than 1,000
files containing nuclear secrets, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report contains numerous warnings and specific
examples showing that outsiders had gained access to the computer
systems at U. S. weapons labs as recently as June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about why the
Clinton administration failed to address security breaches at the
laboratories sooner, and the report, which has been shared with
Congress, is certain to fuel the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first comprehensive review of its kind, was
prepared by U. S. counterintelligence officials throughout the
government. It confirmed and elaborated on longstanding concerns
about the vulnerability of the weapons laboratories to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The report was distributed to the highest levels of the
government, including Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy;
William Cohen, the secretary of defense; Janet Reno, the attorney
general; President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, and three dozen other senior officials at law enforcement,
defense and intelligence agencies. A government official gave a
copy of the report to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Energy Department recorded 324
attacks on its unclassified computer systems from outside the
United States between October 1997 and June 1998, including
instances when outsiders successfully gained ``complete access and
total control to create, view, modify or execute any and all
information stored on the system.'' The document does not say where
the computer attacks originated.
</P>
<P>
   A select congressional committee sent the president additional
warnings about the security of the weapons laboratories in a
separate report that was also secret delivered in January of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said in an interview that he was briefed extensively
on the report and that it ``confirmed the already strong
counterintelligence measures I approved in October, including
cybermeasures.''
</P>
<P>
   The search of Lee's computer ``should have happened earlier,''
Richardson said. But he defended waiting until April 2 to shut down
the computer systems at the laboratory, saying: ``It wouldn't have
made much of a difference to have gone earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shutdown was the most extreme of measures,'' he said.
After learning on March 30 that Lee had improperly moved vast
amounts of nuclear secrets, Richardson said he decided to ``speed
up'' plans adopted months earlier to improve computer security.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his department's performance but said that some
Energy Department officials might be disciplined once an internal
inquiry he ordered had been completed.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 25-page counterintelligence report contains many examples of
lax security and serious intelligence breaches at the labs that
have not been previously disclosed, involving more than a dozen
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign spies ``rightly view DOE as an inviting, diverse and
soft target that is easy to access and that employs many who are
willing to share information,'' the report states. The Energy
Department is responsible for building and designing America's
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   China is cited in the report as posing the most serious security
threat to the U.S. weapons labs. The report also singles out Russia
and India as immediate threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``China represents an acute intelligence threat to DOE,'' the
report said, referring to the Department of Energy. ``It conducts
`a full court press' consisting of massive numbers of collectors of
all kinds, in the United States, in China, and elsewhere abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is an advanced nuclear power yet its nuclear stockpile
is deteriorating,'' it continued. ``As such, China has specifically
targeted DOE for the collection of technical intelligence related
to the design of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes, ``This effort has been very successful and
Beijing's exploitation of U.S. national laboratories has
substantially aided its nuclear weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that the maintenance of nuclear weapons,
so-called ``stockpile stewardship,'' is the area of most intense
interest to China. Lee was at the center of Los Alamos' stockpile
stewardship program for years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report also includes detailed information about a number of
incidents in which China could have obtained sensitive weapons
information, as well as some of the ways the espionage could have
taken place, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Chinese scientist working at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory, on Long Island, was able to send dozens of long,
technical faxes to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, enabling the
Chinese research center to duplicate Brookhaven experiments as they
were being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   _ China might be using its exchanges with American scientists
for espionage. Chinese intelligence officials have also arranged
the visits of American scientists to China to ``enable Chinese
experts to assess and develop these contacts,'' according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-seven Chinese intelligence officers have visited or
been assigned to the labs and other Energy Department facilities
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-dozen congressional committees are examining
both evidence of Chinese nuclear spying and security failures at
Los Alamos and other weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   The secret November report, some officials believe, is the
latest sign that the Clinton administration and investigators moved
too slowly and repeatedly missed opportunities to address the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said his administration acted quickly once it
learned of security problems at the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories. White House officials cite the president's February
1998 directive to beef up security. That directive called for an
assessment of the security threat against nuclear weapons and
technology secrets at the Energy Department which was completed
last November.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, with new disclosures about the extent of
Lee's improper transfers of secret weapons data, the Clinton
administration is facing intensified questions about how his
actions, which jeopardized secrets to virtually the entire U.S.
nuclear arsenal, could have gone undetected for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that nobody looked at his computer files until there
was a crisis?'' said a senior Energy Department official. ``That's
what we're trying to look into.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged. His lawyer left a message on a
reporter's voice mail saying the allegations against his client are
false.
</P>
<P>
   The report also focuses on security breaches at the labs
involving other countries, citing numerous incidents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Russian intelligence has intercepted communications
from Los Alamos concerning nuclear power plants used for military
purposes. In addition, the report says that an unknown individual
sent 38 faxes to India from inside a sensitive area of the Oak
Ridge Laboratory, in Tennessee, during a 30-day period in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report grew out of a comprehensive counterintelligence
review prompted by an espionage investigation that came to focus on
Lee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised about Lee as far back as 1982. At that
time, he telephoned a scientist who had been dismissed from the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a result of an FBI
investigation of China's theft of neutron bomb secrets, officials
said. In the phone call, Lee offered to help the other scientist
with his problems at the lab. The FBI investigated Lee as a result
of the phone call and gave him a polygraph test in late 1982 or
early 1983, officials said. He passed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that in 1994 or 1995, another Los Alamos scientist
saw Lee being hugged by a visiting Chinese scientist in a manner
that seemed suspiciously congratulatory. It turned out to be a
scientist Lee had visited in China in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The witness reported the encounter to the FBI, officials said,
one of the factors that eventually led the bureau to suspect him in
China's theft of design information about America's most advanced
nuclear warhead, known as the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress have questioned whether the FBI was aggressive
enough in its pursuit of Lee in the W-88 case, especially since
both Lee and his wife had informally provided information to the
bureau in the past, officials said. He finally emerged as the prime
suspect in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, Energy Department officials briefed Berger, then
the deputy national security adviser, on the case and how it
related to China's nuclear strategy. Berger took no action and did
not inform the president of the matter, White House officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI meanwhile began a criminal inquiry. But little
investigative work was done by FBI agents throughout the rest of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Justice Department declined an FBI request to ask a
court for authority to monitor Lee's phone and to gain access to
Lee's office computer. Justice Department officials argued there
was insufficient evidence to convince a judge to approve the
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had asked the Energy Department not to move Lee from his
job at Los Alamos, fearing this might alert him that he was a
suspect. But the inquiry appeared to be stalled. In April 1997, the
bureau's agents in Albuquerque, N.M., told Energy Department
officials they could transfer Lee to a less sensitive job.
</P>
<P>
   But that message apparently never reached Energy Department
officials in Washington, officials said. The job Lee was shifted to
that month was one in which he was responsible for updating a
computerized archive of nuclear secrets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Berger was briefed again. This time, the briefing
included evidence that the Chinese were focusing on computer
systems at Los Alamos, in particular computer simulations and codes
for nuclear weapons, according to one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, officials at the Energy Department, the
lab and the FBI were all also warned that the Chinese were
attempting to gain access to computer systems at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The July discussion was also broader, including other security
problems, the W-88 theft and other espionage cases, including one
involving a scientist who had worked for weapons labs and their
contractors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That scientist, Peter Lee (who is not related to Wen Ho Lee)
later pleaded guilty to attempting to pass classified information
in 1985 and making false statements about a trip to China in 1997.
The November 1998 report cited his case as ``a good example of
China's use of cultural ties to collect successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berger's 1997 briefing, he discussed the matter with the
president, and White House officials began to draft a presidential
directive ordering better security at the laboratories, White House
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI's investigation of Wen Ho Lee continued
without success.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Chinese-American FBI agents, posing as
Chinese spies, tried to establish a covert relationship with Lee,
officials said. In their sting, what the FBI calls a ``false flag''
operation, the FBI agents called him, pretending to be Chinese
spies checking up on Lee in the wake of Peter Lee's conviction
earlier that year, officials said. Wen Ho Lee listened, and then
called the agents back to refuse their offer to get together.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, both of the Lee cases were coming under the
scrutiny of the select congressional committee, headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif. At about the same time, Richardson took
over at the Energy Department from Federico Pena.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the secret counterintelligence report was
completed. Richardson, prodded both by Congress and by the mounting
evidence of security problems, took action to screen foreign
visitors to the labs, proposals that had lain dormant for years at
the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lee was subjected to a polygraph for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   During that first examination, for reasons that officials could
not explain, investigators did not ask Lee to consent to a search
of his office computer. Government attorneys had concluded that the
earlier Justice Department denial for an FBI surreptitious search
required Lee's permission to examine his office computer.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lee took a second polygraph. This time, officials
said, he was asked about his computer use and some of his answers
were seen as deceptive. Two days later, apparently aware that
investigators were now suspicious about his computer use, Lee
deleted between 1,000 and 2,000 files, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's deletions involved millions of lines of computer codes he
had downloaded, mostly in 1994 and 1995, from his classified
computer system to an unclassified system. Such unclassified
systems at the labs have been successfully attacked by outsiders,
according to the 1998 intelligence report.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, Lee was interviewed by the FBI. During the
interviews he gave permission for his computer to be searched. On
March 8, he was fired from Los Alamos for security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, investigators pored through his
computer records, recreated the deleted files and learned that Lee
had downloaded computer data and codes that, in effect, were the
distillation of more than a half-century of research on how to
perfect nuclear weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined whether another country _
China, for instance _ obtained the computer data. But officials
said they have found evidence that someone retrieved the renamed
files that had been switched to the unclassified system.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Lee's computer transfers, Richardson shut down
the computer systems at the weapons labs. He ordered new procedures
to make it more difficult to transfer classified data.
</P>
<P>
   The inadequacy of Energy Department's monitoring of lab computer
systems had been pointed out for years in low-level Energy
Department reports, as well as in the November 1998 intelligence
report sent to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they didn't shut down computer systems earlier is
because they weren't paying attention to the problem,'' said one
Republican member of Congress.

2000, NOT JUST A YEAR, BUT A PARTY PRICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will it be the party of the millennium or the
wretched excess of an age?
</P>
<P>
   A New York producer, Steven Leber, has paid more than $2 million
to rent out all four floors of the 22-acre Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center in Manhattan on New Year's Eve. He says that
25,000 guests will pay $1,000 to $2,500 to participate in what he
calls ``Celebration 2000: The Party of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-hour event, to be sponsored by American Express, is being
trumpeted in newspaper advertisements and promotional mailings
Sunday. The party is to kick off at 6 p.m. on Dec. 31 and will end
after breakfast, offering entertainers who include the tenor Andrea
Bocelli, the magician David Copperfield and the comedian Joan
Rivers as well as the singers Sting, Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry,
Tom Jones and Enrique Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
   For 2,000 partygoers willing to pay $2,500 per head, meals will
be designed and supervised by the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten,
proprietor of such restaurants as Jean Georges, Vong and Mercer
Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Javits party suggests an anti-Woodstock for the betuxed,
bejewelled and middle-aged, Leber termed it ``the greatest party in
the world,'' adding that ``we want 25,000 people to walk out the
next morning and say they've had the greatest New Year's Eve of
their life.'' The 57-year-old Leber once ran the music division of
the William Morris Agency and toured ``Beatlemania'' and the Moscow
Circus in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Leber defended the admission fee as ``a reasonably priced
ticket, given the cost of the other entertainment around town.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Rainbow Room, operated these days by the Cipriani family,
the millennium party will cost $6,000 per couple for live music and
dancing for about 250 guests (that's $3,900 per person, including
tax and gratuity).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the fund-raiser at the American Museum of Natural
History, which plans to welcome about 1,500 guests paying $1,000 to
$5,000. Their tickets will entitle them to a preview of the Rose
Center for Earth and Space and the new Hayden Planetarium, which do
not officially open until February 2000. The event is already 80
percent sold out, according to a museum spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a cut-rate competitor to these New Year's Eve
events, of course. ``Our party is free,'' commented Peter Kohlmann,
executive producer of the 24-hour-long Times Square 2000
celebration, to be the largest in the event's 94-year history.
</P>
<P>
   There, the millennium will be celebrated time zone by time zone,
starting at 7 a.m. New York time, when revelers in the South
Pacific greet the New Year. Live video coverage of these
festivities will be displayed to the crowd on five new
20-by-30-foot TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hour, for 20 minutes, there will be a live event in
Times Square, with music, choreographed pageantry, lighting,
pyrotechnics and other special effects,'' said Kohlmann, who is
producing the event under the auspices of the Times Square Business
Improvement District.
</P>
<P>
   Leber said he would spend more than $20 million to fill Javits
with entertainers and to transform the exhibition center into a
world of laser lights, celebratory drapery and set designs that
will divide the cavernous space into a big-band ballroom, a disco
and a comedy room.
</P>
<P>
   As for the food, ``This is my millennium statement,'' said
Vongerichten, adding that he is working to create a menu that
``will be very unusual, because this is the only millennium we will
ever celebrate.'' The meals will be catered by the company he
serves as a consultant and partner, Tentation, the American branch
of Potel &AMP; Chabot, a Paris food purveyor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the merrier,'' said Ann Godfrey Hughes, a spokeswoman
for the New York Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``On a normal New
Year's Eve, we expect 500,000 people. But this year we're expecting
millions.''

 &HT;    Anderson wants jersey retired at Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Anderson says he doesn't like looking up to the
rafters at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum and not
seeing his name and number among the retirees. Graduation is a
requirement if you want to have your number hanging and Anderson,
now with Boston, says he is equal to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to graduate,'' he said. ``I'm planning on getting
back into it this summer. I'm serious about it. I'm going to try to
graduate. I'm about 50 credits short (of a degree), but I want to
do it. That's not my reason to graduate, but that's the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the names of the famous, he notes, ``They got (Matt)
Harpring, (Tom) Hammonds, (Mark) Price, (John) Salley, but no K.A.
And that bugs me.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks' big Achilles
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts acknowledges the
severity of Patrick Ewing's Achilles is such that it might be best
to shut him down until next season. ``I threw it out just to say,
`Is it worthwhile resting him now?''' Checketts said. ``But I think
in Patrick's view, if he can help us, I think we have to have it.
I'm not giving up on the season when I say this, but Patrick needs
a good off-season when he's not sitting at the bargaining table and
doesn't have that load on his mind. He needs a good off-season of
conditioning and getting ready to play.''. . . Wes Unseld talked to
Dave Cowens about the Wizards' job. Ex-Hawks guard Doc Rivers also
spoke to Unseld. . . . Mike Fratello cannot opt out of his
Cleveland deal until July, 2000 but isn't unhappy with his job.
</P>
<P>
   The `Junk Yard Dog'
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Williams is tearing it up in Detroit. In six starts, he
has averaged 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds and made 37 of 58 shots.
``If I play 30 minutes and don't get at least a double-double, then
that's not JYD basketball,'' said Williams, also known as the Junk
Yard Dog. He had 21 points, 14 rebounds, 7 assists against Boston.
``I told my father that I would get 15 rebounds. I was one short.
He said he wouldn't get his haircut until I got 15. Now he is
walking around my house with an Afro. I know my mom is mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruining of the Bulls
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 81 points and shooting under 40 percent, the Bulls
have their worst offense since the early 1960s. Theirs is also the
biggest drop-off for a championship team. After losing Bill
Russell, the Celtics went from 48 victories to 34. The worst
single-season drop was San Antonio's, from .720 in 1995-96 to .244.
Last year, the Bulls were .756. Should they lose all their
remaining games, they would be 12-38 for .240.
</P>
<P>
   Shortened season urged
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley says the ideal NBA season would be 60 games. ``People
would have rest. Injuries would be cut down. The commissioner
definitely doesn't want to hear that, but that would be an ideal
schedule. This has tested everybody, and the commissioner is aware
of that. Of course, then he would say, `Pat, would you take a
22-game pay cut?'''
</P>
<P>
   And how would Riley respond? ``I don't get paid by the game.''

 &HT;    Duncan not ready for long run with Spurs
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tim Duncan is not going to commit himself long-term to
the San Antonio Spurs. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs concede he won't sign an extension this off-season
because of the franchise's cloudy future.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan says he hasn't thought about his contract status, but
admits the arena issue is a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had one arena proposal _ a tax-increment financing
project with a local school district _ killed prior to the season.
City and Bexar County officials are expected to reopen talks with
Spurs chairman Peter Holt after the mayoral election. The Spurs
would like some movement by November. A poll commissioned by the
Spurs last year said 70 percent of San Antonio residents were
opposed to building an arena with a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of it. A whole lot of it,'' Duncan said. ``I love
San Antonio. It's a great place for me. If we're going to be here,
what kind of team are we going to have? A lot of different factors
go into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have some great guys around you. You want to have
great fan support. A stadium is a big part of it. A practice
facility is a big part of it, but it's not the most important
part.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Jazz
</P>
<P>
   Jazz owner Larry Miller is upset about the rip from Isiah Thomas
last Sunday on NBC in which Thomas called Miller's tirade against
Portland's Greg Anthony ``classless and tasteless.'' Miller said
Thomas' comments were a factor in him being disciplined by the NBA.
Miller, who sits at courtside, has had run-ins with a number of
players, including Dikembe Mutombo. He was fined $10,000. ... With
the season winding down and his team struggling, Utah coach Jerry
Sloan says, ``It seems to me every game is like a playoff game now.
Hopefully, our players realize that.'' No love in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Jerry West on the Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant rift:
``It's not dislike, it's just a jealousy. I saw that same sort of
thing while sitting in a locker room with Elgin (Baylor) and Wilt
(Chamberlain).'' When Chamberlain read that remark, he ripped
ex-teammate West. ``When something big comes up, such as problems
with (Dennis) Rodman, the man (West) disappears.'' Chamberlain also
defended Bryant: ``Kobe is taking the brunt for every problem they
have; he has become their whipping boy, and that's wrong. A lot of
his mistakes are just the exuberance of youth. If he makes a
sensational play and they win, he's great. But if they lose, then
he's a hot dog. That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready and able
</P>
<P>
   When Portland hammered Seattle 119-84, Damon Stoudamire played
his best game since coming to the team last season, scoring 31
points. He made 14 of 21 shots and added six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I set my mind to it, I'm capable of doing that,''
Stoudamire said. ``A lot of people forgot that I averaged 20 points
in this league (with Toronto). This is something I used to have to
do all the time.''

 &HT;    Elway's retirement puts pressure on Jets
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Vinny Testaverde teed off at the Cadillac/NFL
Golf Classic in Clifton, N.J., last spring, he was an unemployed
quarterback hoping the next telephone call might bring a contract
offer.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked down the first fairway at the Upper Montclair
Country Club on Monday, though, the New York Jets quarterback was
carrying more than a 7-iron on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference that will be reshuffled by the retirement of
John Elway, a reborn Testaverde and his teammates suddenly carry
the pressure of being anointed the club most likely to supplant the
Denver Broncos as AFC champions next season. It is a mantle,
Testaverde said, worn tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk isn't going to win anything,'' Testaverde said. ``A year
ago, we felt we were ready to make a move. But as much as we talked
about being a Super Bowl caliber team, we weren't sure of
ourselves. Now that we've been to the (conference title game), we
know what we're capable of accomplishing. But I'm sure there are
plenty of teams, with John out of the equation now, who feel the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Elway's 16-year career hasn't resulted in the kind of
desperation among Broncos officials that might have happened before
Terrell Davis' arrival in 1995. But many people think that the
Broncos' chances for a first-ever Super Bowl three-peat have been
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   As the news of Elway's retirement spread last weekend,
bookmakers in Las Vegas changed the Broncos odds for winning their
third consecutive Super Bowl from 7-2 to 4-1, with Minnesota
becoming the favorite. One of the New York tabloids noted that
Elway's retirement, ``had handed the AFC crown'' to the Jets.
Another cited the pressure Jets coach Bill Parcells will face in
what figures to be his final season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets, who have acquired several key veterans this
spring, aren't the only team that should benefit by Denver's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Players in Jacksonville, Miami and New England all said the
retirement could have a leveling effect. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution checked with 10 coaches or general managers,
and the Jets and Broncos got four votes each as favorites in the
AFC, and the Jaguars got two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural reaction when a great player leaves is to assume
there's going to be some backsliding by his team,'' Jaguars coach
Tom Coughlin said. ``We'll have to see. Because of free-agency,
there's so little continuity anyway that it seems like you are
always starting over. Last year is rarely indicative anymore of
what this year will be. People will play Denver differently now,
but the Broncos will play differently, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos players like to refer to their offense as a ``well-oiled
machine,'' but everyone is wondering if the attack will be as
strong without Elway. Miami coach Jimmy Johnson suggested that the
difference will be more psychological _ positively for the
opposition and perhaps negatively for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, (teams) might not be looking over their
shoulders as much,'' he said, referring to Elway's trademark
late-game comebacks. ``Sometimes, if you believe a team is
beatable, then it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubby Brister, the vagabond quarterback who will replace Elway,
was 4-0 as a starter last season. He said on Tuesday that he
expects to see plenty of eight-man fronts as defenses concentrate
on stopping Davis to make Denver pass. Coach Mike Shanahan and
several Denver players have been outspoken and unified in their
support of Brister. But Brister, two years younger than the
38-year-old Elway, remains an unproven commodity. He has not
started more than four games in a season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta starter Chris Miller, journeyman Jeff Brohm, and
second-year player Brian Griese will back Brister. In the last
three seasons, Brister, Miller, Griese and Brohm have combined for
four starts, 193 attempts and 11 touchdown passes. And Denver is
financially strapped, because owner Pat Bowlen subscribed to the
play-now-and-pay-later approach with Elway, annually restructuring
his contract to help create room under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Elway will cost Denver nearly as much in retirement as he did
when he was playing, counting $3.9 million against the team's cap
next season and $5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville wide receiver Keenan McCardell said that Elway's
retirement ``was not like Michael Jordan's,'' and said the Broncos
will remain the team to beat as long as Davis is running.
</P>
<P>
   But Jets tailback Curtis Martin spoke for most of the league
when he summed up what might befall an Elway-less team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad for them,'' Martin said. ``And good for all the
rest of us.''

 &HT;    Sabres make obvious clear: Hasek won't be a Thrasher
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the first official setback in the Thrashers'
attempt to accrue talent, Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier
tipped his hand on the Sabres' protected list for the upcoming
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   He's keeping Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to help get him to Atlanta,'' Regier said,
laughing. ``Maybe he'll end up there some day, but as long as I'm
here, it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hasek, the NHL's closest thing to a one-man franchise, led
the Sabres to a four-game sweep over Ottawa in the first round of
the playoffs, Thrashers general manager Don Waddell jokingly
wondered if Buffalo would expose the goalie. Sure _ right after
Philadelphia serves up Eric Lindros, Colorado offers Peter Forsberg
and Wayne Gretzky decides to make a comeback because he always
wanted to be a Thrasher.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa dominated the play in Game 1 (shots: 41-15) and outshot
Buffalo by an average of 14 per game in the series. But Hasek
limited the Senators to six goals on 162 shots (.963 saves
percentage) and frustrated Ottawa's young forwards. ``You don't
have to be a genius to figure out the difference,'' Senators coach
Jacques Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Not fan of 2-ref system
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia coach Roger Neilson escaped a fine despite publicly
ripping the league and the two-referee system. Neilson became
incensed when the Flyers were called for two minor penalties by
separate refs on the same play in Game 4 against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``A referee is the guy who's in charge of the game _ he can't
split it up with somebody else,'' Neilson said. ``There's two
things you never want to know: One is how they make hot dogs, and
the other is what goes on in the NHL office.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Gary Bettman is saying little about the half-dozen
racial incidents that have targeted black players in recent years,
most recently the unproven allegation that Toronto's Tie Domi
called Philadelphia's Sandy McCarthy the ``N'' word. ``Obviously,''
Bettman said, ``if there are things we need as a league and if
teams need to discuss things with their players in consultation
with the players association, that's something we have to look
at.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy on Domi's denials: ``He's like a rat trying to hide.
He's a little weasel. He has to tell the truth _ if he's a real
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas defenseman Shawn Chambers after playing 56 minutes, 21
seconds, nearly a complete regulation game, in the Stars'
triple-overtime win over Edmonton: ``I couldn't even get excited. I
saw the pile of players celebrating the (winning) goal. I just
turned and went the other way to (goalie) Eddie Belfour.'' It was
Belfour's third triple-overtime game. ... The NHL might soften the
crease rules in the off-season to something akin to ``no harm, no
foul.'' As an example, a skate in the crease would not negate a
goal if an official thinks that the offensive player did not
interfere with the goaltender. ... Washington has told goalie Rick
Tabaracci he won't be back. ... Chicago center Alex Zhamnov thinks
No. 36 makes him look too slow so he's switching to 13 next season.
Honest. ...If Boston or Toronto should advance to the finals
against Detroit, it would be the first meeting of Original Six
teams for the Stanley Cup in 20 years, since Montreal beat the New
York Rangers in 1978-79. ... There were eight third-period
comebacks in the first 23 playoff games, equaling the number in the
entire 1998 post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers update
</P>
<P>
   Montreal assistant coach Dave King, a candidate for the
Thrashers' head coaching job, is considering an offer for the top
job with Jokerit, a team based in Helsinki, Finland. But Waddell,
the Thrashers GM, isn't concerned: ``If we lose (a candidate)
because of other opportunities, it would be unfortunate. But we
won't lose anybody we're really hot on, and at this point we're
lukewarm on all of the candidates.'' ... Ottawa's quick exit might
have hurt the potential candidacy of Senators' assistant coach Mike
Murphy. ... The Thrashers will host ``NHL Breakout '99,'' a street
and in-line hockey tournament, May 8-9, at Whitewater in Marietta.
Entry information is available at area ice and roller rinks and
sporting goods stores. ... Waddell expressed no doubt that Philips
Arena will be completed in time for next season as he accompanied a
few media members on a tour the other day. Not that the Thrashers
need any extra motivation to have their arena finished, but they
would be fined $15 million by the NHL if it's not. ... With the
NHL's decision to retire Gretzky's No. 99 league-wide, the
Thrashers pulled off this rarity: retiring a uniform number before
they ever assigned one.

WILLIAM MCCREA, ASTRONOMER WHO STUDIED SUN'S COMPOSITION, DIES AT
94  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir William Hunter McCrea, a British astronomer and
mathematician who, as a young researcher, advanced the knowledge of
the Sun's composition and who later set forth theories on the
formation of planetary systems and galaxies, died last Sunday. He
was 94 and lived in Lewes, Sussex.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, astrophysicists succeeded in debunking an ancient
proposition that the Sun was made up mostly of iron. The scientists
theorized that the Sun held many of the same gases and materials as
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Going one step further, spectro-scopy hinted at the presence of
hydrogen in the Sun's atmosphere, and the German astronomer
Albrecht Unsold suggested in 1928 that hydrogen, in fact, was the
most common element. William McCrea, a brilliant mathematician and
research student at Cambridge University, worked out the
calculations that confirmed that hypothesis a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists eventually established that all stars were composed
chiefly of hydrogen, a realization that turned their science into a
new direction. It also pointed toward the Big Bang theory of the
origin of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960's, Professor McCrea distanced himself from that
theory of a single Big Bang. He advanced his own interpretations
that indicated instead a series of bangs at different times and
places in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Dublin, William McCrea was educated at Cambridge and
the University of Gottingen. He returned to Cambridge to receive
his doctorate in 1929 and set out as a lecturer in mathematics at
Edinburgh University.
</P>
<P>
   He next moved to the University of London and the Imperial
College of Science. He remained associated with the University of
London until 1966, when he was appointed research professor of
theoretical astronomy at the University of Sussex. He took emeritus
status in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed papers to mathematical and astronomical journals
and translated Unsold's ``The New Cosmos'' (1969). His own book
titles included ``Relativity Physics'' (1935), ``Analytical
Geometry of Three Dimensions'' (1942), ``Physics of Sun and Stars''
(1950), ``The Royal Greenwich Observatory'' (1975), and ``History
of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1920 to 1980'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   He was a consulting astronomer and visiting professor to
observatories and universities around the world. Queen Elizabeth II
knighted him in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   McCrea's wife, Marian Nicol Cole Webster McCrea, died in 1995,
after 62 years of marriage. They had two daughters and a son.

STANLEY ADAMS, WHO LED COUNTERATTACK IN KOREA, DIES AT 76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Calif., Mo, Kan.)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Stanley T. Adams, who as an Army sergeant won the Medal
of Honor in the Korean War for leading a counterattack that left
more than 50 enemy soldiers dead in hand-to-hand combat, died on
April 19 at the Oregon Veterans Home in The Dalles, Ore. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who lived in Bend, Ore., had Alzheimer's disease, said
his wife, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1950, Adams, then a sergeant first class, was serving
with the 19th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division when it was
rushed to South Korea from occupation duty in Japan soon after
North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South
Korea. Most of the men in the division were inexperienced, but
Adams, a native of DeSoto, Kan., was an Army veteran of World War
II who had fought in North Africa and Italy and had been wounded in
action.
</P>
<P>
   By midwinter of 1951, U.N. forces in Korea were reeling after
Chinese Communist troops had staged a large counteroffensive in
late November 1950, forcing American soldiers and marines to
retreat from the Yalu River and the Chosin Reservoir in North
Korea. Within six weeks, Communist forces had recrossed the 38th
parallel and recaptured Seoul, the South Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops in the Eighth Army, which included the 24th
Division, began a counteroffensive in late January. Adams' company
set up positions south of Seoul on Feb. 3. His platoon held an
outpost on a ridge 200 yards in front of the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 p.m., the Communists attacked two adjacent companies,
driving a wedge between them. Two hours later, 250 enemy soldiers
hit Adams' outpost with machine-gun and mortar fire. After holding
on for 45 minutes, the platoon retreated toward the company's main
position. Soon afterward, Adams fixed his bayonet and charged the
enemy, followed by 13 men from his platoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenacity of the Chinese and North Korean soldiers forced
the men of the Eighth Army to battle them at close quarters
reminiscent of the Civil War,'' Edward F. Murphy wrote in ``Korean
War Heroes'' (Presidio Press, 1992). ``The only way to remove the
enemy from their hilltop positions was to dig them out. Men like
Sergeant Adams knew this, and effectively used the almost obsolete
bayonet to accomplish their missions.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adams was 50 yards from the enemy he was hit in the leg by
a bullet. He continued on, only to be knocked down four more times
by the concussion of exploding grenades.
</P>
<P>
   But he got up and charged the Communist positions, swinging his
rifle butt and using his bayonet. After nearly an hour of
hand-to-hand combat, the Chinese retreated, leaving behind more
than 50 dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House ceremony on July 5, 1951, President Harry S.
Truman presented Adams with the Medal of Honor, its citation
crediting him with ``saving his battalion from possible disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after receiving the medal, the nation's highest military
decoration, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. He remained in
the Army until 1970, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Adams later
held an administrative position with the Internal Revenue Service
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Gary, of Wellington,
Mo.; a daughter, Joy Kenyon of San Mateo, Calif.; a brother,
Charles, of Wichita, Kan., 12 grandchildren and 5
great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Florida official says national plan to save billfish inadequate
 &HT;    By Willie Howard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A plan to protect billfish in the
Atlantic Ocean, announced Monday by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, will do ``absolutely nothing'' to reduce billfish
mortality or to rebuild overfished billfish populations, the
chairman of the NMFS billfish advisory panel said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Nelson, executive director of Florida's Marine Fisheries
Commission and chairman of the panel that advises NMFS on billfish,
said the plan fails to significantly address the bycatch, or the
unintended catch, of sailfish and marlin by commercial longliners
who use rigs 30 to 40 miles long containing thousands of hooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at blue and white marlin and sailfish, 94 percent
of the mortality is from longline bycatch,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commercial fishermen are not allowed to land or sell
billfish. But because they can't select which fish will bite their
longline hooks, billfish are unintentionally caught and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition for Marine Conservation has asked the
NMFS to restrict longlines to 10 miles in length and impose a
six-hour maximum soak time. If longlines were pulled and checked
more frequently, NCMC says, hooked billfish would be more likely to
be alive when released than if the rigs are left in the water for
long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   NMFS spokesman Gordon Helm said the agency, an arm of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, is studying longline length restrictions
and soak-time limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a living document,'' Helm said of the fishery
management plan for Atlantic billfish, an outgrowth of the 1996
Sustainable Fisheries Act, which requires federal regulators to
identify overfished stocks and develop plans to rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plans might as well be written by commercial
longliners,'' said Mike Leech, president of the International Game
Fish Association, which represents recreational anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Plans approved this week, which take effect June 1, do limit the
number of longline fishermen, something the commercial fishing
industry has wanted for years. They also forbid longline fishing
during the month of June in a section of the ocean off New Jersey
to protect bluefin tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A three-fish-per-person daily bag limit on Atlantic yellowfin
tuna for recreational anglers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A one-shark-per-vessel recreational bag limit and a 4 1/2-foot
minimum size limit on several species of coastal sharks, not
including 19 shark species already protected by no-take rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voluntary education workshops for both commercial and
recreational anglers on several species of highly migratory fish in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The NMFS had proposed closing a small portion of the Atlantic
off Florida to longline fishing for three months to protect
juvenile swordfish, but that part of the plan is being
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed closure off Florida is expected to go back before
the Department of Commerce after public hearings this summer.
Meanwhile, the longline industry is pushing for a buyout plan that
would result in large time and area closures for longline fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Beideman, executive director of the New Jersey-based Blue
Water Fishermen's Association, which represents 160 operators of
longline fishing vessels, said his organization is working with
Congress on a plan for the government to buy some 60 longline
vessels, for $15 million. In exchange, much of the Atlantic ocean,
from North Carolina to the Florida Keys, would be closed year-round
to longline fishing.

   Beideman said the buyout and Atlantic closure, along with a
half-year closure in a portion of the Gulf of Mexico off the
Florida Panhandle, would reduce by 47 percent the unintended
killing of juvenile swordfish and longline billfish mortality by 24
percent.

 &HT;    Celtics miss on promise, playoffs
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the jockeying for playoff positioning and the race
for the final postseason spots goes down to the NBA's final
regular-season days, a group of teams must feel like the creepy
neighbor who wasn't invited to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expected the Chicago Bulls to be excluded from the
fray, what with the gutting by general manager Jerry Krause. But in
Boston, Cleveland and New Jersey _ where much was expected this
season _underachievement has been the order of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In this shortened season with wide-open prospects, the Celtics,
Cavaliers and Nets have floundered in disturbing fashion. Injuries
have played a part, particularly in Cleveland, but injuries, we're
told so often, are a part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Rick Pitino's Celtics hardly resembled the team
that won 35 games last season. They were young and expected to be
better, but instead they've been awful. Pitino's pressing scheme
essentially is an all-or-nothing system, and it mostly resulted in
blowout defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Among other problems, which include Antoine Walker being booed
by home fans, point guard Kenny Anderson was hardly the factor
Pitino expected when he traded promising Chauncey Billups for the
former Georgia Tech star. Anderson's plight epitomizes this year's
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about my career,'' Anderson said. ``I'm an
underachiever, as far as what my potential was when I was coming
out of high school, college. I feel I've underachieved. It's not
over, though, so there's a light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more down for the Cavaliers, a team of which much was
expected, what with the return of four rookies who received
significant minutes last year. The best of the lot was center
Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who went down with a broken foot a month into
the season. Point guard Brevin Knight and guard Derek Anderson both
missed time with injuries, too. And so, coach Mike Fratello is
liable to have his first sub.-500 season since he coached the
1984-85 Hawks to a 34-48 mark. Meanwhile, it's been ugly all season
for New Jersey, a team picked by some to win the Atlantic Division.
Instead, the Nets got John Calipari fired as they stumbled through
the season.

 &HT;    Malone shows no remorse By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The longer Karl Malone plays, the more he opens
himself up to criticism as a dirty player. An unrepentant dirty
player.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence against the Utah Jazz forward came last week
when he clocked Phoenix center Joe Kleine with an elbow to the face
that took plastic surgery and 30 stitches to close. If that had not
been bad enough, Malone said later, after claiming that he didn't
mean to bloody Kleine, ``That's the way I play, and that's the way
I'm going to play as long as I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered no apology. That left Suns coach Danny Ainge
incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl showed zero remorse,'' Ainge said. ``All he's done is
bash Joe and Luc Longley. All he does is play dirty and show no
remorse for the players he leaves injured on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Malone injured Longley's knee when he leaned on
the Phoenix center and then kicked him. Longley missed seven games.
Last year, Malone knocked out San Antonio's David Robinson and
guard Elliot Perry with elbows to the face. Malone once fractured a
bone in the face of the late Derek Smith with an elbow and bloodied
Isiah Thomas with an elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge cited that history as a pattern. ``If this was the first
time Karl had done it, you could excuse it,'' Ainge said. ``You
never know which Karl Malone is doing the talking, anyway. Is it
the one who says he's never playing in Utah again? Or is it the one
who is crying at the podium after re-negotiating his contract _ for
the fifth time? You might as well call him Sybil.''
</P>
<P>
   PHIL'S NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will raise a banner Wednesday at the United Center for
former coach Phil Jackson, who quit after last season and six NBA
championships in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is expected to attend, along with presidential
hopeful Bill Bradley, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson has spent much of his time on the
motivational speaking circuit and aiding Bradley's quest for the
White House. He probably will coach next season and have his choice
of jobs from New Jersey and Washington _ who have interims at the
helm now _ and possibly New York and the Lakers, depending on how
those teams finish.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan's purchase of the Charlotte Hornets apparently
imminent, Jackson probably would get a call from his former player,
too, although Paul Silas has made a strong bid to keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To the Spurs. After a slow start, Tim Duncan's squad has been
brilliant and poses as much a threat as anyone in the playoffs _
despite David Robinson's demise.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. A sinking ship hardly needs a
20-year-old to argue with his coach about a defensive assignment,
as Bryant did with Kurt Rambis last week. Might Kobe be getting too
big for his britches?

SUSPECT HELD, OVER BOMBING IN LONDON: FEAR PERSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British police officers sped to a small Hampshire
village southwest of London early Saturday to arrest a man they
said may be involved in a wave of extremist bombings that claimed
two lives in a blast Friday night at a gay bar in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest failed to quell widespread anxieties among
minority groups that they may be the next target of what the police
depict as a hate-driven racial campaign by extreme rightists that
has sent tremors of nervousness across London. Representatives of
London's Jewish groups said worshipers may be searched at
synagogues and Jews would patrol some areas to watch for suspicious
activities. ``We are concerned, but I hope that the precautions we
have put into effect will stop anything happening,'' said Mike
Whine of the British Board of Jewish Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 people were wounded when the bomb _ the latest in a
series of attacks _ exploded at the Admiral Duncan pub. The police
said they were linking the Soho blast to earlier attacks on
Londoners of African-Caribbean descent in Brixton, south London,
two weeks ago Saturday, and a second blast last weekend in Brick
Lane, east London, which has a large Asian population. Six people
were described by hospital authorities Saturday as in a critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   A person asserting to represent a shadowy right-wing extremist
group calling itself the White Wolves called a London radio station
to take responsibility for last night's attack.
</P>
<P>
   The three attacks have left London jittery. The police cordoned
off an area in the district around Victoria station, a main railway
terminus, Saturday after a further scare but there was no immediate
word on whether a bomb had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the bombings remains mysterious. When the first
bombs went off in Brixton and Brick Lane, some Londoners concluded
that they were in protest of an official inquiry that unearthed
police racism in investigations of the killing of a black
teen-ager, Stephen Lawrence, by a gang of white youths who have
escaped punishment. Since then, though, the bombers' activities
seem to suggest a broader, neo-Nazi agenda aimed at the same groups
vilified by Hitler and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, five people have now been arrested but two were
released on bail. The arrests follow the release by the police of
images from a closed-circuit television camera that recorded a
young white man in a baseball cap apparently surveying a busy
market area in Brixton two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good likeness for the video still,'' a police
spokesman said of the man seized when scores of officers burst into
a modest, semi-detached house on a quiet residential street in
Cove, Hampshire, on the southwest outskirts of London near
Farnborough at 2 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors told reporters that the police ordered them to leave
their houses as officers raided the three-bedroom house where, a
police spokesman said, ``combustible materials'' were found.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the suspect shared the house with another man
and a woman and had lived there for about a year. The man was said
to be in his early 20s. A police spokesman said the man had been
arrested ``in connection with the Brixton and Brick Lane bombs,''
but did not say whether the man was also suspected of involvement
in Friday's attack on a sunny, summery evening in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   The police raid stunned the quiet village. ``It's shocked us
all,'' Olive Gibbs, a 73-year-old who lives two doors away from the
man who was detained, told the British Press Association. ``It's
such a quiet place and there has never been anything like that
happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Wells, a 34-year-old mother of two who also lives nearby,
said: ``We used to let our children run around but I'm going to
ship them out today. We've heard that the house is a bomb
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   While little is known about the White Wolves group that asserted
responsibility for Friday night's blast _ and has also been linked
to the previous two _ investigators say their name suggests
neo-Nazi links, and some newspaper reports have said they are
connected to similar extremists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White Wolves are said to be an offshoot of Combat 18 _ which
takes its name from the position of Adolf Hitler's initials in the
alphabet _ itself a violent breakaway from rightist political
organizations. Some groups reported a letter sent to some of them
before the Brixton bomb that told Jews and ``nonwhites'' to leave
Britain by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews and nonwhites who remain after 1999 has ended will be
exterminated,'' the letter said. ``When the clocks strike midnight
on 31 December, 1999, the White Wolves will begin to howl and when
the wolves begin to howl the Wolves begin to hunt. You have been
warned. Hail Britannia.''

 &HT;    Overworked pitching a problem for Indians
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the Cleveland Indians fight the urge to fit
themselves for their championship rings, a detail plagues them as
they rush off toward October. It's their pitching staff. It's an
autumn disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   With the majors' best record entering the weekend, Cleveland has
a starting staff that continually failed to get through the middle
innings. A suspect bullpen, supposedly addressed with offseason
acquisitions, already has been overworked. As the postseason is all
about pitching, the Indians are riding for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the rate we're going,'' manager Mike Hargrove said,
``(relievers) Paul Shuey, Steve Reed and Mike Jackson are going to
end up with 120 appearances each.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not Shuey. Forced to work three consecutive games in
Boston last weekend, he tore a hamstring and might miss most of
May. What's puzzling about that trend is that Cleveland's staff had
been considered one of the AL's soundest. Now the club is obsessed
with soaring pitch-counts.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-game span last week, Cleveland starters threw 136
pitches in the first inning alone, an average of 34 per man, when
even half that total is above the norm. Where pitching coach Phil
Regan targets a nine-inning game between 117-120 pitches, both Dave
Burba and Jaret Wright would average 151 pitches per nine innings
at their current rate; Doc Gooden would be up to 197.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are throwing too many pitches early,'' Regan said.
``They're pitching themselves out of games.''
</P>
<P>
   That spelled ruin for a bullpen that blew a league-high 23 saves
last year. Over the winter, the Indians dealt for Ricky ``Don't
Call Me Ricardo'' Rincon and Jerry Spradlin. Closer Jose Mesa, Doug
Jones and Eric Plunk, who had a combined 4.64 ERA as Indians last
season, were jettisoned, and the club even picked up Mark Langston
when San Diego cut him and made him a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have improved nothing. Shuey is down, Rincon is
sitting out a month with a a bad elbow, and Langston's availability
is limited because of a bone spur in his left elbow. Closer Jackson
is fighting muscle strains on both sides of his rib cage. Spradlin
was so bad he was dumped on San Francisco for some middling
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bullpen is populated with suspects Paul Wagner and Rich
DeLucia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Indians are scoring by the bushel simply
because they have to. The pitching staff gave up five or more runs
in eight of the first 21 games, while the bullpen blew three save
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked a lot about pitch counts the last few days, Regan
said. ``Guys have to keep their pitch counts down and stay in games
longer to give our bullpen a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chad Ogea, the only active pitcher to win a World
Series game for the Indians, is 2-1 in Philadelphia, has worked
into the seventh in three of his first five starts and hasn't
exceeded 100 pitches yet.

 &HT;    Jacobs feeling `more accepted'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the Senior PGA Tour players feeling some form
of comfort zone at this week's Nationwide Championship at The Golf
Club of Georgia, nobody should come close to John Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what else Jacobs accomplishes on the Senior Tour,
Alpharetta always will be the site of his official arrival. It was
here last year that Jacobs went from being ``a great guy who hits
it out of sight'' to ``legitimate winner,'' and glasses of wine
properly were sipped in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   With a one-shot win over Hale Irwin, who in 1998 was still
nearly unbeatable when near the lead, Jacobs became an enthusiastic
member of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little more accepted now,'' he said. ``Unless you
win, you're kind of like second class. . . . If you pound around,
pound around and don't win, there's always a doubt that gets in
your mind. The longer you go, there's more and more doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   More commonly referred to as ``JJ,'' Jacobs opened the 1999
season with a win in the MasterCard Championship in Hawaii, then
nearly grabbed another victory, eventually losing to Gary McCord in
an exciting playoff at the Toshiba Classic on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Jacobs reunion, new names are the theme at this
year's Nationwide. Rookie Bruce Fleisher has won three times and
leads the money list with $827,550. LaGrange's Allen Doyle, known
in Georgia for his six state titles as an amateur, has won twice,
including the recent PGA Seniors Championship, and is second on the
money list with $725,924. Marietta's Larry Nelson is third with
$543,228.
</P>
<P>
   McCord, Marietta's Joe Inman and Bob Duval, who won his first
tournament on the same day son David won The Players Championship,
also are in the Nationwide field.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin and Gil Morgan are the Senior Tour's mystery duo this
year. After dominating the last few years, they are 24th and 27th,
respectively on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irwin won the Senior Skins Game in January, he has only
one top 10 in a full-field event.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As more than 7,000 protesters demonstrated outside, the
National Rifle Association held its annual meeting in a hotel
ballroom here Saturday, rallying defiantly against calls for
restricting guns after the school shootings in nearby Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 people crammed into a room set up for 2,000 for
the association's meeting, which had been scaled back from three
days to one after the Littleton shootings, in which 15 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Charlton Heston, the actor who is the president of the
organization, the pro-gun group had spurned calls from state and
local politicians and others to scrap its convention out of respect
for those killed just 10 miles away in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, they observed a moment of silence for the
victims. Then the Colorado secretary of state, Vikki Buckley, a
Republican, delivered a rousing defense of the constitutional right
to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the killings in Littleton, Ms. Buckley said: ``Guns are not
the issue. Hate, what pulled the trigger of violence, is the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who would run the NRA out of town need to look at our
own children who are engaging in irresponsible sex and having
children they cannot take care of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raise as much heck about that as you did the NRA and you will
have saved more lives in five years than are taken with guns in a
century,'' she declared to sustained applause and a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, protesters held signs denouncing the event and the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver doesn't want NRA blood money,'' read one sign, as
protesters walked somberly from the state capitol to the hotel
singing ``We Shall Overcome.'' Another sign read, ``Cradle
children, not Uzis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed that I was not involved in this earlier,''
said George Flynn, a protester and the father of a Columbine High
School student who was not harmed in the attack. ``It took
something like this to wake me up, and I am ashamed of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But convention participants were unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   Clem Potelunas, a civil engineer, drove his pickup truck from
Idaho Falls, Idaho, for the gun meeting. ``We're here to show
solidarity for what we believe in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the rifle
association, followed Ms. Buckley with a more subdued policy
speech. He said that the Littleton shootings had left a vast
misimpression of where the rifle association stood on several
issues.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre emphasized that ``the real problem is unprosecuted
criminal access to guns,'' a statement that brought much applause.
</P>
<P>
   But his very modest nods to anything that hinted at concession
were greeted coolly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, LaPierre said: ``We believe in absolutely gun-free,
zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the group had never gone on record as saying
there should be absolutely no guns in schools. LaPierre said that
anyone who took a gun to school should be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre also said the association supported trigger locks as
long as they were voluntary, not mandatory. The association has
been at odds with gun manufacturers over this point, with most
manufacturers now routinely outfitting new weapons with such locks.
The rifle association's position may seem like the smallest of
steps, especially since the locks can easily be removed and do not
have to be put back on again. But as recently as a year ago, the
association would not have said, as LaPierre did Saturday, ``We
support and encourage the distribution, development and use of
safety locks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, law enforcement officials continued to investigate
the shootings. On Friday, the parents of one of the killers, Dylan
Klebold, met for several hours with investigators at their lawyer's
office.
</P>
<P>
   But The Denver Post reported Saturday that the parents of Eric
Harris, the other killer, had said through their lawyer that they
would talk to police only if granted total immunity from
prosecution. Their lawyer, Benjamin Colkitt III, was not reachable
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone, has said that a search
of the Harris house on the evening of the shooting found a
sawed-off shotgun barrel and bomb-making materials fully visible in
Eric's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brown, who reported to police last year that his son,
Brooks, had been threatened by Eric Harris on the Internet,
rejected comments by the sheriff's office that the authorities had
not contacted the Harris and Klebold families because the Browns
had requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is beyond ludicrous,'' Randy Brown told The Denver Rocky
Mountain News. ``We took the complaint to them with the kids'
names. We wanted them to be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them if they could keep our name out of it, act like
they found it on their own, so we didn't have to worry about Eric
killing Brooks,'' Brown said. He added that investigators had never
telephoned to say that they had had problems gaining entry to Eric
Harris' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the angry atmosphere following the shootings, there have been
bomb threats to the hotel where the NRA members met Saturday and
death threats to families of the two suspects. Doug Dean, a state
representative from Colorado Springs, who sponsored a bill this
spring to loosen rules on the granting of permits for concealed
weapons, has said that he has received so many telephone threats
that he may leave politics. Dean, a Republican, is the State House
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a continuing jumpy mood, high school absenteeism
spiked on Friday, fueled by Internet rumors that there would be
trouble on April 30, the 54th anniversary of Hitler's death.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has not been immune to the rash of bomb threats that have
plagued schools around the nation in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Arvada police arrested a 34-year-old woman with a
history of run-ins with school administrators over the treatment of
her son.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Thomas, the Jefferson County district attorney, quoted the
woman, Faye Rae Holt, as saying in a recorded message on Wednesday
on the attendance telephone line for Pomona High School: ``There
goes your students. There goes your school. This is not a joke.''
The bomb threat forced a two-hour evacuation of the school
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, on a hill in Clement Park overlooking Columbine, as
many as 300 people an hour visited memorials to the victims. Last
Tuesday, Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter whose father-in-law was
murdered in 1996, drove here and erected 15 crosses.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday afternoon, Brian Rohrbough, whose son Daniel, a
15-year-old freshman, was murdered in the shootings, uprooted and
carried away two crosses that carried the names of the two killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue of closure, this is an issue of right and
wrong,'' Rohrbough said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 people injured in the shootings, four remained in
hospitals Saturday, two in serious condition and two in fair.
Protests against violence and in sympathy with the victims were to
take place Saturday in 25 countries.

AN ORDINARY SERBIAN MAN IS BURIED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In one of the ordinary epics of everyday
life, they buried Tomislav Mitrovic Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was 60 years old, with a wife, Lila; two daughters, Ivana and
Jelena; a grandson, Kosta; and an informally adopted son, Dejan,
the grown child of his best friend, who had died years before.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovic was a program director for Radio Television Serbia, the
state-run broadcaster that gives the news much as President
Slobodan Milosevic wants it given. Mitrovic was on the overnight
shift on April 22-23, when NATO missiles hit the station to silence
what the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, had called ``as much
a part of Milosevic's murder machine as his military.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovic, known as Tomi, was the 11th body pulled from the
rubble of the station. They found him _ or, more precisely, they
were able to identify him _ on April 29, six days after the
explosion. He was in the control room that night, coordinating
camera positions and tape for the early morning news, roughly where
the missile impacted.
</P>
<P>
   His family knew he was missing; they were simply waiting for the
final, formal notification. Other families still wait, while
investigators continue to sift through the broken masonry. Sixteen
people of the 100 working that night are dead or still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Those who died in the 2:10 a.m. strike were not the editors or
the managers or the creators of the programming that Brussels,
London and Washington find so dangerous _ and which is still on the
air in much of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   They were people like Darko Stoimenovski, 26, a technician who
had helped foreigners transmit their footage; Ksenija Bankovic, 28,
a video mixer; Jelica Munitlak, 27, a make-up artist; Milan
Joksimovic, a 46-year-old security guard, and Tomi Mitrovic.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew the station was a likely target. But the workers
had been told by their editor in chief, Dragoljub Milanovic, who
was not in the building, that for reasons of patriotism and need
they would work their assigned night shifts or they could pick up
their work papers and find another job, losing their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovic, well liked in the way congenial, competent people are
in any technical profession, was a year away from retirement in a
country deformed by years of international sanctions, economic
mismanagement, ethnic hatred and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You retire in a year, and you're told to work or leave now and
lose your pension,'' said another employee of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less than $100 a month, but it's still something. And in
a country broken like this one, you can't afford it. And when
you're 60, no one else is going to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovic was the best man at the wedding of Dejan's father,
which brings with it special responsibilities here. He was the
``kum'' (pronounced koom) of this second family, like a godparent
but more. Dejan's father, Mihajlo, had been a lawyer, a
sophisticated and cosmopolitan man with important connections in
Yugoslavia and big expectations for his son.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitrovic was the salt of the earth, an easygoing man whose
company Dejan's father cherished. And when Dejan wanted to become a
journalist, and his father was horrified, it was Mitrovic who
interceded, again and again, and kept a peace between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started in television in the early '60s as the guy who
delivered the mail,'' Dejan said. ``He had no sons, but there was
this little boy who was the son of his best friend.'' Here, hating
it, Dejan's face slowly collapsed, tears surging from his eyes as
if a pipe had broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked about journalism,'' Dejan finally said, ``my
parents were so embarrassed, but he supported me. He said, `Do what
you care about and the money will come.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Dejan's father died in the hospital in early 1995 after a
long illness, it was Mitrovic who went to identify the body. And it
was Mitrovic who brought the family the wedding ring that he had
carried to the nuptials of his best friend many years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomi loved America,'' Dejan said. ``He built himself an
American house, and everyone joked about it, but they admired it.
He built a ranch house, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. He
saw it somewhere and he liked it, so he built one.''
</P>
<P>
   The living room and dining room are connected; there is a nice
garden and a very un-Serbian lawn: Mitrovic used to cut the grass
short, American-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a wife, two daughters, a grandchild, a couple of cats
and a dog who appeared one day,'' Dejan said. ``He was just one of
the people working there. He had no influence on the programs or on
Milosevic. He just switched the cameras and the programs from
channel to channel. He was a professional. He worked for his
salary. If the political opposition ran the station, he'd work for
them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Dejan used to talk politics, and after 30 years of being
a faithful reader of Politika, then as now the mouthpiece of
whatever regime rules in Belgrade, Mitrovic stopped reading the
paper in the winter of 1996-1997. Then, months of pro-democracy and
anti-Milosevic demonstrations roiled the country, and state
television refused to cover those demonstrations for a month, as if
they did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators called the station ``the Bastille,'' and some
of the windows still covered with plastic, even after NATO's
bombing, were those broken by the stones of democracy's advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the West did nothing then,'' the state television
journalist said. ``They had a chance to push out Milosevic and did
nothing.'' He laughed harshly. ``They certainly didn't bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovic became embarrassed by the station's politics. ``He was
no supporter of Milosevic,'' said Dejan, now 31. ``I had these
debates with him. But you know, older people have this distance.
They have so much to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejan stopped again, busied himself with a cigarette, looking
away. ``He told me, `You know, at this age, what can I do? My whole
life is there. I'm not 20 anymore and single so I could deliver the
milk if I had to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tomislav Mitrovic was mourned by hundreds Saturday at the
Topcider cemetery. He was just one out of the many dead, Albanian
and Serb.
</P>
<P>
   The night the missile hit, said Slobodan Novakovic, speaking
today at the graveside, Mitrovic told his subordinates to go home,
while he remained on duty. ``He showed enormous courage,''
Novakovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an ordinary man but a special man,'' Dejan said, again
in tears. ``He was my father's best friend, and he became my
friend. And he was guilty of nothing.''

SLEEPY HOLLOW AND DEVELOPERS PREPARE FOR LIFE AFTER GM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. _ General Motors is almost done taking apart
the massive plant here where it made 11 million cars. As workers
cart off chunks of steel and long ribbons of aluminum in the shadow
of the Hudson highlands, this village is beginning to feel less
like a factory town and more like a river town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vistas opening up that no one has seen for the last
100 years,'' said Mayor Philip Zegarelli. ``It's like a curtain
rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the communities along the Hudson River in
Westchester County, Sleepy Hollow is in the delicate process of
de-industrialization. Up and down the county's 50 miles of
riverfront, towns are reclaiming land where chemicals were
processed, sugar refined and ovens, carpets and wire made. Towns
are finally turning years, even decades, of talk into action, with
parks, marinas and housing in the works.
</P>
<P>
   For years, factory workers and residents here, along with local
and state officials, fought the closing of the General Motors
plant, which at its peak employed 5,000 people and provided half
the taxes in the village. But when the plant shut three years ago,
the village, in a gesture that signaled the end of an era, changed
its name from North Tarrytown to Sleepy Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, General Motors is reviewing proposals for its property from
three developers, including Donald Trump. The company says it hopes
to select a plan by the fall. All three call for a mix of housing
and commercial space, and under the village's recent rezoning,
there is the potential to create a village within a village _ 1,900
apartments that could nearly double Sleepy Hollow's population of
8,300.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 97-acre parcel is Westchester's largest developable
tract along the Hudson, and is at a point where the Metro North
train tracks are inland, giving the land riverfront access that
provides magnificent views, its transformation is stirring
excitement and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling business owners envision throngs of shoppers.
Residents dream of strolling along a public esplanade at the
Hudson's edge. Village officials look forward to restoring the tax
base. But environmentalists and some of the village's residents say
the plan could choke the village with traffic. And elected
officials are feeling pressure to find just the right balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orientation of the site toward the river is fantastic,''
said Zegarelli. ``By the same token, you want to be careful that
whatever proposals come up don't swamp the village, either. It's
such a huge undertaking _ you really can't blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, construction will not begin for at least a few
years. Once General Motors selects a developer, the plan will be
subject to an environmental-impact study. One hurdle is poor access
to the parcel; only one road, the village's main street, Beekman
Avenue, leads directly to the site from Route 9.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and residents are particularly concerned about
traffic. The mayor believes that rezoning carried out under the
previous administration allows far too many residences, which could
mean traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Others have raised questions about pollution on the property.
Residents remember when you could tell which colors the cars were
being painted by looking at the Hudson. But General Motors
considers this a ``relatively clean site,'' because it was an
assembly plant, said Phyllis Riina, a real estate manager for the
company. Oil contamination was found in the area of the paint shop,
she said, but cleanup work, which entailed removing soil, was
recently completed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the state Department of Environmental Conservation
reviewed the company's records to determine whether the property
should be added to the state's Superfund program for polluted
sites. An agency spokesman, Samuel Thernstrom, said there was ``no
evidence to suggest that hazardous waste had been disposed of on
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are construction difficulties. Part of the site is
landfill, and General Motors expects that builders will have to
drive pilings into the ground to support new structures.
</P>
<P>
   There are marketing challenges as well. The surrounding
neighborhood includes Sleepy Hollow's most modest housing, as
wealthy residents had no interest in living next to a
2.5-million-square-foot factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have some tacky older buildings, and you're going to
see that,'' said Elio De Cecchis, the owner of De Cecchis Realty
here. ``You are certainly going to exclude some people who can't
overcome'' that sight.
</P>
<P>
   Village officials are eager to see the property return fully to
the tax rolls. The Board of Trustees ran out of money in April and
had to borrow $500,000 until the fiscal year ends at the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
   The financial troubles are the result of a long-simmering
dispute with General Motors. The company is relying on an
assessment valuing its property at $12 million, which resulted from
an agreement made with the village before the auto plant closed.
The village is insisting on valuing the land at $44 million, based
on a reappraisal, and officials are not cashing any tax payments
until the matter, which is in court, is settled. Last year, the
dispute forced the village to lay off seven employees, including
two police officers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what development proposals General Motors is
considering. The company will not divulge the names of the
developers, but Trump has said that he is a contender. He is vague
about his plan, saying only that it calls for mostly housing and
shops. (The zoning would also allow a hotel.) As for concerns about
housing density and traffic, Trump said: ``It's a big site. We're
going to come up with a better way to enter the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are skeptical, however. They say traffic is
already a problem. ``You come out here on Beekman Avenue at 3
o'clock, and you can't move,'' said John Masias, 73, who worked at
the GM plant for 32 years. ``Personally, I don't think they should
have any apartments because of the congestion. The town's too
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are worried about tipping the socioeconomic scale toward
the rich, even though Mayor Zegarelli says he will insist that any
development include moderately priced housing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The village now is economically diverse, with large gracious
homes in the verdant Philipse Manor section and plain multifamily
housing downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about gentrification,'' said Stuart Siegel, an
IBM computer scientist who lives in a rental building. ``If Trump's
involved, it could raise the rents on existing apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone, it seems, looks forward to regaining access to the
Hudson River, which broadens out in the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow
to one of its widest points. On a recent overcast day, a lone
Canada goose floated on the river's gray surface by the General
Motors plant, as welders cut through a building facade, sending out
showers of sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a river town,'' said Bruce MacDonald, 42, who was
snapping photographs of the scene. ``But sometimes you don't feel
that.''

 &HT;    Bush's absence in key state rubs voters the wrong way
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Here's John Kasich learning how to mush a
dogsled in Laconia. There's John McCain on the cafe and barber shop
circuit in Portsmouth. On Saturday, Lamar Alexander opened a new
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has been through. Ditto Dan Quayle, Gary Bauer,
Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan. And many of them will be back
tonight for the New Hampshire GOP's grandly named ``Vision for the
New Millennium'' banquet.
</P>
<P>
   But where, some from the Granite State are asking, is George W.
Bush, the front-runner in absentia?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as his rivals speak, some of Bush's influential New
Hampshire backers will be on hand, without a candidate but with a
``Coming Attractions'' display pushing Bush like he is going to be
the feel-good hit of the summer. For now, that _ and sign up party
activiststs _ is about all they can do.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary is nine months away, but activists and
voters here expect candidates to show up early and often. They
always do, a tradition that magnifies Bush's absence.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, Bush probably will have been here enough to make
voters forget his late arrival. For now, however, it's turning off
some folks and turning them toward other presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough about George Bush,'' said Bob Coffey, a
Newmarket business consultant who likes his politics on the
hand-to-hand level. ``I'm not sure he is really wanting to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he'll be here soon, shortly after the Texas
legislative session ends May 31. Not soon enough, Coffey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does get time off. We all get weekends off. All of these
other guys are coming up here on weekends. I don't see why he can't
make a trip up here every once in a while,'' said Coffey, who had
Kasich at his home two weeks ago and is leaning toward backing the
House member from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Bedford, state Rep. Kathleen Flora is getting similar
bad vibes about Bush. She has given up on him. Later this month,
she'll participate in a news conference featuring state and party
leaders backing McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decision she reached after taking close looks at McCain,
Alexander, Dole and Quayle. Bush, out of sight, was out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not paid attention to George W. Bush,'' said Flora,
``and the reason for that is he has not been here and has not made
himself known. I didn't feel like he was all that interested in the
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not impressed with Bush's line about having work to do in
his current job before looking for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have come up on the weekends,'' she said. ``I think
he has just absolutely been invisible. ... I haven't heard what he
stands for, and I haven't seen what he has done, and I haven't seen
the interest that he supposedly has for winning the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the undercurrent of dissatisfaction about Bush's
absence, he is well-armed to get a full-blown campaign up and
running as soon as he is ready. He has far more money than the
other candidates (save perhaps for the self-financed Forbes), and
his organization here boasts the top names. Sen. Judd Gregg, owner
and operator of the state's best GOP network, is a Bush
co-chairman, as is former Gov. Steve Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg scoffs at the notion that Bush's late arrival could become
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to him has been very strong and hasn't been
tempered in any way by the fact that he said he can't get to New
Hampshire until the Legislature is out,'' he said. ``I've told
people he will be here with enthusiasm and with energy, pursuing a
very hands-on, I'm-here, ask-me-your-questions campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush charm, money and machinery will kick in to bolster poll
numbers that already put him atop the field here. A Franklin Pierce
College poll conducted April 22-27 for WNDS-TV of Derry, N.H.,
showed Bush with a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, slowly but surely giving up the guise of a guy who is
merely thinking about running, began papering New Hampshire last
year with ``keep your powder dry'' letters to folks with
long-standing ties to his family.
</P>
<P>
   His only face time in a state whose voters crave it came April 8
in a live interview on Manchester's WMUR-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to come up to New Hampshire and begin a grass-roots
campaign,'' he said. ``I understand that New Hampshire is retail
politics, and I look forward to coming up there to shake as many
hands as I can, look people in the eye and tell them where my heart
is.''
</P>
<P>
   That will begin June 14 in Manchester, where Bush will be the
featured speaker at the New Hampshire Federation of Republican
Women's annual Lilac Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   And when he gets here, the game will change for the others who
have been here for months and, in some cases, years. The goal is to
emerge as the candidate who can move to the head of the class if
the frontrunner stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race to be the anti-Bush,'' a top Alexander strategist
said Saturday as the ex-Tennessee governor headed door to door.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Russell, who quit as assistant state GOP chair to sign
on with the Bush team here, knows her guy is running ahead, but
also knows there is some crankiness about his late arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are candidates in on a weekly basis. Some days you see
several,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Russell spun Bush's absence as a source of anticipation, not
frustration. ``There is a lot of excitement about being able to see
him and hear him and ask him questions. Up here, we like to see and
touch and interact,'' she said. ``Many people have signed on. Many
more are very anxious to take him for a test drive.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes Bush's friendly style will play well with New
Hampshire voters, once he gets there. She also thinks Bush is
scoring points by sticking to his commitment to make the Texas
Legislature his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proves he is a man of his word, loyal to the voters of
Texas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton County GOP Chairwoman Nancy Merrill admires that but
didn't let it stop her from signing on elsewhere. She couldn't wait
for Bush to get here. She has signed on with McCain, who has been
here several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing Senator McCain helped me to make my decision,''
Merrill said. ``I always liked his record, and something happens in
New Hampshire that's wonderful when you can listen to the
candidates, not just sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of the other candidate may have been a factor to
me,'' she said of Bush, adding, however, ``I know a good many
voters up here are solid Bush supporters even though he hasn't been
here yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers such as Russell understand the value of being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen Forbes help someone on with their coat. I have
seen Alexander move very easily and graciously through crowds.
Kasich moves through a crowd with a little more animation. He
connects in a different way with people. Elizabeth Dole, with her
warm smile and Southern accent, just charms people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers
</P>
<P>
   Being here also shows you care, according to McCain backer Nancy
Merrill, who thinks June may be a little late for Bush's debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a sense that he doesn't think New
Hampshire is important. I just think there is probably a little
frustration that he hasn't been here so people could actually hear
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The others have been heard, some for years. Buchanan is making
his third race here. Alexander holds an annual summer lobster bake
that has grown into one of the state's biggest events (1,300
lobsters in 1997, 2,500 in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   After his Saturday door-to-door tour, Alexander said he knows
many New Hampshire voters are months away from picking a favorite.
But he is sure he is scoring points with his frequent visits.
</P>
<P>
   What's the peril for a candidate not due here until June 14?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're about to find that out,'' said Alexander. ``The
peril is you might not be seen as ready to be president. I think
people like to size you up and chew you over. ... It's one thing to
be a governor. Going from being governor to being president is like
going from the playground to the NBA finals, and the people of New
Hampshire know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes spent $5 million on TV ads. Dole is well-known
from her husband's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a familiar name, if not face, from his father's
campaigns. But the most recent one, 1992, is a fading memory to
many folks.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers in the field have worked to keep their names in
the papers in recent weeks. McCain showed up to chat with the
breakfast crowd at Cafe Brioche in Portsmouth and shake hands at
John's Barber Shop and the Federal Cigar newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of campaigning that counts here, according to
Kasich, who talked about the hands-on factor after his klatch at
the Coffey house last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You let people poke you and look you in the eyes and smell you
and find out whether they like you or not,'' he told local
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich was back again this weekend as part of his grand, but
simple, plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strategy is to come here and bug them about every weekend,
which I've been doing about every weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that he is approaching saturation. The first
question after his Friday night speech came from a local reporter
who showed up a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything new?'' the scribe inquired.
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates get voter and media review when they come
through, including the scrutiny of the conservative and influential
Manchester Union-Leader, which backed Buchanan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Governor Bush has the name and the
bankroll,'' editor-in-chief Joseph McQuaid wrote recently. ``But he
won't be making his first New Hampshire campaign appearance until
June, at which time New Hampshire voters will be able to begin
comparing and contrasting him with many other candidates.''

CONGRESS MULLS PRICING PLAN FOR NORTHEAST MILK PRODUCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a fight pitting farmers' incomes against
consumers' pocketbooks, Congress has begun a fierce debate over
legislation that would allow dairy farmers in New York, New Jersey
and other states to charge more for milk.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would enable New York and New Jersey _ as well as
Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania _ to join the six New England
states in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a two-year-old
federally sanctioned cartel that sets a minimum wholesale price for
milk sold in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would also authorize Southern states to
create their own compact, would almost certainly raise prices at
the cash register by a few pennies a gallon, and perhaps much more.
</P>
<P>
   With 157 sponsors in the House and 39 sponsors in the Senate,
the bill is well on its way to winning the 218 House votes and 51
Senate votes it needs for passage.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and businesses that process milk have led a
vigorous lobbying campaign against the measure, contending that it
would hurt the elderly and the poor. Anti-tax groups have also
opposed the bill, saying it would have the effect of imposing a
milk tax on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, environmentalists have joined farmers in
asserting that the measure would help small dairy farmers stay in
business, keep the region's milk supply steady and prevent the sale
and development of pasture land. And Southern conservatives have
locked arms with Northern liberals in supporting the bill, saying
that, for the dairy industry at least, government regulation might
be OK after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government already sets minimum prices for fluid
milk,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is a lead sponsor of
the bill. ``I just want to improve the regulatory system.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is immensely important to farmers like Tom A. Borden,
a part owner of O.A. Borden &AMP; Sons Farms in Washington County,
N.Y., 30 miles north of Albany. A sixth-generation dairy farmer who
is distantly related to the founders of Borden Foods Corp., Borden,
44, said the legislation would increase his annual income by
several thousand dollars, enough to cover part of his property
taxes and equipment costs. Most important, he said, it would ease
his anxieties about the roller-coaster milk market by guaranteeing
a minimum level of revenue from his 160-cow herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes us healthier will make it more appealing
for the next generation to take on the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Augustine Carson, 74, a retired postal worker from Harlem
who tries to drink a quart of milk each day to combat her
arthritis, said she feared that the legislation could end up
squeezing her already tight budget. ``If I had to pay more for
milk, I'd have to cut down on other things,'' Ms. Carson said. ``I
know farmers work hard and have to make a little more money, but
can't it come from some other source?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on Capitol Hill will be strongly colored by regional
alliances, as the South and Northeast unite against the Midwest,
and possibly the West, where farmers contend that dairy compacts
will hurt their sales. Some urban legislators, including those from
New York City, are also expected to oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly significant to New York state, the
nation's third largest milk producer. Under immense pressure from
the state's 8,300 dairy farmers _ down from 14,200 a decade ago _
Gov. George Pataki pushed a measure endorsing the compact through
the Legislature last year by tying it to a pay increase for the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the state's senators, Charles Schumer and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, both Democrats, support the federal bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow New York, New Jersey and Maryland _ whose
legislatures have endorsed the compact _ to join the Northeast
compact immediately. Delaware and Pennsylvania could also join once
their legislatures approve it. And it would make the Northeast
compact permanent. Because the system was controversial, the
compact was devised as a test and is scheduled to go out of
business Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Southern states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia,
would also be authorized to create a separate regional compact.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has been regulating the milk market since
the Great Depression, and continues to set wholesale prices for
drinking milk in most regions. It does not set prices for milk used
for cheese, ice cream and other dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has been scaling back price supports since
the 1980s, causing wholesale prices to fluctuate more. In April,
for instance, the price paid to farmers for drinking milk in New
York plummeted to 99 cents per gallon from a record high of $1.50,
which would cause the average farmer's monthly revenue to drop by
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say that such wild changes have made it difficult to
plan or get bank loans. They also say that declining consumption,
coupled with increased productivity, have kept milk prices
relatively low. The compact is intended to address both problems by
setting prices that are steadier, and generally higher, than the
federal price.
</P>
<P>
   Under compact rules, farmers receive the higher of the two
prices. When the federal price goes above the compact price, as it
did happen late last year, the compact price goes out of effect,
until the Federal price is the lower one. The compact price is set
by a 26-member commission appointed by the governors of the six New
England states.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case on Capitol Hill, the debate has featured a
battle of worst case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend that in states that join the Northeast
compact, milk prices will rise by 20 cents to 40 cents per gallon.
Higher prices, they say, will reduce sales, causing even more small
farms to go out of business. The real beneficiaries from the
arrangement, they maintain, are large farms, which would receive
most of the additional revenue from higher prices. Such critics say
the government should try to emphasize benefits for small farmers
by using tax cuts or aid programs that could reduce their utility
bills, property taxes and feed costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am all for helping small farmers in our state, but this
appears to be just helping big producers,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, a Democrat representing Manhattan and Queens who said she
is likely to vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that the Northeast compact has raised retail
prices only a few cents a gallon and that increases above that have
resulted from market forces. While the compact may require milk
processors to pay more for milk, those increases will not
necessarily be passed on to consumers, they say. And they assert
that without the compact, small farms will continue to fail,
causing supplies to decline and prices to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this, many small farmers will go out of
business and then milk production will be in the hands of a few,''
said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica who is pushing
for the legislation. ``And then you'll really see prices go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also note that the Northeast compact has exempted
school lunch programs and the Women, Infants and Children nutrition
program for low-income families from paying the higher milk price.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy economists say both sides have been guilty of
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Several economists say the Northeast compact has had a smaller
effect on prices than the critics had predicted. Although prices in
the six New England states rose sharply in the first month of the
compact, July 1997, they fell back slightly and then leveled off.
In Massachusetts, for instance, retail prices jumped by 30 cents a
gallon, to $2.89 in July 1997, but fell to $2.69 a month later, and
remained near that level for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It achieved what it was supposed to do, which is to provide
some price stability,'' said Bob Cropp, an economist with the
University of Wisconsin. He estimated that the compact had
increased retail milk prices by about 10 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also questioned the central premise of the bill's
supporters: that compacts will help small farms avoid being bought
out by larger ones. ``This does precious little to prevent the
structural change that is going on in the dairy industry,'' said
Andrew Novakovic, director of Cornell University's dairy markets
and policy program.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers say the legislation, while far from ideal, is the
best thing available. And, they say, they need it urgently. ``We
can't shut the cows off and wait till next year,'' said Eric Ooms,
a dairy farmer in Columbia County, N.Y.  &QL;

INMATE   WINS LAWSUIT FOR $100,000 IN RETALIATION CASE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An inmate who claimed that he had been harassed and
discriminated against because he complained about corruption at
Sing Sing state prison has been awarded $100,000 in damages by a
federal jury.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Ronald Maurer, 49, filed a handwritten lawsuit three
years ago in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, claiming that he had
been improperly disciplined and placed in segregated housing
because he alleged that a high-ranking correction officer was
discarding inmates' grievances.
</P>
<P>
   The jury award, handed down Wednesday, was believed to be one of
the largest in which a prisoner charged systematic retaliation,
said David Marriott, an associate at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore, the
firm that took over the case last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer was first incarcerated in 1990 at the prison in Ossining,
N.Y., for first-degree robbery of $100 from a Westchester
convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott described his client as a model inmate who was
college-educated and a devout Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer had an unblemished disciplinary record for five years and
was housed in the less restrictive honor block. He became active on
the Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee, according to the
lawsuit. In May 1995, he filed a grievance alleging that a sergeant
on the committee was throwing away copies of prisoners' grievances.
Marriott said that he was then written up for a spate of false
violations.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, he was accused of trying to organize a strike
against double-bunking, a practice in which two inmates are housed
in a cell intended for one. The lawsuit claimed that the defendant,
Lt. Robert Patterson, had concocted the charge, held a hearing and
then orchestrated discipline against the inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer was then sent to an isolated housing unit known as ``the
box,'' where he served 210 days, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   A superintendent at the prison later exonerated Maurer, who was
transferred to Attica state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson could not be reached for comment Saturday. Court
records show that his lawyer, Nancy Lynn Eisenstadt, an assistant
attorney general, argued that he knew nothing of Maurer's
accusations that inmates' grievances were being discarded, and
therefore could not have been retaliating for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury found that the lieutenant had violated Maurer's
constitutional rights. It decided that Maurer should receive
$25,000 for suffering and $75,000 in punitive damages. The state
plans to seek a new trial, Marriott said.

STADIUM LOST: HOW ROWLAND'S BIGGEST COUP BECAME HIS WORST DEFEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ When the owner of the New England Patriots
flew to Hartford to visit his sweetheart deal for the last time on
Thursday, he did what he had always done, according to Connecticut
officials: He asked for something more.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Robert K. Kraft, wanted 30 more days to decide
whether to honor his pledge to move the Patriots to Hartford. He
had until Sunday to withdraw from the deal without a penalty _ an
escape hatch his lawyers had insisted on inserting into the
229-page contract. After that date, he could be liable for damages
of as much as $100 million to Connecticut, which had agreed to
build him a free stadium in return for a 30-year lease, larding the
deal with extras and guarantees that made the deal the richest in
the history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, who had been bleeding politically ever
since Massachusetts business and political leaders agreed Tuesday
on a package of subsidies to keep the football team in Foxboro, had
had enough. He refused the extension three or four times over the
course of a tense four-hour meeting in the Capitol, according to
aides who were in the room, and said that if Kraft did not renounce
the Massachusetts overture, Connecticut would kill its stadium
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get back to us by 5 o'clock tomorrow,'' Rowland said,
according to his aides. ``You owe us at least that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You give me till tomorrow night, I'll give you an answer,''
Kraft replied, according to a Patriots executive. With a dozen TV
cameras waiting outside the office, the men began drafting a vague
statement about the meeting. According to the Connecticut camp,
Kraft then said, ``You mean we're not going to get an extension?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor just glowered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final insult in a quick hitch that had gone bad
almost immediately after that triumphant day in November, when
Kraft told Rowland at the packed announcement ceremony, ``You're in
the red zone, and we're giving you the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal's undoing seems sure to fuel the arguments of those who
have preached caution for cities and states as bidding wars for
sports franchises have escalated, and threatens the political
future of Rowland, a moderate Republican who has been mentioned as
vice-presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   At a funereal news conference Friday night, Rowland tried to
make sport of the damage to his image, saying, ``I'm not sure I had
that much of a national reputation to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft beat the governor's deadline by less than an hour,
announcing late Friday afternoon that he was killing the deal with
Connecticut because he could not be assured that the stadium, which
was to be built on a riverside site with a host of environmental
problems, would be ready for play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland thought he had had the upper hand. But instead, he was
about to suffer the biggest embarrassment of his governorship.
Supporters contend that he should have started saying no to Kraft a
long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, a Patriots executive said Kraft was
sorry to have hurt Rowland and admired his courage. But the
executive said the state shared the blame. While the team insisted
on having the stadium ready for play in 2002, Rowland could promise
only his best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bargained for a deal, and the deal couldn't happen,'' the
executive said. ``That's life in the big city. We did negotiate a
hell of a deal, but the overriding thing for us was being settled
in a new football stadium by 2002 so we could compete in the
National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Patriots executive, Rowland said at one point,
``You're telling me that for one year you'll walk from a billion
dollars? I just don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said, ``He just didn't know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the team is back where it started, with an outmoded stadium
that Jonathan Kraft, the owner's son and a team vice president, has
described as an overgrown high school football field. Massachusetts
officials say they plan to court the Krafts aggressively between
now and May 25, the date of a National Football League meeting,
when team owners are scheduled to debate the Patriots' relocation
options.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts offer was brokered by executives of the NFL,
who wanted to keep a team in the Boston television market. But in
an interview Friday night, an executive close to Robert Kraft
dismissed the Massachusetts package with an expletive, so the terms
of any new Foxboro deal are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What is much more certain, according to Democratic and
Republican politicians, is that Rowland, who at 41 is the nation's
youngest governor, will need fancy footwork to recover politically
from having exposed his city and state to such a crippling setback
in morale.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders in Hartford said that financing for any
downtown redevelopment would be much more difficult to get now that
the centerpiece of the city's hopes is gone. The many Connecticut
legislators who signed onto the stadium deal can now be expected to
bring much harsher scrutiny to any proposal from the governor. The
demonization of Kraft in the Connecticut media began immediately
Friday night, with one television station illustrating its stadium
story with a full-screen image of a donkey with Kraft's head pasted
on.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of The Hartford Courant Saturday, which had the
headline ``Dear John . . .,'' included a column called ``They
Burned Us, The Dirty Rats,'' which called the pullout ``the most
withering and subversive attack by a major sports league on a
single city in American history,'' and described Kraft as ``no
better than a common tenement rat.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has vowed to sue Kraft, asserting that he colluded in
the Massachusetts negotiations, which was barred by his contract
with Connecticut. A Patriots official said Kraft played no role in
the talks with Massachusetts. Rowland said the state would also sue
the NFL, alleging that it undermined Connecticut's contract with
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuits may deflect some of the heat, Rowland has one
major problem. His dealings with the Patriots were littered with
warning signs that the team might pull out. The governor himself
said in frustration at Thursday's meeting, according to his aides:
``You have nothing in this game. The risk is all ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set when Kraft and Rowland were originally
negotiating the deal. The team asked the state to guarantee that
all 66,000 seats in the $375 million stadium would be sold. He did
not quite get that, but the state agreed to pay for enough seats to
insure him a perpetual profit, the element of the deal that made it
the most lucrative in sports. With the free stadium in hand,
according to both sides, Kraft then asked for a free practice
center. He did not quite get that, but the state threw in a $15
million subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, according to Rowland's aides, the Patriots faxed
a statement to the state demanding that the team be absolved from
any lawsuit over the Massachusetts negotiations, even though no
accusation had been made. The governor scheduled the Thursday
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Rowland wanted the team to refuse the Massachusetts
deal, Kraft wanted to be reassured that the stadium would be ready
by 2002. That date already represented a delay in the state's
original promise, which had been silk-screened along with Patriots
logos on T-shirts legislators held up as they approved the deal:
``Connecticut 2001: A Football Odyssey.''

REFUGEES RESIST MOVING FROM UNSAFE BORDER TOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ About 100,000 Kosovo refugees remain in this
crumbling border city, and the local authorities, fearing Serb
attack, are intent on forcing them to move on to safer areas in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   But most are reluctant to leave, especially to go to places that
could be worse than Kukes, a battered city normally of 20,000 that
is straining under the crush of so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies, which encourage but do not force refugees to
move from unsafe border areas, have been stuck in the middle. But
during the last week they tried a new tack _ taking refugee leaders
to visit safer regions so they could see conditions there for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that they would report back to the refugees and
encourage them to move voluntarily before the local authorities
force them out.
</P>
<P>
   That would clear the city and make room for additional refugees,
who continue to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the first visit by refugee leaders to another
site were not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, they were mobbed by refugees who feared the
future and craved information. At one camp, the leaders described
conditions in and around Peshkopi, a five-hour drive from here on
bad roads where 3,000 refugees could be resettled in public
buildings and with host families.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders had trouble persuading anyone to move. The refugees
did not like the idea that no more than six people could be settled
in each house, because that would break up the families of many
Albanians from Kosovo where families of 10 are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees did not like being moved away from doctors and food
readily available in the tent camp where they have been living for
a month. They could not obtain assurances that host families would
not demand rent. Many refugees have no money, because they were
robbed by Serb forces before they crossed the border from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And most of all, they found insufferable the idea of being
forced to move once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move here, and then they force us to move there, as though
we were rabbits being hunted by a dog,'' said Mehmet Dervishi, 58,
who comes from Kosterc.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks he and his family have been living in a tent
provided by Greece. ``They will have to send the army to take us
out of here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is trying to find a
middle ground that will satisfy local authorities but will also
protect the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Concern for their safety has grown since Serb rockets exploded
just outside Kukes two weeks ago. The rockets were presumably aimed
at a camp of the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, which recently
opened an office here and is openly meeting Western journalists,
dropping any pretense of not having a presence in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials also say they believe that when NATO orders the
Apache anti-tank helicopters in Albania into combat against Serb
forces, an advance base will be established near here or that the
helicopters will travel through this corridor, drawing Serb fire
that could fall on Kukes, 10 miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Buses have been available for weeks to take refugees to other
regions. But they often they sit half-empty, waiting for enough
refugees to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Salih Kajtazi, 70, fears that in some distant place away from
the relief agencies, he will be forced to pay for food or shelter,
and he does not have any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who had money have already left,'' Kajtazi said. ``Those
without money are here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United Nations, Jacques Franquin, said local
authorities were applying intense pressure on refugees to move and
were ready to use local laws to force them to leave, though they
had agreed to wait a short while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got them to agree to delay the process until the assessment
visits by refugee leaders are complete,'' Franquin said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaip Hajdari, 37, was one of those who went on the first
inspection. He came back and told other refugees that conditions at
Peshkopi were much better than in Kukes. He said refugees who found
a vacant house or apartment there would receive about $1 a person
per day, as well as meals and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   He said that those who stayed with host families, as a majority
would be expected to do, would not receive stipends. Instead, the
host families would receive allotments of food and other supplies
to be shared with the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go because I have a tractor and also a very large
family that could not be accommodated,'' Hajdari told the refugees
after returning. ``But I think you should go.''
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion was rejected when he told the refugees that
authorities had taken him to places where refugees were already
living _ in a warehouse, an old hotel and a gymnasium _ but not to
places where new refugees would be sent.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd standing in the mud was unconvinced that they should
leave. ``If I have to,'' Dervishi said, ``I will go up to the
mountains and eat grass. But I won't leave here for that place.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia said Saturday that he would free three captive American
soldiers on Sunday after a lobbying effort by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who urged NATO to reciprocate by immediately halting
further airstrikes and opening negotiations on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Complete details about the transfer of the soldiers were still
being worked out, according to Yugoslav officials. But Jackson said
it was likely that the three soldiers would be taken by car or bus
from Belgrade to the Croatian border early Sunday, a trip of about
an hour and a half, and then flown by U.S. military aircraft to an
air base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracles do happen,'' said the Rev. Joan Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches and part of the
19-member interfaith delegation that joined Jackson in the appeal.
``Jesse Jackson made a very powerful and profound case about what
this would really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who organized the trip to Belgrade despite attempts by
senior Clinton administration officials to dissuade him, said he
believed that Milosevic was ready to talk seriously about how to
meet NATO's basic demands for an end to Yugoslav violence against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and for the deployment of an armed
international peacekeeping force in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would take a letter from the Yugoslav president,
expressing this willingness to negotiate, back to Washington to
give to President Clinton, but he stressed to Milosevic that his
delegation had no authority to negotiate or make promises about
NATO's reaction to the release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said,
``We have now seen the comments from Rev. Jackson and his
delegation, and obviously we welcome the soldiers' release.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spoke briefly by telephone on Friday to Sandy Berger,
the White House national security adviser, and called again
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to travel to Europe later this week, and may
meet the released prisoners there. But White House officials were
wary of responding to their release until it actually occurs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not immediately react to Jackson's
suggestion that NATO suspend airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged NATO to show good faith by halting, at least for
the moment, the continuous bombing raids over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there will a bombing halt,'' he added, noting that the
three soldiers remain in the hands of the Yugoslav military, in a
military building. ``How ironic it would be, how tragic, if now as
they are ready to come home, they would be hit tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers _ Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.,
and Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas _ were captured
on March 31 while on patrol along the border between Kosovo and
Macedonia. The Yugoslav authorities have maintained that they were
inside Yugoslavia when they were seized.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers have been kept in isolation and received their
first visits from outsiders only last week, first from
representatives of the International Red Cross and on Friday from
Jackson, congressman Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., and two journalists.
</P>
<P>
   News of the impending release came after Jackson and three of
his companions met for more than two hours Saturday with Milosevic
in a session that participants described as alternately bombastic
and warm, encouraging and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, accompanied by three of the religious leaders who
traveled with him to Belgrade, said he had repeatedly urged
Milosevic at the meeting to move beyond a recitation of Yugoslav
grievances over the NATO bombing and to free the soldiers as ``a
bold diplomatic move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia wants the three Americans to be seen as the moral
equivalent of those killed in the bombings,'' Jackson said after
returning to his hotel from his meeting at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a softening of Yugoslav attitudes came immediately.
Nine of the clergy were permitted to meet with the three soldiers
without the presence of the Yugoslav army officers who monitored
the interviews on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the men were relaxed and smiling, but were worried
about having their hopes for release raised.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the three servicemen, the American leaders were
called to the office of the Yugoslav foreign minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down, and there was the tea and the coffee and all
that,'' Campbell said. ``Then he just brings out this sheet of
paper and says, `It is my pleasure to tell you that the request you
made to President Milosevic' _ and then he took this very deep
breath _ `well, it has been decided that the prisoners will be
released to you and Rev. Jackson.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has ended nearly every official meeting here by
gently commanding Yugoslav officials to join hands in prayer, spent
about half an hour alone with Milosevic, in an office and then in
the shade of the palace garden.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, when he was out of earshot of both his own and
the president's companions, he said he appealed to Milosevic as a
politician who might gain by making an unexpected and perhaps
unreciprocated gesture. ``We chose to meet in a room for about 30
minutes to get into details as raw as we could about the advantages
of taking the risk for peace,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in all their public meetings in Belgrade _ with Patriarch
Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church, with government officials and
with representatives of other Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups _
the American clergy have heard no criticism of Milosevic and only
the faintest acknowledgment of Kosovo refugees' accounts of rape,
killing and forcible expulsion at the hands of Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have heard a blanket condemnation of the NATO
bombing operation and found that their arguments received no
coverage in the Belgrade media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, it was Milosevic talking,'' said Nazir Uddin
Khaja, president of the board of the American Muslim Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the great lie _ you repeat it so long you believe
it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Khaja, an internist from Los Angeles who made the journey to
Belgrade over the objections of many in his organization, said he
thought long and hard about whether he wanted to be one of the
group's emissaries to the meeting with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd have to shake his hands, and I was thinking about
how blood-soaked his hands are,'' he said. ``But I felt, especially
as an American Muslim, we have to be present on the platforms for
peace, for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the meeting, the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky,
said Milosevic appeared to take seriously the group's warning that
NATO and the United States are committed to a prolonged bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did make the point that the military logic is inexorable,''
said Kishkovsky, the ecumenical officer of the Russian Orthodox
Church in America. ``And there, I believe, there was strong
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Milosevic appeared to understand that the Jackson
delegation was not a signal of a change in NATO or U.S. policy. ``I
think he was astutely reading it, that we are here on our own, not
discouraged or encouraged by our government, but nevertheless not
hostile to our government,'' Kishkovsky said. Families of the
prisoners were excited but cautious at the news Saturday. Tricia
Stone, the wife of Sgt. Stone, plans to fly to Germany to meet her
husband if he is released. ``She is praying, and she is hopeful,
and she is packed and ready to go in case it is,'' said her
stepmother, Lisa McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We want to believe it. We'll know it's true when we
hear it from the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles home of Andrew Ramirez's father, the fence
was bedecked with three American flags, about two dozen yellow
ribbons and some yellow silk roses.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carcano, 42, a cousin, said over the fence, ``We've
always been hopeful that all three of the guys would be released,
but until it's official, until we actually see it, we're not going
to get too excited.''

 &HT;    Jordan's comeback may be with ownership
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few days after Christmas 1996, as Michael Jordan sat
in the visitors' locker room at the Omni before the Chicago Bulls
played the Hawks, he was asked about buying an NBA franchise
someday. He frowned. Jordan the businessman has built a vast
portfolio that includes car dealerships, restaurants and golf and
sneaker companies. The notion of owning a team in the league he
dominated and raised to unprecedented heights, however, did not
appeal to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Jordan said then. ``I have better things to do with
my money. I don't need the headaches of dealing with players who
want money before proving themselves. Nah, no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, there was a way. Barring some surprise that Jordan
and his representatives find unworkable, the retired legend soon
will become the only African-American to become co-owner or
majority owner of an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time coming,'' said Buck Williams, former NBA
player and Players Association president. ``It's much needed in a
predominantly black league.''
</P>
<P>
   Even back when he proclaimed no interest in purchasing a team,
Jordan did acknowledge that something was wrong with a league made
up of about 80 percent African-American players but no owners.
``That's something that should be addressed,'' he said then. ``No
doubt about it. It's a serious issue. I will support anyone who
wants to try to be the first, any way I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Jordan has said little publicly about his interest in
the Hornets, what happened to change his position is unknown. He
said in a recent statement that he would be ``fulfilling a personal
and business challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, as he did in becoming the most prolific player in
NBA history, Jordan is primed for a historical and unprecedented
move that would bolster a league in need of his presence in any
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the things that Michael has done for the NBA, that
would be a fitting scenario for him now,'' said Eddie Johnson, a
longtime NBA player now with Houston. ``I knew he would not be able
to stay retired from basketball. He would have to come back some
way or another, just as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird have done.
This would be an excellent way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would pay about $80 million for half of the Hornets, a
team that has been in turmoil under George Shinn, the current
majority owner who may bow out of an active role. Shinn's
tight-fisted spending has hurt the roster, and a pending sexual
assault lawsuit and a messy divorce have hurt his image. A
Jordan-Shinn partnership would be strange in that sense. While
Shinn is beset by publicized personal problems, Jordan works
diligently on keeping a clean image.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern, eager to have Shinn removed from
control and to make his sport the only one with at team that is 50
percent-owned by an African-American, planted the idea of Jordan
hooking up with the Hornets. Jordan's ownership almost certainly
would create financial resources for a new arena in Charlotte. Its
12-year-old facility soon will be the league's oldest without
undergoing recent renovation, and it has just 12 luxury boxes and
no club seating.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond Charlotte, Jordan's involvement could generate
interest from other African-Americans _ particularly former players
_ to step into an owner's role. ``Owning an NBA team,'' Stern said,
``is a good means for former players who've made a lot of money to
go into business together in a business they know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern has been pushing for minority involvement in team
ownership for three decades, ever since he was a lawyer in the
NBA's front office. In 1989, he put African-American businessmen
Peter Bynoe and Bertram Lee together with owners of the Denver
Nuggets. The two bought the Nuggets but a year later had to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Lee apparently was more flash than cash and even got evicted
from a downtown Denver apartment he rented. ``They were not as
economically strong a group as I thought,'' Stern said. ``And that
might not be fair to Peter. But he did sell for a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ex-players Magic Johnson (Los Angeles Lakers) and
Isiah Thomas (Toronto) bought parts of franchises, although Thomas
has since sold his 8 percent share and Johnson retains only 5
percent. Actor Bill Cosby has a 3 percent share of the New Jersey
Nets. None has had final say on personnel decisions, as Jordan
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more black owners, and there has never been one of
real significance yet,'' said Charles Barkley, Houston forward and
Jordan's friend. ``We need more black coaches, too. Black coaches
are like UFOs. You have sightings of them every now and then. Black
owners are even more rare. There have been other blacks to try to
own an NBA team, but they didn't have enough money to stick with
it. Michael would break that cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of black ownership has been a matter of money more than
of race, Stern says. ``I think there should be minority ownership
in the NBA _ and I've been pitching it for 30 years _ for every
origin, color and gender,'' Stern said. ``I don't believe there are
any barriers except for putting up the money. This is about
capitalism, not race.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the price tags are high. A team like the Hornets, who
entered the league in 1992 for $32.5 million, is valued now at $160
million. Not many people have that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has any minority gained at least a half-share of an NFL
or major-league baseball team, though four blacks and one Hispanic
own portions of a baseball franchise. Bob Johnson, president and
CEO of Black Entertainment Television, is wealthy enough, and he's
interested in becoming an NBA owner. The problem for him is finding
a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then it's the matter of, even if you had the money, do the
owners want you in the league?'' Johnson said. ``Michael Jordan
will be accepted by any league, so he clears that hurdle. It's a
challenge for African-Americans, but there are very few who can
afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Johnson has been chasing a franchise everywhere,'' Stern
said. ``Bob's a value-purchaser. He's worked very hard and is quite
successful. But he will not overspend for an NBA franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's about what it comes down to now. ``The time to get
into ownership for African-Americans was when the league was first
created,'' Johnson said. ``As the league grew, we were left out of
the equation, weren't able to be serious players. And it continues
to be difficult, with the appreciation of the teams.'' Before Magic
Johnson bought a small piece of the Lakers, he was interested in
the Minnesota Timberwolves, up for sale in 1994. He called on
Minneapolis record-producing stars Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and
singing sensation Janet Jackson to form a bid team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural fit for Jimmy and Terry,'' Johnson said.
``They're from there and they love the NBA. For me and Janet, it
would have been business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jam welcomed the idea. ``Actually, the owners at the time
contacted us,'' he said. ``And we were interested, because we love
basketball and we didn't want the Timberwolves to be moved, which
is what was being talked about. ``
</P>
<P>
   The real motivation, Jam acknowledged, was ownership of the
arena to tie into his music business. The deal fell through when
the parties could not agree on a price and Magic Johnson got an
irresistible offer from Lakers owner Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never a dream of ours to be NBA owners,'' Jam said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the players union would disagree, Stern points out that
owning an NBA team is not an automatic money-maker. He said some
owners would rather have skipped this entire season and cut their
losses than play under the old collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the numbers,'' Jam said, ``and owning an NBA team
is tough to make money. But if you own the arena, then you have the
suites, the naming rights and 160 open dates. If you take advantage
of that, then the arena is being used and it's a viable thing. If
not . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``See, in the African-American communities, there's not a Paul
Allen (of the Portland Trail Blazers) who can go and build an arena
and buy a team out of his pocket. Having that team and that arena
doesn't affect anything he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' Jam said, ``it has to be about putting 10 people
together to make it happen. So, in that regard, I think the void of
African-American ownership is economics more than race-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan left the league as no one has before _ winning his final
game on a last-second jumper in the NBA Finals. Many people thought
he would not be able to resist one more run as a player. But he
has, and he's on the verge of becoming linked with the league
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like with Magic, Bird or myself, I think Jordan should
always have a connection to the NBA,'' Isiah Thomas said. ``It just
makes sense, business-wise, and in other ways. For Jordan to have
no connection to the league would be a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan chose the Hornets because of his strong allegiance to
North Carolina, his home state, and because of Shinn's willingness
to sell. He could have purchased a small piece of the Bulls, the
team he led to six NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he would make a good owner,'' Bulls owner Jerry
Reinsdorf said. ``He is good at everything he does. Michael is very
bright and has very good insight into things that he focuses on. So
I'm sure he would be a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once asked Michael if he thought that when he had finished
playing he would want to be part of (the Bulls') ownership group,''
Reinsdorf said. ``That wasn't an offer. I asked him if he'd like to
be. He said no. He said that he didn't think that he would enjoy
being an owner because he thought that he would not be tolerant of
players. And that was it. It was a 30-second conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who made an estimated $45 million annually from
off-the-court activities while he was playing, conducted a much
longer meeting at his New York restaurant last month with Charlotte
lawyer John Fennebresque. Fennebresque, who heads the city's arena
committee, left impressed by Jordan's acumen, interest and
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that his involvement would make (a new arena) a lot
more likely,'' Fennebresque said. ``I said, 'We need money and we
need your stature.' He is very interested. He loves North Carolina.
He wouldn't move here, but he would spend a significant amount of
time here. He wants to be very involved in the management of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan in the wings, the Hornets have made a serious
playoff push after trading all-star Glenn Rice to the Lakers for
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. Injured forward Anthony Mason will
be back next year. By then, Jordan's presence could lure more
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I would play for Michael,'' said Scottie Pippen, a
former Jordan teammate and now a forward for Houston. ``I played
with him for 10 years. So I know I can play for him. He'd want to
do the same thing I'd want to do. And that's win. He would make a
good owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also could be a magnet for other roles. Pippen predicted
that Phil Jackson, formerly of the Bulls, would be Jordan's first
choice as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said, ``If he offered me a job to help him run the
franchise in some way, I would love to join him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is so beloved that he could be North Carolina's governor,
if he wanted to. In the African-American community, he has been
criticized for not being outspoken on issues of race. But, as he
did on the court, his ambition is to lead by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to say, 'Look, I'm an African-American NBA
owner,''' veteran Indiana guard Mark Jackson said. ``By doing it,
he's leading the way, showing that it's something African-Americans
can do. That's what role models do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA needs more than one African-American owner. But you've
got to start somewhere, and Michael Jordan's a great one to get it
started.''

the length and soak-time restrictions. (Howard, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret report to top Clinton administration
officials last November warned that China posed an ``acute
intelligence threat'' to the government's nuclear weapons
laboratories and that computer systems at the labs were being
constantly penetrated by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investigators waited until March to search the computer of a
scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory who had been under
investigation for nearly three years, suspected of spying for
China. And it was not until April that the Energy Department shut
down its classified computer systems to impose tighter security
over their data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in February, the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, tried to
delete evidence that he had improperly transferred more than 1,000
files containing nuclear secrets, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report contains numerous warnings and specific
examples showing that outsiders had gained access to the computer
systems at U. S. weapons labs as recently as June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about why the
Clinton administration failed to address security breaches at the
laboratories sooner, and the report, which has been shared with
Congress, is certain to fuel the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first comprehensive review of its kind, was
prepared by U. S. counterintelligence officials throughout the
government. It confirmed and elaborated on longstanding concerns
about the vulnerability of the weapons laboratories to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The report was distributed to the highest levels of the
government, including Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy;
William Cohen, the secretary of defense; Janet Reno, the attorney
general; President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, and three dozen other senior officials at law enforcement,
defense and intelligence agencies. A government official gave a
copy of the report to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Energy Department recorded 324
attacks on its unclassified computer systems from outside the
United States between October 1997 and June 1998, including
instances when outsiders successfully gained ``complete access and
total control to create, view, modify or execute any and all
information stored on the system.'' The document does not say where
the computer attacks originated.
</P>
<P>
   A select congressional committee sent the president additional
warnings about the security of the weapons laboratories in a
separate report that was also secretly delivered in January of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said in an interview that he was briefed extensively
on that report and that it ``confirmed the already strong
counterintelligence measures I approved in October, including
cybermeasures.''
</P>
<P>
   The search of Lee's computer ``should have happened earlier,''
Richardson said. But he defended waiting until April 2 to shut down
the computer systems at the laboratory, saying: ``It wouldn't have
made much of a difference to have gone earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shutdown was the most extreme of measures,'' he said.
After learning on March 30 that Lee had improperly moved vast
amounts of nuclear secrets, Richardson said he decided to ``speed
up'' plans adopted months earlier to improve computer security.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his department's performance but said that some
Energy Department officials might be disciplined once an internal
inquiry he ordered had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-page counterintelligence report contains many examples of
lax security and serious intelligence breaches at the labs that
have not been previously disclosed, involving more than a dozen
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign spies ``rightly view DOE as an inviting, diverse and
soft target that is easy to access and that employs many who are
willing to share information,'' the report states. The Energy
Department is responsible for building and designing America's
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   China is cited in the report as posing the most serious security
threat to the U.S. weapons labs. The report also singles out Russia
and India as immediate threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``China represents an acute intelligence threat to DOE,'' the
report said, referring to the Department of Energy. ``It conducts
`a full court press' consisting of massive numbers of collectors of
all kinds, in the United States, in China, and elsewhere abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is an advanced nuclear power yet its nuclear stockpile
is deteriorating,'' it continued. ``As such, China has specifically
targeted DOE for the collection of technical intelligence related
to the design of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes, ``This effort has been very successful and
Beijing's exploitation of U.S. national laboratories has
substantially aided its nuclear weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that the maintenance of nuclear weapons,
so-called ``stockpile stewardship,'' is the area of most intense
interest to China. Lee was at the center of Los Alamos' stockpile
stewardship program for years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report also includes detailed information about a number of
incidents in which China could have obtained sensitive weapons
information, as well as some of the ways the espionage could have
taken place, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Chinese scientist working at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory, on Long Island, was able to send dozens of long,
technical faxes to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, enabling the
Chinese research center to duplicate Brookhaven experiments as they
were being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   _ China might be using its exchanges with American scientists
for espionage. Chinese intelligence officials have also arranged
the visits of American scientists to China to ``enable Chinese
experts to assess and develop these contacts,'' according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-seven Chinese intelligence officers have visited or
been assigned to the labs and other Energy Department facilities
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-dozen congressional committees are examining
both evidence of Chinese nuclear spying and security failures at
Los Alamos and other weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   The secret November report, some officials believe, is the
latest sign that the Clinton administration and investigators moved
too slowly and repeatedly missed opportunities to address the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said his administration acted quickly once it
learned of security problems at the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories. White House officials cite the president's February
1998 directive to beef up security. That directive called for an
assessment of the security threat against nuclear weapons and
technology secrets at the Energy Department which was completed
last November.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, with new disclosures about the extent of
Lee's improper transfers of secret weapons data, the Clinton
administration is facing intensified questions about how his
actions, which jeopardized secrets to virtually the entire U.S.
nuclear arsenal, could have gone undetected for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that nobody looked at his computer files until there
was a crisis?'' said a senior Energy Department official. ``That's
what we're trying to look into.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged. His lawyer left a message on a
reporter's voice mail saying the allegations against his client are
false.
</P>
<P>
   The report also focuses on security breaches at the labs
involving other countries, citing numerous incidents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Russian intelligence has intercepted communications
from Los Alamos concerning nuclear power plants used for military
purposes. In addition, the report says that an unknown individual
sent 38 faxes to India from inside a sensitive area of the Oak
Ridge Laboratory, in Tennessee, during a 30-day period in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report grew out of a comprehensive counterintelligence
review prompted by an espionage investigation that came to focus on
Lee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised about Lee as far back as 1982. At that
time, he telephoned a scientist who had been dismissed from the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a result of an FBI
investigation of China's theft of neutron bomb secrets, officials
said. In the phone call, Lee offered to help the other scientist
with his problems at the lab. The FBI investigated Lee as a result
of the phone call and gave him a polygraph test in late 1982 or
early 1983, officials said. He passed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that in 1994 or 1995, another Los Alamos scientist
saw Lee being hugged by a visiting Chinese scientist in a manner
that seemed suspiciously congratulatory. It turned out to be a
scientist Lee had visited in China in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The witness reported the encounter to the FBI, officials said,
one of the factors that eventually led the bureau to suspect him in
China's theft of design information about America's most advanced
nuclear warhead, known as the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress have questioned whether the FBI was aggressive
enough in its pursuit of Lee in the W-88 case, especially since
both Lee and his wife had informally provided information to the
bureau in the past, officials said. He finally emerged as the prime
suspect in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, Energy Department officials briefed Berger, then
the deputy national security adviser, on the case and how it
related to China's nuclear strategy. Berger took no action and did
not inform the president of the matter, White House officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI meanwhile began a criminal inquiry. But little
investigative work was done by FBI agents throughout the rest of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Justice Department declined an FBI request to ask a
court for authority to monitor Lee's phone and to gain access to
Lee's office computer. Justice Department officials argued there
was insufficient evidence to convince a judge to approve the
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had asked the Energy Department not to move Lee from his
job at Los Alamos, fearing this might alert him that he was a
suspect. But the inquiry appeared to be stalled. In April 1997, the
bureau's agents in Albuquerque, N.M., told Energy Department
officials they could transfer Lee to a less sensitive job.
</P>
<P>
   But that message apparently never reached Energy Department
officials in Washington, officials said. The job Lee was shifted to
that month was one in which he was responsible for updating a
computerized archive of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Berger was briefed again. This time, the briefing
included evidence that the Chinese were focusing on computer
systems at Los Alamos, in particular computer simulations and codes
for nuclear weapons, according to one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, officials at the Energy Department, the
lab and the FBI were all also warned that the Chinese were
attempting to gain access to computer systems at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The July discussion was also broader, including other security
problems, the W-88 theft and other espionage cases, including one
involving a scientist who had worked for weapons labs and their
contractors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Leavy, a White House spokesman, said Saturday that the
1997 briefing ``included a number of troubling disclosures.'' He
added that it was that briefing that led the White House to begin
the process of seeking to tighten security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   That scientist, Peter Lee (who is not related to Wen Ho Lee)
later pleaded guilty to attempting to pass classified information
in 1985 and making false statements about a trip to China in 1997.
The November 1998 report cited his case as ``a good example of
China's use of cultural ties to collect successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berger's 1997 briefing, he discussed the matter with the
president, and White House officials began to draft a presidential
directive ordering better security at the laboratories, White House
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI's investigation of Wen Ho Lee continued
without success.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Chinese-American FBI agents, posing as
Chinese spies, tried to establish a covert relationship with Lee,
officials said. In their sting, what the FBI calls a ``false flag''
operation, the FBI agents called him, pretending to be Chinese
spies checking up on Lee in the wake of Peter Lee's conviction
earlier that year, officials said. Wen Ho Lee listened, and then
called the agents back to refuse their offer to get together.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, both of the Lee cases were coming under the
scrutiny of the select congressional committee, headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif. At about the same time, Richardson took
over at the Energy Department from Federico Pena.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the secret counterintelligence report was
completed. Richardson, prodded both by Congress and by the mounting
evidence of security problems, took action to screen foreign
visitors to the labs, proposals that had lain dormant for years at
the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lee was subjected to a polygraph for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   During that first examination, for reasons that officials could
not explain, investigators did not ask Lee to consent to a search
of his office computer. Government attorneys had concluded that the
earlier Justice Department denial for an FBI surreptitious search
required Lee's permission to examine his office computer.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lee took a second polygraph. This time, officials
said, he was asked about his computer use and some of his answers
were seen as deceptive. Two days later, apparently aware that
investigators were now suspicious about his computer use, Lee
deleted between 1,000 and 2,000 files, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's deletions involved millions of lines of computer codes he
had downloaded, mostly in 1994 and 1995, from his classified
computer system to an unclassified system. Such unclassified
systems at the labs have been successfully attacked by outsiders,
according to the 1998 intelligence report.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, Lee was interviewed by the FBI. During the
interviews he gave permission for his computer to be searched. On
March 8, he was fired from Los Alamos for security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, investigators pored through his
computer records, recreated the deleted files and learned that Lee
had downloaded computer data and codes that, in effect, were the
distillation of more than a half-century of research on how to
perfect nuclear weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined whether another country _
China, for instance _ obtained the computer data. But officials
said they have found evidence that someone retrieved the renamed
files that had been switched to the unclassified system.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Lee's computer transfers, Richardson shut down
the computer systems at the weapons labs. He ordered new procedures
to make it more difficult to transfer classified data.
</P>
<P>
   The inadequacy of Energy Department's monitoring of lab computer
systems had been pointed out for years in low-level Energy
Department reports, as well as in the November 1998 intelligence
report sent to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they didn't shut down computer systems earlier is
because they weren't paying attention to the problem,'' said one
Republican member of Congress.

FOR DEVILS, A FEEL OF THE ROAD AT HOME
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday night's 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins
guaranteed the New Jersey Devils at least one more home game in the
Stanley Cup playoffs, perhaps as many as 13 more in the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   This means more nights in hotels, even when the game is at home,
a team tradition that has been slightly relaxed this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's pretty comfortable with what we're doing,'' said
cach Robbie Ftorek, who added that he is not too concerned that ``a
couple of the single guys'' might have different opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Even a telephone call can be a distraction on the afternoon of a
game, Ftorek said, and distractions are unwelcome during the
two-month tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the Devils spent Saturday night in a hotel. They were
in Pittsburgh preparing to play the Penguins this afternoon in Game
6 of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils held a 3-2 lead in the best-of-7 series. A victory
Sunday would advance them to face the Buffalo Sabres. A defeat
would mean Game 7 at home on Tuesday _ and back to a ``home'' hotel
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, under coach Jacques Lemaire, the Devils spent
many nights in hotels during the playoffs, even on nights in New
Jersey that did not precede games. Lemaire and general manager Lou
Lamoriello liked to keep their athletes under close watch, if not
lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   Although many hockey teams stay in hotels before home games in
the later rounds of the playoffs, few did it as often or as early
as the Devils. Even on the road, they seemed isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in the first round against Ottawa, the top-seeded
Devils stayed at a hotel that was far from downtown and the wicked
ways of the Canadian capital. The hotel was closer to the arena,
they were told. After they were upset by the Senators, a few Devils
gave the impression that defeat was a release from captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Without speaking against Lemaire's methods or challenging the
authoritarian ways of Lamoriello, Ftorek has loosened things up a
bit. On the road, at least in the first round, his team has stayed
in downtown hotels in Pittsburgh. At home, they are allowed to live
in their houses or apartments except on the nights before games.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek said he talked this over with Scott Stevens, the captain,
who discussed it with other veterans. Ken Daneyko, one of the team
seniors, said the current hotel policy is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different and I think it's great,'' Daneyko
said. ``It's so you can rest and focus on the game and get away
from home. It's a sacrifice. You have to put your families aside.
But players with kids might not get as good a rest at home. We're
doing it less than in the past. You don't want to get too mentally
tired from focusing too much on every game. But, the night before
the game, I totally agree with it and I think most of the guys do
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott, who used to play in Edmonton, said the Oilers did
not use hotels at home, so the Devils' way was an adjustment.
Arnott, one of the single Devils, said: ``We usually accumulate in
one room and just hang out. It's good for the team and the
camaraderie. We have a team breakfast and get ready for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who is married, said he wasn't sure how much he was
supposed to talk about hotel policy. ``We get to go home, we get to
go home, we get to go home,'' he said, with a smile. ``I think the
mood is good. That's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he misses his wife, Holik said: ``I always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik set up both of Randy McKay's goals Friday night. After the
game, both men greeted family members in the lobby and left
Continental Arena with them.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Bombardir, married with an infant son, discussed the team
hotel policy in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always the worry,'' he said, ``if you're staying in
hotels too much, and all of a sudden you're worrying about not
seeing your children and your wife, and you're not comfortable in
there. I think going in there the night before is just fine for us.
It works well.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Devils bachelors, Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora, combined on
Sykora's goal Friday that put the team ahead to stay. Afterward,
Sykora said: ``It doesn't bother me to be alone at home or at the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias, who is engaged to be married, said: ``The last couple of
years, it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias said that letting players go home, except on the nights
before home games, ``is better for the married guys to be with
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he would prefer to spend more time with his
fiancee, Elias paused and chose his words carefully. ``This is
Lou's and the coach's decision,'' he said, ``and we've got to
follow that.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In 35 years as a criminal lawyer, Oscar Goodman has
won cases for clients like Meyer Lansky and Anthony (Tony the Ant)
Spilotro. He has won acquittal for a surgeon accused of molesting
female patients under anesthesia, defended a federal judge against
impeachment charges and a man accused of murdering another federal
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the alpha and omega of law,'' Goodman said last week
from his green marble-floored office here, surrounded by
autographed pictures from clients and admirers as diverse as LaToya
Jackson, Mike Tyson, Mike Wallace and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But now Goodman, or ``The Big O,'' as he is known to friends, is
running for mayor. ``It's the first time in my life when I'll be on
the inside trying to do good and keep the government honest,'' he
said. ``I intend to treat Las Vegas as my primary client, with the
same passion I've had for all my less popular clients over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he declared his candidacy in March, Goodman has treated
voters like jurors, arguing his case _ including a plan to charge
developers' fees to finance civic improvements _ with populist
persuasiveness. Contrary to the oddsmakers' early assessments,
polls show him heavily favored to place first in a crowded
nonpartisan primary election on Tuesday, if not win the outright
majority that would avoid a June 8 runoff and make him mayor on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so appropriate for that city if Oscar became the
mayor,'' said his friend Nicholas Pileggi, the writer and the Las
Vegas demimonde who co-wrote the screenplay for Martin Scorsese's
movie, ``Casino,'' in which Goodman unabashedly played himself.
``He's a really genuine person,'' Pileggi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pileggi, speaking by telephone from New York, added: ``He's a
true defense attorney in the best sense of the word, his own little
Civil Liberties Union. It would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in this city, which has worked hard to reinvent
itself as a family-friendly resort in which mob rule is a distant
memory, is so excited at the prospect of a Goodman reign. When he
announced his candidacy, The Las Vegas Review-Journal ran an
editorial headlined ``Anybody but Oscar,'' which described Goodman
as a ``barrister to butchers'' and said he ``carries so much
baggage he could be skycap of the century at McCarran International
Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   His clients have been colorful, to say the least. He kept
Spilotro, the Chicago mob's man in Vegas, out of jail despite
accusations that he had killed 22 people. Eventually, Spilotro's
body was found in an Indiana cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a bearded, bespectacled 59-year-old father of four,
mostly takes the criticism in stride. But he has also hit back with
a television commercial featuring testimonials to his fairness and
integrity from old adversaries: the former head of the local
Organized Crime Strike Force, a former agent of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and a former U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll grab the City Council and the good old boy system and
he'll shake it pretty hard,'' the former U.S. attorney, Lamond
Mills, a Ronald Reagan appointee and a prominent Mormon in the
state, said in an interview. ``I think that would be a hoot. My
conservative friends say to me, `What about the image?' But the
fact of the matter is, people don't come here to go up to the
Mormon Temple. They come to gamble. I think he'll add to the
pizazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a Democrat, is one of nine candidates scrambling to
fill the seat being vacated by Jan Jones, who announced this winter
that she would not seek a third term. Goodman's two leading
opponents are Arnie Adamsen, a City Council member, and Mark Fine,
a developer. They each trailed him by more than 10 percentage
points in a poll published last week in The Review-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   With a reporter in his office, he cheerily fielded a phone call
from the city's reigning casino mogul, Steve Wynn, who had called
to confide the results of a private poll that showed Goodman within
striking distance of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying as hard as I can,'' Goodman said into the phone,
adding, ``I learned everything from you, Steve. I'm dead serious!''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has a populist, libertarian streak that appeals to a
town that, despite its explosive growth, retains a frontier air,
said Michael Bowers, a professor of political science at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still sort of wide open and there's a strong kind of
libertarian streak that runs through the whole state,'' Bowers
said. ``At the same time, there's a sense of people coming here and
starting over, leaving their past mistakes behind them, and so
people are less judgmental than they would be in many other
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor here is relatively weak, one of five equal votes on
the City Council. Much of the power over planning and zoning rests
with the county, which controls the unincorporated area of the
famous Strip, where most of the new casinos have been built. But
Goodman says he will use the bully pulpit to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In early appearances, Goodman showed some lack of familiarity
with the city budget and policy, and he has been impolitic enough
to acknowledge in the past that he is personally sympathetic to the
idea of decriminalizing drugs and legalizing prostitution, though
he insists that, whatever his beliefs, ``as mayor, I would never do
anything that would embarrass Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosecutor, Goodman grew up in Philadelphia and
graduated from Haverford College and the University of Pennsylvania
Law School. Goodman and his wife, Carolyn, arrived in Las Vegas in
1964, ``with $87 between us,'' he said, on the advice of a Las
Vegas police officer he had met on a case as a clerk at the
Philadelphia district attorney's office. Early on, he decided that
he could be in the world of casinos and night clubs, but never of
it, if he wanted to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, here I was a 23-year-old kid coming
out to Damon Runyonville, and everybody I saw was a character,''
Goodman recalled. ``There were guys with nicknames which described
them. There was Wingy, who had one arm, the Midget, Hunchy. I mean,
every night it was a dream come true for somebody who loved O.
Henry stories and Damon Runyon stories, and my wife said, ``Wait a
minute, two things: You can't be your client, you've got to be a
cut above your clients in order to have credibility, and you have
to be like Caesar's wife, you've got to be above reproach, because
there is nothing they would rather do than get you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman never gave prosecutors anything to get him on, though in
1994 he paid a $50,000 fine and risked jail time for refusing to
give the government payment records from a reputed mobster, Natale
Richichi, on the grounds that to do so would violate lawyer-client
privilege. He turned over the records when his client gave him
permission and the government threatened to bring criminal contempt
proceedings that could have led to disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has another inviolate rule: He never represents
informers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks of them as rats,'' Pileggi said. ``But he has never
taken on the aura of these people. I think he truly loved Spilotro,
one of the most vicious killers you can imagine. Now you'll never
convince Oscar of that. When he was around him, he was a total
gentleman.''

MANY PAY TO SEND CHILDREN TO MORE AFFLUENT PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By JOSEPH BERGER c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. _ Len Sarver is on the school board here, so
it is not surprising that he sends his 13-year-old son, Josh, to
public school. But what bothers some school officials here is that
he does not send Josh to public school in Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sarver pays $6,500 a year so that Josh can attend
middle school in the more prosperous adjacent town of Pelham,
where, Sarver believes, Josh can get a more rigorous and safer
education. ``I'm certainly not going to jeopardize my child
physically or educationally,'' said Sarver, an electrical
contractor, explaining why he has spurned the schools he helps
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Westchester County, much of New York state and in
several other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maine,
parents are exercising an expensive and little-studied form of
school choice, spending between $4,000 and $12,000 to send their
children to public schools outside their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   But as this arrangement has emerged willy-nilly _ through casual
decisions by random school districts with little direction from the
state governments _ educators are grappling with the fact that most
of the students who transfer seem to live in more urban suburbs
like Mount Vernon, Yonkers and Port Chester with large populations
of black and Hispanic students, and they end up attending schools
in leafy, overwhelmingly white districts like Pelham, Bronxville,
Tuckahoe and Rye. In fact, Sarver says one reason he chose Pelham
is that he does not want Josh to attend a school where he is one of
only a small group of white children.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and families say that those who pay tuition for public
school do so mainly because they feel their home schools do not
match those across the border, yet they do not want the religious
ambiance of a parochial school or the exclusivity of a private one.
The parents believe they are getting good value. In the latest
state report cards, 93 percent of Pelham's third graders read above
grade level, compared with 49 percent of Mount Vernon's.
</P>
<P>
   But some school officials in New York say that the state, by
tolerating such transfers, inadvertently injures struggling
communities like Mount Vernon, allowing the neighboring districts
to skim off some of those cities' brightest students and making it
even harder to provide integrated education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes the better kids from the system,'' said Ronald
Ross, the new superintendent of Mount Vernon, where more than 90
percent of the district's 9,800 students are black or Hispanic.
``Whatever problems we have, it makes it more difficult. It creates
the impression that we are not doing our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some officials point out that banning the practice would be
futile, citing the experience of Bergen County in New Jersey. In
1985, high school students from the well-off enclave of Englewood
Cliffs, which has no high school, began paying for school in
Tenafly, another comfortable white community, rather than their
historic destination: Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, whose
students increasingly were black. When a series of rulings required
Englewood Cliffs students to return to Dwight Morrow, virtually
every family put their children in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the country experiments increasingly with school choice and
vouchers, the 50 states seem to have a hodgepodge of policies on
whether students can pay to attend a neighboring district's public
schools. Illinois, which, unlike New York, does keep track of such
students, counts 13,119 whose families are paying for them to
attend public school outside their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   Until this school year, Wisconsin allowed receiving districts to
charge a limited tuition, but then joined Minnesota, Arizona, Iowa,
Oregon and 11 other states in expanding choice by requiring
districts to accept outsiders at no charge if they have the space.
</P>
<P>
   To promote integration, Massachusetts permits black and Hispanic
students in cities like Boston or Springfield to transfer for free
to suburban districts. California, however, bars transfers of white
students out of cities like San Francisco because these assignments
chip away at integration.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Orfield, a professor of education at Harvard and an expert
on integration plans, contends that ``the policy ought to be to
discourage transfers that undermine existing desegregation plans
and encourage transfers that increase the possibility of
desegregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts take a contradictory view. Stephan Thernstrom, a
Harvard history professor who with his wife, Abigail, wrote a
critical 1997 study of race-based policies, ``America in Black and
White: One Nation Indivisible,'' said that a generation of
experience with integration plans had shown that they were ``of
questionable educational benefit'' and did not enhance black
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think integration is an important value,'' he said, ``but
parental choice is an even more important one, so in that trade-off
I would opt for parental choice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, the number of students that any single district
receives from outside is not great _ 30 or 40 is typical _ but the
collective impact can be considerable, since transferring students
are concentrated in middle school and high school and since a
single district like Mount Vernon can lose students to several
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New York state, where only 15 percent of black students and
14 percent of Latino students attend schools with white majorities,
has never adopted a policy encouraging or barring tuition-paying
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a local issue, it's a parental issue, it's a family
issue, and parents are free to make those choices,'' said Bill
Hirschen, a spokesman for the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Not all suburban districts accept tuition-paying students.
Scarsdale's school clerk, Lois Rehm, said residents feel it would
be unfair for out-of-towners to get the benefits of Scarsdale's
schools while avoiding the high costs of living in Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendents of the Westchester districts that accept outside
students are frank in saying they do so because the costs are
minimal and the money can be used to add teachers. Ardsley's 30
tuition students, who come from Yonkers, Dobbs Ferry, Greenburgh
and Elmsford, pay $8,500 apiece for elementary school and $10,500
for high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to 1 percent of our tax rate,'' said Dr. Stanley
Toll, Superintendent of the Ardsley schools. ``If the students
weren't here, the residents would be paying 1 percent more.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, tuition-paying students are admitted only in classes
where there are vacancies. Most districts screen out students with
academic or behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Several Westchester superintendents said they did not think a
state policy barring tuition-paying transfers would have any impact
on the racial mix of schools, since parents unhappy with home
districts would then send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to spend $10,000 to send their kids to
Ardsley, they have a lot of options out there,'' Toll said. Private
school tuition for sixth grade in New York and New Jersey averages
$14,100 a year, according to the National Association of
Independent Schools. At Roman Catholic schools, it ranges from
$2,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Coletti, superintendent in Port Chester, which loses
students to Rye City, believes state policy should permit students
to transfer elsewhere only for programs his schools do not offer.
He suspects that in his district, which sends 84 percent of its
graduates to college and offers a full palette of advanced
placement courses, it is not quality that prompts families to
emigrate. Some parents, he suggests, do not want their children
attending schools where the student body is 65 percent Hispanic and
10 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make decisions on the basis of wanting their children
exposed to a culturally diverse population or not wanting their
children exposed to a culturally diverse population, and you can
read the code words into that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to middle schools in Mount Vernon and Pelham point up
some of the sharp contrasts that, in the minds of some families,
justify their decision to switch districts. Pelham Middle School,
where many students come from affluent families, is a cheerful
building facing a verdant athletic field. It is so well equipped
that shop students can build wooden bridges and test their
durability against earthquakes. At Mount Vernon's Alfred M. Franko
Middle School, where many children qualify for free lunch, obscene
graffiti were scrawled on lockers, and a science teacher appealed
to the Superintendent for ventilation hoods so he could perform
chemical experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon school district spends $10,000 per student
while Pelham spends more than $12,000. Each of Pelham's 156 eighth
graders must take the Regents test in earth science, and 95 percent
pass; at Franko, 40 of the 258 eighth graders took the test last
year and 31 passed. The percentage of Mount Vernon students
suspended last year was more than four times that of Pelham
students.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Mount Vernon junior high school students who made the
switch to Pelham _ two of whom are black _ say it was not easy
making new friends and enduring longer trips to school. But they
were drawn by Pelham's distinct advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that my parents aren't happy with Mount Vernon,''
said Chad Northern, a black seventh grader at Pelham. ``It's just
that they wanted something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Snyder, an eighth grader, said Pelham offered sports
like lacrosse and field hockey that Mount Vernon could not, and far
more honors classes. Michael Lynch, an eighth grader, who, like
Barbara, is white, said he switched ``because Mount Vernon's
schools were kind of dangerous.'' Although he said ``there are
stories of kids being cut up by knives and gangs walking around,''
he had not heard any firsthand accounts. Still, Mount Vernon's
reputation suffered a severe setback in 1994 when a student was
stabbed to death in a high school hallway dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Sarver, one of four white members of a nine-member board that
has been deeply divided along racial lines, acknowledged some
racial consideration in his decision. He did not want Josh
attending a school where whites would account for only a small
percentage of the student body _ something that was not the case at
his son's racially balanced elementary school in Mount Vernon or in
the polyglot neighborhood in north Mount Vernon where the Sarvers
live. ``I want him to have the opportunity of meeting different
groups, but I also want him to have a chance to be in a white group
as well,'' Sarver said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mount Vernon, families who put their children in neighboring
districts seem to irritate some school officials. Sarver's decision
seems particularly to chafe at Ross, the Mount Vernon
superintendent. ``It's ironic that someone who sits on the board
and makes decisions for other people's children refuses to send
their children to those schools,'' Ross said.

KNICKS' SEASON IS HANGING IN BALANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Mass., N.C., Fla.)   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Jeff Van Gundy has peeked at the scoreboard,
spun the dial on the satellite dish and even sat at the breakfast
table with his wife, Kim, and figured out the playoff
possibilities. While it is still possible for the Knicks to finish
anywhere from the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference all the way
down to the 10th spot, the math has boiled down to a seemingly
simple equation: if the Knicks can win two games, they will be
assured of a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've got to win two tough games against three tough
teams,'' Van Gundy said Saturday after the Knicks finished their
workout at SUNY-Purchase and prepared to fly to Indiana to face the
Pacers on Sunday afternoon. ``... We need two wins, but the
schedule is definitely not in our favor about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic number for the Knicks to clinch a playoff berth is
two; any combination of two Knick victories and Charlotte Hornet
losses puts the Knicks into the postseason. With games in Indiana
on Sunday, against Boston on Monday and then against the Miami Heat
on Wednesday, Van Gundy knows that it will not be easy for his team
to get two victories by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks can clinch a berth on Sunday, if they win in Indiana
in the afternoon and Charlotte loses at Miami that night. The
Hornets finish with games against Philadelphia on Tuesday night and
at Boston on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But before they concern themselves with any of the
possibilities, the Knicks are trying to focus solely on their own
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says we've got to win two out of three,'' Chris
Childs said. ``We've got to win one _ Sunday. Then we'll think
about Boston after that game. Everybody is up and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the problem for the Knicks is that everybody is not
up and ready to go. Marcus Camby practiced Saturday and will play
Sunday with a sore right shoulder. But Childs and Patrick Ewing did
not practice, and the Knicks will be unsure until game time if
either can play.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy sounded doubtful about whether Ewing, who has a sore
left Achilles' tendon, would be ready. He returned to action on
Thursday night against Philadelphia after sitting out the previous
three games, but reinjured himself in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last game, he played 21 minutes and I was going to put him
back in, but he said that he couldn't go back in,'' Van Gundy said.
``He didn't look good the other night and that was off of six days'
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying `didn't play well.' I'm saying he didn't look
like he did against Charlotte, where the time off had served him
well and he had a bounce in his step. If he can't be productive and
effective, there's no sense putting him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs was hopeful that his bruised right knee was recovering
quickly enough that he would be able to play. But even if the leg
responded to treatment, Childs said that he had not slept more than
an hour or two in the previous three nights, both from the pain and
the worry that the injury was something worse than it turned out to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has tried to dismiss the notion of resting Ewing
during these final three games, in preparation for the post-season.
He has also resisted speculating on possible playoff positioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first goal is only to get there, because we're a long way
from getting there,'' Van Gundy said. ``We have by far the most
difficult schedule. I just want to get there. They know we're not
there yet, but they should feel good about where they're at, what
they've done over the last five games, because they've played very
well. But they know that we need two wins.''

EDITORIAL: THE LOGIC OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough, the war
in Yugoslavia promises to extend into the summer, if not beyond. As
the American people brace for a sustained military campaign, they
deserve a clearer account of America's goals from President Clinton
and of how the national interest would be served by achieving them.
Anyone who doubts the demand for a plain and compelling rationale
for the war need look no further than the House of Representatives,
which last week stunned Washington by refusing on a tie vote to
support the NATO air offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Though partisan maneuvering by the Republicans was partly
responsible for the unfortunate outcome, the deadlocked House was a
symbol of national ambivalence that Clinton cannot afford to
ignore. The problem is not that Clinton has failed to outline
military and political objectives for Kosovo. He has done so in
some detail. But he has so far failed to connect those aims with
larger U.S. interests in a way that convinces a majority of his
countrymen that war with Slobodan Milosevic is warranted and may
have to be waged for months.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment scars have left Clinton and House Republicans wary
of each other, but the White House must work more closely with
Congress if it wants to build support for the war. Republicans, for
their part, should cease probing for political advantage on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 days of bombing, the military and political picture in
Kosovo has changed in ways that the White House and NATO did not
fully anticipate. As a result, some clarification and redefinition
of purpose are required.
</P>
<P>
   One of the original objectives of the air war _ protecting the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo from Yugoslav aggression _ has proved
unrealistic and unattainable. Each day brings a new wave of
bedraggled refugees to Albania and Macedonia, and with them stories
of unspeakable abuses and killing by the Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, has acknowledged that
alliance missiles and bombs cannot stop the bloodletting. Even if
NATO wanted to send a ground force into Kosovo, which it does not,
it would take two or three months to assemble the troops and
weapons, more than enough time for Milosevic to finish his ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   That unpleasant fact means that this war is now being fought
primarily over the future of Kosovo, a cause that is harder to
define and more difficult to sell to Americans than the defense of
innocent civilians under brutal attack. It is also a cause that
will be difficult, though not necessarily impossible, to advance
with air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   The goals Clinton has enunciated for Kosovo are honorable and
desirable. They include the return of the refugees, the restoration
of a high degree of political autonomy for Kosovo and the creation
of a secure environment in which Yugoslav forces could no longer
threaten ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the support of the country, Clinton has to place those
aims in a broader framework. We believe that freedom, human rights
and the preservation of a civilized society are critical principles
bound up in the conflict in Kosovo, and that Milosevic's effort to
drive the Balkans into a new dark age must be resisted. While
Yugoslavia does not present a military threat to the rest of
Europe, and unlike Iraq cannot impede the flow of oil, its
genocidal assault on Kosovo cannot go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War over, the country needs to devise a new
calculus for determining when its security is threatened and the
use of force is warranted. Kosovo is a test case. If the United
States and its NATO allies are prepared to let a tyrant in the
Balkans slaughter his countrymen and overrun his neighbors with
hundreds of thousands of refugees, other combustible regions of
Europe may face similar upheavals. History teaches that instability
in Europe inevitably hurts the United States, and can produce
larger conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Just how Washington and its allies defend these interests in the
Balkans will depend on military and diplomatic developments in the
weeks ahead. The application of air power, which is now crippling
the Yugoslav economy, may eventually force Milosevic to seek peace.
The bombing must be given time to work. The option of an invasion
should be kept open, if only to pressure Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be diplomatic progress now that Russia is trying
to broker a deal and may be ready to back an armed international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. While Clinton's peace terms should
shape a settlement, there may be space within them to work out an
accord. NATO has already offered more flexible terms for a
cease-fire and Milosevic has given a little ground on allowing
peacekeepers in Kosovo when the war ends. His demand that it be
unarmed or only lightly armed is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever course Clinton chooses, the country must be
satisfied it is worth the sacrifices that may be required. If
Clinton hopes to prevail in Kosovo, he will first have to secure
the support of the American people and of Congress.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Black Americans live shorter lives than whites and are more
likely to suffer stress-related maladies like high blood pressure,
which contributes to stroke and heart attack. The medical
profession has yet to list ``racism'' as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But some social scientists now see tension related to
discrimination as a health hazard on par with smoking and a
high-fat diet. Among the day-to-day acts of discrimination that
shadow African-Americans, none are more stressful or dangerous than
those committed by police, some of whom treat black people as
criminals until proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is largely invisible to whites, many of whom see
the complaints as a function of what writer Norman Podhoretz once
described as ``paranoid touchiness'' among black people.
</P>
<P>
   Not all whites hold the Podhoretz view, of course, and the
current police scandals in New York City and New Jersey are
broadening the vantage point on this problem. When these sagas are
over, millions of white people who thought black people paranoid
will have substantial insight into a nightmarish reality that
whites barely glimpse but that black people live through day after
day.
</P>
<P>
   After years of lies, New Jersey admitted that the state police
targeted black motorists _ on the basis of race alone _ for drug
searches along the New Jersey Turnpike. Taking a page from the KGB,
troopers even recruited motel workers to spy on patrons who spoke
Spanish or paid in cash on grounds that such people might be ``drug
couriers.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislative hearings by New Jersey's black and Latino
caucus have provided chapter and verse on how these policies were
carried out. Former state troopers testified that barracks bulletin
boards were once strewn with racial epithets and that troopers used
racist banter over the radio, describing cars with black drivers as
``buckets of coal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most telling testimony came from a black dentist,
Elmo Randolph, whose gold BMW was stopped more than 100 times over
four years as he drove from his home in Bergenfield to his office
in East Orange. Troopers continued to harass him even after they
had identified him as a dentist, which suggests that the stops were
a game to be played at African-Americans' expense.
</P>
<P>
   When Randolph refused to let police search his car, they seized
his license and made him wait on the side of the highway for 20
minutes. Randolph finally sold the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department denies using ``racial
profiling,'' but a recent story in Crain's New York Business raises
questions. The newspaper interviewed 20 black professionals _
including corporate presidents _ who told harrowing stories of
being singled out and humiliated by police, usually for driving
expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Graves Jr., the president of Black Enterprise magazine, has
been stopped twice over the last year in his Lexus and told Crain's
earlier this month that black men driving luxury cars were `` a
recipe for disaster'' _ meaning that encounters with the police
often turn violent, with the black person ending up dead.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of harassment has deepened racial alienation among
affluent black people who had hoped against hope that money would
let them blend in at last and become regular Americans. But instead
of fading into the crowd, they have become an ever more popular
target for police departments in New York City and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Black families of all income levels bear a heavy burden in
anxiety, worried that fathers, sons and husbands may one day be
picked off by police officers who mistake them for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The recent events in New York and New Jersey are proof that
African-Americans who were thought to be paranoid are in fact being
singled out for disproportionate police attention, even when they
break no laws. Mayors and governors who permit this practice will
have themselves to blame when the damage suits reach into the
billions and the racial climate is irreparably poisoned.  &QL;

C. GORDON, EXPERT ON LAW OF IMMIGRATION, DIES AT 93  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Md., Calif.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Gordon, a son of immigrants who became the general
counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
founding author of the 20-volume treatise Immigration Law and
Procedure, died Wednesday at Bay Medical Center in Panama City,
Fla. He was 93 and lived in Potomac, Md., and Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was a seminal figure in modern immigration law.
``Immigration Law and Procedure,'' which he published starting in
1959, is the principal reference in the field, widely cited in
court opinions and scholarly articles. He continued to publish
supplements and updates to it until he was 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before him, there was really no complete guide,'' said a
longtime friend, Maurice A. Roberts, retired chairman of the Board
of Immigration Appeals at the Justice Department. ``His book was
like an encyclopedia, and it gradually expanded as the law
expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was born on Oct. 12, 1905, in New York City, the son of
immigrants from Eastern Europe. He attended the City College of New
York and graduated from New York University Law School with honors
in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years in private practice before joining the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1939. He stayed for 35
years, rising to general counsel in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at the immigration agency, Gordon argued eight
cases before the Supreme Court. ``He was known as a liberal and
someone in favor of a more open, fairer immigration policy,''
Roberts said, but sometimes he had to argue positions with which he
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In one such instance, three decades ago, Gordon lost the case of
Afroyim vs. Rusk, in which the Supreme Court ruled that a
naturalized citizen cannot lose his citizenship against his will by
voting in a foreign election.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the agency in 1974, Gordon went into private
practice and founded a Washington law firm, Gordon &AMP; Bryant. During
those years, he filed lawsuits challenging the interdiction of
Haitian refugees at sea and restrictions on Iranian citizens during
the Iran hostage crisis. He retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Anne; a son, Michael Gordon of
Potomac; a daughter, Ellen Gittel Gordon of Los Angeles, and two
grandchildren.

`A ROUGH YEAR' TARNISHES PROSECUTOR'S REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ When Patricia Hurt was appointed just over a year
ago as the Essex County prosecutor, the accolades were quick to
pour in. She was the first black woman to hold the job, and as a
Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic county, she brought what
many considered a refreshing mix of law-and-order conservatism and
social advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a very long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal authorities are now looking into charges that
three people were beaten by officers in the course of separate
investigations conducted by her office; local officials are
accusing her of wasting taxpayers' money on luxury office
appointments, like a $120 leather wastebasket, and unjustified
salary increases; and some current and former employees of the
office are suing her for what they contend is age and gender
discrimination when Ms. Hurt promoted her personal favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some employees have complained that she
occasionally used her assistants to help with personal errands, in
one case picking up her, her family members and an aide from the
airport after a vacation in South Carolina. Through an aide, Ms.
Hurt denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has grown louder in the wake of the furor over how
her office handled the April 8 murder of an Orange policewoman. Ms.
Hurt charged with murder and kept in custody for six days a man who
had a strong alibi, who passed two polygraph tests and who was
later cleared.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the office, Ms. Hurt refused to
free the man, Terrance Everett, despite the urging of senior
investigators. And when the suspect was finally cleared, she
expressed no regret for what her office had done.
</P>
<P>
   The case cost the prosecutor her top deputy, Patrick Toscano,
who resigned in protest. But just as critically, it cost her a huge
measure of respect.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in the legal community, Ms. Hurt's determined
refusal to apologize publicly to Everett, marked the end of what
had been a fairly buoyant honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to him was horrible, and had it continued he
would have faced the death penalty,'' said Alan Zegas, a veteran
defense lawyer in Essex County. ``She should have apologized, and
by not apologizing her conduct reflects poorly on her office and on
her as prosecutor, and from what I have heard has caused morale in
the office to deteriorate along with her credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most prominent among the new chorus of detractors is
Essex County Executive James Treffinger, who once counted Ms. Hurt
among his most trusted aides when she was his deputy county
executive and who once liked to take credit for pressing Gov.
Christie Whitman to appoint her as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sees her as distant and autocratic. While she once basked
in the light of television cameras with an airy and engaging
manner, she has grown more defensive and reluctant to take
questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It perplexes and frankly saddens me that there has been such a
remarkable change,'' said Treffinger, who this week called for an
investigation into some of Ms. Hurt's recent spending in the
prosecutor's office. ``I can only speculate that the change is due
to the tremendous powers conferred on her by the office of
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last week, Ms. Hurt refused to grant an
interview to discuss the controversies. But Friday, in an impromptu
hourlong session in her office, she parried accusations of
mismanaging the office and exhibited some of the resilience and
toughness that close associates said had long been her traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an awesome responsibility to sit in this chair, and the
decisions that are made are made on so many different bases,'' Ms.
Hurt said. ``But I am trying to get this office ready for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded and visibly buoyed by supportive staff members during
the interview, she said she would not try to take on the criticisms
of her office one by one, but termed them unfair. At one point she
expressed fear that the criticism, and the pressure to respond to
it, was affecting the kind of compassion for crime victims and the
community outreach that she has tried to make the hallmark of her
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from the mother of Robin Moses,'' she said,
referring to e a 33-year-old woman from Orange who disappeared last
September. ``She said, `You aren't going to forget about my
daughter, are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt said that with all the decisions she had to make daily,
there were bound to be mistakes and those who disagreed with her.
But many of the mistakes and grumbling were more the result of not
having enough money to pay competitive salaries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Brunell, Ms. Hurt's deputy first assistant prosecutor,
echoed the concerns about low salaries and insufficient resources
and added that Ms. Hurt's additional efforts to reach out to the
community had probably further strained the office while making her
``extremely popular'' with the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Thad Givens, her acting chief of investigations, pointed to the
long hours that many employees were working. ``If they didn't like
her, we would have had a rebellion by now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Givens also responded Saturday to the charge that she had used
her staff to meet her and family members at the airport. He
acknowledged that investigators from the state attorney general's
office had been in Newark on Friday to look at records after
receiving an anonymous complaint about the incident. But he
explained that office investigators were sent to the airport
because Ms. Hurt had been the object of threats from a fugitive
that her office was seeking. He added that she had been accompanied
during her vacation by an office investigator for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the charges of brutality that have drawn state and
federal investigators to the office, Ms. Hurt denied any wrongdoing
by her staff, while friends and longtime supporters outside the
office said she was being unfairly blamed for police actions over
which she has no control. And they said that much of the criticism
is aimed at her because she is overturning ``the old boy network''
by appointing women and members of minorities to top posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to catch a little more flak as African-Americans
coming into a position such as Pat has,'' said Hadren Simmons, a
longtime friend and a founder of Concerned Black Republicans of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurt's detractors are both black and white, Republican
and Democrat. Veteran black investigators in her office who were
either demoted, reassigned or forced into retirement during her
first months in office were among those who filed a lawsuit
charging her with age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Hurt, 42, took office in January 1998, she was given
the reins to the largest and busiest prosecutor's office in the
state, in New Jersey's second most populous county after Bergen
County. And she quickly caught people's attention with her
aggressive efforts to solve more than a dozen slayings of
prostitutes. She formed an unusual task force of detectives to gain
the confidence of women who would otherwise be hiding from the
police and spoke of her desire to protect vulnerable segments of
society.
</P>
<P>
   She also hired the mother of Megan Kanka as a part-time
spokesman for the office, traveling around the county explaining
``Megan's Law'' to educators and community groups. She put up
billboards urging people to help fight drugs and sharpened the
office's focus on victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt also seemed intent on shaking up some of the old
personnel traditions, moving quickly to force out several senior
people. Some of them were replaced with less-experienced employees
and with women.
</P>
<P>
   She named an old friend and child abuse investigator in the
office, Priscilla Corcoran, as her deputy chief of investigations,
and elevated two lawyers, Sara McCardle and Siobhan Teare, to top
supervisory posts.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the quick personnel moves created the impression
among some staff members of an office in chaos. ``Lists would
appear transferring people, 15 or 20 at a time, in ways that made
no sense,'' said one veteran investigator. ``Then a few weeks later
those changes would be quietly rescinded because they hadn't
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees also accused Ms. Hurt of playing favorites in
managing her staff. One example they cite is that of Leshia Rosa,
who lives in Ms. Hurt's home in Montclair and who Ms. Hurt terms a
``tenant of mine.'' Ms. Rosa is an investigator in the office and
she often serves as Ms. Hurt's driver. Their friendship goes back
to 1995, when Ms. Rosa got a county job as a $19,000-a-year
juvenile detention officer. When Ms. Hurt became county prosecutor,
Ms. Rosa was appointed to the $58,536-a-year investigator's job,
according to county personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Hurt first came onto the scene in Essex County she was
referred to many simply as ``Bobby's daughter,'' a reference to her
well-known, much beloved father, Robert Hurt, a former teacher at
Newark's Montgomery Street school, who had been a standout point
guard with an awesome leaping ability when he played basketball at
Orange High School in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   She is the oldest of three children of Edith and Robert Hurt.
She attended Montclair High School, where she was president of her
junior and senior classes. At graduation in 1974, she won the
Montclair High School Award, given to a student who stands out for
both their leadership and academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt attended Elmira College in upstate New York, and after
graduating in 1978 she enrolled in Howard University Law School in
Washington. With a law degree, Ms. Hurt returned to New Jersey and
worked as a law clerk for a Hudson County Superior Court judge and
later as a prosecutor in Hudson and Essex counties.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989-1992, she was Newark's chief municipal prosecutor, and
in 1992 she entered private practice, handling real estate
transactions and divorces while teaching paralegal studies part
time at Montclair State University.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Edwards, who with Simmons founded Concerned Black
Republicans of New Jersey, said that Ms. Hurt had long been a
political rarity _ a black Republican in a county where the
overwhelming majority of black voters are Democrat. But she had not
been active in politics until 1994, when he and Simmons, persuaded
her to run for county registrar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had approached others to run, but Pat was the only one who
saw the vision we had,'' said Edwards, who was then the vice
chairman of the Essex County Republican Party. ``Jim Treffinger was
running for county executive, and the party was trying to be
inclusive and empower black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Hurt lost to a black woman running on the
Democratic ticket, Treffinger won against a fractured Democratic
party. It was generally believed, Simmons said, that Ms. Hurt had
helped bring along some black voters to seal that victory.
Treffinger hired her as his deputy county executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of my most trusted senior management people, and I
had the utmost confidence in her,'' said Treffinger, adding that he
could always depend on Ms. Hurt for level-headed advice.
</P>
<P>
   At about the time that Prosecutor Clifford Minor stepped down,
Treffinger was heading into a re-election campaign that would pit
him against former Newark Mayor Kenneth Gibson. In what many saw as
a calculated bid to attract black support, Treffinger, who is
white, urged Whitman to appoint Ms. Hurt as the next prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hurt's first few months in office attracted positive
headlines, the problems were not far behind. In September two of
Ms. Hurt's appointees ran into trouble. Ms. Corcoran, whom she had
named deputy chief of investigations, and Capt. Durrell Dunson, a
newly arrived recruit from the Newark Police Department, were
implicated in the brutalizing of a suspected drug dealer during a
raid. The case is now before a grand jury, and Ms. Corcoran has
resigned while Dunson is on restricted duty.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also led to the resignation of Edward Malia, the
man whose appointment as chief of investigations Ms. Hurt had
announced along with Ms. Corcoran's on the day she was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   September turned even worse for Ms. Hurt when she and Ms. Rosa
were stopped for speeding in the Prosecutor's official car on the
Garden State Parkway. The incident led Ms. Hurt and her lawyer to
suggest that the white state trooper who stopped her was engaging
in racial profiling and should be investigated by the governor.
While Ms. Hurt later retracted that charge, she continued to insist
that she had not been treated respectfully in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   October brought the filing of the age and gender discrimination
lawsuit by the current and former employees. Also at that time the
white state trooper whom Ms. Hurt had accused of racial profiling
announced that he would sue her for slander and defamation.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurt's biggest problem began on the night of April 8,
when Joyce Carnegie, a police officer in the small town of Orange,
was gunned down while looking for a robbery suspect. Less than two
days after the killing, local police had arrested Terrance Everett,
a 24-year-old man with a criminal record who fit the description of
the killer and whose picture was identified by several witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But to some of Ms. Hurt's top aides, it became clear within
hours of his arrest that he was not the killer. Yet Ms. Hurt pushed
ahead with her case against Everett, arraigning him on a murder
charge and bringing him before television cameras with bruises and
a black eye that he said he suffered from police abuse while being
arrested. And in the meantime, investigators failed to interview a
key alibi witness until five days after Everett was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't all. Because of investigators' doubts about
Everett, officers continued to look for suspects even while Everett
was in jail. A day after his arrest, officers arrested a
27-year-old man who also fit the description of the officer's
killer. That man, Earl Faison, died in police custody; the
authorities have not explained how he died.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigations are now being conducted in both
cases, and Ms. Hurt's office is facing civil action as well.
Lawyers for Everett say they intend to file suit alleging false
arrest and brutality, while Faison's family is also considering
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt continues to say little about the investigation into
Officer Carnegie's death, other than that she was comfortable with
how it was handled. ``I do not intend on answering each of the
criticisms,'' she said Friday, ``except to note that they are
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the announcement late last week that the attorney
general's office was auditing her handling of funds forfeited by
drug dealers and the allegations by Treffinger that she was
misusing money and spending extravagantly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if it had been a rough two weeks, Ms. Hurt managed
a smile and replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough year.''

CATAMARAN SAILOR PLOTTING THE REVENGE OF THE TOMATO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla., )   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Hans Meijer, a multihull sailor from Virginia Beach, Va., a
tomato is anything but a piece of fruit. It has got him into
trouble twice now in ocean racing, and both times, he has had to
head for the beach. Not a good place for tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this circuitous connection between a tomato and
sailing? Sponsorship in the Worrell 1000, an annual catamaran race
1,000 miles along the East Coast, from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to
Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Meijer, a competitor in that race for the last two years, has
named his 20-foot catamaran, Pomodoro, Italian for a tomato. (The
boat's name comes from Pizza Pomodoro, the restaurant that Meijer's
sister owns in London.) Each time he has sailed under that name, he
and his teammate have been forced to abandon their little beach
cats at Cape Hatteras, along a rough-and-tumble stretch of ocean
off the North Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 38-year-old Meijer hopes things will be
different. The event, scheduled to begin next Sunday off Fort
Lauderdale, is expected to include 13 two-man teams. Meijer plans
to sail with Brian Lambert, 33, from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., as
crew. They will wear a specially made T-shirt to charge their
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a picture of a tomato on the front,'' Meijer said, ``a
mean, vicious tomato with blood running from its fangs. It has
green vines for hands, and they are wrapped around the lighthouse
at Cape Hatteras.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Meijer's catamaran dismasted in rough seas 14 miles off
the coast. It took two Coast Guard vessels to pick up Meijer and
his crewman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his multihull's front crossbeam cracked. Near shore,
a huge wave picked the boat up like a skillet under an
egg-over-easy and dumped the boat right-side-up on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Meijer landed on a deserted island off Hatteras last year. It
was another 23 hours before his shore crew picked him up from the
remote fishing camp on the deserted island off Hatteras. A
fisherman had given them plates of spaghetti and Scotch to get them
through to the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meijer's failure to get around Hatteras has been niggling at him
all the while.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is unfinished business,'' Meijer said in a telephone
interview last week. ``The challenge of sailing 1,000 miles is
something I've got to do. It's been a dream for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   So, this year Meijer and Lambert will wear tomato T-shirts that
issue a challenge to Hatteras: ``You're mine in '99.''
</P>
<P>
   For Meijer, the race has become a mission. For others, the
Worrell 1000 is a way of life. Randy Smyth, a sailmaker from Fort
Walton, has won the 15-year-old competition three times. Smyth, now
44, keeps coming back despite the race's grueling reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Its format calls for 11 seaside stops before the race finishes
May 21 in Virginia Beach. While mostly competing by day, the
sailors must also negotiate two evening stages. It means that
instead of a hotel bed, they are pinned to their catamaran's open
trampoline all night. The sailing is wet. Synthetic dry suits
replace all standard yachting gear. Eating is usually sandwiches
squashed in plastic wrap tied to the forestay. Navigating is tricky
near Hatteras, which is known as a Graveyard of the Atlantic).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look toward shore from miles out, you see what
appears to be the skyline of a built-up city,'' Michael Worrell, a
co-founder of the race, said recently. ``But as you get closer, it
is really ocean swells coming together, and waves break straight up
into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to bother Smyth. ``You're kind of going out
there blindfolded,'' he said. ``If you're afraid of things like
waves and shoals, it could be daunting. But to me, it's a building
block in which you learn from past experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   So last year when a fierce northeaster barreled into the coast,
demolishing four catamarans and canceling Leg 11, from Cape
Hatteras to Kill Devil Hills, N.C., 10 of the 21 boats were forced
to pulled out. But Smyth got through it by going into the beach and
taking off the boat's jib before heading to the shoals. His boat's
reduced sail area allowed him to head up the shore in control as
other teams were being tossed in the steep surf.

<P>
   Three people were killed and 13 others injured early Saturday in
a fire in a small apartment building in Huntington Station, N.Y.,
Suffolk County police and fire officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze, which broke out shortly after 3:30 a.m., badly
damaged all five apartments in the two-story building at 28 West
Hills Road, before members of the Huntington Manor Fire Department
were able to bring the flames under control three hours later. An
estimated 30 people were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County Police arson and homicide squads were
investigating because fatalities occurred and because the fire's
cause was unknown, according to Officer Sonny Di Stefano, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Di Stefano said the dead had been identified as Maria Chicas,
35, and her daughter, Maria, 4, who lived in a second-floor
apartment, and Luis Cruz, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Elvancia Flores, 40, who suffered critical
injuries, was airlifted to the University Medical Center at Stony
Brook. Ten residents and two firefighters sustained
non-life-threatening injuries.

W.S. SALANT, ECONOMIST FROM THE KEYNESIAN SCHOOL, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter S. Salant, who as a graduate student in the 1930s and
later as a government and private economist helped infuse the
revolutionary teachings of John Maynard Keynes into Washington
policy deliberations, died Friday at a hospice near his home in
Washington. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard University in 1933, Salant
attended the lectures of Keynes at Cambridge University, two years
before he published ``The General Theory of Employment, Interest
and Money'' _ the discipline-shattering treatise that argued that
industrialized economies, then mired in depression, were unlikely
to recover on their own but could use government spending and tax
cuts to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Salant returned to Harvard and joined the celebrated fiscal
policy seminar run by Professors Alvin Hansen and John Williams
that explored Keynes' new ideas and trained economists who went on
to build a discipline forged in part on the Keynesian foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an economically depressed time,'' James Tobin, a Nobel
laureate at Yale University, recalled in a recent interview. ``Most
older professors other than Hansen himself had no explanation or
understanding of what was happening, and no solution. The idea that
Keynes had an explanation and a solution that involved an
intellectual revolution but not a proletarian revolution was a
pretty exciting thing. Walter was part of the core Keynesian group,
a major figure of what became the center of American
Keynesianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin calls a short book, ``An Economic Program for American
Democracy,'' that Salant co-wrote with a number of graduate
students in 1938 a ``Keynesian manifesto'' _ one of the first
strong polemics in the United States on behalf of more government
investment and other Keynesian ideas that were then revolutionary
but would, because of the efforts of Salant and others, become
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Salant left Harvard for a series of government positions. He
served in the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commerce Department in the 1930s, and, in the '40s,
the Office of Price Administration and other agencies that designed
the national strategy for wartime price controls. He was a senior
staff member for international relations on the President's Council
of Economic Advisers from 1946 to 1952. He later served as a
consultant to NATO and in the Treasury Department in the Kennedy
and Johnson administrations. He left government in the 1954 to
become a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington,
staying until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin credits Salant with helping to ``internationalize
Keynes.'' ``The General Theory,'' Tobin said, ``analyzed economies
that engaged in no trade. Salant applied its lessons to a world
that increasingly relied on trade and foreign investment _
analyzing how trade surpluses play the same role in an economy to
create employment and output as do private investment or government
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Charles P. Kindleberger of MIT points to an influential
report that Salant prepared for the Truman administration showing
that the proposed Marshall Plan _ a massive aid program for the
reconstruction of Europe _ was affordable, financially feasible and
would not, as critics feared, ignite a ruinous inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Kindleberger also cites Salant's contributions to analyzing
America's balance-of-trade deficits, a problem so severe that a
senior official in the Kennedy administration cited it along with
nuclear arms as the two biggest issues confronting government. A
report that Salant wrote with Lorie Tarshis, Emile Despres, Alice
Rivlin, now vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and other
distinguished economists at the request of President Kennedy's
Council of Economic Advisers laid out the proper economic role of
the United States as the world's central bank. Just as central
banks need to provide currency to their domestic economies, they
said, the United States needs to supply dollars to the
international economy. In a controversial article he wrote in 1966
with Kindleberger and Despres, Salant explained that a steady
outflow of dollars to pay for the trade deficit was no economic
catastrophe. The outflow was necessary to feed an international
economy desperate for liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin says the staff of the Brookings Institution in the
1960s included many distinguished economists who, like Salant,
worked on practical problems of economic policy. His colleagues
included Kermit Gordon, Joseph Pechman, Herb Stein, Charles
Schultze and Arthur Okun, all of whom served in the federal budget
office or on the Council of Economic Advisers. She also cites
Salant's role as mentor. He was, she said, ``one of those people
who took you under his wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salant was born in New York City in 1911 and received his
doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1962. He served on the Board
of Editors of the American Economic Review, the journal of the
American Economic Association, from 1956 to 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Edna; two sons, Michael, of
Washington, and Stephen, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his decision to leave university life for
Washington in the Depression, Salant wrote in a reminiscence of the
New Deal that the spirit of the Roosevelt administration brought in
young people like himself, ``generated ideas, fermentation, energy,
a feeling that something was being done, that there was leadership
when leadership was needed, that there was a relationship between
the government and the people in which the government was the
citizen's friend.''

OUTDOORS: SEASON OPENS FOR TOMS, BUT WATCH OUT FOR THOSE HENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the days grow longer and warmer, wild turkeys in New York
state are responding to ``the force that through the green fuse
drives the flower,'' and hunters count on this to reduce the male's
ability to notice that danger is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   Only adult males, also called toms or gobblers, may be shot
during the state's May 1-31 spring turkey season, which takes place
in all of the state north of the Bronx-Westchester county border.
</P>
<P>
   The season opens when most hens, already impregnated, are on
their nests. In a further effort to avoid the killing of hens by
mistake, the hours for the spring season are from a half-hour
before sunrise to noon. The nesting females tend to stick with
their brooding duties until that hour, but sometime during the day
they have to leave their nests and forage for food.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the fully camouflaged spring hunter hies himself to
a likely spot in the woods and yelps as if he were a hen turkey
seeking to be serviced. The usual calling device for this is a box
call with a swinging lid. Some hunters use a diaphragm call that is
held in the mouth; its advantage is that it leaves your hands free
to hold your fowling piece and reduces hand movements. But it has
less range than a box call and is more difficult to use properly.
</P>
<P>
   A gobbling call is occasionally used in an effort to convince a
tom that another male has invaded his territory, a call to arms, if
you will. On rare occasions, novice hunters have stalked another
hunter who is gobbling. There is no need for this kind of nonsense.
Experienced hunters know that it is almost impossible to stalk a
wild tom successfully. The rule of thumb when spring turkey hunting
is, once you start yelping, to let the birds come to you.
</P>
<P>
   The spring hunter is after gobblers that are striving to mate
with every receptive hen around. Once so served, the hens turn to
egg-laying and nesting. The toms, meanwhile, remain inflamed.
Hard-put to find release, the male turkey sometimes races nonstop
through the trees and puckerbrush toward a hunter's yelp, but this
is not usual.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not an expert, it is best to call as few times as
possible, perhaps a few times every 20 minutes if the bird is
coming at you. Turkeys have marvelous hearing, and one sour note is
often all it takes to spook them. Their eyesight is also superb.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the nimrod's virtual immobility was brought home to
me many years ago when I went on my first spring turkey hunt. Paul
Updike and I ensconced ourselves on a hardwood ridge in the
Catskills where he had heard gobblers during preseason scouting.
Early on, a distant gobbler responded to his box call, but nearly
two hours went by before the bird came within shotgun range. It
circled around behind us and I froze.
</P>
<P>
   Paul inched himself around in order to be facing the bird. He
was in an awkward and contorted position, but dared not move any
more because his quarry was running back and forth through the dry
leaves. After 20 minutes, during which I saw nothing, Paul fired.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the shot he lay writhing on the forest floor,
shouting to me to get the bird. For an instant I thought that his
shotgun had exploded, injuring him; then I realized he was
experiencing a charley horse of magnificent proportions.
</P>
<P>
   I retrieved the turkey, a handsome gobbler of about 20 pounds
that was stone-hammer dead, and brought it back to Paul, who by
that time had stopped thrashing about. It was then that he told me
that turkeys are tough and that many toms believed to be dead have
escaped. Dogs are allowed in fall turkey hunting in New York state,
but not in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hard winters do not reduce turkey populations as much as cold,
wet springs. Reproduction was down last spring, says Glenn Cole, a
state wildlife biologist, and that was reflected in a reduced
hunter kill of the birds in the fall of 1998. The hunter take in
the spring of 1998 was more than 9,000, about normal in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The daily spring limit is one tom and the spring season's limit
is two. Both a hunting license and a special turkey permit are
needed to hunt the birds in New York state. The permit is also good
for the fall turkey season, when any turkey is legal game.
</P>
<P>
   Although most hens will be on their nests, a few are always
wandering about and they sometimes respond to the hunter's yelping.
Thus hunters must be certain of the sex of the bird. Males have
highly visible beards hanging from their chests. Only a few hens
are so adorned. The head of the gobbler is red, white and blue; the
hen's is a muted blue-gray. The gobbling, strutting, wing-dragging
and fanned tail approach of the tom is highly distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Only shotguns or bow and arrow may be used for turkey hunting in
New York state. The shotshell pellets may be no larger than No. 2
or smaller than No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to learn the art of spring turkey hunting on your
own, but you will progress a lot faster if you can go out with an
experienced hunter your first season.

officials are trying to determine why at least 40 veterans of the
Persian Gulf war appear to have come down with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), the nerve disease sometimes called ``Lou Gehrig's
Disease.'' A University of Kentucky neurologist who specializes in
treating ALS said he was asked by VA officials to review medical
records of Gulf veterans diagnosed with the disease and will ask
the Defense Department this week to fund a study to determine how
many other veterans whose names do not appear in VA records also
have it _ or already have died of it. He said 40 cases would be
significantly higher than the national incidence of the disease.

   SCHOOLS-WORSTEVER _ BATH, Mich. _ Before Oklahoma City, before
Littleton, Colorado, before the wave of bizarre, terrorist-style
school house bloodbaths shook the foundations of an American
cultural landscape awash in techno-violence, there was Bath,
Michigan. There, on May 18, 1927, just days before lucky Lindbergh
conquered the Atlantic, a man described variously as homicidal
farmer, angry school board treasurer and meticulous handyman,
detonated hundreds of pounds of explosives he had secreted in the
subflooring of the local school, blowing 45 people - mostly
elementary school children - into oblivion. The small town just
outside Lansing was never the same. Today the incident is so little
remembered that major U.S. newspapers including the New York Times
erred when describing Littleton as the mostly deadly school
incident in American history Simmering, lonely hate and targeting
children for mass murder are nothing new. The angry farmer did his
deed because he resented increased taxes for the school. (Bennish,

ON MAY 1, A SPRING BREAK FOR PENT-UP NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A big fat dose of spring was reported to have arrived
in earnest throughout this city Saturday. And just about everywhere
you looked, the evidence was rather compelling.
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square at 8 a.m., there was Cindy Crawford, warming up
packs of numbered runners for a jog to Central Park to raise money
for women's health issues. Not long after, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
went bowling in Bryant Park to kick off a pro bowling tournament
and raise awareness of himself. And in neighborhoods across the
rest of the city, New Yorkers kicked off the first real spring
weekend this year under a gorgeous, cloudless blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably as good a weekend as there has been in the
spring,'' declared Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Penn State
University who predicted Saturday's ``abundant sunshine'' and
70-degree temperatures would last through Sunday. ``This has, no
doubt, got people's hormones flaring up.''
</P>
<P>
   In healthy ways, mostly.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, cherry blossoms bloomed to great fanfare, and
environmentalists fished for toxic bass. In Harlem,
philanthropically minded souls restored a school playground. The
weather did, indeed, have something to do with that. ``You always
think this is the last day it's going to be like this,'' said Greg
Cirota, 31, a New York University film student, as he strolled
through a Lower East Side street fair. ``But then I realize it's
the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no patch of Manhattan was put to greater or more diverse
springtime use than Washington Square Park, onto which pot-loving
hippies, child-toting yuppies and domesticated donkeys
simultaneously converged, each with a separate agenda. On the
southeast corner, hundreds of people gathered for the Million
Marijuana March to chant slogans advocating the legalization of
smokable hemp. About 100 feet away, Pink Ink Art and Motion, a
visual-arts company, offered children's tours through a psychedelic
playground of colored fabric tents and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, about 40 protesters from the Global Sweatshop
Coalition parked in front of a Kmart at Astor Place and chanted:
``Hey, hey. Ho ho. Sweatshops have got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   On 143rd Street in Harlem, the mood was more altruistic as more
than 100 volunteers from the New York Junior League renovated a
playground at PS 194. ``Just watching everyone helping out here,
it's better than Tom Sawyer,'' said city Parks Commissioner Henry
Stern, who insists on being called ``Starquest'' when on official
parks business. Supervising the volunteers sweeping away nails and
glass, painting and repairing playground equipment, Starquest said,
``This will be one beautiful playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn was no less resplendent. At the Brooklyn Botanic
Gardens, a weekendlong Cherry Blossom Festival drew hundreds of
floralists, kindergartners and pensioners alike. ``There's no place
prettier in the world than this spot,'' said Joan Asher, 56, of
Brooklyn, breathing in the sweetened air between two rows of cherry
trees Saturday morning. ``This whole place just recharges my
battery.''
</P>
<P>
   As children played in the thick lawn around her, Dorothy Duan,
81, immigrant from China, gave a Tai Chi demonstration to anyone
who cared to watch. ``The blossoms remind me of my home town in
China,'' Ms. Duan said. ``I always try to come here around blossom
time.''
</P>
<P>
   About a mile east, in Williamsburg, the springtime subject at
hand was fish. About 50 people gathered along a garbage-strewn
section of East River bank for a ``fish-in,'' sponsored by the New
York chapter of the Sierra Club, to draw attention to the
pollutants in the river that have kept striped bass more or less
toxic for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come here as a kid, but I don't remember ever
catching anything back then,'' said Andrew Dassaro, 36, a subway
conductor who spent the morning with a fishing line cast into the
river beside his nephew Thomas, 6.
</P>
<P>
   There was other evidence of full-tilt spring action _ Upper West
Side residents planting flowers in tree boxes; pet-store clearance
sales on cat leashes and dog beds, to name two _ but spring in New
York would not be quite right without its sine qua non signature:
German tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're walking through Strawberry Fields,'' said a
tour bus driver standing beside his rig on 77th Street and Central
Park West, waiting for a pack of Germans to return. ``It's really
nice out here.''

EDITORIAL: A GIFT OF SUMMER, FOR A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summer is a punishment for children who live in neighborhoods
barren of grass, with streets so dangerous that parents confine
boys and girls to the front steps or keep them indoors. For
children like these, a yearly vacation in the country can make the
difference between a childhood in the shadows and a childhood with
sunshine, swimming and a chance to make new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1877, a not-for-profit organization called the Fresh Air
Fund has opened worlds of grass and trees to 1.6 million poor
children from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 3,000 children who would otherwise be confined to the
city will attend Fresh Air camps on a 3,000-acre site in Fishkill,
N.Y. About 6,000 disadvantaged children, ages 6 to 18, will spend
two weeks with volunteer families in small communities across 13
states, from Virginia to Maine, and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The program also has a special one-week option for New York City
families who would like to host Fresh Air Fund children during
their summer vacations in the country. More than 65 percent of the
children are invited back year after year. Many get to know their
second families so well that they spend entire summers in the
country. The experience is life-changing for both the children and
the families that befriend them.
</P>
<P>
   Host families freely open their homes to youngsters. But there
are transportation, insurance and administrative costs. A two-week
``Friendly Town'' vacation costs $433, and a child can attend a
fund camp for $995. In 1998, the fund received 53,000 gifts
totaling $10.3 million. The goal for 1999 is to raise $11.4 million
by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the fund's contributions come from
individuals. Tax-deductible donations can be sent to the Fresh Air
Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. Families
wishing to be Friendly Town hosts may call (800) 367-0003.

ISRAELI SCIENTIST REPORTS ADVANCE IN CODE BREAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Israeli computer scientist is expected to shake up the world
of cryptography this week when he introduces a design for a device
that could quickly unscramble computer-generated codes that until
now have been considered secure enough for financial and government
communications.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper to be presented Tuesday in Prague, Czech Republic,
Adi Shamir, one of the world's foremost cryptographers, will
describe a machine, not yet built, that could vastly improve the
ability of code breakers to crack ciphers thought to be unbreakable
in practical terms. They are used to protect everything from
financial transactions on the Internet to account balances stored
in smart cards.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir's idea, which would combine existing technology into a
special purpose computer, could be built for a reasonable cost,
said several experts who have seen the paper. It is scheduled to be
presented at an annual meeting of the International Association for
Cryptographic Research, beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir, a computer scientist at Weizmann Institute of Science in
Rehovoth, Israel, is the S in RSA, the encryption design that has
become the international standard for secure transmissions. He is a
co-inventor of RSA with Ronald Rivest of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Leonard Adleman of the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   RSA is what is known as public-key cryptography. In this system,
a person has a public key and a private key. The public key is used
to scramble a message and may be used by anyone, so it can, even
should, be made public. But the private key that is needed to
unscramble the message must be kept a secret by the person who
holds it.
</P>
<P>
   RSA, like many public-key systems, is based on the fact that it
is immensely difficult and time-consuming for even the most
powerful computers to factor large numbers. But Shamir's machine
would make factoring numbers as long as about 150 digits much
easier, thus making it much simpler to reveal messages scrambled
with public-key encryption methods.
</P>
<P>
   A number of advances in factoring have been made in the last
five years. But most of them are the result of applying brute force
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   When RSA was created in 1977, Shamir and his colleagues
challenged anyone to break the code. Employing 1970s technology,
they said, a cracker would need 40 quadrillion years to factor a
public key, and even with anticipated advances in computer science
and mathematics, they predicted that no one would be able to break
the code until well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a message the trio had encoded with a 129-digit key
successfully withstood attack for only 17 years. It was factored by
an international team of researchers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Using Shamir's machine, cracking the 140-digit number would be
reduced to the difficulty of cracking a key about 80 digits long,
which is relatively easy by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that if his machine worked it would mean that
cryptographic systems with keys of 512 bits or less _ that is, keys
less than about 150 digits long _ would be vulnerable in the
future, an exposure that would have seemed unthinkable only five
years ago. The longer 1,024-bit keys that are available today would
not be vulnerable at present.

PEGRAM HAS HIS DAY IN THE OAKS INSTEAD 
MONEY MATTERS 
IT'S THE PLACE TO BE 
RIDERS RULE THE DAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Mike Pegram didn't feel bad that he would be
merely a spectator at the 125th running of the Kentucky Derby. The
owner of last year's winner, Real Quiet, could have entered
Silverbulletday but decided he had a more important title to
defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the owner who had the most fun last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only because he won the grand race. Pegram, the owner
of 22 McDonald's franchises in Washington state, brought a casual
attitude along with a party posse to his first Kentucky Derby. His
fashion statement over a week of high style remained consistent:
jeans and no tie.
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends, many of whom he grew up with in nearby
Princeton, Ind., were mainstays in the late hours. They preferred
an ever-present beer cooler over the tony parties. Pegram's good
friend, trainer Bob Baffert, made a point to carry the colors of
the everyman. In fact, it was Pegram who persuaded the California
trainer's to switch to thoroughbreds and bankrolled it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave horse racing's biggest week empty-handed.
Silverbulletday, his championship filly, proved she was one of the
best of her generation by rolling to an easy two-length lead as the
1-9 favorite in the prestigious Kentucky Oaks on Friday. She picked
up the $341,620 purse to push her earnings over $2 million and give
Pegram a rare Oaks-Derby double.
</P>
<P>
   He also stayed for the big race Saturday and played with Baffert
and his entourage. ``That's what friends do,'' Pegram said.
</P>
<P>
   Money Matters
</P>
<P>
   The 125th running of the Kentucky Oaks broke attendance records
for the fifth year in a row. The more than 101,034 people, however,
didn't break the betting record for Oaks day. The on-track handle
was $10,339,112, short of 1998's $10,359,724
</P>
<P>
   Here's the breakdown of the record $1,186,200 purse for the 1999
Kentucky Derby: The winner earned $886,2000; second place,
$170,000; third, $85,000, and fourth, $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the Place to Be
</P>
<P>
   Even with the late scratch of the Dubai-based Aljabr, the
19-horse field exceeded the average for Derby starters in the 1980s
and 1990s. In the past two decades, an average of 16.7 horses
started the race. In the 1960s and 1970s, Derby fields averaged
13.75. Most trainers expect future Derbys to fill the 20-horse
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure you'd rather have 12 or 13 horses, but this is the
biggest show in our sport,'' said Nick Zito, who brought Adonis and
Stephen Got Even here. ``You can't tell your owners, `You can't
bring your horse here.' If it's a good horse, they want to come and
be a part of this phenomenon. It's the place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Riders Rule the Day
</P>
<P>
   In a big Derby field, jockeys are even more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who can see an eighth of a mile ahead is going to win
this race,'' said the trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who had Mike Smith
riding Cat Thief and Chris Antley on Charismatic. ``He'll be making
early moves and planning late ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert said the jockeys would decide who had a chance to
win as they went around the first turn. ``There's a lot of banging
and a good rider will bring his horse through and in position to
win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was relying on last year's winner, Kent Desormeaux, to
do that in guiding the filly Excellent Meeting. Gary Stevens rode
on her entry mate General Challenge, with David Flores on Prime
Timber.

UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD OF INTERNET STOCKS MAKES LITTLE SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you like to know how crazy this stock market is? Really?
Naw, you wouldn't. It will only make you cry if you've been brought
up to believe in the precepts of value investing.
</P>
<P>
   Still want to know? OK, here goes. The Wall Street Journal on
Tuesday had a story showing how far the stock market has gone in
divorcing itself from reality. The article was pegged to a study by
a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst, and revealed the secret of
how to make money investing in the depressed small-company sector.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Penney's research revealed that if you had bought the
stocks of companies in the Russell 2000 index expected to lose
money this year, you'd be making a killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 comprises small companies, usually defined as
those with a market value under $1.5 billion. This means it
includes many Internet-related stocks. As of April 23, Penney
noted, your portfolio would have been up 24.2 percent if you had
invested in the 190 companies expected to either post losses this
year or, at best, have no profit.
</P>
<P>
   But, as they say on the hard-sell commercials, that's not all.
If you had invested in the 1,494 Russell 2000 companies forecasting
a profitable year, your portfolio would be down 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox results from the Bizarro World of Internet stocks.
Get this: Doubleclick, an Internet marketing enterprise,
anticipates a loss of 43 cents a share this year, but its stock was
up more than 670 percent. SportsLine USA, an Internet sports
information company, is pegged by analysts to lose $1.92 a share,
but has scored a 170 percent gain on its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this madness to some of the more spectacular value plays
in the Russell 2000 lineup. Papa John's International, a
pizza-delivery operation, has racked up 20 straight quarters of
year-over-year growth exceeding 20 percent. Despite this remarkable
five-year record, the stock is down 8 percent. This is ``quite
remarkable,'' said an analyst who tracks the stock. Yes, indeed, in
more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   If that fails to bring tears to your eyes, here's another
Bizarro World refugee. Specialty Equipment, which is doing a
land-office business selling its wares to McDonald's restaurants,
has consistently beaten earnings expectations and has been buying
back its own stock. Nevertheless, ``no one cares,'' said an analyst
who follows the company. Its performance lags those of the major
market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   All of this brings to mind the recent observation of an analyst
who mused that some Internet companies were managed as if the
executives in charge didn't want to make a profit. This is no
accident, he contended, because Internet entrepreneurs are afraid
if they generate profits, they'll be judged by investors and
analysts like traditional companies. His point was put into
perspective by America Online's recent experience. Its stock got
hammered after per share quarterly earnings came in nearly triple
what Wall Street expected.
</P>
<P>
   What does this insanity tell us? For one thing, it tells us that
Internet stocks have been the place to be in recent months. In a
less salubrious context, however, it also reminds us that the
madness of crowds historically brings those crowds to grief.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat emptor.

 &HT;    Ripken retirement near
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<P>
   Cal Ripken's back trouble is nothing new. He has successfully
fought off a disc problem in recent seasons with a program of
special strengthening exercises. But with his late father's illness
preoccupying his winter months, Ripken let the exercises slip,
which slowly delivered him to the disabled list once camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   Although he pledged to keep his condition ``private'' as he
tries to restart his season, Ripken is waiting for a series of
cortisone injections to take effect while he works the muscles
around the area. But without improvement, retirement becomes not
just an alternative but a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make decisions all the time,'' Ripken said, ``and this
is a time in my life when I have to look hard at my injury
situation, evaluate that and the whole career and make decisions
and make judgments. That's life, and that's what we do. ...
</P>
<P>
   Boston second baseman Jeff Frye suspected it would cost him his
job when the Red Sox signed Jose Offerman, and he was right as
Frye, while praising manager Jimy Williams, said, ``If I'm not good
enough to be the starting second baseman on a particular team,
maybe I shouldn't be on that team.''

   Plenty of seats at Comiskey
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox might wind up with the worst attendance in the
majors, which puts a smile on the mess in Montreal. Crowds at
Comiskey averaged under 13,000 through the first 10 games. Last
weekend's series with Detroit drew a three-day gate of 36,471,
which doesn't even match the Sunday crowd crosstown at Wrigley
Field, where the Cubs played the Mets before 39,265.
</P>
<P>
   The year before the strike, the White Sox won 94 games while
drawing 2.6 million fans. This year's projection is between 1.5
million and 1.6 million, despite the attraction of Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit bottom,'' said Rob Gallas, the team's vice president
for marketing. ...

   Torii Hunter, rookie center fielder in Minnesota, has crashed
into the wall three times chasing fly balls, including a
homer-saving catch this week. ``I probably run into 20 a year,'' he
said. ``I've been knocked out about 10 times. Actually, probably
more, but I can't remember all of them.'' ... Kansas City's Johnny
Damon was able to keep his consecutive-games streak alive at 180
after his wife delivered twins during an off-day last week. Damon
entered the weekend hitting .211.

   Roster ramifications in Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's acquisition of outfielder Brian Hunter from Detroit
means two things: The Mariners' search for a lead-off hitter
reached the critical stage, and someone else is going to have to go
from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's .298 on-base percentage was lowest in the majors last
season. He becomes the special project of hitting coach Jesse
Barfield. After the Mariners demoted reliever Brett Hinchliffe to
open a spot, the team has been left with 10 pitchers. Butch Huskey,
John Mabry and Matt Mieske are all left fielders and one is on the
way out. ...
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the 50-year celebration of Jackie Robinson's
major-league debut, Texas shortstop Royce Clayton is the only
active player to make a contribution to the Robinson Foundation,
setting up a college endowment with a $100,000 pledge. ... Angels
manager Terry Collins is discounting trainers' reports that
shortstop Gary DiSarcina's broken arm might be healed before the
All-Star break. ``Nothing is etched in stone,'' Collins said.
``I've been etching stuff in stone, and it keeps falling on my
head, so I'm not going to do that.''

 &HT;    Fast pace for Atlantan Barrett
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   NL EAST
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Michael Barrett finally has forced Montreal manager
Felipe Alou to play him daily at third base, a decision that
numbers Shane Andrews' days with the Expos. Barrett, the 1995
first-round pick out of Pace Academy, entered the weekend hitting
.344 with three homers and 12 RBIs while splitting time between
third base and catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrett is learning to play in the big leagues, and it isn't
fair to have him alternating from one position to the other,'' Alou
said. ``I don't think there is any question about Barrett being
able to play third base, and he deserves to play regularly. That's
my plan now.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, 27, asked to be traded during spring camp when told
Barrett would get time with him at third. Barrett's play has caused
a that time-sharing plan, which also included catcher Chris Widger,
to fall apart...

   Florida first baseman Derrek Lee could not contain himself after
making the final out in last Saturday's loss to Atlanta and kicked
a trash can across the Marlins dugout. Unfortunately, it landed on
his manager.

   ``I was just sitting there,'' manager John Boles said, ``and all
of a sudden I was covered with all this stuff.'' Lee apologized.

   Farnsworth gets a shot
</P>
<P>
   The debut of Milton High School product Kyle Farnsworth with the
Chicago Cubs was a surprise last week, but only by a couple of
months. The Cubs had hoped to call up the former 47th-round draft
pick at midseason, but injuries _ six Cubs pitchers are on the DL _
forced the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be here for a couple starts, and more than
likely he'll go back,'' general manger Ed Lynch said. ``I've said
it all along _ when we bring people like Kyle Farnsworth to the
major leagues, we'd like for them to come and stay.'' ... Ex-Brave
Chad Fox, who had become Milwaukee's most trusted reliever, will
have his aching left elbow examined by Birmingham specialist James
Andrews this week. Fox, who underwent Tommy John surgery four years
ago, has had mysterious swelling and pain in the joint all month.
... The Astros' decision to trade away catcher Brad Ausmus is less
popular than ever in Houston, now that rookie Mitch Meluskey might
require shoulder surgery. NL WEST

<P>
   Blame pointed at Pirates
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres say they have video of Pittsburgh's Jason
Schmidt and Turner Ward shining a laser pointer from the Pirates'
dugout during a recent game at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schmidt and Ward deny the charge, but a Padres staff
photographer has blurred vision after Schmidt allegedly shined the
laser into his lens.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hallinan, baseball's director of security, said during the
offseason that MLB will prosecute anyone using one of the laser
devices. ``Those things are dangerous for fans and players,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer, Joel Swink, 44, says he saw Schmidt using the
light before his vision was affected as he looked through his
view-finder. Swink won't say if he is considering legal action. ...
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Brian Bohanon is alone on a new frontier, the first
pitcher in Colorado history to open a season 4-0. The rest of the
rotation is struggling. Until Darryl Kile's victory Thursday, no
other Rockies starter had won a game since the opener.

   ATLANTA _ The Dodgers clubhouse has spit its first bolt. Raul
Mondesi was demoted from the clean-up spot after hitting .143 with
runners in scoring position. His response: hitting a two-run homer
from the No. 5 hole to let Kevin Brown beat Milwaukee 3-2 on
Tuesday _ then Mondesi ripped management.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come they have to change me?'' Mondesi griped. ``We have
nine players. How come I'm always the one who has to change? This
happens to me every year. Every year, it's the same crap. I'm tired
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not manager Davey Johnson's only flashfire. Brown
wrenched his back fielding a Fernando Vina bunt that game. The $105
Million Man already has given up five homers this spring. Last year
in San Diego, Brown yielded just eight homers in 257 innings.

   Cormier, a hunting buddy of Thome, saw him waiting for a cab
after the game and gave him a lift to the Indians' hotel while they
patched things up.

 &HT;    Georgia-Florida at night?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the rowdiness that surrounds the annual
Georgia-Florida football game in Jacksonville, none of the parties
involved has wanted to play the game at night. That situation could
change soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of ESPN, which is negotiating an extension of its
contract with the SEC, the athletics boards at Georgia and Florida
have agreed to allow the game to be played at night this year or
sometime in the future, if CBS does not pick it for the network's
3:30 p.m. national telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, ESPN, whose contract with the SEC ends
after the 2000 season, is promised only one opportunity to televise
the Georgia-Florida game at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have a much cleaner environment with the new
stadium and the surrounding area, we thought this was a restriction
we could lift on a one-time basis,'' Georgia athletics director
Vince Dooley said. ``If the game is managed well, we can talk about
whether or not we will do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of CBS passing on the Georgia-Florida game this year
are slim. The other SEC games set for Oct. 30 are Auburn-Arkansas,
Ole Miss-LSU and Tennessee-South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn may be under lights
</P>
<P>
   Dooley, with the approval of his athletics board, made another
concession to help the SEC improve the value of its TV package with
ESPN. The Georgia-Auburn game in Athens on Nov. 13, which in years
past could start no later than 5:30 p.m., will be made available
for a night broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dooley agreed to make as many as two of Georgia's six
home games available at night for ESPN. Dooley said he will not
change his policy against Thursday night games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes
</P>
<P>
   _ When a talented freshman like Duke's Corey Maggette talks
about turning pro, the natural assumption is that an agent is
whispering in his ear. But there are strong rumors in the ACC that
the Chicago native has heard from the hometown NBA Bulls, who have
promised to groom him as the next Michael Jordan if he comes out
now. If that turns to be true, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, also a
Chicago native, will not forget.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sophomore quarterback Tim Olmstead will transfer from Florida.
The former Parade All-American from Woodberry Forest, Va., never
was able to fully grasp the complex offense of coach Steve
Spurrier. The Gators have two freshman quarterbacks, Rex Grossman
and Chris Stephens, joining the team this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville has told five players,
including redshirt freshman wide receiver Willie Northern, that
their scholarships would not be renewed. The others are offensive
tackle Brandon Taylor, linebacker Manning Sumner, defensive end
Brian Parchinski and center Shawn Bushong.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee's spring tour of its booster clubs, known as the Big
Orange Caravan, will stop in Atlanta on May 11 with golf and dinner
at the Crooked Creek Golf Club. Football coach Phillip Fulmer and
basketball coach Jerry Green are scheduled to attend. For more
information call Kristen Olkowski at 404-636-1979.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Mexico State athletics director Jim Paul is leaving the
school to join the presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.

 &HT;    Cowboys uncertain Sanders will return
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The medical term for the injury that forced
Deion Sanders into surgery on Wednesday is ``hyperdorsiflexion of
the first metatarsal phalangeal joint.'' By any name, though, the
injury spells trouble for Dallas, which began a weekend mini-camp
here on Friday uncertain of the star cornerback's future.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon Bill Hamilton spent three hours repairing the big toe on
Sanders' left foot but even conservative estimates put the rehab at
four months. What no one is saying aloud: A similar injury ended
the Hall of Fame tenure of Steelers linebacker Jack Lambert in '85
and is regarded as career-threatening for Sanders as well.
</P>
<P>
   The situation leaves owner Jerry Jones and coach Chan Gailey in
a tough spot. Sanders has a salary cap figure of $8.2 million. As
he did with Troy Aikman recently, Jones was hoping to negotiate an
extension to reduce that. But how can Jones huddle with agent
Eugene Parker and talk about a $10 million signing bonus when no
one is sure when or if Sanders, who turns 32 in August, will play?
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gailey is using Kevin Mathis at the corner spot
opposite Kevin Smith. But the Cowboys last week studied tape of
free agent corners Ashley Ambrose, Ryan McNeil, Cris Dishman and
Darrien Gordon and could sign one of them. The Cowboys will already
be without defensive tackle Leon Lett for at least a portion of the
season because of a positive drug test, so the defensive front
already is dented.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia star Champ Bailey had an auspicious debut in the
Redskins mini-camp, intercepting the first pass thrown at him. ...
Dallas may sign free agent quarterback Neil O'Donnell. ... A huge
element in owner Bob Kraft's decision to back out of the deal that
would have moved the Patriots to Hartford was that environmental
factors would have prohibited the team from playing there until
2003 at the earliest. ...Two reasons the Dallas draft was panned:
Three prospects were off most boards because of medical problems
and three failed drug tests in college. ... It won't be official
for a week, but Pittsburgh reached accord with quarterback Kordell
Stewart on a three-year extension through 2003. The deal includes
$22.45 million in ``new money,'' with a signing bonus of $8.1
million. ... Barry Sanders continues to send signals he's not
thrilled with the state of the Lions. As anticipated, he skipped
mini-camp and was fined $488 a day by coach Bobby Ross. He is 1,458
yards shy of supplanting Walter Payton as the NFL's career leader,
but is more concerned with winning. Preposterous as it sounds,
Sanders could sit out this season. Detroit is just 78-82 since he
arrived in '89 and has used 10 starting quarterbacks in that time.
Only Rodney Peete (47) and Scott Mitchell (57) had more than 15
starts. ... One more sign St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil is in a
must-win situation: The Rams cut guard Zach Wiegert, the team's
``transition'' free agent. Club president John Shaw and vice
president Jay Zygmunt were among the many Rams officials who
disagreed with Vermeil's ill-advised assessment of Wiegert. ...
Seattle wideout Joey Galloway, eligible for free agency next
spring, had a terrific mini-camp. One Seahawks coach timed Galloway
at an astonishing 4.19 in the 40. ...Miami coach Jimmy Johnson
isn't surprised the running back landscape has changed so
dramatically in the AFC East. ``With me, Jim Mora and Bill
Parcells, you have coaches who want to run the football,'' Johnson
said. ``No one throws 40 times a game anymore.'' In two years, the
division has undergone dramatic makeover. Antowain Smith (Buffalo)
took over for Thurman Thomas and Curtis Martin (Jets) for Adrian
Murrell in '97. This year, first-round pick Edgerrin James replaces
Marshall Faulk in Indy. The Patriots' Pete Carroll will consider
several candidates, including Kevin Faulk, to replace injured
Robert Edwards. And Johnson seems confident rookies James Johnson
or Rob Konrad will oust Karim Abdul-Jabbar. ... The Raiders quietly
hired New Orleans assistant general manager Chet Franklin. ...
Pittsburgh will release former first-round offensive tackle Jamain
Stephens after June 1. ... Colts line coach Howard Mudd felt
third-rounder Brandon Burlsworth, killed last week in a car
accident, would challenge Tony Mandarich for the starting job at
right guard.

BOAT ROMANTICS GATHER WITH THEIR HANDMADE BEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Ore., Texas, Wyo.)  (rk) 
 By   TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECEPTION PASS, Wash. _ In the upper left-hand corner of the
country, up where Puget Sound is littered with low, rocky islands,
about 65 hand-built boats lined the beach of a quiet, fog-filled
bay last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There was a three-person touring craft inspired by Aleutian
fur-trading boats, open Alaskan rowboats known as umiaks, boats for
hunting caribou west of the Hudson Bay, and kayaks from East
Greenland, West Greenland and Southwest Greenland, with those from
each area distinct. And there were people who could tell them all
apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth Skin Boat Gathering here, scores of people from as
far away as Japan and Texas met to admire and learn about handmade,
skin-covered boats _ mostly kayaks, with wood or aluminum or
titanium frames, covered in nylon or canvas, the modern substitute
for sealskin.
</P>
<P>
   Skin boats are lighter than those made of fiberglass or plastic,
and they draw on indigenous design that has evolved over centuries.
Their proponents have revolted against what they call the
``over-the-counter culture'' of prefabricated, store-bought plastic
or fiberglass boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a romance,'' said Corey Freedman, who runs a
skin-boat building school in nearby Anacortes. ``People just fall
in love with them, and they don't know why. It has to do with the
elegance and the shape of the boats, the esthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman organized the gathering, which was advertised, mostly
by e-mail, as an ``informal, noncommercial, free education event.''
</P>
<P>
   Maligiaq Padilla, 17, the guest of honor, performed some of the
32 kayak maneuvers known as Eskimo rolls that he had learned in his
native Greenland. He became the youngest national kayak champion
last year. He capsized the boat and righted himself _ a 360-degree
roll _ using his paddle, a 2-foot-long harpoon stick, or just a
closed fist. All the while, Padilla was wedged into the kayak's
15-inch cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd of about 100, in wet suits, life jackets and
an occasional loin cloth, gave various reasons for their love of
skin boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about this arena of recreation is the
personal innovation, the intuitive evolution, that has been taken
away by the production line, by the boats that have been poured
from cans into molds,'' said Steve Kaspar of Martinez, Calif., who
had brought along his two-person aluminum baidarka, an Aleutian sea
kayak.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Heath, 76, of Houston, has studied kayaks for 45 years.
``A kayak to me is like a violin that lasts, and has changed so
little in hundreds of years,'' he said. ``Why mess with the design?
A 300-year-old Stradivarius doesn't look out of place today.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Golden, 28, of Portland, Ore., brought eight skin boats
he had built from boats he had seen in museums, one weighing as
little as 20 pounds and one designed to point directly into the
wind, for negotiating the gusty fiords of Greenland. He has studied
40 Arctic boats, he said, ``and I never found one to be badly or
poorly designed at all.''
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Golden's brother and sister-in-law, Dan Golden and Edith
Casterline, spent part of their honeymoon on the Columbia River in
a three-holer that Dan Golden built from designs made soon after
the first Russian made contact with the Aleutian Islanders about a
century ago. The center hole was reserved for the Russian hunter,
who shot otters while the natives paddled.
</P>
<P>
   Antonella Novi was 16 when she built her baidarka as part of a
school humanities project. ``Because I built it in the winter, I
really felt the coldness of building a boat, like they did in
Alaska,'' she said, recalling the hours she spent lashing the cedar
ribs to the frame. ``It really brought it home to my fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Gaydos, a Wyoming iron worker who had paddled for seven
weeks across northern Alaska, brought a birch-bark canoe to the

Minnesota woods to lash it together. The birch bark is peeled

   Sara Ballenger, 23, a student at Western Washington University

Ms. Ballenger, who has cerebral palsy and enjoys helping people
exercise away from the mechanical devices like wheelchairs and
scooters that they use on land.

   Though her only previous woodworking experience dated to sixth
grade, she loved building her own boat. ``It really does have a

thing, and people are so moved by the boat. It's my baby. I made
it, and it takes me where I want to go.''

 &HT;    Refugees say Serbs fortifying towns

   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ Childrens' games of hide-and-seek
at the 17 November Primary School over the border in Prizren have
given way to a more deadly competition: the Serbian Yugoslav army
has cloistered troops and arms there to save them from NATO bomb
attacks, according to refugees who arrived here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city that in the last two days has disgorged
thousands of ethnic Albanians, the Serb military has hidden troops,
camouflaged tanks and secreted civilian trucks laden with arms and
ammunition, the refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, refugees from other towns and villages also
have spoken of tanks and troops being sheltered in homes and
schools, as the NATO bombing campaign has intensified. They have
described widespread military trenching works, mostly undertaken by
young Kosovar men pulled from their families and forced to build
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO undertake to clear a safe zone or enclave in Kosovo,
especially once its Apache attack helicopters are operational, this
southernmost part of Yugoslavia is a likely first target.
</P>
<P>
   A cross-section of refugees in the new surge of exiles described
districts of Prizren, a municipal area of more than 100,000 people,
as being virtually emptied of civilians in recent days as more
troops entered the city. Life has become increasingly difficult,
they said, with diminished food supplies and harassing troops and
police especially on the lookout for young men to draft for work
gangs over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 18,000 refugees crossed this border Friday and
Saturday, and another 10,000 from the Prizren area had been
expected to move into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Among refugees interviewed here, several cited the 17 November
Primary School, named for the day that partisan fighters liberated
Prizren from the Nazis in World War II, as a makeshift arms depot
put off-limits to local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw soldiers and ammunition in this school,'' said Shefkat
Haliti, 34, who lives about half a mile from the school. ``There
were trucks covered with plastic sheets. They aren't military
trucks but trucks taken from the people. There were boxes of
ammunition in the trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bekim Saramat, 24, who crossed into Albania Saturday afternoon
with his pregnant wife and a younger brother, said the school and
many other civilian properties have been taken over by Serbian
Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put sandbags in front of the school and in the road so no
one can get through,'' he said. ``I live near the palace of
culture, and they are there too. There is a tank there. It's in the
road with sandbags around it. They put old carpets on top of the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Saramat listed factories now housing troops and supplies as
Printex, a printing plant, Communa, a shoe factory, Perlonka, a
textile factory, and a fourth called Progress.
</P>
<P>
   He said a storehouse formerly used for humanitarian supplies of
the Catholic Relief Services has been emptied with the goods given
to police and is now being used to house tanks and military
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to protect it,'' Saramat said. ``If NATO comes in
maybe they will need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factory called Pharmokoz, apparently a former
pharmaceuticals plant, was described by several refugees as a
military base and arms depot. It also was said to contain artillery
units that in earlier weeks fired on positions of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Others said trucks, either civilian or military ones in
camouflage, have been driven to the outer residential areas of
Prizren and parked in narrow streets lined with houses in an effort
to hide them.
</P>
<P>
   There also were multiple reports of ethnic Albanians being
driven out of their homes, which were turned into shelters for
small groups of soldiers or paramilitary troops. This was
especially true around a military barracks that refugees said had
been bombed in a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Again on Saturday, arriving refugees reported seeing ethnic
Albanians making defensive trenches around the town of Zhur,
located just two to three miles north of the Yugoslav-Albanian
border. Some said they recognized friends whom had been taken away
by Serb forces digging in the work gangs, clothed in old military
jumpsuits.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Some of the nation's largest banks _ including
First Union and Nationsbank _ are based here, solidifying North
Carolina's reputation as the banking state. But if honest North
Carolinians have no trouble finding a bank, neither do bank
robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though bank robbery has been declining nationwide, the
crime has become remarkably common here. The state's banks, credit
unions and savings institutions were robbed 289 times last year, a
38 percent jump from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While numbers are not yet fully reported, North Carolina's rise
in bank robberies last year appears to be near the nation's
highest, according to the FBI, North Carolina had 38.9 for each
million people last year, compared with Illinois and New Jersey,
which had 21 and 11 robberies per million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's tally was so high that the FBI's field office
in Charlotte, which covers the entire state, ranked fourth
nationwide last year in the number of reported bank robberies,
trailing only Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While bank officials are concerned about the rising number of
robberies in North Carolina, they have not taken harsh measures to
prevent them. In fact, the banks' friendliness to customers _
revered locally as Southern hospitality _ may increase the
frequency of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives say robberies are a hazard of the industry. No
one has a good explanation as to why the number of robberies is up
one year and down the next. ``I don't know how you avoid them,''
Harold T. Keen, president of KS Bank in Kenly, N.C., said. ``This
is not something that happens every month. And you don't want to
have so much security that you inconvenience your customers.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many banks concentrated in its urban areas, North
Carolina has become a modern-day version of the Wild West, where
holding up stage coaches became a national pastime. The two crimes
are remarkably similar, law enforcement officials say, in that they
are sometimes so randomly planned that many criminals settle on a
target on the basis of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank robbery is a crime of opportunity,'' said Mark Rozzi, a
special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Charlotte
office. ``The banks in North Carolina have a lot of branches that
pride themselves on being friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbing banks has changed little since Bonnie and Clyde became
household names in the 1930s. Then as now, the number of bank
holdups appeared to have less correlation with the economy's health
than with the personalities of the robbers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank robbers are antisocial,'' Dr. Ken Tardiss, a specialist
in violent crime and a professor of psychiatry at the Weill Medical
College of Cornell University, said. ``The economy may be doing
well for some people but not for them. Or they may just want more
money and have a feeling that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a bank robber has experienced the thrill of a holdup, it is
difficult to abandon the glare of a security camera. Some 20
percent of the bank robbers who were convicted nationwide last year
were repeat offenders; two of the most active were in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One, Mark Vernon Brindell, an unemployed landscaper from Wake
Forest, was sentenced last year to five years in federal prison for
holding up seven banks near Raleigh. The other, Isaiah Belcher III,
was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for robbing eight banks
near Durham. Between them, Brindell and Belcher committed 5.2
percent of the state's bank robberies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI maintains that there is no stereotypical bank
robber, some crime experts insist that bank robbers are among the
dumbest thugs going. One North Carolina robber several years ago
actually wrote the holdup note on the back of his deposit slip,
while another tried to rob a bank's drive-through window from the
back seat of a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not physicists,'' said Thad Woodard,
president of the North Carolina Bankers Association. ``A lot of
times they are on drugs and need money to support their habit.''
</P>
<P>
   While some robbers do wear disguises, most enter banks wearing
street clothes, hand tellers written instructions and then make
quiet getaways.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. A masked man entered a KS Bank in
October and wasted little time terrorizing the place. Hopping over
the counter, he pushed the teller aside and yanked open the money
drawer. As he grabbed stacks of bills, he shouted obscenities, bank
officials said, until he leaped back over the counter and fled. He
has yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled last year by the FBI in North
Carolina, a majority of bank robberies occurred on Fridays between
9 and 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason these robberies happened when they did?'' Rozzi
said. ``The robbers wanted money for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in North Carolina solved 70 percent of the state's bank
robbery cases last year, well ahead of the 60 percent rate in the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this is that bank robberies are just a
foolish crime,'' Rozzi said. ``There are easier ways to get more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials balk at releasing amounts taken during robberies,
but crime experts insist that most of the time the loot is
insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   FBI statistics for North Carolina put the average take last year
at $11,722, slightly above the nationwide average of $9,266, but
the numbers were skewed by several vault robberies. Many robbers
get only a few thousand dollars, bank officials said, since they
take money primarily out of teller drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most banks in the United States, branches in the
Southeast seldom use common security measures like armed guards or
bulletproof glass to protect tellers. Some bank officials say these
measures would upset customers, who have grown accustomed to
niceties like free coffee and personal greetings by branch
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that we have a different way of doing
business down here,'' Woodard said. ``Customers don't want to be
frightened or overly stressed by security. Some customers feel so
welcome here that they carry the teller a card or cake on her
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the banks were prone to a few other mishaps.
Since the average teller nationwide works only six to nine months
before quitting, it is difficult to provide extensive security
training. All too often, law enforcement officials say,
inexperienced tellers are unable to find the marked bills during a
robbery or give the holdup note back when the robber did not ask
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the rise in robberies, several banks are
experimenting with new security technology. One program that has
been particularly successful is the $5,000 reward set up by the
North Carolina Bankers Association for information leading to the
arrest and indictment of someone who robbed any of its member
banks. A prime source of information is the robbers' friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs appear to be lowering the number of bank
robberies in North Carolina, but law enforcement officials remain
cautious. In a meeting last month with other agents from the FBI's
office in Raleigh, one senior agent, John Werner, noted that the
rising number of bank robberies in the state was beginning to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been speaking for about half an hour,'' Werner
said. ``And by the time I had finished, two more banks had been
robbed.''

 &HT;    Gordon slump gives rivals hope
 &HT;    By Mark Schalbach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Jeff Gordon couldn't run away with his third
Winston Cup title in a row in the first three months of the season,
leaving championship hopes for several other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the Winston Cup champion three of the last four seasons,
is fifth in points entering today's California 500 at California
Speedway, trailing leader Jeff Burton by 210.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's recent problems _ three DNFs in nine events, including
a 38th-place finish in last week's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway _ have given several drivers, including Burton, Dale
Jarrett and Mark Martin, hopes for a first title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's nice that we have the talk about the
championship,'' said Jarrett, who trails Burton by 40 points.
``It's something that you have to concentrate on right from the
very beginning ... you have to race every single race with that
championship in mind. You can't have an off-week.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Jarrett were knocked out of the season-opening
Daytona 500 in the same multicar pileup, but they've had only one
off-day since. Both drivers have finished outside the top 10 only
once in the last eight events. Burton had victories at Las Vegas
and Darlington, while Jarrett is still searching for his first win
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is a little frustrating, but on the other hand, I
know we have 25 races left and we're doing the right things now,''
Jarrett said. ``Jeff Gordon has had his problems, but he's still
very much in striking distance. I heard somebody say that they
weren't sure that (Gordon) could make up that point differential.
Of course, you just have to laugh a little bit at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was second to Gordon in points last season, says he
welcomes the parity, but the added pressure that accompanies it
``takes a lot of the fun out of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   With consecutive top-five finishes at Martinsville and
Talladega, Martin climbed to third in points. He slipped to sixth
in the standings after a wreck and 34th-place outing at Texas Motor
Speedway on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been in this position before. He was fifth in points
a year ago, trailing leader Rusty Wallace by 73 after nine events.
Gordon finished fourth at California, and then won at Charlotte two
weeks later to regain the points lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett says he expects more of the same from Gordon. ``Yes,
Jeff Gordon is still the one to beat. He's the only one in the top
five who has won a championship. The rest of us have to prove we
can get it done.

   NAZARETH, Pa. _ For a small band of Champ Car drivers, life
doesn't necessarily slow down once they have climbed out of the
cockpit. Win or lose, the good times for these twenty-something
bachelors start after the race is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Moore, Max Papis, Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan, all
rising stars on the Championship Auto Racing Teams open-wheel
racing circuit, are known loosely as the Brat Pack, a nickname
derived from the Frank Sinatra-led Rat Pack, which enlivened
Hollywood's party scene in the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sinatra's clique, Moore, Papis, Franchitti and Kanaan are
drawn together by an intense appetite for fun and all-night
parties. Whether they are judging beauty contests in Surfers
Paradise, Australia, or borrowing Harley-Davidsons for a ride up
the California coast, or staying up till dawn in Elkhart Lake,
Wis., or traveling from race to race in Moore's motor coach, these
guys know how to enjoy life.
</P>
<P>
   But for two hours on the track, Moore, Papis, Franchitti and
Kanaan put their friendship aside and have nothing on their minds
but being first to the finish. On Sunday, they are at the Bosch
Spark Plug 200at Nazareth Speedway, the fourth of 20 CART Fedex
championship series races this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all kind of get along,'' said Franchitti, who came into his
own last season, winning three races in the Team Kool Green
Honda/Reynard. ``We're different in a lot of ways, but we're also
incredibly similar. When we're on the road, they are like my
family. But when qualifying starts, they are the opposition. We can
all flick that switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The four are talented drivers who just happen to be young,
single and free to enjoy some of the world's most stimulating
cities, from Miami to Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   But, to a man, they are dedicated to their job, and they are
very good at what they do. Moore, 24, driver of the Player's
Mercedes/Reynard, is the CART points leader this season and is
favored to take his first series title, while Franchitti
(pronounced Fran-CHEE-ti), 25, is considered to have an outside
chance of capturing the title. Papis (PAP-iss), 29, driver of Team
Rahal's Ford/Reynard, and Kanaan (CAY-nen), 24, driver of
McDonald's Honda/Reynard, are with strong teams and want to climb
the Champ Car ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can give yourself freedom,'' said Papis, the group's
self-proclaimed leader, ``but you have to know your limitations.
I'm not a party animal. I'm a human being. Trying to achieve goals
in life shouldn't prevent you from enjoying life.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of their nocturnal adventures are kept secret by the
pack's members, there are plenty of wild nights that have become
conversational fodder in the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the night after Franchitti's first-ever
victory last season at Elkhart Lake, when the pack celebrated at
the best (and only) tavern in town. At 4 a.m., the party was just
getting started. Needless to say, Franchitti was not on his 8 a.m.
flight home to Scotland. And Papis stopped to take a nap on the
lawn in front of his hotel; it was, after all, on the way back to
his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning they found me in bed,'' Papis said, ``wearing
all of my clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   And their friendship helps counterbalance the intensity and
loneliness of competition on one of auto racing's toughest
circuits. ``Because we're on the road so much,'' said Moore, who
invited Franchitti to spend a week at his family's home near
Vancouver, British Columbia, before last season's Molson Indy,
``it's nice to have friends. We're all similar ages and have
similar interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The four rarely discuss racing away from the track, instead
preferring to talk about women, golf and just about anything else.
There are exceptions, however, when shop talk is permitted and,
indeed, required: like that final-lap pass on the final turn of the
Long Beach Grand Prix, when Moore overtook Papis.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes there are friendly wagers within the group, like
the $5 Australian that Franchitti claimed from Moore after taking
the pole position at last year's Surfers Paradise Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did when I got out of the car was go looking
for Greg,'' Franchitti said. ``He's a very confident sort and he
thought for sure he would win the pole. I enjoy beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks from now, the Brat Pack will be in Rio de Janeiro, and
Kanaan, who is from that part of Brazil, will be in charge of
showing his guests a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's time to have fun, we have fun,'' Papis said. ``My
philosophy is you better do it the way you drive your race car: 110
percent.''

UNDER SIEGE BY STRAY CATS AND STRANGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW PALTZ, N.Y. _ Robert Feldman, a New Paltz village trustee,
conceded that the Village Board had tried this ruse before:
floating a provocative proposal to force residents to confront a
difficult problem. It's just that none of the proposals had ever
involved killing stray cats.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the idea, and now New Paltz is in the cross hairs
of cat fanciers from up and down the Hudson River Valley. They have
been generous with long-term advice about the village's cat problem
(``educate people'' was a refrain at a recent town meeting), but
short on the kind of here-and-now help that a dozen homeowners in
the Millrock neighborhood are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The residents say it has been more than a year since a neighbor
began feeding a handful of strays in his yard, and now they say
there may be as many as 100 howling, digging, copulating and
defecating cats shredding flower beds and gardens, chasing away
songbirds and leaving lawns under attack by beetles no longer kept
in check by starlings and cowbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what to do anymore,'' said Toni Simone, who
lives down the street from where Caleb Roderick, a retired merchant
seaman, holds his cat feedings. Sixteen people showed up for a
hearing last week, two from the village and the rest cat defenders
drawn here by news accounts of the proposed slaughter. They were
clear about their love for cats, but they left their feelings
toward humans a little in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize that your children are going to grow up as
harsh-minded as you are?'' Cathy Anderson, a member of Citizens
League for Animal Protection, asked Feldman. Fed up, Feldman
stalked out. (``I don't have to take that kind of abuse,'' he said
later. ``I'm not the president of the United States.'')
</P>
<P>
   Other board members got off no easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in a supermarket checkout line and you're standing
next to someone with AIDS or someone who is incubating influenza,
would you want to shoot them, too?'' a woman from Woodstock asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think euthanizing cats and shooting people is quite
the same thing,'' Mayor Thomas Nyquist, who was worried about
feline diseases, tried to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same thing, and it's the next thing,'' the woman
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't control something, you just want to kill it,'' a
third woman interjected.
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders accused residents of exaggerating the problem,
saying that Roderick fed only about 30 cats. Roderick might have
resolved the discrepancy, but he did not answer his door or return
three phone messages left at his house.
</P>
<P>
   But the cat foes had other statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four bird feeders, and we used to go through 400
pounds of bird seed in a year,'' said Judith Bogdanowicz, a high
school Spanish teacher who lives next door to Roderick. ``This
winter I bought a 40-pound bag down at Agway, and it's rotting into
the feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Simon, a naturalist who has written several books on birds
and insects, says the cats have altered the ecological balance of
the neighborhood as birds have fled or been eaten and insects have
proliferated. ``We used to have wrens in our wren house, and robins
and starlings and hundreds of other kinds,'' she said. ``They have
all packed up and left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village Board could find no easy solution. ``We tried all
the official routes _ the Department of Environmental Conservation,
the State Health Department _ and they all had their jurisdictions
that we weren't part of,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the village hired the Citizens League to remove the
cats. Its volunteers took about 35, but then released more than a
dozen back to Roderick. So the board fired the league and played
its gambit, telling local reporters that it was death to the cats.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. A shelter in Middletown called Pets Alive (``We don't
believe in euthanasia as a final solution,'' says its telephone
message) came forward, and has promised to take all the cats away
permanently. By the end of last week, it had collected 12.
</P>
<P>
   But what if new strays replace them? ``We're going to solve the
immediate situation, and we're going to pass a cat law,'' said
Laura Zeisel, another trustee. ``But what I'm concerned about is,
is it all going to start over again later?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Some of the nation's largest banks _ including
First Union and Nationsbank _ are based here, solidifying North
Carolina's reputation as the banking state. But if honest North
Carolinians have no trouble finding a bank, neither do bank
robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though bank robbery has been declining nationwide, the
crime has become remarkably common here. The state's banks, credit
unions and savings institutions were robbed 289 times last year, a
38 percent jump from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While numbers are not yet fully reported, North Carolina's rise
in bank robberies last year appears to be near the nation's
highest, according to the FBI, North Carolina had 38.9 for each
million people last year, compared with Illinois and New Jersey,
which had 21 and 11 robberies per million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's tally was so high that the FBI's field office
in Charlotte, which covers the entire state, ranked fourth
nationwide last year in the number of reported bank robberies,
trailing only Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While bank officials are concerned about the rising number of
robberies in North Carolina, they have not taken harsh measures to
prevent them. In fact, the banks' friendliness to customers _
revered locally as Southern hospitality _ may increase the
frequency of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives say robberies are a hazard of the industry. No
one has a good explanation as to why the number of robberies is up
one year and down the next. ``I don't know how you avoid them,''
Harold T. Keen, president of KS Bank in Kenly, N.C., said. ``This
is not something that happens every month. And you don't want to
have so much security that you inconvenience your customers.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many banks concentrated in its urban areas, North
Carolina has become a modern-day version of the Wild West, where
holding up stage coaches became a national pastime. The two crimes
are remarkably similar, law enforcement officials say, in that they
are sometimes so randomly planned that many criminals settle on a
target on the basis of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank robbery is a crime of opportunity,'' said Mark Rozzi, a
special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Charlotte
office. ``The banks in North Carolina have a lot of branches that
pride themselves on being friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbing banks has changed little since Bonnie and Clyde became
household names in the 1930s. Then as now, the number of bank
holdups appeared to have less correlation with the economy's health
than with the personalities of the robbers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank robbers are antisocial,'' Dr. Ken Tardiss, a specialist
in violent crime and a professor of psychiatry at the Weill Medical
College of Cornell University, said. ``The economy may be doing
well for some people but not for them. Or they may just want more
money and have a feeling that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a bank robber has experienced the thrill of a holdup, it is
difficult to abandon the glare of a security camera. Some 20
percent of the bank robbers who were convicted nationwide last year
were repeat offenders; two of the most active were in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One, Mark Vernon Brindell, an unemployed landscaper from Wake
Forest, was sentenced last year to five years in federal prison for
holding up seven banks near Raleigh. The other, Isaiah Belcher III,
was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for robbing eight banks
near Durham. Between them, Brindell and Belcher committed 5.2
percent of the state's bank robberies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI maintains that there is no stereotypical bank
robber, some crime experts insist that bank robbers are among the
dumbest thugs going. One North Carolina robber several years ago
actually wrote the holdup note on the back of his deposit slip,
while another tried to rob a bank's drive-through window from the
back seat of a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not physicists,'' said Thad Woodard,
president of the North Carolina Bankers Association. ``A lot of
times they are on drugs and need money to support their habit.''
</P>
<P>
   While some robbers do wear disguises, most enter banks wearing
street clothes, hand tellers written instructions and then make
quiet getaways.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. A masked man entered a KS Bank in
October and wasted little time terrorizing the place. Hopping over
the counter, he pushed the teller aside and yanked open the money
drawer. As he grabbed stacks of bills, he shouted obscenities, bank
officials said, until he leaped back over the counter and fled. He
has yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled last year by the FBI in North
Carolina, a majority of bank robberies occurred on Fridays between
9 and 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason these robberies happened when they did?'' Rozzi
said. ``The robbers wanted money for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in North Carolina solved 70 percent of the state's bank
robbery cases last year, well ahead of the 60 percent rate in the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this is that bank robberies are just a
foolish crime,'' Rozzi said. ``There are easier ways to get more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials balk at releasing amounts taken during robberies,
but crime experts insist that most of the time the loot is
insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   FBI statistics for North Carolina put the average take last year
at $11,722, slightly above the nationwide average of $9,266, but
the numbers were skewed by several vault robberies. Many robbers
get only a few thousand dollars, bank officials said, since they
take money primarily out of teller drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most banks in the United States, branches in the
Southeast seldom use common security measures like armed guards or
bulletproof glass to protect tellers. Some bank officials say these
measures would upset customers, who have grown accustomed to
niceties like free coffee and personal greetings by branch
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that we have a different way of doing
business down here,'' Woodard said. ``Customers don't want to be
frightened or overly stressed by security. Some customers feel so
welcome here that they carry the teller a card or cake on her
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the banks were prone to a few other mishaps.
Since the average teller nationwide works only six to nine months
before quitting, it is difficult to provide extensive security
training. All too often, law enforcement officials say,
inexperienced tellers are unable to find the marked bills during a
robbery or give the holdup note back when the robber did not ask
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the rise in robberies, several banks are
experimenting with new security technology. One program that has
been particularly successful is the $5,000 reward set up by the
North Carolina Bankers Association for information leading to the
arrest and indictment of someone who robbed any of its member
banks. A prime source of information is the robbers' friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs appear to be lowering the number of bank
robberies in North Carolina, but law enforcement officials remain
cautious. In a meeting last month with other agents from the FBI's
office in Raleigh, one senior agent, John Werner, noted that the
rising number of bank robberies in the state was beginning to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been speaking for about half an hour,'' Werner
said. ``And by the time I had finished, two more banks had been
robbed.''

   Robbing banks has changed little since Bonnie and Clyde became
household names in the 1930s. Then as now, the number of bank
holdups appeared to have less correlation with the economy's health
than with the personalities of the robbers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank robbers are antisocial,'' Dr. Ken Tardiss, a specialist
in violent crime and a professor of psychiatry at the Weill Medical
College of Cornell University, said. ``The economy may be doing
well for some people but not for them. Or they may just want more
money and have a feeling that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a bank robber has experienced the thrill of a holdup, it is
difficult to abandon the glare of a security camera. Some 20
percent of the bank robbers who were convicted nationwide last year
were repeat offenders; two of the most active were in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One, Mark Vernon Brindell, an unemployed landscaper from Wake
Forest, was sentenced last year to five years in federal prison for
holding up seven banks near Raleigh. The other, Isaiah Belcher III,
was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for robbing eight banks
near Durham. Between them, Brindell and Belcher committed 5.2
percent of the state's bank robberies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI maintains that there is no stereotypical bank
robber, some crime experts insist that bank robbers are among the
dumbest thugs going. One North Carolina robber several years ago
actually wrote the holdup note on the back of his deposit slip,
while another tried to rob a bank's drive-through window from the
back seat of a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not physicists,'' said Thad Woodard,
president of the North Carolina Bankers Association. ``A lot of
times they are on drugs and need money to support their habit.''
</P>
<P>
   While some robbers do wear disguises, most enter banks wearing
street clothes, hand tellers written instructions and then make
quiet getaways.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. A masked man entered a KS Bank in
October and wasted little time terrorizing the place. Hopping over
the counter, he pushed the teller aside and yanked open the money
drawer. As he grabbed stacks of bills, he shouted obscenities, bank
officials said, until he leaped back over the counter and fled. He
has yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled last year by the FBI in North
Carolina, a majority of bank robberies occurred on Fridays between
9 and 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason these robberies happened when they did?'' Rozzi
said. ``The robbers wanted money for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in North Carolina solved 70 percent of the state's bank
robbery cases last year, well ahead of the 60 percent rate in the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this is that bank robberies are just a
foolish crime,'' Rozzi said. ``There are easier ways to get more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials balk at releasing amounts taken during robberies,
but crime experts insist that most of the time the loot is
insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   FBI statistics for North Carolina put the average take last year
at $11,722, slightly above the nationwide average of $9,266, but
the numbers were skewed by several vault robberies. Many robbers
get only a few thousand dollars, bank officials said, since they
take money primarily out of teller drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most banks in the United States, branches in the
Southeast seldom use common security measures like armed guards or
bulletproof glass to protect tellers. Some bank officials say these
measures would upset customers, who have grown accustomed to
niceties like free coffee and personal greetings by branch
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that we have a different way of doing
business down here,'' Woodard said. ``Customers don't want to be
frightened or overly stressed by security. Some customers feel so
welcome here that they carry the teller a card or cake on her
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the banks were prone to a few other mishaps.
Since the average teller nationwide works only six to nine months
before quitting, it is difficult to provide extensive security
training. All too often, law enforcement officials say,
inexperienced tellers are unable to find the marked bills during a
robbery or give the holdup note back when the robber did not ask
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the rise in robberies, several banks are
experimenting with new security technology. One program that has
been particularly successful is the $5,000 reward set up by the
North Carolina Bankers Association for information leading to the
arrest and indictment of someone who robbed any of its member
banks. A prime source of information is the robbers' friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs appear to be lowering the number of bank
robberies in North Carolina, but law enforcement officials remain
cautious. In a meeting last month with other agents from the FBI's
office in Raleigh, one senior agent, John Werner, noted that the
rising number of bank robberies in the state was beginning to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been speaking for about half an hour,'' Werner
said. ``And by the time I had finished, two more banks had been
robbed.''

 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   His curse turned into his blessing. As the Denver Broncos'
quarterback in three embarrassing Super Bowl losses, it was as if
John Elway had a tattoo that read, ``Can't win the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Broncos were not the better team on any of
those three Super Bowl Sundays against the Giants, the Washington
Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers, he was the losing
quarterback. And the losing quarterback always gets the blame.
</P>
<P>
   But all that blame kept John Elway playing when his battered
body would have preferred to surrender. ``I would love another
chance,'' he said before the 1995 season. ``I want to retire a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with two consecutive Super Bowl rings, John Elway will
retire as a champion. Tattoos aren't supposed to disappear, but his
have. And for all of the arrows he has thrown with that archer's
bow of an arm, he made that tattoo disappear two seasons ago in
Super Bowl XXXII in San Diego by scrambling instead of passing.
</P>
<P>
   With the score, 17-17, late in the third quarter, Elway's
obsession to retire a champion was at stake. The Broncos had a
third-and-6 at the 12-yard line, but the Green Bay Packers had just
stuffed Terrell Davis for only a 1-yard gain. If the Broncos didn't
get a first down, they would have to kick a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the snap in the shotgun formation, Elway retreated beyond
the 20-yard line as he searched for a receiver. Finding none open,
he hurried upfield, then to the right, as he crossed the 10-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   In another situation, hoping to get the first down, Elway might
have run out of bounds. Or he might have slid, as quarterbacks do
and he usually did. But this was the Super Bowl; this was his
chance to ``retire a champion.'' For all he knew, maybe his last
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as safety LeRoy Butler and linebacker Brian Williams
converged on him, Elway dived for the first down. As the tacklers
hit him, his body whirled like the propeller of a helicopter and he
landed, sprawled, at the 4-yard line. First down.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Davis pounded into the end zone and the Broncos
were ahead, 24-17. The Packers would rally for a 24-24 tie but
after the Broncos had won, 31-24, with Davis scoring three
touchdowns, their teammates pointed to Elway's theatrical first
down as the play that turned the game. And his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him do that and then get up pumping his fist, I
said, `It's on,' '' tight end Shannon Sharpe said later. ``That's
when I was sure we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Broncos won, that's when the pro football realm was
finally convinced that John Elway was a champion. Until then, all
of his last-minute drives during the season and the playoffs had
been dramatic, and all those completions and all those yards and
all those touchdown passes had merely been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   All those stats hadn't been able to make that tattoo disappear
until the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, lifted the Vince Lombardi
trophy that night at Jack Murphy Stadium and said, ``This one's for
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the tattoo gone, some people sniped that Elway didn't
win until he had Terrell Davis, but that was only a reminder that
in his three earlier Super Bowl losses, he didn't have anybody like
Terrell Davis. Against the Giants, the Redskins and the 49ers, he
was out there alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best quarterbacks can't always do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if to show that the diamonds in his Super Bowl ring
weren't fake, Elway did it again, this time as a passer. Against
the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami, he completed 18
of 29 passes for 336 yards, including an arrow to wide receiver Rod
Smith for an 80-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be his last roundup. And his best. As a
champion, he's now going out as few of the National Football
League's best quarterbacks have.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the best quarterbacks inspired a championship team, if
not two or three or four title teams, relatively early in their
careers, but most didn't retire from the reigning championship
team. Joe Montana didn't. Terry Bradshaw didn't. Roger Staubach
didn't. Joe Namath didn't. Johnny Unitas didn't. Bobby Layne
didn't. Sammy Baugh and Sid Luckman didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the quarterbacks in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, only
Otto Graham and Norm Van Brocklin decided to stop playing after
having guided their teams to the NFL title in their last season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham led the Cleveland Browns to the 1955 and 1956
championships, then departed. Van Brocklin sparked the Philadelphia
Eagles to the 1960 title, then coached the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   And now Elway, sure to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he
is eligible for election in five years, has done what only Graham
did: go out on top with two consecutive NFL rings.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's not the best quarterback ever. To most historians,
Baugh, Graham, Unitas and Montana are on that ``best ever'' level;
take your pick. He's on the next tier, with several others; take
your pick. But he retired a champion.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all John Elway was trying to do in Super Bowl XXXII
when he spun like a helicopter's propeller going for that first
down and made a tattoo disappear.

 &HT;    Kenseth wins Auto Club 300
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif._ Matt Kenseth spends much of his time in the
shadow of NASCAR Busch Series competitor Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   While Earnhardt has the familiar name, Kenseth is earning the
reputation of the series' best driver. On Saturday, Kenseth took
advantage of Earnhardt's mechanical problems to win the Auto Club
300 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, who is expected to jump to Winston Cup racing next
season in a car owned by Cup star Mark Martin, won for the second
time in 10 starts this season, moving within 95 points of Earnhardt
in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very surprising,'' said Kenseth, of Cambridge, Wis. ``I
definitely didn't expect to win this race. I felt like we were a
long, long ways off on the chassis setup. When the race started, we
were extremely loose. I was worried about hanging on until the last
caution, much less winning the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, 27, took the lead from Elliott Sadler after a restart
on lap 133, 13 laps after Earnhardt spun on the backstretch. In the
final 17 laps, Kenseth was able to hold off Winston Cup points
leader Jeff Burton and Earnhardt, who finished second and third,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth won the race under caution after Todd Bodine hit the
wall with only two laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who lost only five points to Kenseth, wrecked with
only 30 laps remaining. His No. 3 Chevrolet spun out when he tried
to pass the lapped car of Hank Parker Jr. Earnhardt lost a lap
because of the mishap, and then he lost third gear when he went to
the pits for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to figure out a way to get around the lapped
traffic in front of us,'' Earnhardt said. ``We'd run two or three
laps behind (Parker) and he was racing us pretty hard. ... I told
him (after the race) that the next time he races me that hard, it
should be for positions. He wasn't on the lead lap, so he wasn't
going to lose anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the gear, Earnhardt was able to rally. He
regained his lap from the leaders when another caution was thrown
only four laps after his spin. With 11 laps left, he'd climbed to
third but another wreck caused a restart. Earnhardt was passed by
two cars because of the transmission problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to figure out what's going on with that,'' Earnhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte quits Busch
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, fourth in the Winston Cup points standings, will
not drive in another Busch race this year.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has withdrawn as the Busch driver for the No. 18 Pontiac
owned by former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs.

ANALYSIS: MILOSEVIC ADVANCES BY YIELDING ON SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the New York Times.)  
(lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ By agreeing to the release of three
captured American soldiers and offering to accept a lightly armed
U.N. peacekeeping force to monitor a peace in Kosovo, President,
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has made it clear that he wants a
bombing halt, and that he is ready to deal.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Milosevic is putting NATO, and particularly
Washington and London, on the defensive, forcing the alliance to
confront its real war options: to keep bombing and risk the need to
put in ground troops over the summer to try to remove Milosevic
from office, or to negotiate seriously now to end NATO's first war
in Europe, even if it leaves Milosevic in place.
</P>
<P>
   Through the promised release of the soldiers and the diplomatic
moves, Milosevic is going below the heads of NATO country leaders
to appeal to their publics, who are showing increasing signs of
nervousness about this Nintendo war from the air, now in its sixth
week.
</P>
<P>
   In this effort, Milosevic is aided by the intensifying air war,
which means an increasing number and frequency of accidents, bombed
houses and buses and civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two days alone, residential areas of Belgrade were
bombed by accident and a passenger bus in Kosovo was split in half,
apparently by a NATO missile, reportedly killing 34 people. On
Tuesday, more than 20 people died, half of them children, when NATO
bombed a residential area of Surdulica, near the Bulgarian border.
On Friday, a NATO missile landed in Bulgaria itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, treading cautiously, still made exactly
the point Saturday that Milosevic wanted, and that the White House
feared: He called for a bombing halt, and asked Clinton and NATO
``to give peace and reconciliation a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While the White House might regard the soldiers' release as a
cynical gesture by Milosevic, Jackson said, ``This is a gesture
that should not go ignored,'' and added: ``I hope that the
negotiators on both sides will seize this moment to go back to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO generals and politicians will argue that it is precisely
the pain of the bombing that is inducing Milosevic to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   What he offers is not close enough to NATO demands to be taken
as anything but an opening position. He now says he would accept
lightly armed peacekeepers under the banner of the United Nations,
including possibly from NATO countries like Italy, Greece and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO insists on a fully armed international force with NATO
troops at its core, a retreat from its prior demand for 30,000 NATO
troops in Kosovo. It is not clear how much more Washington will
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also offering to reduce his security forces in
Kosovo to 11,000; NATO wants nearly all to leave. Milosevic is
offering an internal political solution to Kosovo, leaving out the
Kosovo Liberation Army on the pretense that it has been defeated, a
position Washington is unlikely to accept. And Milosevic wants
Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo, while NATO wants some form of
international protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides say they want all refugees to return, Yugoslav
officials say the refugees must prove citizenship, even as security
forces rip up identity papers and remove license plates of those
fleeing Kosovo. Over the past two days alone, according to relief
officials, thousands have been driven from Prizren, in southwestern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The patriotism of the Serbs and Milosevic's conduct of the war
have put pressure on NATO, as well. NATO is more than just
Washington and London, where the rhetoric remains bellicose. The
Greek, Italian, German and even French people are increasingly
anxious about the brutal civilian costs, for the ethnic Albanians
but also for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And their leaders are not necessarily happy about the model for
NATO's future that Kosovo, however accidental, seems to represent:
an aggressive arm of American foreign policy, no longer the purely
defensive alliance that kept the peace in Europe during the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned about the reaction of Russia. Europeans
are much closer to Russia, and thus more concerned that Moscow not
isolate itself again or elect a new president after Boris Yeltsin
who is a bigger threat to world peace than Milosevic has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   These Europeans _ as well as new NATO members like Hungary and
prospective members like Romania _ are particularly concerned about
the crisis that Milosevic has created, apparently to NATO's
complete surprise, as Albanians flee to neighboring countries and
even across the Adriatic to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has regionalized the conflict, broadening the issue
from the control of one southern Serbian province of Kosovo to the
political stability of Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria,
Greece, Italy and even Germany, where the new leftist government,
like the Italian one, finds itself prosecuting a lengthy war it
never much wanted.
</P>
<P>
   These Europeans, who want the abuses in Kosovo to end and the
refugees to go home, are likely to find much sense in what Jackson
says. Most NATO countries, small enough to feel vulnerable, do not
see it as their duty to choose Yugoslavia's leaders or to reopen
the question of postwar international boundaries whenever old
nationality questions rear their heads.

Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was among those slain at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., at a rally protesting the National
Rifle Association's meeting in Denver on Saturday. The rally drew
some 7,000 protesters. Led by Charlton Heston, the actor who is the
president of the organization, the pro-gun group had spurned calls
from state and local politicians and others to scrap its convention
out of respect for those killed just 10 miles away in Littleton.

Church Bulletin Day at the Hagerstown, Md., Suns' baseball games,
at which discounts are given to those who have a bulletin from
their church, discriminate against him as a professed agnostic.
``It irked me that if you bring a church bulletin, you are treated
better,'' says Silverman. ``It discriminates against atheists,
agnostics, humanists, pagans and lots of others, even Christians
who do not go to church.'' (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

baseball games, the team owner, Winston Blenckstone, holds several
promotion days, like Church Bulletin Day, when discounts are given
to those who have a bulletin from their church. But now, the offer
is under assault as religious discrimination, an accusation that
leaves Blenckstone scratching his head in bewilderment. ``Minor
league baseball is all about promotions,'' says Blenckstone.

U.S. SAYS G.I. RELEASES WON'T ALTER THE AIR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Administration and Pentagon officials said Saturday
that the release of the three American prisoners would not alter
the aims or methods of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, which
continued with an unrelenting intensity made possible by clearer
skies over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The officials welcomed the announcement that the three soldiers
would be freed on Sunday, but they did so warily lest it fall
through.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was too early to discuss whether NATO would respond
to the soldiers' release with any reciprocal gestures, as Yugoslav
officials suggested they should. The Pentagon announced Saturday
that a second Yugoslav prisoner was now in NATO's custody, but said
nothing about the possibility of a prisoner exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner, whose name and rank were not disclosed, was
captured by ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo and handed over to
Albania's government, which then turned him over to the United
States, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said. Like the
first prisoner, a lieutenant, the soldier was flown to a U.S. base
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to negotiate
the Americans' release, appealed for a pause in NATO's attacks,
saying the three soldiers were being held in military installations
in or near the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Saturday to Sandy Berger, the White House national
security adviser, and to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
after the release was announced.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials ruled out a pause in the strikes,
but attacks in Belgrade eased overnight Friday, and by midnight the
capital had once again escaped the sort of thunderous barrages that
destroyed several government and military buildings earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will persist until our military objectives are met,'' the
National Security Council's spokesman, David Leavy, said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's willingness to release the American prisoners came
a day after Milosevic met with Russia's special envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and offered his own plan for ending the war. U.S. and
NATO officials have dismissed Milosevic's plan, but they
interpreted the recent other events as signs that the Yugoslav
leader's defiance may be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough incidents to suggest that the military
campaign is starting to pinch,'' a senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air war entered its 39th day Saturday, U.S. and allied
aircraft struck targets across Yugoslavia. Taking advantage of the
longest stretch of fair weather since the strikes began on March
24, allied warplanes are flying about 600 missions a day.
</P>
<P>
   With the intensification came a new report of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO missile struck a bus in central Kosovo crossing a bridge
near the town of Luzane, 12 miles north of Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, Serbian officials and witnesses told reporters
who were escorted to the site. There were conflicting reports on
the number of people killed in the attack, but Serbian officials at
the scene told reporters that 34 bodies had been recovered after
the bus was sliced in two.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said allied warplanes had not
targeted that bridge. Twelve hours after the first reports of the
attack, officials at NATO's headquarters said Saturday night that
they still could not confirm that an allied aircraft had fired on
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon said that in addition to striking planned
targets, NATO's warplanes were now attacking targets that emerge
unexpectedly. It is possible the attack on the bus was one of
those.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, NATO attacked 40 targets that had not been planned,
compared with 31 fixed targets, said Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a
planner at the Joint Staff Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The ``targets of opportunity'' included such things as tanks,
armored vehicles, artillery batteries and command posts. ``What's
happening now is we're able now to respond faster to targets that
may pop up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters, officials said the raids destroyed nine
radio and television transmission towers around the country and
seven highway and railroad bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nights ago we attacked the brains behind the brutality in
Belgrade,'' a spokesman, Peter Daniel, said, referring to
Thursday's strikes on military and police buildings in the capital,
``and yesterday we went after the nervous system that keeps the
Milosevic machine informed and in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   With some 800 NATO aircraft involved, the strikes against
Yugoslavia are occurring around the clock.

PENGUINS' JAGR DOUBTFUL FOR GAME 6, BUT DEVILS HAVE THEIR OWN
INJURY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHUCK FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH, Pa _ Jaromir Jagr's status is still uncertain, but
the Devils have health concerns of their own with the injured
center Sergei Nemchinov as they hurtle toward Game 6 against the
Penguins here Sunday with a long-time-no-see objective: to put a
playoff opponent away.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened for the Devils practically since they won
the 1995 Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play a Game 7,'' said Scott Stevens, the
Devils' captain, Saturday after a light workout at Civic Arena,
where the Devils carry a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.
``Anything can happen when it comes down to one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Win this game, win this series, and the Devils may ease some of
the sting lingering from the first-round defeat by Ottawa last
season and the second-round defeat by the Rangers the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a healthy Nemchinov certainly could not hurt
their chances. The versatile forward, obtained from the Islanders
on March 22, blocked a shot by Jiri Slegr with five minutes left in
Game 5's second period on Friday night. He tried to play early in
the third period, but his bruised left leg would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov skated Saturday, and his availability for Game 6
apparently will be a pre-game decision. If Nemchinov is unable to
play, Dave Andreychuk would most likely replace him on the line
with Brendan Morrison and Vadim Sharifijanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who can play any situation: power play, penalty
killing, any defensive situation you want,'' Stevens said. ``He can
play center, he can play wing. He's a smart player.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not, however, as important to the Devils as Jagr, the
league's probable most valuable player, is to the Penguins. A groin
injury has scratched Jagr from the past four games, and he did not
hold much hope of playing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are straining to focus on their playoff path. The
last time they won a post-season series was in the first round in
1997, defeating Montreal. The Devils' last Game 6 triumph on the
road came in the 1994 semifinals at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Devils compiled the best road record in NHL history this
season at 28-10-3. The Devils arrived in Pittsburgh riding a crest
of momentum, after giving up two game-tying goals in 13 seconds
Friday before winning, 4-3, for their second consecutive victory in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good things in this locker room right
now,'' center Petr Sykora said. ``We have a big chance to do some
things tomorrow. A Game 7? We don't really think that far. We think
about the next game, the next shift, and keep it rolling.''

 &HT;    Long lines, wet weather put damper on Star Wars party
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ ``The Force'' just wasn't with the folks planning a
three-day Star Wars Celebration in Denver this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 loyal fans along with wet and windy weather
overwhelmed the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum. As a
result, lines grew long and patience grew short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this has got to be their worst case scenario,'' said
Jonathan MacKnight, as he stood under the sheltering wing of a B52
bomber outside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of fans waiting to see displays, watch shows and shop for
memorabilia stretched hundreds of yards across muddy fields and
parking lots. Although organizers claim there were 15,000 passes
sold each day, the crowd seemed larger and rumors circulated that
as many as 40,000 people were there on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they didn't expect all these people to show up
at the same time, and of course they didn't expect it to rain,''
MacKnight said. ``This is really pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star Wars Celebration was a joint production of the
publishers of Star Wars Insider magazine and Lucasfilms, which is
producing what may be the most anticipated motion picture ever.
``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' premieres Wednesday,
May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Fans from all over the world on Friday and Saturday squeezed
onto the grounds of the museum where the celebration was held.
Friday's weather was horrible with constant hard rain and
temperatures in the 40s, but fan spirits were high.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was a little dryer and warmer Saturday, but the
crowd was larger, and the patience of the fans was beginning to
fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it one bit,'' said Gerald Reedy of Fort Collins,
Colo. ``It's ironic that this event is being held on an old
military base, but there have been no logistics whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. Reedy was near the front of a line three or four
abreast that snaked back at least 100 yards across a muddy parking
lot. He had joined the line two hours earlier and expected to spend
another hour in line before actually making it into the vendors'
area where Star Wars toys, souvenirs and collectibles were on sale.
</P>
<P>
   People in line said they were willing to wait because the
vendors at the celebration had collectible items not available
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be so bad but I was in the same line for three and
a half hours yesterday, and by the time I got through the line they
were all sold out,'' Reedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Alvarado of Chicago abandoned the line after two hours on
Saturday without even reaching the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was getting close, a vendor's representative came out
with a list of what they had for sale and it was nothing special.
I'm really disappointed,'' Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that the event was poorly planned and that it
should have been held in a much larger indoor venue.

I'm really disappointed,'' Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that the event was poorly planned and that it
should have been held in a much larger indoor venue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most popular events and personal appearances were
held in leaky canvas tents, and few provisions were made for the
thousands of wet fans waiting in lines.
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky enough to actually get into one of the shows or into
the main display area inside the museum were thrilled with what
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances by actor Ray Park, who portrays villain Darth Maul
in the ``Phantom Menace,'' were one of the hot ticket events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome,'' said Rick Towne of Omaha, Neb. ``He
basically showed us his best stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Park is an international martial arts champion chosen to play
Darth Maul because of his skill as an acrobatic fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Towne said Park easily demonstrated standing back flips and
no-hands cartwheels. ``And then he did this move where he flattens
out and flips sideways one and a half turns,'' Towne said. ``He was
pretty modest though. One of the ladies asked him to take his shirt
off and he declined.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the people attending the first two days of the
celebration were men in their early 20s or late teens.
</P>
<P>
   But also prevalent in the crowd were families where two or three
generations traveled to Denver to take part in the Star Wars hoopla
together.
</P>
<P>
   Lienor Maldonado from the Yakima Valley in Washington said she
took her son Esteban to see the original Star Wars movie when he
was about four years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he has paid my way to come here to Denver as a Mother's
Day present,'' Maldonado said. ``Since I took him to the movie
first, I think it's only fair.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bullat of San Diego said he's been taking his son to Star
Wars events for years. Now David Bullat II is 18 and can at least
share some of the driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up to Mann's Chinese Theater when the re-release of
Star Wars came out a few years ago,'' the younger Bullat said.
``I'm the real fan, but this is something we can enjoy doing
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Lowe, 2, was still in her pajamas huddled under blankets
in a stroller while her father, Tony, waited in line to get into
the vendors' area.
</P>
<P>
   Her nose was a little runny, and she was obviously spending most
of her time dosing.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked why she and her father had come across town to
wait in line so long, young Ellie pumped a tiny triumphant fist in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stah Wuhz!'' she said.

EXPOS HAVE EX-FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Dodgers arrive in Montreal on Sunday
night they should not expect much of a reception. Wednesday night's
game between the Expos and San Francisco Giants drew a season-low
4,998, a little less than Tuesday's 5,202 total.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth straight game in which the Expos have drawn
under 10,000, raising speculation they will move to Northern
Virginia despite civic efforts to keep the club in Montreal.
Through 12 dates, the Expos are averaging 11,489, but that includes
an opening-day crowd of 43,918. Since the first game, the average
is 8,541.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting Expos were able to keep manager Felipe Alou
from joining the Dodgers last winter by giving him $6 million for
three years and appealing to his sense of loyalty. But attempts to
build a new downtown ballpark appear to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club can't stay (in Montreal) under these
circumstances,'' said Alou, who has spent 25 years with the Expos.
``We need to have a new stadium and a bigger payroll. People want
to blame the fans for a lack of support, but you can't keep letting
players get away and expect the fans to keep coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou said he has no regrets about passing on the Dodgers offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My promise here to these fans is to stay here and try to
develop this young club. I made that promise and I'd like to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefties for lunch: Against Randy Johnson last Sunday, Tony Gwynn
struck out twice, just his third two-strikeout game since Sept. 20,
1996 _ two against Johnson and one against Kevin Tapani of the
Cubs. Gwynn's hitting streak ended after 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Gwynn is 0 for 8 with four strikeouts against
Johnson. That doesn't count a 1-for-6 effort in last year's
National League Division Series, with the one hit a double that led
to the first run in the Padres' 2-1 defeat of Houston in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn became just the third left-handed batter to start against
Johnson this season, after Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine and
Philadelphia first baseman Rico Brogna. Atlanta pinch-hitter
Randall Simon (groundout) is the only other lefty to bat against
Johnson. From 1994-98, left-handed hitters batted just .197 against
Johnson. They were 0 for 11 against him this season entering
Friday's start against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Cookin' at home: The Braves' Brian Jordan says part of the
reason he's off to the hottest start of his career is being at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, Jordan, who makes his home in the Atlanta
suburb of Alpharetta, was hitting .347 with six homers and 21 RBI,
one shy of the league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also credits the workout program he follows each winter
with trainer Bob Kersee, husband of former Olympian Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, for getting him into baseball shape, rather than
football condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting behind Mark McGwire last season, Jordan hit a
career-high 25 homers and drove in 91 runs, 13 RBI shy of matching
his 1996 career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McGwire) cleaned the bases a lot,'' Jordan said. ``I could
have produced a little more, there's no question my RBI total could
have been better. But you've got to have somebody who can run in
front of you too. My doubles wouldn't score (McGwire) from first,
where my doubles will score Chipper (Jones) now. I don't know what
to expect, I don't know what my potential is. Hopefully I'll just
get better every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Solid start: Giants pitcher Joe Nathan pitched seven shutout
innings in his major-league debut April 21 against Colorado, then
followed that Wednesday by going eight innings in Montreal,
allowing seven hits and two runs during a 4-3 victory. He gave up
three hits and two runs in the first inning. He has a 1.20 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who replaced injured Mark Gardner in the Giants
rotation, pitched just two years in the minors before this season.
He was drafted by the Giants as a shortstop in 1995. He took all of
the 1996 season off when the Giants told him he should forget about
being a position player and concentrate on pitching. His fastball
has been clocked at 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurting in Houston: First Moises Alou. Then rookie catcher Mitch
Meluskey. Now shortstop Ricky Gutierrez is the third Houston
starter to go down to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey went on the DL on Monday after his shoulder popped as
he was swinging through a batting-practice pitch. Less than 24
hours later, the Astros lost Gutierrez to a fractured left hand.
Gutierrez, hitting .357, was hit by a pitch from Arizona's Armando
Reynoso during the fourth inning Tuesday night and is expected to
miss four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Out of control: After coming out of Tuesday's game after just
four innings because he got too close to his prescribed pitch count
of 85, right-hander Alex Fernandez went back into the Marlins
clubhouse, picked up a baseball bat and threw it at one of the four
television sets that hang from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The bat merely nicked the TV screen, however, and ended up
lodged in one of the ceiling tiles. ``That's really why I took him
out,'' Marlins manager John Boles joked. ``He didn't have any
control.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DUELING MOUNT RUSHMORES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and rewrite; some material repeated from earlier
version, but column is essentially new.)  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert's dream died. D. Wayne Lukas went
to heaven. It was the latest chapter in a compelling tale of
dueling egos, of two striking, media-savvy trainers who have carved
their profiles into the consciousness of a fading sport that was
crying out for a Rushmore of stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s standing is final: Lukas won his third Kentucky Derby
of the decade Saturday, fourth overall, and Baffert failed in his
bid for an unprecedented third straight. While Lukas was exhorting
Cat Thief down the stretch, Charismatic burst past Cat Thief and
Worldly Manner to win the 125th Derby at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Upon realization that his other horse had won and Cat Thief was
third, that he had gone from Hall of Fame election earlier in the
week to the Derby's winner's circle, Lukas looked as if he had
bought a winning lottery ticket more than the many who had trained
a champ. He would take it, though, and he would take credit for it,
because that's what coaches do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best training job I ever did, this and Grindstone,'' the
one-time high school basketball coach said, dressed impeccably in a
dark blue suit, with the purple silk hankie standing stiffly in the
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Lukas, 63, had a run of six straight Triple
Crown victories and 7-of-8, then the silver-haired Baffert came
along with his golden touch to win the last two Derbies and
Preaknesses. In the expanding universe of entertainment and sports,
from the R-rated professional wrestling to the made-for-television
X Games, it makes sense that celebrity trainers who look as if
they've walked out of the opera more than a smelly barn have become
the marketing rage.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sport where the horses tend to sound alike and the
jockeys, for all their courage and skill, are existentially cast in
supporting roles. Trainers are the college basketball and football
coaches of thoroughbred racing. They represent The Program, the
continuum, as the horses pass in and out of prominence every few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any coincidence that Lukas, who counts Bobby Knight
among his close friends, insists that his hefty stable of assistant
trainers address him as Coach? He refers to his ``system'' when he
talks about all the places he can't possibly be and the men who
implement his training techniques at a half-dozen tracks.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent dominance of Lukas and then Baffert suggests
anything, it is that the next wave of aspiring super-trainers had
better be part entrepreneur, part showman. They had better be good
recruiters, and jugglers, too. Trainers have always served
different masters, the way a college coach works for the school and
the shoe company. So you have these strange sports settings, such
as Lukas trying to root home a Derby winner with one owner, then
turning around to celebrate with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about being in a spot,'' he said. ``I'm standing
there with my closest friend, Bill Young, and we think we've got
Cat Thief winning the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. The next thing Lukas knew, he was hugging Robert and
Beverly Lewis, Charismatic's owners, while Baffert was living out
the axiom of yet another famous coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Riley said that when you compete at the championship
level, there's only winning and misery,'' Baffert said, his sad
eyes hidden behind his customary country-club cool shades. ``We
don't know how to act. We're sort of lost souls.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to settle for Friday's victory in the Kentucky Oaks with
Silverbulletday. His three horses, General Challenge, Prime Timber
and the touted filly Excellent Meeting, never threatened. Baffert
could only blame the luck and long odds of a 19-horse Derby field.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer realistic for the big-time trainer to stake
one's Triple Crown season on a horse or two. There used to be four
Derby preps, and now there are 10. As Nick Zito, the New York
trainer and two-time Derby winner said, ``If you run strong in one
of them, how do you not come to the Derby?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a long way from what Charlie Whittingham believed. The
training legend who died last week at 86 waited a quarter-century
between Derby appearances after finishing ninth and vowing he would
not return until he had a horse who could win. At the age of 73, he
came back and won with Ferdinand in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham, from the very old school, from a time when the best
horse trainers looked like, well, trainers, was known as the Bald
Eagle and for his less polished lines than our contemporary
basketball geniuses. As even Lukas admitted that he had
underestimated this 31-1 long shot, right down to Charismatic's
final Derby strides, he may have recalled an old Whittingham
favorite: ``Don't say anything bad about a horse until it's been
dead for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas didn't. Instead, he remembered someone commenting to
Whittingham early last winter at Santa Anita that the great and
powerful Lukas was having a particularly poor week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie told the guy, `Let sleeping dogs lie,''' said Lukas on
the day he put Bob Baffert's dream of three straight Derbies to
rest.

WATSON, MORGAN TRY FOR HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Houston teammates Bob Watson and Joe Morgan
now are on opposite sides in different groups trying to buy the
Oakland A's. The winner has a good chance to be the first African
American to co-own and actively take part in the management of a
major-league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got old Colt 45s on different sides, and I find that
interesting,'' Watson said this past week. ``What that means is
that if you are in the game long enough, sometimes you find
yourselves being on the other side of the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the sale is expected May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group is in this together for the betterment of the East
Bay and the Oakland community,'' Watson said. ``I know it's the
same for Joe and his group. They are good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson was the first African American to be the assistant
general manager of a major-league team when he left the A's, where
he had coached from 1986-88, to join the Houston front office.
Later he was the first African-American general manager, also with
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   He had another first when he left Houston for New York, where he
was executive vice president of the Yankees, building the team that
has won two of the last three World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't like being the first, because it indicates
the relative lack of progress African Americans have made in the
front office in the half-century since Jackie Robinson joined the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 52 years since minorities became involved in
baseball, so we shouldn't be talking about this,'' Watson said.
``And when it gets to the point where it doesn't need to be
mentioned, I'd be as happy at that as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy in Texas:The Baltimore Orioles were 5-16 entering the
weekend, the worst record in the major leagues. The Rangers, on the
other hand, were in first place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   But DH Rafael Palmeiro said the won-loss record doesn't confirm
that he made the right choice in returning to the Rangers, rather
than re-signing with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make a difference,'' Palmeiro said. ``I have
nothing against those Orioles players and the players are the ones
that are struggling. I played with those guys for five years. It's
hard for me to see them go through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, I'm glad I'm here for all the reasons I said
before the season. How they perform has no effect on whether I made
the right decision. If they were 15-4, my answer would still be the
same. I'm glad I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad-armed and... dangerous? Although the Red Sox don't think
it's serious, right-hander Bret Saberhagen was prematurely forced
from the mound on April 23 with stiffness in the back of his right
shoulder. Saberhagen, who has a history of shoulder trouble, had a
similar problem in spring training, when he did not miss a start.
Nonetheless, he was scratched from his scheduled Friday start at
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was hopeful that he would not have to be placed on
the disabled list. In addition to winning 15 games last year _ his
highest total since 1989 _ he went the entire season without
missing a turn.
</P>
<P>
   In the bus league: Cleveland is off to a fast start, but it has
gotten nothing from two offseason bullpen moves. They traded Brian
Giles to Pittsburgh for Ricardo Rincon and Chad Ogea to
Philadelphia for Jerry Spradlin. Rincon has made two appearances
and Spradlin made four before the Indians traded him to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland traded him for two minor-leaguers (one to be
announced) on April 22. The team was getting off the bus on the
tarmac of Cleveland's Hopkins International Airport late at night
to board a charter for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Before Spradlin could get on the plane, manager Mike Hargrove
pulled him aside and told him about the trade.
</P>
<P>
   All Spradlin could mutter was, ``How am I going to get home?''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' traveling secretary asked one of the bus drivers
who had driven the team to the airport to drive Spradlin to his
home in Westlake, a suburb of Cleveland, in his empty bus.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking it up in Seattle: Former Dodgers utility infielder
Rafael Bournigal _ acquired Tuesday from Texas _ flew into Seattle
and found himself in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Bournigal, 32, became the seventh man to play shortstop for the
Mariners this season, joining injured starter Alex Rodriguez,
Carlos Guillen, Russ Davis, Charles Gipson, David Bell, Giomar
Guevara and Domingo Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Bournigal had two hits in the fifth inning Thursday when Seattle
scored a franchise-record 22 runs against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can catch the ball, which is the first priority,'' said
manager Lou Piniella, who also got outfielder Brian Hunter from
Detroit on Wednesday. ``He's a good hit-and-run candidate, a guy
who can run a little bit and put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Two deals in two nights might be just be the beginning of a busy
stretch for general manager Woody Woodward. The Mariners have too
many outfielders: Ken Griffey Jr., Jay Buhner and Hunter will
likely start the majority of the games, which leaves precious
little time for Butch Huskey, Matt Mieske and Raul Ibanez _ and
probably delegates John Mabry to backup duties at first and third
base.

LUKAS BACK IN WINNER'S CIRCLE WITH AN UNLIKELY LONG SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert missed his date with horse racing
history Saturday when none of his three horses ran in the money
while D. Wayne Lukas' 31-1 long shot, Charismatic, won the 125th
running of the Kentucky Derby by a neck over Menifee, and by less
than one length over Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   This was a drama with subplots that never materialized. For the
21st consecutive year, favorites lost: the filly Excellent Meeting
finished fifth and her entrymate General Challenge, winner of the
Santa Anita Derby, ran 11th. Baffert's third horse, Prime Timber,
ran fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery horse Worldly Manner, who trained but did not race
in Dubai, ran seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The two fillies trying to outrun 17 colts also struck out:
Excellent Meeting, added to the race by Baffert only the day before
the Derby, and Three Ring, who finished last in the field of 19. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many horses,'' Baffert said. ``The race was decided on the
first turn. But you can't win 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Baffert tripped on the threshold of history when he was
shooting for his third straight Derby success, the story still was
spiced with melodrama, and redemption for his rivals. It started
with Lukas, who was replaced as king of the Triple Crown trainers
when Baffert came out of California in 1997 and won with Silver
Charm, then again in 1998 with Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But this week Lukas roared back. Four days ago he was elected to
racing's Hall of Fame after some dispute over how long he had
worked as a thoroughbred trainer. And Saturday, before 151,051
spectators on a sparkling spring day at Churchill Downs, he struck
Derby gold for the third time in five years and the fourth time in
his career when his 3-year-old stars ran first and third in
America's most prestigious horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably never misjudged a horse early in his career as much
as Charismatic,'' Lukas said with some cheery chagrin. ``He looked
like he wanted to be a fat horse who would run every two weeks. I
thought, `If we get away with this, we ought to get out of the
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Melodrama also accompanied the winning jockey, Chris Antley, who
overcame publicized drug problems in the late '80s to win the 1991
Derby on Strike the Gold. Since then, he has suffered more personal
problems, most recently a struggle to gain control of his weight.
But he returned to racing with new discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne asked me to ride,'' Antley said. ``I said I was open. I
told my father, I have a goal in life. Miracles were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Charismatic, a well-bred son of Summer Squall.
Charismatic had lost seven straight times before he won the
Lexington Stakes at nearby Keeneland two weeks ago. And during his
losing streak, Charismatic was offered as a claimer who might have
been taken by anyone willing to risk a relatively few dollars.
Saturday he won the $1.1 million Kentucky Derby in his 15th start.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his owners, Beverley and Bob Lewis of Los Angeles, there was
redemption. In the 1996 Derby they ran the filly Serena's Song, who
led for a mile before fading to 16th. But they won the race the
next year with Silver Charm, trained by Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought a few times, maybe we ought to quit paying the
bills for this horse,'' Bob Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The horse now will be able to pay his own bills. He won the
first prize of $886,200, and he returned $64.60 for a $2 bet to
win, the third largest payoff in Derby history. He also did it
before the second-largest crowd in Derby history _ only the 100th
Derby in 1974, attended by 163,628, drew more. And the entrants
were considered so evenly matched that strange betting patterns
resulted: the favored entry, Excellent Meeting and General
Challenge, went off at 4.8-1, the longest odds for any favorite in
Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   Another young star, Menifee, winner of the Blue Grass Stakes
three weeks ago, made a gallant late run through the homestretch
and missed catching Charismatic by inches. After half a mile, he
was far back, in 17th place. After one mile, 12th. In the stretch,
still sixth in traffic. But he closed like a rocket, losing by the
length of Charismatic's chestnut neck.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second year in a row that Elliott Walden trained
the runner-up in the Derby. Last year his Victory Gallop ran second
to Real Quiet in both the Derby and the Preakness, but outran him
in the Belmont Stakes and for the second straight year kept Baffert
from sweeping the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the widest horse on the first turn,'' Walden said.
``And Pat Day had to wait for room before he finally got him
moving. He ran big, but just got beat. In a 19-horse field,
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first three-quarters of a mile, wild drama was suggested
by the pace-setter, Valhol, the colt who won the Arkansas Derby at
odds of 30-1 and then became embroiled in a controversy over
whether his jockey had used an electrical device to get him to run
faster. Charismatic raced no better than seventh down the
backstretch. But after they had run a mile, Cat Thief took the
lead, Charismatic moved up to third place and Valhol faded to 15th
place.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch looked like a cavalry charge, with Cat Thief a
half-length in front of Charismatic, and Worldly Manner next,
despite the unusual training methods of his owner, Sheik Mohammed
bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai. And as they flashed across the
wire, Charismatic had his neck in front of the hard-charging
Menifee, who had three-quarters of a length on Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic ran the mile and one-quarter in 2:03 1/5, the
slowest time since Go for Gin's winning time in 1994. But he paid
such huge odds that he created a an exacta payoff, with Menifee, of
$727.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to act,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any luck. We're sort of lost souls.''

 &HT;    Ligtenberg biding time with elbow
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sighting a long-lost friend across the clubhouse, John
Rocker walked up to Kerry Ligtenberg Saturday afternoon, pointed at
Ligtenberg's atrophied right arm and observed, ``Nice noodle, dude.
Your arm was bigger than that when you were 9 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, pal. One month after undergoing ligament
transplant surgery in his right elbow, Ligtenberg dropped by for an
exam by team orthopedist Joe Chandler and a spin on the treadmill
in the workout room, biding time until he feels half-human again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really do much,'' he said. ``When I'm at least able to
play catch, it'll feel like I can do something. It's like Joe just
said. Just sit back and don't do anything stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning to his Minnesota home, he has decided to
remain in Atlanta with his new wife, Sara, and pursue his physical
therapy program here. Though he plans to be a more frequent visitor
now, he has stayed away from the clubhouse. Ryan Klesko had even
taken over Ligtenberg's locker, which is next to his, as a junk
overflow and removed it with apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ligtenberg still cannot straighten his arm, Chandler
feels he's slightly ahead of schedule in recovery, given his range
of motion. Ligtenberg never could straighten his arm completely,
due to some calcium build-up in the elbow and is expected to have a
completely refurbished joint when his recovery is complete.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he works out on a treadmill, trains to keep his right
shoulder strong and loosens his elbow with whirlpool therapy. He
still eats, brushes his teeth and combs his hair left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Now at third base
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones was back in the lineup Saturday night after a game
off for a jammed right ankle. Manager Bobby Cox left open the third
hole in the lineup until batting practice, but Jones was already
adamant about playing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the second game Jones had missed in a week, after
sitting out Monday's game in Florida with a sore adductor in his
left leg. Though Jones is carrying 10 extra pounds after an
extensive offseason weight-lifting program, he maintained his new
size is not related to the two problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to turn (an ankle) over,'' he said, ``you're
going to turn it over regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   But two games' absence in one week is noteworthy for Jones, who
has sat out just seven games the last two years. He had not missed
two in the same week since opening the 1996 season on the disabled
list and sitting out the first four games following arthroscopic
knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The day after
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz's first career one-hitter was still the subject of
clubhouse conversation one day after his 3-0 victory Friday night.
It took him 323 career starts to achieve it, but that reinforces
the difficulty of the feat. Neither Greg Maddux or Tom Glavine has
ever thrown a nine-inning, one-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever seen Smoltz throw a better game, catcher
Javy Lopez said, 'I've seen him that good once. It was in San Diego
(in 1996) when he almost had a no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt at rest
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen made his third start of the year at shortstop
while Walt Weiss was given a night off. Weiss finished April
uncharacteristically with three errors in his last three games and
wound up with five misplays in the first month. He committed just
12 errors in 96 games last season.

IS THE RISING SUN SETTING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't a good first month for many of
baseball's Japanese players.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo, who electrified fans just four years ago as the ace
of the Dodgers pitching staff, was released by two teams and
finally signed with the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, who won 13 games last season for the World Series
champion New York Yankees, was chastised by Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner for poor work habits and buried in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii, Nomo's teammate in Japan and last year with the
New York Mets, has nearly pitched himself out of the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's 6-2 loss to San Diego, Yoshii allowed four runs on
six hits in just 4.2 innings. Yoshii's earned run average rose to
7.52. In 20 innings, he has allowed 25 hits and 17 runs.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a time this tradition-laden sport might
re-evaluate its interest in Japanese baseball, this might have been
it. After all, before Nomo there hadn't been a Japanese-born player
in the major leagues since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, clubs are maintaining a strong presence in Asia. And
now teams aren't just looking at pitchers. Outfielders Hideki
Matsui and Alejandro Quezada are names to remember. It's clear no
one is willing to give up so quickly on one of the game's final
frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a game over there, there are more major-league
scouts than ever,'' said Acey Kohrogi, Dodgers director for Asian
operations. ``It's probably harder than ever to get a player out of
Japan, but the feeling is it is definitely worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first is through the free-agent system, which doesn't kick
in until after a player has completed nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo got out through a loophole by retiring first, then signing
in the U.S. But nine years for a pitcher in a sport that demands
you start what you finish leaves them little at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The second is through a new rule implemented this year and
designed to stop players from negotiating directly with
major-league clubs. Irabu went directly to the San Diego Padres,
who gave up players in return. Irabu then decided he didn't want to
play for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Japanese player informs their commissioner's office that
they would like to play in the U.S. Major-league teams are notified
and interested parties submit sealed bids. The one that wins has
exclusive rights.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese teams are willing to give up top talent for the same
reason big-league teams do. There is a widening gap between the
rich and poor teams in Japanese baseball. Small-market clubs need
to dump salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of similarities there to us here,'' said
Minnesota GM Terry Ryan, who recently visited Japan. ``They have
teams with large payrolls and small payrolls, teams with high
revenues and low revenues. It's eerily similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's Japanese rights are still owned by his former club, the
Kintetsu Buffaloes, though he says he has no intention of going
back. But arrogance might be all he has left.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs signed him to a minor-league contract after the
Mets released him in spring training. The Cubs wanted him to make
four minor-league starts before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   And even though they had lost starters Kerry Wood (for the
season) and Kevin Tapani and Jon Leiber to the 15-day disabled
list, the Cubs wanted him to extend his Triple-A tryout a little
longer. Nomo was unwilling. All the Cubs had to lose was $800,000,
and they certainly can use pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our evaluators said other people were throwing better,''
manager Jim Riggleman said. ``(Nomo) was third on our list (at
Triple-A Iowa). The fact that he's a known person, it would have
been a popular decision. But other guys were pitching better.''
</P>
<P>
   After he left the Cubs, Nomo threw for several clubs and
displayed little of the form that made him reach 500 strikeouts
faster than any pitcher in major-league history. Despite a
baseball-wide shortage of pitching, Nomo's years of 200-pitch games
in Japan now appear too big an obstacle to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomo was only so-so,'' said Cleveland pitching coach Phil
Regan after Nomo threw for him last Tuesday in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians wanted Nomo to go to Triple-A Buffalo or extended
spring training, but the Brewers stepped up Thursday and said he
would be put in the rotation after one minor-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, meanwhile, has made it back to the Yankees rotation,
although not entirely because of merit. He will take the place of
Roger Clemens, who was placed on the DL because of a hamstring
injury. &QL;

ANTLEY LOSES WEIGHT AND WINS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Eight months ago, Chris Antley was a
broken-down jockey. His weight had ballooned to 147 pounds, or at
least that was the number he saw when he had the guts to look at
the scale. He had returned home to Columbia, S.C., to live with his
folks. He was lost, and his father, Les, tried to buck him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me to start another business,'' said the jockey
who was the leading money winner in the United States in 1985 and
the Kentucky Derby winner in 1991 aboard Strike the Gold. ``He told
me, `You don't need to ride.' He was trying to persuade me to ease
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Antley, now 33, wasn't about to listen. ``I told my father I
have a goal in life, and I'll die trying to get there,'' he
recalled Saturday just minutes after stunning everyone by winning
the Derby again aboard a 30-1 long shot named Charismatic. And he
remembered asking his father this question: ``Wouldn't it just be
neat if I can ride in the Kentucky Derby?''
</P>
<P>
   As Antley recounted this conversation Saturday afternoon, his
voice caught with emotion, and he tried to fight back the tears.
It's a mile and a quarter in the Derby from the starting gate to
the finish line and the winner's circle, but for Antley, and all
his struggles in recent years, it was a much longer route.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a golden-handed rider in New York before shifting to
the California tracks in 1993. For all his success in New York, he
had also encountered suspensions for drugs. And as the 1990s
progressed, he wasn't the elite rider he once was, either.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday Antley had all the answers. He seemed to push a
button on Charismatic in the stretch, and the colt, who was as
lowly regarded as his jockey, barreled down the stretch with
151,051 people roaring them along. Three months ago, Charismatic
was a $62,500 claimer, and Antley was earning the name Forest Gump
for his long-distance runs _ on foot, without a horse in sight _
through his hometown in South Carolina as he tried to lose enough
weight to get back in the business. Overall, from November 1997
until February 1999, the confused and overweight jockey didn't ride
a single mount.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first Saturday in May, however, the Chestnut colt was
wearing the roses and awarding his few backers a $64.60 payoff. His
rider? Well, he was trying to absorb a miracle. ``I'm still kind of
in awe,'' Antley said softly. ``This was a dream. It's a new
beginning for me.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Both horse and rider were given a second
chance. Just two weeks ago, D.Wayne Lukas sent his unheralded colt
to Keeneland and the Lexington Stakes. The day before that race,
Antley had a mount for Lukas in California. He had finally returned
to Santa Anita, and riding, in February and had put up modest
numbers _ 23 victories in 138 mounts. ``I want you to watch the
Lexington tomorrow,'' Antley remembers Lukas telling him. ``He's
coming around to the top of his game. Tell me what you think and
get back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charismatic romped home by two and a half lengths at 12-1
odds _ with the great Jerry Bailey aboard _ Antley made two phone
calls: first to Lukas, then to Les Antley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to the Derby,'' he told his father.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lukas was focused on winning his fourth Derby and
perhaps wrestling the spotlight back from rival Bob Baffert, the
trainer saw something different, something better in Antley than
when Lukas had passed him over for rides before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hungry,'' Lukas said. ``He had a passion to get back
into it. He's always been a great rider _ a great finisher that fit
this horse. But he seemed more interested in his work, more serious
in the morning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, Antley was starved for more riding success. He dabbled
in the stock market at his folks' home in South Carolina _ he calls
himself a ``long-term day trader.'' But mostly he ran through town,
to the bookstore, for groceries, building up to 25 miles a day. He
sighed when asked his current weight. ``One hundred and fourteen
pounds,'' he said, then smiled proudly.
</P>
<P>
   When he injured his knee before Thanksgiving and was laid up
until Christmas, he found something in himself that hadn't been
there before. It was something that made this Kentucky Derby
victory more rewarding than the Strike The Gold triumph eight years
ago. ``I've had things handed to me and always been able to come
through my career pretty quick,'' he said. ``But this time I
couldn't just come back nonchalant, I had to find the depths of
myself to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   He found something else on Charismatic, a big, fleshy horse,
ironically, that Lukas had worried all week about because he was so
friendly with the feed tub. When Antley turned for home, he bore
down on the chestnut, much the way he had bore down on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approached the quarter-pole, I was three or four deep
and was confident,'' he said. ``I hadn't put him down hard yet.
From that point on, it's just a matter of hoping nobody comes and
gets you. There's no use looking back.''

SPRING LEAVES BRUINS WITH MANY QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What became apparent to the Bruins during four
weeks of spring practice was obvious to the 2,000 fans who attended
UCLA's final scrimmage Saturday at Spaulding Field.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback situation is murky, the defense has improved,
and a plethora of questions must be answered in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the 70-play scrimmage, the offense scored just two touchdowns
and a field goal while the defense held continuously on third down
and repelled several scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, coach Bob Toledo reaffirmed his decision to delay
naming a starting quarterback until training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so close, and all five feel they're in the hunt,'' he
said. ``We've got three or four months to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Drew Bennett and redshirt freshman Cory Paus were the
most impressive Saturday. Bennett completed 5 of 9 passes for 47
yards and scored on a 5-yard run. Paus completed 4 of 7 for 60
yards and directed a scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only goal I had this spring was to compete with Drew the
best I could and make it hard for the coaches to decide,'' Paus
said. ``Now, I just have to get better and keep the pressure on
Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Scott McEwan, a Thousand Oaks native, completed 2 of 4
passes for 34 yards. Redshirt freshman Ryan McCann, an Agoura
native who played well in the final week, was 2 of 6 for 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And J.P. Losman, the true freshman from Venice who enrolled a
month ago, completed 2 of 4 passes for 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks were without their top receivers. Danny Farmer
(volleyball) and Brian Poli-Dixon (wrist) did not play, and Freddie
Mitchell was used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   The tailbacks looked good. DeShaun Foster rushed for 62 yards
and a touchdown, and Jermaine Lewis gained 47 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about the team,'' Toledo said. ``Once we get
the right guys in, we'll be OK. I was concerned (this spring) about
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   No safe bet: Other than the quarterback position, UCLA's primary
concern is safety. Jason Stephens was solid at one spot, but
neither Eric Whitfield nor Audie Attar emerged as a consistent
performer at the other safety position.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Toledo and defensive coordinator/secondary coach
Bob Field might move a cornerback to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two candidates are Marques Anderson and Ryan Roques,''
Field said. ``It's something we're contemplating in order to get
our four best (defensive backs) on the field. And unless something
happens otherwise, three of the four best are Marques, Ryan and
(starting cornerback) Jason Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: Two of UCLA's top recruits _ Sherman Oaks'
Notre Dame defensive lineman Travis Johnson and Bellflower's St.
John Bosco offensive tackle Paul Mociler _ attended the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will visit five schools before deciding and
listed UCLA, USC, Michigan, Ohio State and Florida State as his top
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Mociler listed UCLA, Notre Dame, Stanford, Michigan and USC, and
said UCLA ``is my first choice at this point.''

MCRAE'S GRAND SLAM LETS FRANCO RELAX ON HIS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets seemed to have been grinding and churning
toward John Franco on his day, overcoming all manner of potential
disappointment, setting up what would have been a poetic conclusion
to an afternoon of honor for their reliever.
</P>
<P>
   As Franco sat in the bright sunshine of the Mets' bullpen,
watching yet another video tribute to him, he awaited the call that
everyone in Shea Stadium figured would come. Instead, Franco saw
Brian McRae blast a 1-0 fastball over the right-field fence in the
seventh inning. The grand slam, the Mets' first of the season, blew
open a close game and helped send the Mets to a 9-4 victory over
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Franco went home with a new motorcycle and the Mets (15-9)
walked away with their fourth victory in a row, and second straight
over the Giants (16-9), who had entered the series with the best
record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams don't always have to play good to win,'' McRae
said. ``It was good to add some runs because you look at the way
the Giants were swinging the bats, they were going to get back in
it. We're finding ways to win when we're not playing our best
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Until McRae's shot gave the Mets an 8-2 lead, it seemed very
likely that they would need Franco to stave off any damage before
this victory dissolved. There were passed balls and wild throws and
hit batsmen. The Mets' starting pitcher, Orel Hershiser (2-2),
struggled almost from the moment he took the mound. He made an
error on a wild pickoff throw in the first inning _ he later called
his outing a war _ and the Mets at times struggled behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a 1-0 lead after Edgardo Alfonzo launched a home
run over the left-field bullpen in the first inning, but the Giants
took a 2-1 lead in the next inning on two Met fielding plays that
make managers wince.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second, and one out, the Giants' Rick
Aurilia singled to left. Charlie Hayes lumbered from second base
and had barely rounded third when left fielder Matt Franco threw
home for what appeared to be a play at the plate. Catcher Todd
Pratt mishandled the ball, and Hayes scored, tying the score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the next at-bat, with runners at the corners, pitcher Chris
Brock (2-2) hit a grounder to second base that Alfonzo fielded. But
Alfonzo hesitated, failing to either tag Aurilia in the base path
or throw to second to start a potential double play. Aurilia
advanced to second, and Brent Mayne scored the second run of the
inning on the out at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have made the play,'' Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good it happened early in the season when we didn't need
it, instead of late. Next time I'll make that play. Once in a while
we're going to have a tough game like that. You don't give up in
the first few innings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They didn't. In the third inning, Pratt threw out Armando Rios
trying to steal second and the Giants could not score. In the
bottom of the third, the Mets rallied with two out after Brock
walked Roger Cedeno. Consecutive singles by Alfonzo, John Olerud
(who has reached base in all 24 games this season) and Robin
Ventura added two runs, giving the Mets a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were lacking the big bat of the injured Barry Bonds
and could not come back. Hershiser settled in just enough to hold
the lead, the Mets produced another run in the sixth and then came
McRae's bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season, and you're going to have games like
that,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not look pretty, but you're going to have a lot of
them and you better win them. Offensively you have to make sure
everybody is going to have good at-bats. You know you're grinding
and every at-bat is important and everybody can't try to hit a home
run.''

 &HT;    Families hopeful as POWs release negotiated
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will they come home?
</P>
<P>
   The families of three American prisoners of war being held in
Yugoslavia could only hope and wait Saturday after learning that
the Rev. Jesse Jackson apparently had negotiated the release of
their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the big call that they're on the bus and on
their way out,'' said Vivian Ramirez, the mother of 24-year-old
Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, at a news conference in Los Angeles. She
said she planned to watch television reports all night and ``wait
with the phone next to me ... until they call.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, Texas, the reaction was much the same from the
family of 22-year-old Spec. Steven Gonzales. ``We're just
overwhelmed emotionally at the moment,'' said the soldier's mother,
Rosie Gonzales. ``God just keeps answering our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Smiths Creek area of Michigan, the family of 25-year-old
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone remained secluded. But a friend and
spokesman, Army National Guard Major James McCrone, said Stone's
father, stepmother and two sisters are relieved but ``trying to
keep everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not out of there yet,'' McCrone added. `` As soon as they
know for sure that he is on the way out, they'll feel a lot better.
But they are very excited, very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's wife, Tricia, is ``packed and ready to go'' once her
husband is released, said Lisa McKinney, her stepmother. Tricia and
the couple's 4-year-old son, Ryan, have been staying with McKinney
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The caution of the families equalled that of Clinton
administration officials in their initial responses to the
announced release. President Clinton declined comment to reporters
enroute to play golf in Virginia. His national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, said the release of the soldiers would be ``a
positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Gonzales and Stone were captured while patrolling the
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border March 31, seven days after President
Clinton initiated a NATO bombing campaign to force a peace treaty
between Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic
Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since their capture and their display on Yugoslavian television
- all three appeared to have been beaten - the soldiers'
communities have kept vigil in remarkably similar ways. Homes and
schools in their neighborhoods have been bedecked with yellow
ribbons, as a reminder of their plight.
</P>
<P>
   All three families learned of Jackson's apparent success in
freeing the POWs from the Pentagon and media reports. None heard
directly from Jackson, who expects to depart from Belgrade with the
soldiers Sunday and travel to Croatia with his delegation of
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said Saturday night that, if they
are released, the three men will go by bus to Zagreb, Croatia where
an Air Force jet will be waiting. From there, they will be flown to
Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany where they will be reunited with
their families. ``We will do everything we can ... to get the POWs
out quickly,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez said the first news reports she heard of
Jackson's success frightened her. ``I got scared,'' she said. ``I
said I cannot really believe the news. I have to hear it from
someone else.'' She telephoned the Pentagon and was told to ``pack
my things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jackson, she said, ``He is a life saver. He will be my hero
when he brings my little Andy home. I really do thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I've never liked Jesse Jackson so much in my life,'' said
Terri Sumrall, a friend and former high school classmate of
Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   Sumrall, now a senior at the University of Texas in Austin, said
Gonzales looked well in a television appearance with Jackson in
Yugoslavia on Friday. ``It was good to see him smiling and in good
spirits,'' she said. ``I expected so much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Vivian Ramirez said her son looked a little thin but
otherwise healthy. She said the first thing she will do when she
sees him will be to cry, then hug him ``and I will not let go.''

 &HT;    Families hopeful as POWs release negotiated
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will they come home?
</P>
<P>
   The families of three American prisoners of war being held in
Yugoslavia could only hope and wait Saturday after learning that
the Rev. Jesse Jackson apparently had negotiated the release of
their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the big call that they're on the bus and on
their way out,'' said Vivian Ramirez, the mother of 24-year-old
Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, at a news conference in Los Angeles. She
said she planned to watch television reports all night and ``wait
with the phone next to me ... until they call.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, Texas, the reaction was much the same from the
family of 22-year-old Spec. Steven Gonzales. ``We're just
overwhelmed emotionally at the moment,'' said the soldier's mother,
Rosie Gonzales. ``God just keeps answering our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Smiths Creek area of Michigan, the family of 25-year-old
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone remained secluded. But a friend and
spokesman, Army National Guard Major James McCrone, said Stone's
father, stepmother and two sisters are relieved but ``trying to
keep everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not out of there yet,'' McCrone added. `` As soon as they
know for sure that he is on the way out, they'll feel a lot better.
But they are very excited, very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's wife, Tricia, is ``packed and ready to go'' once her
husband is released, said Lisa McKinney, her stepmother. Tricia and
the couple's 4-year-old son, Ryan, have been staying with McKinney
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The caution of the families equalled that of Clinton
administration officials in their initial responses to the
announced release. President Clinton declined comment to reporters
enroute to play golf in Virginia. His national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, said the release of the soldiers would be ``a
positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Gonzales and Stone were captured while patrolling the
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border March 31, seven days after President
Clinton initiated a NATO bombing campaign to force a peace treaty
between Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic
Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since their capture and their display on Yugoslavian television
- all three appeared to have been beaten - the soldiers'
communities have kept vigil in remarkably similar ways. Homes and
schools in their neighborhoods have been bedecked with yellow
ribbons, as a reminder of their plight.
</P>
<P>
   All three families learned of Jackson's apparent success in
freeing the POWs from the Pentagon and media reports. None heard
directly from Jackson, who expects to depart from Belgrade with the
soldiers Sunday and travel to Croatia with his delegation of
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said Saturday night that, if they
are released, the three men will go by bus to Zagreb, Croatia where
an Air Force jet will be waiting. From there, they will be flown to
Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany where they will be reunited with
their families. ``We will do everything we can ... to get the POWs
out quickly,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez said the first news reports she heard of
Jackson's success frightened her. ``I got scared,'' she said. ``I
said I cannot really believe the news. I have to hear it from
someone else.'' She telephoned the Pentagon and was told to ``pack
my things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jackson, she said, ``He is a life saver. He will be my hero
when he brings my little Andy home. I really do thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I've never liked Jesse Jackson so much in my life,'' said
Terri Sumrall, a friend and former high school classmate of
Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   Sumrall, now a senior at the University of Texas in Austin, said
Gonzales looked well in a television appearance with Jackson in
Yugoslavia on Friday. ``It was good to see him smiling and in good
spirits,'' she said. ``I expected so much worse.''
</P>

ONLY PLAYOFFS CAN SAVE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Still waiting for this shortened season to become
relevant?
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in the final few days of the 50-game year, and it
seems like the only suspense revolved around whether the Lakers
would ever get their act together.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe that question was really answered last month.
</P>
<P>
   As the season concludes, it's painfully evident only the
playoffs can rescue the league. So let's take a peek at how these
brackets really match up.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a little bit of jockeying to be done here, such
as whether Utah or Portland will enjoy home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs, but things should stay fairly intact. &QL; 
WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Utah vs. Sacramento: The Jazz won the season series 2-1, while
the Kings are just thrilled to be here. Next.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers vs. Houston: Only homecourt is up in the air, with Lakers
owning it today. The Lakers won the series 2-1, but were routed in
final meeting. The teams' dislike for each other will make this a
great first-round matchup. Remember, Rockets eliminated Lakers in
1996, despite being lower seed.
</P>
<P>
   Portland vs. Minnesota: The Blazers swept T'Wolves 3-0 in
regular season, and without Stephon Marbury or Tom Gugliotta, this
should also go three-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio vs. Phoenix: It just seems like these guys play each
other every season. The regular-season series tied 2-2, and the
Spurs could be in danger of an early exit, especially with Jason
Kidd looking like the league's MVP. &QL; 
EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Miami vs. New York: The Heat lead the regular-season series 2-1,
but the bookies in Manhattan are more concerned about how many
fights will take place. Knicks might be overtaken by Charlotte if
they stumble this week.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta vs. Detroit: The Hawks have become a post-lockout
success story, but Detroit won two of three meetings. Atlanta is
hot, having won seven of its past eight games, nearly overtaking
Indiana for the Central Division title.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana vs. Milwaukee: The Pacers should make a run to the NBA
title, and swept the season series 3-0. But throw in their
unimpressive 15-7 record at home, and this could be a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando vs. Philadelphia: Sixers won series 2-1, but Chuck Daly
has figured out how to make shooting guards Penny Hardaway, Darrell
Armstrong and Nick Anderson happy. He's starting all three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mailman keeps delivering: The last time Phoenix played at Utah,
Karl Malone fouled Luc Longley so hard the Australian suffered a
hyperextended knee and missed seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The encore took place Monday, when the Jazz again hosted the
Suns. Longley's backup and buddy, Joe Kleine, took a hard elbow
from Malone as Malone put up a shot near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   No foul was called on either Malone or Kleine, but Kleine's face
was a bloody mess. He stalked down court, caught up with Malone,
yelled at him and gave him a shove, streaking Malone's jersey with
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine was called for a technical, and Malone had to leave the
floor to change his jersey. Kleine probably wished he had gotten
off so easily.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Lakeview Hospital in nearby Bountiful, where Dr.
Richard Kjar, a plastic surgeon, used 30 stitches to repair
Kleine's lower lip. He also had to be checked for a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl showed zero remorse,'' Phoenix coach Danny Ainge said.
``All he's done is bash Joe and Luc Longley. All he does is play
dirty and show no remorse for the players he leaves injured on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone pleaded ignorance to the incident: ``I was going to the
basket and he stuck his nose in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton lets off steam: After the Sonics got trashed by the Trail
Blazers on Wednesday, Payton was overheard in the locker room
cursing to his agent, Aaron Goodwin, about Seattle's sorry season.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin told Payton to calm down because general manager Wally
Walker was close by. Payton responded: ``I don't (care) if Wally
hears me.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the G-rated version of what he said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode lasted no more than 30 seconds but was turned into
screaming headlines by the Seattle papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't reported correctly,'' Payton said. ``Frustration is
always going to come out. And I'm frustrated right now about us
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton is apparently also upset that Walker let Jerome Kersey
and Greg Anthony leave, and brought in benchwarmer Billy Owens.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so does Payton want to be traded?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to be in Seattle,'' Payton said. ``(The incident)
has nothing to do with it. My contract isn't up until 2003 so I'm
going to be here until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be here until I retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting mad: Golden State's normally placid Chris Mills got
into it with Sacramento guard Vernon Maxwell this week, exchanging
words with him on the court. Mills has never had warm feelings for
Mad Max and actually went to the Kings locker room to seek him out
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be combatants shouted at each other but were separated
and Mills never actually made it into the visitors' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've calmed down,'' Mills said afterward. ``He had me
pretty upset out there. It seemed like he was mad at the world and
I guess he was trying to take it out on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who posted up the smaller Maxwell several times during
the game, said Maxwell's fouling antics and constant trash talking
eventually got to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully when I see him next time we won't have to come to
blows and we can have a civilized basketball game,'' Mills said. &QL;

GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE, SPORTS ARENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you happen to be trapped inside the Sports
Arena late at night - after the ``announced crowd'' has piled into
the same car and escaped, after the dance team has gone off to some
nightspot where the bouncers can sniff a sportswriter at 50 paces,
after Chris Ford's last accusation of defense (``illegal!'') has
dusted the rafters don't be surprised to hear a conversation
between the ghosts of Randy Woods and Benoit Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Woods: Hey, I've found your left shoe!
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin: Great ... now I have three.
</P>
<P>
   And if you see the ghost of Larry Brown, tell him the UCLA job
isn't open. Then run like hell.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're not here to tear down the Sports Arena, because USC
still needs it. But after Wednesday's last dance with the Seattle
SuperSonics, the Clippers will drive downtown and commence yelling
for the Staples Center construction crew to hurry it up.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Clipper family invest even one respectful sniff for the
sake of bitter history?
</P>
<P>
   If you bet on it, give the points. With that in mind, here's a
sample of Sports Arena sentiment:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss this red carpet,'' Clipper Lorenzen Wright said
while studying a locker room rug that still waits for its first
champagne stain. ``I'll miss watching birds fly through the
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   To the best of our recollection, the place has seemed like a
nest that seats 16,021 cuckoos.
</P>
<P>
   When compared to other NBA venues, the 40-year-old Sports Arena
is a bran muffin in a row of wedding cakes. Its playing surface has
more dead spots than a referee's heart. Its game-night witnesses
include barely enough celebrities to staff a game show.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little wedge of Siberia in the bread basket of L.A.
</P>
<P>
   It is where on April 24, 1994 there was no legal or illegal
defense committed, because San Antonio's David Robinson managed to
score an arena-record 71 points.
</P>
<P>
   It is where the Kings made their home in the halcyon days before
scribes realized players were saying ``out'' instead of ``oat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is where NBA teams arrived to challenge the Lakers, whose
superstar forward Elgin Baylor retains diplomatic immunity as the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   It is where they wouldn't dare build a new Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And it is where since 1984 visiting losing streaks have gone to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Meanwhile, at the Forum
</P>
<P>
   Recent episodes of the Laker soap opera have inspired the gods
of sports-talk radio to pose the following question:
</P>
<P>
   If you were (Laker personnel lord) Jerry ``Out'' West and were
required to trade either Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant, what
would you do?
</P>
<P>
   Best answer: become personnel lord of another team.
</P>
<P>
   One room-temperature rumor has the Laker idea man joining the
Knicks and becoming Jerry East. Yeah, loyal followers around town
are becoming disloyal to West. They refuse to forget that he traded
two guys with at least one letter `D' in their first names Eddie
and Elden for Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   We think he should stay in Tinseltown and become executive
producer of a film that pays tribute to the 1999 Lakers: ``Star
Warp: The Phantom Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   (Subhead) Draft update
</P>
<P>
   The NBA stages a draft every year, and every year the league's
talent buzzards say the draft stinks.
</P>
<P>
   They said it reeked last year, and the current rookie crop has
responded by providing the NBA with a whiff of ambrosia.
</P>
<P>
   But the buzzards still fly.
</P>
<P>
   And they're hoping suspects for the 1999 NBA Draft are
reinforced by early entry declarations from UCLA point guard Baron
Davis and Lamar Odom, the 6-foot-9 Swiss Army Knife of Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of talent, Davis is a top-five lock. But the biggest
question posed by Davis-watchers we've interviewed has nothing to
do with his repaired knee. No, the NBA is concerned about Baron's
willingness to be coached.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he became more suit-friendly while coaching two high
school all-star teams in Saturday's showcase event at L.A.
Southwest College.
</P>
<P>
   If Odom can convince suitors he has a severe passion for the
game, he could be chosen first, ahead of Maryland guard Steve ``I
Can Too Play The Point'' Francis. If not, Francis could be the
first junior-college product taken at No. 1 since Larry Johnson
(1991).
</P>
<P>
   Recent early entry additions who might spice up the end of the
lottery or the middle of the first round include gifted-but-raw
UNLV small forward Shawn Marion and Georgia small forward Jumaine
Jones, whose jumper has more range than a John Wayne movie.
</P>
<P>
   Still straddling the fence, but leaning toward the NBA side, is
Duke sophomore-to-be Corey Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   (Subhead) Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby, the Clippers free-agent rookie small forward, is
absolutely mad for Chinese food. One of Nesby's long-term goals is
to open two restaurants that specialize in Chinese chow - one in
California and one in Las Vegas (he played at UNLV). Suggested
name: ``Ty Cuisine.'' ... Before you dismiss the playing-time
whining by the agent of Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire,
remember that Damon spelled backward is Nomad. ... Leon Smith of
Martin Luther King High in Chicago has decided to make himself a
vailable for the NBA Draft. After bow-wowing scouts in a recent
all-star tilt at Pauley Pavilion, the 6-10 Smith looks like a minor
reach in the second round. ... Bet you've been wondering who
invented the game-morning shootaround, right? If you're an NBA
player who likes to sleep in, blame former Lakers coach Bill
Sharman. ... As was demonstrated in his ugly exchange with
Portland's Greg Anthony, Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller likes to
insult visiting players from his courtside seat. According to a
rumor we might have made up, Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling
prefers to harass opposing players by threatening to acquire them
in a trade.

 &HT;    K.C. fans walk out in protest
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Millwood has spent all spring answering
questions about his new role in the Braves rotation. Saturday
night, he gave the best response yet from the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the Cincinnati Reds to scoreless into the eighth,
Millwood extended a brilliant stretch of Atlanta starting pitching
in a 5-1 victory at Turner Field, the Braves' fourth straight win
and seventh in eight games. Chipper Jones homered from each side of
the plate in the seventh two-home run game of his career and Andruw
Jones and Bret Boone each homered once, taking some of the thunder
away from Millwood's finest performance this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starters have now allowed just one run in their last 31
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (3-2) allowed three hits, walked two and struck out
eight, retiring 20 of 21 batters after a first-inning run until
pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney singled with one out in the eighth.
Following a walk to Mike Cameron, Rudy Seanez relieved him and
stranded both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Odalis Perez (0-1) faces former Brave Denny Neagle at
1:10 p.m. today in the final game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones' solo homer in the seventh provided some insurance
while extending a productive streak of the Braves' hottest hitter.
The home run was Jones' fourth in seven games as he continued to
batter Reds' pitching. He now has a .359 career average against
Cincinnati with 13 of his 25 hits going for homers.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who had gone 2-for-13 during this homestand,
struck his sixth homer of the season on Harnisch's first pitch of
the fourth inning for a 2-1 lead. The homer was Jones' first in 10
days, after hitting five in his first 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it 1-1 in the third with a least likely RBI
source. After Ozzie Guillen singled and was sacrificed to second by
Millwood, Otis Nixon came to the plate with just 4 hits in his
previous 33 at-bats and hitting .167 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon legged out an infield single to the right side and
Guillen came around to score when first baseman Sean Casey's throw
got away from Harnisch. The run was unearned with an error charged
to Casey.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four starts, Millwood averaged better than a walk
every other inning, a bad habit that cost him an early lead. He
walked Greg Vaughn with two outs in the first and Casey, whose .372
average ranked fourth in the league entering the night, launched a
double off the wall in right-center, scoring Vaughn without a play
for a 1-0 lead.

UCLA RALLIES TO BEAT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't the first ninth-inning comeback that won
a baseball game for UCLA this season; it was the fifth, which is a
feat in itself.
</P>
<P>
   And considering the opponent, the situation and the environment,
this one was the sweetest for the Bruins. UCLA scored all of its
runs in the top of the ninth to beat rival USC 3-2 Saturday
afternoon at Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins improved to 25-26, 9-8 in the Pacific-10 Conference.
No.15-ranked USC (30-21, 15-5) dropped out of a first-place tie
with Stanford, which beat Oregon State 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans and right-handed starting pitcher Justin Lehr
carried a 2-0 lead into the ninth. UCLA rallied to tie the game
with two outs on Jason Green's single to right field, then went
ahead one batter later when Garrett Atkins scored from second base
on an infield single by Matt Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who was hitless in his first three at-bats, fouled off
four consecutive pitches with two strikes before getting the base
hit off USC reliever Dominic Correa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to put the ball in play,'' said Green, the
Bruins' catcher and senior co-captain. ``(Correa) was throwing some
tough pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   On each two-strike pitch, most of the crowd of 1,242 was on its
feet. Green said he gained motivation from the cheering, even
though it was directed toward the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It juices you up a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the USC team started celebrating when Green nearly struck
out on a high fastball. He fouled-tipped the ball at the last
second and USC catcher Beau Craig couldn't hold on for the third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about as close to a loss as I've ever seen a team
being close to losing,'' said UCLA head coach Gary Adams, who is in
his 30th season as a college coach.
</P>
<P>
   Adams technically wasn't supposed to have witnessed the
comeback. He was ejected by umpire Steve Williamson in the seventh
inning after arguing a balk call against UCLA reliever Tyler Dersom
(Chaminade High).
</P>
<P>
   But Adams snuck peeks at the game from the stairwell leading
into the visitor's locker room, as did UCLA pitching coach Tim
Leary, who was kicked out of the game by home plate umpire Gus
Rodriguez just minutes after Adams was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (assistant) coach (Vince Beringhele) before the game,
`sooner or later I'm going to get tossed, so you better be
prepared,''' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams might have been ejected, but the finish left Lehr
dejected.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, a transfer from UC Santa Barbara who hasn't lost in six
decisions, struck out 10 and walked none in 81/3 innings. He was
taken out in the ninth after he gave up a single to Chase Utley,
who went 3 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Currier came in and walked former Alemany standout Bill
Scott, and Correa moved from second base to the mound to try to
pick up his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins singled to drive in Utley, which made it 2-1. Designated
hitter Eric Reese struck out and then Green got the tying hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debated whether to take out (Lehr) after he got the first
hitter,'' USC head coach Mike Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr said he was disappointed with losing the game, not with
watching the Bruins rally after he was taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20,'' he said. ``Bill Scott hits into a double
play and it's a great call.''

 &HT;    Charasmatic takes Kentucky Derby
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ For six months last year, Chris Antley ran 25
miles a day to take off more than 30 pounds, a weight loss that
would allow him to ride horse races again.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, trainer Wayne Lukas decided Charismatic was so
heavy that the only way to make him lose weight was to race him
every two weeks instead of once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The two former fat boys outran Menifee by a neck after 1 1/4
miles Saturday to win the the 125th Kentucky Derby at odds of 31-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was a triumph that put Wayne Lukas, at age 63, into the Derby
racord books as the race's top trainer of the 1990s. The newest
member of the Racing Hall of Fame, inducted on Tuesday, was first
in 1995 with Thunder Gulch and won again in 1996 with Grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert did not come close in his bid to become the first
trainer to win three straight in the Derby. The Baffert entries
finished fourth, fifth and 11th. Moreover, Lukas won the Derby with
owners who are top Baffert clients, Bob an d Beverly Lewis, first
in the Derby in 1997 with Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to act,'' said Baffert. ``We're sort of lost
souls. There were too many horses and so much traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners nearly lost Charismatic in a claiming race for
$62,500 on Feb. 11 and they were willing to see him go. ``Sometimes
you have to cut your losses,'' Bob Lewis said. Previously,
Charismatic, purchased for $200,000, had won one of 10 races.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kentucky-bred son of Summer Squall is now a millionaire.
His first in the Derby, with a dues-paying field of 19, was worth
$886,220.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the field knocked out many of the top horses as soon
as the race began.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment fell to Vicar, first in the Florida
Derby. ``He never had a lane to run in, we never could get into any
kind of position,'' said trainer Carl Nafzger. Vicar came in
next-to-last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my worst trip ever,'' said Gary Stevens, 11th with
General Challenge, co-favored with entrymate Excellent Meeting at
4-1. ``I got squeezed in the first turn and thrown around so much
it was a wonder we didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   No favorite has won the Derby since 1979. No Breeders' Cup
Juvenile champion has ever won. Answer Lively, 1998 2-year-old
champion, finished 10th Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In fifth, the filly Excellent Meeting was the highest finisher
among Baffert's three entries. The other filly, Calder-based Three
Ring, came in last. ``She got bumped out of the staring gate,''
said trainer Ed Plesa. Jr. ``Then, just when the jockey was taking
hold of her, his saddle slipped. That was all she wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the race's moderate successes was Worldly Manner, trained
in Dubai. But after a challenge in the stretch for jockey Jerry
Bailey, he fell to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 betting choice at 5-1, Stephen Got Even came in 14th. ``He
never got any kind of traction,'' said jockey Chris McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said before the race that the the outcome would likely
depend on how trouble-free the winning horse's route was and how
well the jockey rode.
</P>
<P>
   It worked out that way for Antley and Charismatic, as well as
the Lukas-trained third-place finisher, Cat Thief, ridden by Mike
Smith. Charismatic was the most experienced horse in the field,
with 15 races, which could not have hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth Derby winner for Lukas. Only one trainer has
won more, Ben Jones with six.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, Elliott Walden supplied the
excitement at the end. This time it was Menifee, not Victory
Gallop, left with second money after a furious rush. ``We had to
wait for room too long to win it,'' said the trainer. ``I had to
stop and start one time too many,'' said jockey Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said he always meant to send Charismatic to the Derby,
even before he won the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not have made it if he had not won the Lexington,''
said Lewis, the winner's
</P>
<P>
   owner. ``He might not have had enough earnings. We might have
been bumped from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Mike Mitchell, a California trainer, almost claimed
Charismatic at Santa Anita Feb. 11. But Lewis, who sponsors race
cars, had given the trainer tickets that week to an auto race. ``I
just couldn't take a horse that belonged to Mr. Lewis,'' said
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for four tickets worth $10 apiece I got to keep a $1
million horse,'' said Lewis.

3 WOUNDED AS ARGUMENT TURNS INTO GUNFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An argument at a McDonald's restaurant in Queens
erupted in gunfire Saturday afternoon, leaving three people
wounded, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began shortly after 2:30 p.m. inside the restaurant,
on the corner of Mott Avenue and Beach Channel Drive, said
Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman. He said
it apparently involved two patrons, both described as between 19
and 25, who were yelling at each another. Shortly after the two men
walked outside, one of them pulled a gun and began firing, the
detective said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Devon Tholliver, 19, was wounded in the stomach,
the police said. Two bystanders, 11- and 14-year-old sisters, were
hit in the legs by gunfire. The girls, whose names were not
released, were taken to Peninsula Hospital, where they were listed
in stable condition, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tholliver was listed in serious condition Saturday afternoon at
Jamaica Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard eight shots and then saw people running and this guy
on the floor of the parking lot,'' said Dong Kim, 33, describing
what he saw from his window at George and Chris Cleaners across the
street . ``This isn't the safest neighborhood in the world, but it
shook me a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said another shooting had occurred at the McDonald's
within the last month, and the suspects involved were arrested. The
gunman in Saturday's attack remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   Pentangelo would not speculate on the motive in either crime.
But business owners near the McDonald's said the area was
frequented by drug dealers and their customers. One nearby store
owner said he had made repeated calls to the police about drugs
being sold in front of his building and the McDonald's. ``They need
to do something about this place or a lot of people are going to
get shot,'' he said. ``A lot of people are carrying guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Digne, 46, said the shootings had left her scared. An
area resident for 18 years, she said she had never before been
concerned when her two teen-age children spoke of getting a soda at
the restaurant. But times had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me when they say, `Mom, I'm going to walk up to the
McDonald's' or whatever,'' said Mrs. Digne. ``Its just horrifying.
I don't know what's happening anymore.''

LUKAS WINS DERBY WITH LONG SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Say this for the handicappers who declared
California's 3-year-olds overrated this season: They were
three-quarters correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Baffert troika finished out of the money as the trainer
chased a record third straight Kentucky Derby victory Saturday in
front of 151,051 fans at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   But the winner was another California horse. A colt who'd run in
a Santa Anita claiming race in February. A colt who'd finished
fourth in the Santa Anita Derby in April. A colt whose glamorous
connections had been overshadowed all week by Baffert Mania.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, a 31-1 shot who wasn't even the best Derby horse in
California, was the best in the 125th running of America's most
famous race, winning by a neck to put jockey Chris Antley, trainer
D. Wayne Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach
back in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic paid $64.60 for each $2 wager, making him the third
longest shot to ever win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be foolish to stand here and tell you I thought he was
going to win the race,'' said Lukas, the new Hall of Famer whose
more popular horse, Cat Thief, led in the stretch and wound up
third behind the fast-charging Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lewis put it more succinctly as he cheered his green and
gold silks to victory: ``Unbelievable! That's unbelievable!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth Derby victory for Lukas, tying Dick Thompson
for second on the all-time list and wresting the Mr. Derby title
back from Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second for the Lewises, who won the race with
Baffert-trained Silver Charm in 1997 and thought they'd lost their
Derby chance when winter favorite Exploit got hurt in March.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the second for Antley, who won with Strike the Gold
in '91 but nearly lost his career to weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm going through a miracle,'' Antley said.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm, clear afternoon, the second-largest crowd in Derby
history watched the race unfold in the fashion many feared, with a
traffic jam in the first turn costing many of the 19 horses a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the Baffert-trained Santa Anita Derby winner,
was nearly knocked down in the first turn and finished 11th. The
most heavily bet Eastern horses, Stephen Got Even and Vicar, had
bad luck of their own, quickly fell out of contention, and finished
14th and 18th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other Baffert horses: Prime Timber could do no better
than fourth with a perfect trip and Excellent Meeting dropped so
far back early in the race that she had to make up 10 places in the
last quarter-mile just to get fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any luck,'' Baffert said back at his barn.
``There were just too many horses and so much traffic. I'm just
disappointed we didn't get a chance to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to worry about the Triple Crown this year.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the leaders reached the top of the stretch, the game
of bumper cars was over and the plot became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Early pacesetter Valhol _ the colt whose Arkansas Derby victory
is under investigation _ had dropped out of contention. Cat Thief
and Dubai-based mystery horse Worldly Manner were battling for the
lead. Prime Timber was unwinding a steady rally from midpack on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all was Charismatic, bearing down on the
leaders three paths from the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief and jockey Mike Smith took a clear lead, and in owner
William T. Young's box, Lukas was rooting, ``He hit the front _
here we go!''
</P>
<P>
   Then Charismatic glided past Cat Thief, and Lukas found himself
cheering for the other owners' horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I should jump up and down, holler, throw the
program, or what,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Charismatic seize control than Blue Grass Stakes
winner Menifee and Pat Day found running room and began to gain.
Charismatic was all out, with Antley hacking away with a
left-handed whip, to hold on to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a fast Derby _ the 2:03.29 clocking for 1\ miles was
the slowest on a ``fast'' track since Alysheba's victory in '87.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an emotional one.
</P>
<P>
   For Antley, who didn't know if he'd ever race again after
leaving the sport in the fall of '97 to battle his weight, only to
balloon to 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lewises, who couldn't have seen this one coming.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most of all for Lukas, 63, who is good at hiding his
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   After being named to the Hall of Fame earlier in the week, the
competitive Lukas made a surprising concession, telling reporters
that ``I had my run'' but it was Baffert's turn to rule the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, Lukas made another, more believable admission:
That he had ``misread'' Charismatic, a Kentucky-bred son of '90
Preakness winner Summer Squall.
</P>
<P>
   After Charismatic finished fifth in the Santa Catalina Stakes,
13{ lengths behind General Challenge, Lukas dropped him into a
$62,500 claiming race on Feb. 11. Charismatic finished second and
wasn't bought.
</P>
<P>
   After running second in an allowance race, Charismatic stepped
back up to stakes class for the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows
and finished second again.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas changed his approach, working Charismatic longer and
harder, and he won the 1 1/16-mile Lexington Stakes at Keeneland
two weeks ago to earn a spot in the Derby field.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Charismatic came to Churchill Downs with more losses (11)
than any of his opponents and was the choice of few experts.

LONG ISLAND FIRE KILLS 3 AND INJURES 13 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand.)  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A roaring fire that may have been touched off by leaking gas
engulfed a one-family house crowded with 33 Salvadoran immigrants
in Huntington Station, N.Y., early Saturday, killing three people,
including a mother and daughter, and leaving 13 injured and 30
survivors homeless, Suffolk County officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire, the cause of which was officially
undetermined and under investigation, erupted about 3:35 a.m. at 28
West Hills Rd., near Jericho Turnpike, and spread quickly through
the two-story, white-shingle house, which had been subdivided into
five apartments, each occupied by five to 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Residents told of awaking to strong odors of gas, and then of a
thunderous explosion and jangling smoke alarms and screams
throughout the house as men, women and children stumbled about in
the darkness, trying to get out through billowing smoke and
gathering heat.
</P>
<P>
   Most succeeded. But Maria Chicas, 35, a restaurant cook, and her
daughter, Maria, 4, were trapped and died in their upstairs
apartment. Their cousin, Luis Cruz, 40, who arrived from El
Salvador only four days ago to make a new life in America, fell
burning from a second-story window, unable to reach the
outstretched hands of a firefighter, and he also died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw black smoke coming from the building,'' Anthony Molina,
32, who ran out of his mother's house next door, recalled. ``I
wanted to go in, but then the whole place burst into flames. I saw
a guy in the window. His legs were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fireman got up on a van and tried to grab him, but couldn't
reach him, and the man fell. He was on fire when he fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's two sisters, Jacqueline Molina, 26, and Anita Valentin,
19, said they called 911 twice to report the fire, but were not
taken seriously by a dispatcher at first. They and their brother
and another neighbor, Jean Field, said Huntington Manor
firefighters took 15 to 20 minutes to reach the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Chief John Glidden and Brian O'Shaughnessy, a
dispatcher for the Huntington Manor Volunteer Fire Department,
insisted that firefighters were on the scene two minutes after the
department was notified at 3:42 a.m. by the Suffolk police, who
recorded the first 911 call at 3:38 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Sgt. Robert P. Doyle of the Suffolk police homicide
squad said that the first fire units were on the scene at 3:44
a.m., that 67 firefighters arrived within minutes and that 300,
including members of departments from nearby communities, were
there before it was brought under control at 6:27 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shaughnessy noted that the Huntington Manor firefighters, most
of whom were at home, were summoned simultaneously by a radio pager
that directed them to the fire scene or to the nearest fire station
a quarter of a mile away. He said there appeared to have been a
delay in reporting the fire because the flames had engulfed the
house by the time the first units arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard, the fire had a head start before we had
a chance to do anything,'' he said. ``The volume of fire on arrival
was extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said 33 people were in the building when the fire
broke out _ 10 in a basement apartment, five each in two
first-floor apartments and six and seven in the two second-floor
apartments. Doyle said the police would look into reports that the
house had been illegally subdivided and occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-three people living in the building is excessive,'' the
sergeant said. ``The town is looking into violations. It was
obviously a lot more people living here than should be in a
dwelling of that size.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fire was not immediately declared suspicious, the
Suffolk County police arson and homicide squads were investigating
because fatalities occurred and because the fire's cause was
unknown, according to Officer Sonny Di Stefano, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear where the flames broke out. But Faustino Bonilla,
who lived with his family on the first floor, said he awoke to a
strong odor of gas, then heard an explosion and quickly gathered
his wife and children and fled through the gathering smoke and
heat. Moments after he reached the street, he said, the whole house
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the deaths were to be determined by the Suffolk
County Medical Examiner in autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Elvancia Flores, 40, who suffered critical injuries, was
airlifted to the University Medical Center at Stony Brook. Ten
other residents sustained injuries that were described as not
life-threatening. Seven were taken to Huntington Hospital, two to
North Shore Hospital at Plainview, and one to Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Two Huntington Manor firefighters, Chris Manzanillo and Brian
Winzer, were taken to Huntington Hospital, where they were treated
for smoke inhalation and released.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said that those left homeless by the blaze were
being put up temporarily at the Deer Park Hotel in Commack, and
neighbors and churches in the Huntington Station area were taking
up collections of food, clothing and money for the victims.

</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, as the fire-blackened building gaped open to the
sky, some of the victims were allowed to go back into the ruins to
retrieve what possessions they could find. One came out with a
yellow piggy bank, another with remnants of clothing, a third with
singed and soggy photographs. Bonilla said, ``I'm in the street
now, but at least my family came out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Ms. Field took in some of the victims and
gave them food and comfort. Others said the house that burned had
been a terrible home for its occupants _ a place where there was
often no heat or hot water, where windows were nailed shut to keep
out the cold. But residents were afraid to complain, neighbors
said, because some were illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lester, manager of the building, which he said was one of
several in the area owned by Harvey Vengroff, a Florida resident,
at first declined to comment on whether the house had been
illegally subdivided. Later, however, he said, ``I'm hearing rumors
that it's not OK, but I don't know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had rented the building to five families, and that he
believed there were 27 occupants at the time of the fire, not 33.
He also voiced regrets and spoke of trying to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to pay for the funerals, and fly the bodies back
to El Salvador,'' he said. ``I have no idea what caused this, but I
know all these people, and I'm as distraught as anybody else.'' He
said he had given each of the displaced families $200 to meet
emergency expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the house said that Maria Chicas had five children
besides the one who died _ one who lived with her and survived the
blaze, and four living in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst fire in Huntington Station since May 16, 1991,
when flames deliberately set by a 22-year-old security guard raced
through a McCrory variety store in the Walt Whitman Mall, killing
two employees who were trapped and injuring 28 others.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington Station, 35 miles east of Manhattan in northwestern
Suffolk County, is a community of about 28,000 that is best known
as the birthplace, on May 31, 1819, of the poet Walt Whitman.

It's far from lonely at the top for Sutton
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE WOODLANDS _ The crowded Kentucky Derby on Saturday had nothing
on the horse race that has developed going into the final round of
the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch they are coming at the Tournament Players
Course at The Woodlands with Hal Sutton holding a tenuous two-shot
lead thanks to a birdie-birdie finish in the third round Saturday.
Sutton's 3-under-par 69 was his third consecutive round in the 60s
and left him at 11-under 205 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a mass of humanity within striking distance on what
promises to be a round filled with fireworks today. Joey Sindelar,
the second-round co-leader with Sutton, saw a one-shot lead slip
away when he bogeyed No. 17 and finished at 9-under 207 after a 71
Saturday. A dozen more players are within five shots of Sutton,
including Steve Elkington, who was in the second group on the
course Saturday morning but leaped into contention with a 7-under
65.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal and I definitely would have loved to have run out three or
four shots further to keep people away from us,'' Sindelar said.
``But it didn't happen. And so the battle will be filled with a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sutton has a two-shot lead, Saturday's play proved
that anybody within five or six shots of the lead could come out of
the pack. Elkington's early round was upstaged by Clarence Rose,
who shot 8-under 64 to pass 53 players and join a four-way tie for
third at 208.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, posting an eye-popping early score is a possibility,
and Sutton is taking nothing for granted. But he has every
intention of making everybody earn it if they intend on passing
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be fairly aggressive (today),'' Sutton said.
``There's a lot of good players right behind me and I can guarantee
that they're going to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course is set up for you to make mistakes. That's
the only way I know how to put it. You can't fear making a mistake.
If you fear making a mistake, then you're going to be paralyzed
(today). So I'm going out to put a hook in the water and try to
catch a fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton persevered Saturday, weathering a couple of bogeys in the
middle of the round, then turned up the heat on Sindelar and the
other chasers on the final two holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton hit a 7-iron approach on the 17th 10 feet short of the
cup and drilled the putt. It proved to be a fateful hole. Sindelar
had stepped to the tee with a one-shot lead after making birdie on
the par-5 15th. But he hit a weak 1-iron into the light rough on
the right, then tried to punch a low 6-iron into the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got over the top of it from 165 yards,'' Sindelar said. ``I
knew full well that I didn't want to miss it on the left. I was
aiming three steps to the right, but I still hit it left. That's
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball avoided the lake that wraps around the green, but it
came to rest just inches from the bulkhead boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little trough there and it just caught the ball,''
Sindelar said. ``I'm awfully lucky not to have double-bogeyed that
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar bumped his chip shot onto the fringe, then missed the
15-footer and tapped in for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, his one-shot lead had turned into a one-shot
disadvantage. And when Sutton hit a wedge within five feet on the
18th for an easy birdie, the lead became two shots.
</P>
<P>
   The course was brutal to those who started later in the day.
David Duval was 6 under par for the tournament after six holes
Saturday, then suffered a double-bogey on No. 7 and triple-bogeyed
the 13th. That means over his last 22 holes, Duval has two doubles
and a triple. Golf's No. 1 player usually can count on going months
without a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a chance of rain today, if conditions don't
change, the leaders will have their work cut out for them. The TPC
has shown a tendency in the past few days to dry out quickly in the
afternoon, making the greens firm and giving a distinct advantage
to those playing earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar said he spent part of Saturday re-learning the art of
being in contention. He couldn't remember the last time he was in
the final pairing on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why today was so meaningful,'' he said. ``To me, the
reason guys stay in contention for weeks at a time is because they
get into a comfort zone. That's huge. To look back and realize
there's nobody playing behind you is important. I'm getting
comfortable all over again. And today went a long way toward that
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, meanwhile, will be trying to extend the comeback he
began last fall when he won the Westin Texas Open and the Tour
Championship after having only one win in the previous 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable now,'' he said. ``If I don't win, I
won't feel like I missed my chance. The only thing about winning is
that when it's your time, you win. And when it's not your time,
you're not going to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more confident in my game than I was last year at
this time. I believe in what I'm doing. I think probably the best
thing I'm doing now is that I'm not allowing myself to be paralyzed
by a mistake. I'm human, just like everybody else. And everybody
makes mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I'm doing a better job of putting them behind me and
walking to the next tee, saying, `OK, let's play from here.'''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy should come in handy today when he'll be wearing
the bull's-eye on his back and have a slew of competitors aiming
for him.

OPENING THE POOL FOR SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With summer fast approaching, homeowners with swimming pools are
about to engage in an annual rite of spring _ opening up the pool
in time for the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While many will hire experts to do the job, others will tackle
the task themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening your pool is relatively easy _ as long as you know
what you're doing,'' said Scott Wechsler, president of Pal Pools in
Bohemia, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For many in-ground pool owners, Wechsler said, the biggest
challenge is getting the cover off without allowing dirty water and
debris to get into the relatively clean water underneath. The best
way to do that, Wechsler said, is by pumping standing water off the
cover to remove leaves or other debris. That sounds simple enough
until one realizes that the accumulated debris is probably sitting
smack in the middle of the cover. One way to make it easier to
remove the debris is to increase the water level of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wechsler said, raising the water level in the pool also
makes it easier to remove the cover itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to fill the pool to the middle of the skimmers,'' he
said, referring to the inlets around the perimeter of the pool that
allow water into the filter.
</P>
<P>
   With the water at that level, he said, the cover can usually be
removed by two people _ with each grabbing a corner at the shallow
end of the pool and dragging the cover 5 feet or so onto the pool
apron.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that if they drag the other end of the cover into
the water, it's going to fall in and sink,'' he said. ``But if you
drag uniformly, the cover should float across the top of the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragging from the shallow end also makes it easier to ``fan
fold'' the cover for storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick it up, walk 5 feet back, and fold,'' he said. ``You
keep doing that, folding it on top of itself as you go, and it will
come off in a breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Svatek, the owner of Sundance Swimming Pools in St. James,
N.Y., said that if the cover _ and the homeowner removing it _ have
done their jobs well, the water in the pool should be fairly clean.
If not, Svatek said, any debris or sludge at the bottom of the pool
should be removed using a commercial-grade net with an extension
pole that will not bend or break.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should resist the temptation to ``start fresh'' by
emptying a pool, he said, particularly if it is vinyl-lined.
``Vinyl pools are designed to be filled and remained filled,''
Svatek said. Should the pool be emptied, the liner can shift, tear
or pull loose from the shell it covers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pool has been opened and cleaned of solid debris, the
next thing to do is to get the water moving through the filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generally tell customers to let the filter run for about 24
hours,'' said Nick Spalletta, store manager for Dover Pools and
Supplies in Toms River, N.J. ``That way you get the water on top
mixing with the water on the bottom,'' he said. He added that such
circulation was necessary to assure the success of the next step _
testing the water to get a picture of the overall chemistry of the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most common mistakes people make is putting
chemicals in the pool before they have the water tested to find out
what chemicals they need,'' Spalletta said. Most pool-supply
companies will test customers' water samples free and provide a
detailed analysis of the water, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Testing leads to the part of pool preparation and maintenance
that is most perplexing to homeowners _ pool-water chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Cox, creator of www.poolcenter.com _ an Internet Web site
that is a repository of information about pools and spas _ said
that there were four parameters to test for: the pH level of the
water in the pool, its alkalinity, its calcium hardness and its
chlorine content. Water samples may be taken to a pool-supply
company for testing or may be tested with an ``in-home'' kit, which
should have its testing chemicals replaced every year.
</P>
<P>
   The pH level, Cox said, is a measure of how acidic or basic the
water is, with levels below 7 considered acidic and those above 7
basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever hear of acid rain?'' Cox said. ``That is rainfall with a
very low pH.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the pH level of the human eye is about 7.35,
just slightly basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in range with proper pH levels for your pool,'' he
said, explaining that the proper pH range _ 7.2 to 7.8 _ can be
obtained by adding to the water chemicals known as pH increasers or
pH decreasers, which are available at pool stores and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   The pH level is important, Cox said, because water that is too
acidic _ a low pH _ can eat away at a pool's interior finish and
corrode the copper tubing inside the pool heater. Water with a high
pH, he said, can create mineral-deposit buildups on the pool
surface and in pipes in the filter and heater.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to test for _ alkalinity _ affects the resistance
of the water's pH level to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right alkalinity keeps the pH from bouncing all over the
place,'' Cox said. Low alkalinity, he explained, can be increased
by adding a pH increaser, such as common baking soda, while high
alkalinity can be reduced by adding acids, which are the chemicals
in pH decreasers.
</P>
<P>
   The calcium hardness level, Cox said, is the measure of how hard
or soft the water is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to keep the calcium level in the range of 200 to 400
parts per million,'' Cox said, noting that calcium levels in
general this year appear to be unusually low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the pools we're opening are taking 20 to 30 pounds of
calcium,'' he said. The better test kits, he added, will indicate
how much calcium is needed.
</P>
<P>
   After the pH, alkalinity and calcium levels of the pool are in
proper balance, Cox said, it is time to ``shock'' the pool with
chlorine to kill any algae or micro-organisms that may be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shock a pool, its like you're sending a lightning
bolt through the water,'' he said. ``The lightning bolt slashes and
burns its way through the cell walls of microcontaminants and
destroys them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocking the pool, however, Cox said, involves more than just
adding a lot of chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a threshold known as `breakpoint chlorination,''' he
said, explaining that the term refers to the point at which
chlorine levels in the pool reach the critical mass necessary to
produce the ``lightning effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, it takes 1 pound of shock chlorine for
every 10,000 gallons of water to reach breakpoint chlorination,''
Cox said, cautioning that it was always important to follow the
manufacturer's instructions when using any pool chemical.
</P>
<P>
   After the pool has been properly shocked, he said, the chlorine
content should be maintained at a level of 1 to 2 parts per
million. The pool should be shocked at least once a month or
whenever the chlorine content falls below the recommended level, he
added.

UCLA WINS MEET IN CLOSE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somehow, some way, the UCLA track team found a way
to beat USC again.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog Bruins squeaked by the Trojans 82-81 to win the
men's division for the 21st year in a row Saturday at USC's
Cromwell Field.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the men's meet was the closest in the 66-meet
series started in 1934 and led by USC 38-28. And it might also be
the last cross-town victory for UCLA coach Bob Larsen, who is
rumored to be retiring after 15 seasons with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still here. I made it through the relays and I didn't head
for the beach,'' Larsen said. ``When you are going against a team
as good as USC is _ and look how well they competed today _ we had
to go to the wall to get it done. That's always satisfying, when
you see your guys come through.''
</P>
<P>
   No one came through better than pole vaulter Steven Michels. The
sophomore cleared a lifetime-best 17 feet, 7 inches on his third
and final attempt to defeat Dennis Kholev of USC. Michels' victory
and a third-place finish by Brian McLaughlin gave UCLA a critical
six points.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had trailed 73-58 with four events to go but rallied with
Michels' clutch vault and sweeps in the discus and 5,000 meters to
clinch the meet heading into the final event, the 1,600-meter
relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to lose it, but we came through with heart,''
Michels said. ``We've won it 20 years straight and we had to do it
for everyone who came before us. Being at UCLA, this has to be one
of my biggest moments. SC has an incredible team and I'm just glad
we could compete with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' victory overshadowed USC senior Jerome Davis, the
NCAA defending 400 champion who won the 200 and 400 in 20.70 and
45.61, then ran on the Trojans' 400 and 1,600 relays.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA women, led by senior hurdler Joanna Hayes (who had a
hand in three victories) defeated USC 91-63. UCLA extended their
dual-meet winning streak to 61 in defeating USC for the seventh
consecutive year, and took a 13-3 edge in the all-time series.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes won the 100-meter hurdles in a wind-aided 12.7, the
400-meter hurdles in 56.02 by a hundredth of a second over USC's
Natasha Danvers, and ran on the Bruins' victorious 1,600-meter
relay, which timed 3:35.15.
</P>
<P>
   The USC women's 400-meter relay team of Angela Williams, Torri
Edwards, Malika Edmonson and Candace Young set a national dual meet
and all-time Pacific-10 record to win in 43.35 despite running a
solo effort after UCLA dropped the baton on the first exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a freshman who holds the national high school 100
record, won the 100 in a wind-aided 11.02 to turn back 1998 World
Junior champion Shakedia Jones of UCLA. Edwards, the 1996 Pac-10
champion, rebounded from a false start in the 100 to defeat Jones
in the 200 in 23.33.
</P>
<P>
   After Michels' victory in the pole vault, UCLA's Luke Sullivan
(187-4), Travis Haynes and Scott Moser went 1-2-3 in the discus.
Haynes and Moser also responded with efforts of 185-11 and 184-3 to
bump USC's Gordon Hovey to a non-scoring fourth at 184-3. Bryan
Green, Will Bernaldo and Kevin Bowes 1-2-3 finished in the 5,000
put the Bruins over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The meet took unusual turns on both sides. The Trojans received
a surprising 1-3 finish by USC basketball player Jeff Trepagnier
and football player Kori Dickerson in the high jump. Trepagnier
cleared 6-9} with two days of practice and Dickerson, a defensive
end, cleared 6-8.

FAMILIES OF CAPTURED U.S. SOLDIERS ANXIOUSLY AWAIT THEIR RELEASE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDWARD HEGSTROM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE _ Rosie Gonzales awoke Saturday morning prepared to
wait indefinitely for her son's release from a Yugoslav prison.
</P>
<P>
   So when an urgent message scrolled across her television screen
at 11:30 a.m. announcing that Army Spc. Stephen Gonzales and two
other American prisoners of war would be released, she thought it
was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe my eyes, I thought maybe I was just
reading it wrong,'' an elated Gonzales told reporters just hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost too shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales and husband, Gilbert, could be forgiven for being just
a little bewildered by the sudden news of the plan to release the
prisoners to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Army officials had called to warn the couple not
to get their hopes up. Now the Army has instructed them to pack
their bags and prepare for a flight to Germany for a possible
reunion with their son.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the other two prisoners being held _ Staff
Sgts. Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone _ also seemed to be
slowly recovering from the shock of good news.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Sgt. Stone's wife, Tricia, ``is praying and
hoping that it is true,'' according to her step-mother, Lisa
McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is waiting on a call from the military,'' McKinney said,
although Stone received unofficial word from television interviews
that her husband's release was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said Sgt. Stone will have to undergo three days of
debriefings after reaching Germany before he is reunited with his
wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has three days to get there,'' McKinney said, but added
that as yet they did not know whether Stone will use military or
civilian transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Stone already is packed and ready to leave for Germany
just as soon as official word of her husband's release is received
from the government. She has been staying with her step-mother in
San Antonio during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, the parents of Ramirez were also cautiously
optimistic about the news trickling out of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the big call that they're on the bus and on
their way out (of Yugoslavia),'' Ramirez's mother, Vivian Ramirez,
said at a news conference, according to the Associated Press. She
said she would ``wait with the phone next to me until they call
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the parents of Stephen Gonzales, news of the release capped
a particularly bizarre string of events over the previous 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After an agonizing several days with no word about their
22-year-old son, the family saw a videotape Friday of the three
meeting with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Army officials at first warned that Jackson's mission
would not likely succeed in freeing the three men taken captive at
the Macedonian border on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had prepared ourselves'' for the possibility of a long
wait, said Rosie Gonzales. So news of Stephen's release was a
``double shock.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the press Saturday afternoon, the Gonzales'
went to dinner with friends. They said they planned to spend the
night watching television news programs for any possible updates on
their son's condition.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Army has asked them to prepare to fly to Germany
as early as today for a later reunion with their son.
</P>
<P>
   And what will they say once they finally come face-to-face with
him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think we'll have to say anything,'' said his
mother. ``We'll just look into each other's eyes and hold each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzaleses said they hoped to be able to meet Jackson to
pass on their gratitude for his tireless efforts, particularly
since others were so doubtful that he would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank (Jackson) from the bottom of my heart because he was
determined'' to get the three soldiers freed, Rosie Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also said they support Jackson's claim that the
United States should now move to attempt to resolve the conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes tearful but more often beaming an electric smile,
Rosie Gonzales appeared at the press conference in a white T-shirt
with a picture of her son under the letters: ``POW'' for prisoner
of war.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Gonzales wore a POW bracelet given by a veteran in North
Carolina and a pin donated by a fellow Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales's gave thanks for the outpouring of support they
have received from the people in Huntsville and from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in the power of prayer, and I truly believe that it
was all those prayers that made this possible,'' Rosie Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the pending freedom spread across Huntsville, people
in the town festooned in yellow ribbons already began preparing for
a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time!'' declared shopkeeper Beverly Conner. ``We'll
have to have a parade.''

RAW SPACE IN TRIBECA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a huge puddle in the middle of the loft that
has just been sold for $577,000 to David and Julienne Dweck. The
real estate people don't particularly want it to be photographed,
but the Dwecks don't mind. When they first saw the place, it had
exposed pipes, and no windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have some imagination,'' said Dweck. So a puddle in
their future living room bothers them not at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they wanted raw space, something that is increasingly
difficult to find in what are considered the good parts of
Manhattan, and they believe they've snagged a bargain in getting
2,800 square feet, including a storage closet and parking space, in
TriBeCa. Even if it does look out on a brick wall _ and a sign that
says Shaftway.
</P>
<P>
   And they probably have. Because as nearly every commercial and
industrial building in TriBeCa is being converted to residential
use, large lofts are selling for more than a million dollars, often
after renovation with materials like marble and granite. The
Dwecks, who are expecting their first child in July, wanted a
nearly empty space that they could shape to their taste.
</P>
<P>
   Dweck, who has been living in a rented loft in SoHo for seven
years, married 15 months ago and soon began looking for a place to
buy. He does the design work for a 77-year-old family business,
S.S. Dweck and Sons, which manufactures sheets and towels, so he
has his own ideas about how things should look.
</P>
<P>
   So does his wife, who is just finishing her degree in art
history at New York University. (Although she is now Mrs. Dweck,
she was also Miss Dweck. She and her husband were born with the
same last names, which are typically Syrian, and they met at an
engagement party being held for a man named Dweck.)
</P>
<P>
   They looked at ``30 or 40'' places in SoHo and TriBeCa, but the
ones they liked were all priced at more than a million dollars.
Then one day, they decided to get on their bicycles and go around
to open houses. When they got to 195 Hudson St., they knew they had
found what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need high ceilings,'' said Mrs. Dweck. ``It gives you a
feeling of openness.'' Their friends, says Dweck, tend to live on
the Upper East Side, in smaller, ``cookie-cutter'' spaces. And they
definitely did not want that.
</P>
<P>
   Their building, erected in 1929 as the US Rubber headquarters,
is still being renovated. When done, it will have a doorman, heated
garage, landscaped roof deck and central air-conditioning, but its
commercial history will not be obliterated. The doors to the
apartment are huge, and made of metal, and it has oversized
industrial windows.
</P>
<P>
   Like many loft buildings, its location is far from ideal, right
next to the entrance on Canal Street to the Holland Tunnel. To
block out the noise, the developer has installed triple-paned
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Dwecks are so pleased with the building that they have
referred a number of potential buyers, and two are moving in,
including one of Dweck's best friends, who has taken the space
directly below.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as they close on the loft, they plan to begin building
their space, which will have three bedrooms, two baths, and wood
floors instead of the existing concrete floors. The bulbous,
mushroom-like pillars in the loft will be integrated into the
walls, so they will be only partially visible. They hope to keep an
open feeling, but still have privacy, and doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in a fight,'' said Mrs. Dweck, ``I want to slam a
door.''

KENSETH WINS BUSCH 300
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Matt Kenseth did not have the fastest car or the best
set-up for Saturday's Busch Grand National Auto Club 300 at
California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But the 27-year-old from Cambridge, Wis. had enough of both to
win Saturday's 300-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely did not think we were going to win the race,''
said Kenseth, who is second in the series standings. ``We had to
make a major, major chassis adjustment. I would have been pleased
to finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth said the car's set-up is usually a turn or two away, but
when he entered the pits on Lap 31 in fifth place, ``we needed four
or five rounds and about 2 pounds. We were way off.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the 150-lap race finished _ under a yellow flag
where Todd Bodine scattered debris in Turn 2 after hitting the wall
three laps from the end _ the set-up was just fine. Jeff Burton
finished second and polesitter Dale Earnhardt Jr. was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to pass here,'' said Kenseth, who had
finished third in his two previous California Speedway races. ``I
had just enough to hold off Jeff Burton. If I were behind him, I
would not have got by him. He couldn't pass me when I got in front
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. had the fastest car in the field, easily pulling
away from Kenseth and Burton in the early going. But four yellow
flags in the first 57 laps kept Earnhardt from getting the upper
hand and when he pulled in for a green-flag pit stop on Lap 94,
third gear broke on the downshift.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the least of the series point leader's worries.
Twenty-five laps later, trying to get around a lapped Hank Parker
Jr., the two touched in Turn 2. Earnhardt spun but did not hit
anything. And instead of running for the lead, he was running to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was trying to pass traffic, (Parker) was motioning me
to pass. He was drifting high and I went down with Jeff Burton
under me,'' Earnhardt said. ``(Burton) was juking and jiving me. I
just stayed on the gas and tried to not hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt went down a lap to mid-race leader Elliott Sadler, but
a three-car wreck put Earnhardt back on the lead lap with 23 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth and Burton hooked up after the sixth caution and the
pair ran past Sadler with 18 laps to go, giving Kenseth the lead
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, meanwhile, worked his way to third with six laps
remaining. But he said he knew his day was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to catch 'em, it's another to pass 'em,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth won $73,200 for the victory.

I-95'S EXIT 8A IS A MAGNET TO HIGH-TECH WAREHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANBURY TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ The Graybar Electric company is
starting up a distribution center here whose managers promise
overnight delivery of electrical parts as far away as Boston or the
suburbs of Washington. ``If someone orders by 5 p.m., we'll have it
on their loading dock before they open up the next morning,'' said
Paul J. Milata, Graybar's regional manager here.
</P>
<P>
   He can make that promise because he is managing a new building
that is installing the latest equipment. But another important
factor is the location of the building in Cranbury Business Park,
about two miles from Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the site, about 60 miles southwest of New York City,
midway between New York and Philadelphia, but it is almost
equidistant from Boston and Washington. It is also an overnight
ride west to important industrial centers in Pennsylvania and Ohio
or east to the consumer markets of Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is very little housing in the area, trucks have
largely unimpeded access over local roads to the Turnpike, part of
Interstate Route 95, which connects with the national highway
system.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the reasons that the area off Exit 8A has become
one of the East Coast's prime centers for warehousing and
distribution. Real estate executives estimate that there are 35
million square feet of industrial space within a few miles of the
exit, most of it built over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The area is so identified with warehousing and distribution that
one developer, Kerzner Associates, named its project Eight A
Corporate Park.
</P>
<P>
   According to a year-end report by Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the real
estate services company, buildings in the 8A area accounted for 54
percent of the 2.6 million square feet of industrial construction
in the northern and central parts of the state last year. Little
building is going on now _ about 54,000 square feet _ but brokers
and real estate executives say many applications are awaiting
approvals and add that they expect further speculative construction
to begin as the existing space fills up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that has always had speculative
construction,'' said Michael Nachamkin, a vice president of
Prologis Trust, a real estate investment trust that bills itself as
as much an expert in global logistics as a real estate owner. ``You
need to have an inventory of space for your national customers,''
added Lisa R. Clark, a marketing executive with Prologis. She
explained that companies operating on a national scale want
distribution facilities ready when they decide to enter markets,
without the delays involved in securing permits and construction.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of leasing in the first quarter of this year took 1.35
million square feet of space off the market in the 8A corridor,
according to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. In the largest single deal, Home
Depot, a household products retailer, leased an entire
812,739-square-foot warehouse in Cranbury. Caliber Logistics took
150,000 square feet at 24 Charles Court in South Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an active market,'' said Paul D. Cohen, executive vice
president of SBWE, a real estate services company based in New
Jersey. ``The inventory builds up for a while and then it gets
leased.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exit 8A is the northernmost spot on the Turnpike with land
available,'' said Jonathan B. Tesser, director of leasing for
Matrix Development Group, one of the pioneer developers in the
area. ``Every time rents start to creep up, people start building
on spec again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents are modest compared to office space, but given the size of
the buildings, can add up to a hefty annual total. For example,
Building Two in Cranbury Business Park has 151,200 rentable square
feet. Brokers say modern warehouse space typically rents for $4.25
to $4.75 a square foot annually, with older buildings ranging from
$3.75 to $4.25 a square foot. But brokers reported that some owners
have been bumping up asking rents for the most modern and best
located buildings to the $5.10 to $5.25 a foot range in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tesser estimated there is land near the exit for an additional
15 million to 20 million square feet of development. This land,
which is, in effect, being warehoused for warehouses, has produced
an interesting phenomenon: actively farmed fields running up to the
edge of industrial parks. ``I've got a spinach field on the east
side of the plant, corn on the other and winter wheat in the
back,'' said Milata of Graybar.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing agricultural activity notwithstanding, real
estate executives say almost all of the land is available for
development when needed. ``The owners keep it planted, but all of
it is under contract or option for development,'' said Lou Belfer,
a senior vice president of SBWE.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives say the 8A market developed the way it
did because the large blocks of land suddenly became easily
accessible to the Turnpike when the exit was built in 1966. The
highway was widened in the late 1980s, providing separate car and
truck lanes down to 8A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exit 8A was an afterthought,'' said Cohen, noting that it is
almost midway in the 17 miles between Exits 8 and 9, which were
part of the original layout of the highway, which was built in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development started here around 1982, but there really wasn't
mass development until 1985,'' Cohen said. He said development
continued actively until 1991, when a recession in the real estate
business brought everything to a halt. Activity resumed in 1995, he
said, with existing property being absorbed, and then new
construction began.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early building in the area was done by local
developers, such as Matrix, Frank A. Greek and Son and I. Heller.
But in recent years, the real estate investment trusts have become
a factor, with Prologis and Trammell Crow entering the market and
Reckson Associates Realty Corp. combining with the local Morris
Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix took over the old Phelps Dodge building, a dark, brooding
structure long familiar to motorists on the Turnpike. It changed
the appearance of the 650,000-square-foot structure by lightening
the color of the walls. Matrix added 550,000 square feet of space
to what is now called 200 Docks Corner Road and recently finished
leasing it all to tenants that include Barnes &AMP; Noble and Cooper
Tire.
</P>
<P>
   The Graybar operation is in a building built and owned by
Prologis Trust, formerly Security Capital Industrial Trust, which
claims to be the largest owner of warehouse-distribution space in
the country, with 166 million square feet. Like the other buildings
in Cranbury Business Park, this one is tall enough so goods can be
stacked 32 feet high, and it has an advanced fire suppression
system, an ultraflat floor and broad areas outside the building for
trucks to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers and other real estate executives say a building of this
sort represents the current state of the art and renders obsolete
buildings put into operation less than a decade ago. Advances in
forklift truck technology have allowed goods to be stacked higher
in the steel racks that fill most warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Higher stacking is more economical for distributors because it
allows more goods to be stored on the same piece of land. ``Ten
years ago 24-foot clear was state of the art,'' said Nachamkin,
referring to the vertical distance between the floor and the
trusses that support the roof. ``Today 32 feet is standard,'' he
said, noting that some buildings have 36 feet of stacking space.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get one-third to one-half more product in a building
with 36-foot clear height than 24 feet,'' said Benjamin Katz, a
senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real-estate services
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend toward fewer but bigger boxes in the
warehouse business,'' said Stanley Danzig, a senior director at
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``But only about 10 percent of the product at
8A has ceiling heights over 32 feet.'' However, he pointed out that
not every business needs the greatest height. ``Some people don't
need 32 feet,'' he said. Those older facilities, he said, will be
leased at lesser rents than the new tall buildings can command.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economics of higher stacking are generally
favorable, the technique has imposed some additional demands on
builders. One is for floors that are really, really flat.
</P>
<P>
   Even a minor variation in floor flatness can be a problem when
hoisting pallets of goods over 30 feet and trying to fit them into
closely packed racks. One Prologis estimate is that one millimeter
of variation at floor level can result in a load being as much as
12 inches out of line at the top shelf of a rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above 30 feet, you will have things dropping through or they
simply won't go into the rack,'' said William L. Mascharka,
president of Frazier Industrial Co., a major manufacturer of racks
based in Long Valley, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   So builders are using laser-guided devices known as screeds to
produce flat, smooth floors that resemble ice skating rinks. And
the concrete is compounded with a chemical additive that makes the
floor smoother as it is cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Graybar distribution center, a line of grout patching
compound runs down the center of each aisle of racks. The ground
conceals a wire that sends signals to a device on a forklift truck
to keep it squarely in the center of the aisle, so all the driver
has to think about is forward and back and up and down motion.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the forklift in the precisely right position allows
narrow aisles and the ability to pack goods in more closely.
Because of the sensor system, a forklift measuring 76 inches wide
operates in an aisle of just 84 inches. Because the truck cannot
turn in such a narrow space, the building is equipped with
forklifts whose lifting masts pivot to insert and remove pallet
loads of electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a big population in much of the area off Exit 8A
means that companies can operate at all hours without complaints
about noise from the neighbors. ``Home Depot supplies its stores
overnight,'' said Robert Sager, a managing director at
Insignia/ESG. ``In an industrial park, they can operate any hours
they want without getting residential complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Estate executives say the three main towns in the area,
Cranbury, South Brunswick and Monroe Township, have had varying
attitudes toward development.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first Cranbury was against development, so the early
projects were in Monroe and South Brunswick,''' Cohen said. ``But
then taxes in Cranbury started going through the roof, and coming
out of the recession they changed their master plan and accepted
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesser of Matrix Development said that ``20 years ago Cranbury
was the most difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``Cranbury has most of the available land and
is into development.''

LAYERS OF HISTORY, BUT AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A tumultuous strike more than a century ago settled
the question of whether the model town of Pullman _ built
practically in a single stroke by George M. Pullman to house
thousands of workers of the Pullman Palace Car Co. _ was a new
American utopia.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as a landmarked but beleaguered neighborhood on Chicago's
far South Side, Pullman is struggling to define exactly what it is.
</P>
<P>
   The question is more than an existential exercise, for it bears
on a new effort to restore the remaining public buildings and
attract the visitors _ and visitors' dollars _ needed to bolster
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The critical state of affairs was underscored in December, when
the main office building and an adjacent erecting shop, both
abandoned, were set afire by an arsonist. The blaze ravaged the
clock tower, a red-brick Victorian confection that marked Pullman's
picturesque spot in an otherwise unforgiving industrial landscape
along Lake Calumet, closer to Indiana than to the Loop.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pullman was developed in 1880 as a self-sufficient
community within the greater township of Hyde Park, it was long ago
subsumed into the city of Chicago. It is now a neighborhood of
roughly 35 blocks, with some 4,000 residents. Under court order,
the Palace Car Company gave up its role as landlord by 1909, but
its successor, Pullman-Standard, was building and refurbishing
railroad cars here through the 60's.
</P>
<P>
   Red-brick workers' cottages and two-story flats still line
Pullman's verdant blocks in neat, tight arrays. The Hotel Florence,
a rambling Queen Anne dowager, still greets visitors with a deep
veranda and a tiny mountain range of gables, dormers and chimneys.
The abandoned market hall is ringed by four curving colonnades that
recall the loggias of Renaissance Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring over the town square is the steeple of the Greenstone
Church, made of a stone that ranges in color from moss to lichen to
jade, with stained-glass windows as delicate as doilies. The town
stable, now an auto-repair shop, is still ornamented with two
carved horse heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the clock tower, Pullman's cynosure, is a tumbled and
charred ruin whose arched windows are now empty portals to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's swaying in the breeze,'' said Keith Herron, the assistant
superintendent of historic sites in the Illinois Historic
Preservation Agency, which owns the clock tower. The state plans to
spend $2.1 million to stabilize the structure by wrapping steel
bands around it and filling in the windows with wood braces to
increase lateral stability.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists in Pullman are encouraged by the renewed
attention that has accompanied the catastrophe. After a long spell
of what seemed like official indifference, the city and state are
forming a task force to chart a fresh revitalization effort.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is to be headed by James Thompson, a former Illinois
governor whose administration bought the clock tower and hotel 10
years ago to create what Thompson called ``the greatest railroad
museum in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing came of those plans, great fires seem to have a
galvanizing effect on Chicagoans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it sad that it has to be something tragic like this that
has to be a catalyst?'' asked Deborah Bellamy-Jawor, executive
director of the Historic Pullman Foundation, a nonprofit group
concerned with preservation, restoration, education and research.
``But from now on, it's a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florence (named for George Pullman's daughter) was already
scheduled to undergo a $1.9 million stabilization later this year.
And a $200,000 renovation is under way at the market hall.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the public structures, no easy task in itself, may be
the most straightforward challenge facing the task force. More
vexing _ and more interesting _ is how to interpret and convey
these 19th-century buildings to a 21st-century audience.
</P>
<P>
   Is Pullman a monument to transportation? Certainly, the name was
once synonymous with travel, since the sleeping and dining cars
that emerged from Pullman's factories made long-distance train
trips ``comfortable, inexpensive and safe enough for the middle
class,'' Stanley Buder wrote in ``Pullman: An Experiment in
Industrial Order and Community Planning'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   Is it instead a monument to city planning and that long
tradition of American utopianism that spawned experimental
communities like New Harmony, Ind.; Columbia, Md., and, more
recently, the Florida towns of Seaside and Celebration?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a monument to organized labor? The 1894 strike, which grew
out of the Pullman company's refusal to abate rents even as it
slashed wages and jobs, was a milestone in the union movement. It
reverberated nationally when it was joined by the American Railway
Union under Eugene Debs, which refused to move trains carrying
Pullman cars, prompting the government to use federal troops as
strike breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Or is Pullman a monument to civil rights? The men who tended to
Pullman cars were Pullman employees (the cars were leased, not
sold, to railroads) and their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters, was one of the most potent advocates in the early 20th
century for the equal treatment of African-American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is some of the richest history that we have at any site,''
said Herron, whose agency owns about 60 properties throughout
Illinois.

</P>
<P>
   Added to the historic complexity is the complicated economic and
racial reality of modern Pullman, which cleaves along 111th Street
into a poorer north neighborhood, largely of renters, and a more
affluent _ though scarcely wealthy _ south neighborhood, where many
homeowners have fixed up their properties. The districts are
separated by the old Pullman works, where some residents would like
to see a shopping center, while others would prefer a more purely
historic restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Pullman said he built the town to ``exclude all baneful
influences'' _ taverns, brothels and labor agitators chief among
them _ and to provide homes ``of such character and surroundings as
would prove so attractive as to cause the best class of mechanic to
seek that place for employment.''
</P>
<P>
   His architect was Solon S. Beman, who had worked under Richard
M. Upjohn of New York on the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford.
The landscape designer was Nathan F. Barrett, who had laid out
estates in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Pullman understood the commercial value of beauty,''
said Michael Wolski, the foundation's tour coordinator. And
properties in Pullman _ even the church, which was to be rented by
different denominations _ were expected to earn a 6 percent return
annually on investment.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure revenues, the company cut two checks for workers: one
for the current amount of rent due, the other for whatever was left
over in pay. Workers would endorse the rent checks back to the
company at the Pullman bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen men with families of eight or nine children to
support crying there because they only got three or four cents
after paying their rent,'' said Thomas W. Heathcoate, a car
builder, testifying in 1894 before the federal commission
investigating the strike. The U.S. Strike Commission concluded that
``the esthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little
money value to employees, especially when they lack bread.''
</P>
<P>
   In a blighted state by the 1960s, Pullman was relatively
inexpensive. ``A lot of people moved here because the housing was
affordable,'' said John Cwenkala, who has lived in Pullman 16
years. ``Pullman is one of the only communities that was really
restored by blue-collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his neighbors, Cwenkala is eager to see action
after decades of talk. ``There has been no lack of studies,'' he
said. ``It would be nice to see something happen.''

SERBS SAY ALLIED MISSILE KILLED 34 ON A BUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUZANE, Yugoslavia _ Under the light of a bright moon Saturday
night, the wreckage of a bus that had been sliced in two,
apparently by a NATO missile, still smoldered. At least four bodies
and many body parts lay scattered around. The Serbs Saturday night
said 34 bodies had been recovered, and 15 children were believed to
be among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Five people survived the missile strike Saturday afternoon, said
police and Defense Ministry officials who escorted reporters from
Belgrade to this hamlet of seven houses 12 miles north of Kosovo's
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The bus, a bright red vehicle known as the Nis Express that
passed this spot every day, was traveling south from southern
Serbia's largest city, Nis, to Pristina and was crossing a concrete
bridge across a gorge when the missile slammed into it, according
to the police and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The missile sliced the bus in two and sent half of the vehicle
plunging 40 feet into the gorge below. In the darkness, it was not
possible to see whether parts from the missile were strewn around
the bus wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Nine hours after the reported attack, said by witnesses to have
occurred around 1 p.m., wreckage still smoldered, and the stench of
burned flesh and burning rubber filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a man wearing cheap brown trousers and worn shoes
lay in the gorge. Up on the bridge, near a large hole apparently
gouged by the missile, the other half of the bus lay tipped on its
side, smoldering in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the plane, and then saw it,'' said Rajko Maksic, a
burly 45-year-old farmer who said he was working in his field just
yards from the bridge when the attack occurred. ``Then I heard a
bang, and I looked up and saw bodies falling down, and children
falling, and I ran for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Maksic said the bus was the only vehicle on the bridge, which is
part of the main highway linking Pristina with Serbia proper.
Within 20 minutes, he said, ambulances arrived, taking the five
survivors _ including two children _ to a hospital in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Policemen on the scene said that a bridge further down the
highway toward the provincial capital had also been attacked by
NATO planes, and that one of the ambulances was damaged during that
raid. There was no way to confirm this account, as the police told
reporters that the bridge where the bus was hit was not safe to
pass and that they could not travel further down the road.
</P>
<P>
   As they spoke, planes flew loudly overhead, and very heavy
explosions were heard behind the hills that separate Luzane from
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Maksic said that there had not been much bombing in this
immediate area, but that NATO had targeted a nearby railway. He
could think of no reason for hitting the bus, and was haunted by
all he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible that there could have been a mix-up, because
there are no military objects around here,'' he said. ``My head is
completely confused. All I can think of is the kids I saw.''

11 ARE KILLED AS A TOURIST BOAT SINKS ON ARKANSAS LAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Eleven people drowned and one was injured
Saturday when the amphibious excursion boat on which they were
passengers sank without warning in nearby Lake Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers aboard the open-air, World War II-vintage boat
panicked and scrambled for life preservers as it took on water at
midday and sank suddenly on Lake Hamilton near this popular tourist
town, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included three children, ages 2 to 5, said Sheriff
Larry Selig of Garland County. Twenty people were aboard the craft.
The driver survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in law enforcement here for 20 years, and this is
the most difficult thing I've had to deal with.'' Selig said.
``It's just horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig and lawyers for the company that owns the boat said it was
several minutes into the aquatic leg its journey when it abruptly
began to take on water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver told us that all of a sudden the front started
coming up, almost vertical,'' Selig said. ``Thirty seconds later,
the whole thing was underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the passengers were wearing life preservers, the
Associated Press reported. The boat, known as a ``duck'' for its
use on both land and water, sank in one or two minutes as it
cruised less than a mile offshore, said City Manager Kent Myers and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people in the nearby condos saw what was happening, they
rushed to their boats and went out to help,'' said Joe Sexson,
director of emergency services for nearby Hot Springs National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The craft, covered with a canopy, was required to carry life
preservers but passengers were not required to wear them, Myers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said representatives of the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Board were on the way Hot Springs to investigate the
accident. He said he had ``no idea, none'' as to why the boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the rescue effort from the shore early Saturday
afternoon was a boy who had been on the boat with his parents and
sister, who were unaccounted for. The police did not want to
identify the boy until the fate of his family could be determined.
The sheriff said none of the dead would be identified until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared, wondering what was going to happen,'' the boy
said. ``I just remember going out the window at the top. I couldn't
find my parents or my sister. The boat started going down. The
whole thing was under in 30 seconds.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Divers said the boat came to rest on its wheels in about 60 feet
of water. Had the boat journeyed a few feet farther, they said, it
would have settled into the deepest channel, 180 feet, of Lake
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Land and Lake Tours Inc. of Hot Springs, which owns
the boat, identified its operator as Beth Hambrick and said she had
been employed by the company since last November. The lawyer, Q.
Byrum Hurst Jr. said Ms. Hambrick had all the credentials required
by the Coast Guard to be captain of the vessel. Hurst said that Ms.
Hambrick, who was treated at a local hospital, had tried to save
some of the passengers and was distraught at having failed.
</P>
<P>
   All of the passengers were believed to be from outside the Hot
Springs area, the lawyer said. And all were thought to have been
accounted for by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had paid less than $10 each Saturday morning to
board the 1943 vintage amphibious boat, one of several that gather
tourists in downtown Hot Springs and, after a short scenic tour
launch from a ramp into Lake Hamilton, for a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said the boats, weighing 7.5 half tons, were built for the
military in World War II as troop carriers and later converted for
use as sightseeing boats.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company had never had a fatal accident in its 38
years years of operation. The company, which owns several similar
vehicles, has suspended operations pending an investigation.

DODGERS STARTERS ARE SOLID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pitching was supposed to carry the Dodgers, and
during this five-game winning streak the starters have done their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort's six innings in Saturday's 12-6
win against the Philadelphia Phillies was the fifth consecutive
solid start by a Dodgers pitcher _ each by a different member of
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five games of the nine-game road trip, the
starters are 5-0 with a 3.24 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   It began a few days after a team meeting in which Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson told the pitchers to be more aggressive,
especially with their fastballs, instead of trying to throw
off-speed pitches on the corners of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown set the tone with 62/3 innings against Milwaukee and
allowed two runs. Chan Ho Park had the same numbers the next day.
Ismael Valdes pitched seven innings and allowed four runs in the
series finale.
</P>
<P>
   That trio is expected to lead the Dodgers, and is one of the
best in baseball. But it's what the other two starters did that's
allowed the momentum to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez broke out of his slump with seven innings of
one-run ball in the series opener against the Phillies before
Dreifort's outing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's eased the burden on the Dodgers' overworked bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's a good trip for the confidence,'' Dodgers pitching
coach Charlie Hough said. ``Carlos got confidence. Dreifort is
making progress in things he can do. His slider was unhittable and
he was throwing it for strikes. Carlos pitched to set up his
changeup with his fastball instead of the other way around. It's
been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending their honor: In the spring, everyone outside of the
Dodgers organization wondered how L.A. would survive defensively
with Eric Young and Mark Grudzielanek in the middle of the infield
and Gary Sheffield in left.
</P>
<P>
   A month's sampling is in and the defense is fine. Young has two
errors at second, Grudzielanek has made one at shortstop and
Sheffield has played an error-free and splendid left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all very athletic,'' Johnson said. ``Sheffield has
been the Gold Glove left fielder. Threw a guy out at home, played
the wall unbelievable at home. (Young and Grudzielanek) are taking
extra ground balls. It wasn't something I was really worried
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Osuna diary: Today's Antonio Osuna update has the
right-hander experiencing tenderness in his elbow after throwing
22/3 innings at Single-A San Bernardino on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Osuna will travel to Montreal on Monday and the
Dodgers will examine him when they arrive for their three-game
series. If Osuna is OK, Johnson said he'll be activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little bit of swelling after the game,'' Johnson
said. ``He came in a little bit tender, the swelling went down, got
a little treatment and went out and played catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna is trying to pitch through the pain of a bone spur in his
elbow rather than having surgery to remove it. He's eligible to
come off the disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Osuna is activated, Johnson said the Dodgers will stay with
11 pitchers. It could mean left-hander Jeff Kubenka being returned
to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Catcher Paul LoDuca's seventh-inning
single broke an 0-for-8 slump and raised his average from .036 to
.069. Infielder Tripp Cromer followed with his first hit of the
season after eight hitless at-bats.... Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson has 999 career wins.... Dreifort stole his first base of
the season in the second inning.

DODGERS vs. PHILADELPHIA &QL; 
Time: 10:35 a.m., at Veterans Stadium. &QL; 
TV/Radio: Channel 5; KXTA-AM (1150), KAVL-AM (610), KWKW-AM (1330,
Spanish). &QL; 
Matchup: It's marquee matchup No.2 for Dodgers ace Kevin Brown.
After facing Randy Johnson opening day, Brown meets Phillies
right-hander Curt Schilling in the finale of a three-game series.
Brown (2-1) hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in a start
since yielding five in the opener. The right-hander is fourth in
the league in ERA (2.34). He was 2-0 with a 1.96 ERA against
Philadelphia last season. Schilling (3-1, 2.77) hasn't allowed a
run in 10 innings and opponents are batting .206 against him. The
Phillies scored 29 runs in Schilling's first three starts but
scored three in his last two. &QL;

LAKERS' RICE BURNED ABOUT HIS ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Glen Rice arrived in March, presumably as the missing
piece to the Lakers' championship dreams. But as the regular season
winds down, the sharpshooter admits he's frustrated with his role
in the offense and ambivalent about his future with this team.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Rice said the Lakers have failed to
maximize his skills, and it's showing in his performance. His 42.2
percent field-goal mark is the lowest of a 10-year career in which
he's averaged 46.3 percent. A career 40.9 percent shooter from
3-point range, he's hitting just 36.4 percent this year, worst
since his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a secondary role for the first time in his career, Rice
said he still doesn't feel like a vital part of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I feel that when you have a player
like myself, you got to be willing to set more screens, get me
involved in the offense more than what I have been. I'm not just a
spot-up shooter. I got a lot of other things to my game _ post-up,
coming off screens, penetration dribble _ and I want to use all
those things to help this team. And thus far I haven't had too many
opportunities to do that. So it is frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   It also shouldn't be too surprising, and perhaps that's why Rice
was initially hesitant to be traded to the Lakers from Charlotte.
Accustomed to being the go-to guy, Rice is trying to fit into an
offense where Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant combine for 34 shots
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I haven't adjusted to it as well as I wanted to.
This definitely thus far is not the type of basketball that Glen
Rice is capable of playing,'' Rice said. ``I try and go out there
and I try and stay focused. I feel that we definitely got to be
able to use me a lot more than we have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't shot like this in quite awhile, and it's something
that I'm not proud of. It's something that I think about every day.
I just think that if I'm in the flow of the offense a little
better, the (shooting) percentage definitely will be higher than
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, coach Kurt Rambis indicated the Lakers had
tweaked the offense to provide more opportunities for Rice to shoot
off of screens, as he prefers. But asked about those changes, Rice
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it every now and then, and it's not as much as I would
like it to be,'' Rice said. ``It just has to do with the
play-calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice might accept the third-fiddle role and diminished stats if
the Lakers were winning, but they're 13-13 since his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not OK. No way in the world that I'm OK with the way
things have gone to this point,'' he said. ``I could be somewhat a
little more satisfied (with a lesser role) if we were playing up to
our capabilities and we were winning a lot more. But that hasn't
happened, so no, I'm not OK with it. It's a very, very bad
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers hold a $7.1 million option on Rice for next season,
but had planned to sign him to a long-term extension; or they could
let him walk as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rice's experience so far make him hesitant to stay? He
laughed, then said, ``I tell you what, I'll hold onto that
comment.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

SCHOOL TRAGEDY HAUNTS NRA ANNUAL MEETING
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He stands alone on a pedestal at the foot of the
concrete steps leading to the Colorado state Capitol, eyes always
forward, shoulders set, rifle at the ready. As the spring fog
lifted Saturday morning, however, the stoic Civil War statue found
himself surrounded by row after row of neatly stacked red and white
placards, each reading, ``Shame on the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Already hundreds had gathered at the Capitol, some holding
protest signs on their shoulders the way a infantryman holds his
weapon. Before long, the crowd would grow to more than 7,000. They
had come to protest the annual meeting of the National Rifle
Association, which was being held just down the street in the
cavernous Adam's Mark Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply can't understand it,'' said Merrill Evans, a retired
engineer with a T-shirt reading ``Colorado Coalition Against Gun
Violence'' pulled snugly over his wool jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Evans lives in Littleton, where two teenagers massacred 12 stu
dents and a teacher less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA, out of respect, should have canceled all their
convention programs here, not just some of them,'' Evans said.
``But, no. They bring Charlton Heston and others into town and it's
like rubbing the violence and the evil in our faces, and we won't
stand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few blocks away, in the plaza ballroom of the Adam's
Mark, a huge cheer went up after an NRA official took to the podium
to say the program would be delayed several minutes because more
members showed up than expected. Eventually, more than 3,000
crammed into a room designed for 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Denver resident Allen Upshaw, said he wasn't about
to be intimidated by those who said the NRA didn't belong in his
town at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make us feel like we had something to do with
those kids dying,'' he said. ``That just isn't so, and we can't let
the liberal media, which spreads such foolishness, dictate what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some NRA members carried signs, too. One proclaimed, ``Hitler
was in favor of gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side had buttons and posters and T-shirts. Each was armed
with pamphlets and propaganda. Each had a slate of speakers waiting
for the cameras to roll. These were the opening volleys, the first
shots, a skirmish in a daylong battle of sound bites, in an
unending war of words.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd almost missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn I drove to Littleton, watching the sun rise above
the low hills of Clement Park, not far from Columbine High School.
The night before, the father and grandfather of murder victim
Daniel Rohrbough had cut down and hauled away two of the 15 crosses
that had been erected on one of the hills. Thirteen crosses were
for victims. These two were for the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, they were re placed by smaller, cruder
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere in the park there are flowers and gifts left for the
families of the dead. The saplings lining West Bowles Avenue are
covered with ribbons and droop under the weight of teddy bears and
memen toes. On other trees, deflated bal loons hang like withered
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   After all these days, mourning has lost its freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Tents and sheets of plastic cover most of the offerings. There
are poems and plaques and signs with messages like, ``Columbine
must be doing some thing very good and special for Satan to try so
hard to mess it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass around the memorial has been rubbed to mud by constant
visitors. Each day the paths are cov ered with straw, which is
ground into mud again by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult place to visit, and an even more difficult
place to leave.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got back to the Adam's Mark, the crowd in the ball
room was standing for an opening prayer, heads bowed. Looking down,
it seemed I was the only one in the room with muddy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol, protesters listened as Rabbi Steven Foster told
them this was not a rally but a ``holy convoca tion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A collection of morons is what it is,'' said Bill Lee, a tall,
barrel-chested former gun dealer at the edge of the Capitol crowd.

   ``You're all fools,'' said Lee, who lives in Fort Collins and
boasts of having sold 35,000 weapons during his career. ``You're a
bunch of sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pity you,'' answered Nancy Coleman, who was in town from
California visiting relatives. ``It's people like you that got me
out here today. I used to be in the silent ma jority who are
against this insane proliferation of guns. Now, I'm in the
semi-silent majority.''
</P>
<P>
   As the protesters finished their rally and begin marching down
16th Street toward the Adam's Mark, the NRA was bringing out its
big guns.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre attacked ``the Clinton
Jus tice Department'' and promised to fight against waiting periods
for gun purchases, against restrictions on private gun sales or gun
shows, and in favor of laws that would protect gun manufacturers
from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of LaPierre's speech, protesters had reached the
hotel, the lead group singing We Shall Over come.
</P>
<P>
   Outside to confront them was Rick Reeser, carrying a sign read
ing, ``Clinton &AMP; Cronies Capitalize on Columbine Killings.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeser wore a ball cap with ``NRA'' stitched on the front and a
necktie made to look like the U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have been brain washed,'' he said. ``I'm here to
tell them that Ted Kennedy's car has killed more people than my
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Charlton Heston, the actor and NRA president, delivered
the same basic message to his organiza tion, though in deeper, more
lofty, more pious tones.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Moses had descended from the Colorado mountaintops
to say the original stone tablets contained a typographical error
in line six, and should have read, ``Thou SHALT kill, sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand NRA faithful stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand protesters sur rounded the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When the speeches were over, some NRA members went outside.
Under a gunmetal sky and constant drizzle, the enemies met,
matching one another sign for sign, word for word. I stood and
watched, and lis tened, the rain washing off my shoes as the
discourse dirtied the street and everyone in it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, I drove back to Little ton. On this day, the only
way to get clean was to walk again in the mud.

BASEBALL STRIKING OUT WITH BLACKS  
 MAJOR LEAGUES STILL WHITE GUYS' GAME, CRITICS SAY

<P>
   PHOENIX - Twelve years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's
color line, the last of the then-16 existing major-league clubs
finally integrated. Pumpsie Green wore a Boston Red Sox uniform in
1959, completing baseball's cycle of breaking racial barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, some are wondering whether those barriers
really have been broken.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the percentage of U.S.-born Black players in the
major leagues has declined since 1959. Of the 750 players on
Opening Day rosters this season, 108, or 14.4 percent, were
U.S.-born Blacks. When Green joined the Red Sox, the figure was
17.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the scarcity of African-Americans extends beyond the
field, to the coaching staffs, to key front-office personnel, to
scouts and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's any validity to it, but I think Black
kids look at baseball and ask, `Why should I invest the time and
effort into a sport where the players who look like me are so few?'
'' said Dave Stewart, Toronto Blue Jays assistant general manager,
who is African-American. ``You look at baseball and you do not see
a lot of Black faces in the seats and you definitely don't see them
on the field. As a Black kid, why would you be encouraged to play
baseball?''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League and the National Basketball
Association have become the focus of many young Black athletes, who
see college stars move to the pros with regularity. In many cases,
it takes longer to develop major-league baseball skills, and
chances of instant success are slim. Time in the minor leagues is
almost guaranteed for any young prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you do in this game, you have to wait for your
opportunity,'' said the Diamondbacks' Tony Womack, who toiled six
years in Pittsburgh's minor league system before catching his break
in 1997. ``Some may not want to, but that's the way it tends to be.
If anything, I'd like to see more Blacks with front office or
manager's jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have two U.S.-born Blacks _ Womack and Bernard
Gilkey _ on their active roster.
</P>
<P>
   Two clubs had only one U.S.-born Black each on their Opening Day
rosters _ the Kansas City Royals (Jermaine Dye) and the New York
Yankees (Derek Jeter). At the other end were the Cincinnati Reds,
who had seven, and Baltimore Orioles, with six plus one, Delino
DeShields, who was on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The overall figure of 14.4 percent, calculated in a survey by
``The'' ``Arizona Republic,'' does not include eight Black players
who were on the disabled list when the season began, but even if
they were added, the percentage rises only to 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not only touchy but murky as well. Major League
Baseball doesn't count minorities, and ``The Republic's'' survey
was not scientific. Some players of mixed heritage were counted as
Latino because that is their preference. New York Mets right
fielder Bobby Bonilla, for instance, was born in New York. Even
though his parents are of African descent, they came from the
Dominican Republic and identify with a Latin heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion, the figures should sound warning bells
throughout baseball, Stewart and others say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it look like bringing Jackie Robinson into the game
was a joke. Me personally, as a Black athlete, I appreciate the
fact the barrier was broken. But if things continue, then what was
it all for? The changes have to come from management,'' Stewart
said. &QL; 
In the stands &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a group of serious baseball fans played a game
of spotting the minorities at major-league parks. They were amazed
at the low number of Black faces among fans who showed up to watch
games in Minnesota, Atlanta, Baltimore and many other cities.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that should worry baseball officials, said Charles
Farrell, director of Rainbow Sports, a branch of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow Push Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting part is Blacks will watch the game on TV,''
Farrell said. ``The numbers prove it. Why is it that
African-Americans watch but won't come out to the ballpark?
Baseball is infinitely more affordable than football and certainly
more than basketball. Baseball is a game that if you get hooked on
it, you're hooked for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As salaries escalate and new stadiums are built, baseball has
to find ways to fill those seats for it to remain economically
viable. What better fans to bring to the game than
African-Americans and Latinos? If they aggressively do that, out of
those communities will come future players. And the next generation
of fans has to come from the Black community, because baseball
already has the White fans.'' &QL; 
Blacks not playing game &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The raw numbers speak for themselves. Blacks are simply not
playing baseball in the numbers they once did. Then again, baseball
is not the marquee sport it once was and that, some believe, is the
reason for the dwindling number of African-Americans in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1959, baseball was really the way to go for all athletes,''
Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``The other
sports, basketball and football, were nowhere near being where they
are now. The big money, if you could call it that back then, was in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Black athletes in the NBA and NFL in the late
1950s barely registered a blip on the screen. The number of Black
players in the NBA (79 percent) and NFL (66 percent) dominate over
baseball, and the total number of Black athletes in professional
sports has shot through the roof. Baseball's number of 14.4 percent
is just slightly more than the percentage of Blacks in the total
U.S. population, which was 12.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that salaries in basketball are higher than in
any other sport and that icons such as Michael Jordan and Magic
Johnson have placed basketball on a much higher pedestal in the
Black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone got a bald head because Michael had it,'' said Joe
Black, the 1952 National League rookie of the year and one of the
first Blacks in the game, who now works with Major League Baseball
and the Diamondbacks. ``The kids look on TV and see all they have
to do is dunk a basketball and they'll make millions. They're led
by emotions rather than common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, hardly anyone can reach the level of being a pro
basketball or football player. A baseball career is clearly longer.
Maybe it's slower to achieve, but you eventually can get the same
notoriety. I try to talk to young kids about playing and they tell
me it's too hot to play baseball. The problem is, you cannot become
a major leaguer unless you play the game.'' &QL; 
RBI for poor kids &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is where RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner cities) wants to
make a difference. The program started in 1989, and two years later
Major League Baseball took it over. It provides places and
equipment to be used primarily by Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 100,000 participating players come from
economically deprived families and might not normally have an
opportunity to play organized baseball. But RBI is not entirely for
Black children. It is in inner cities for any underprivileged
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly getting a lot more kids playing who would not
be playing at all,'' said RBI's director, Thomas Brasuell. ``We
could always get more. It's hard to say if we're going backwards or
moving ahead with the addition of Latino players. It's a tough one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read where by the year 2010 Latinos will be the largest
minority in the country. When you look at it that way, we are going
in the right direction. Then you look at New York City, where 30
percent of our players are Black. Well, in the entire city, 13
percent is Black. So I'd say RBI is doing all right in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   So far one player has made it from RBI to the majors _ Florida
Marlins outfielder Vic Darensbourg, who grew up in south central
Los Angeles, where the RBI program was founded.
</P>
<P>
   RBI has its backers and its skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``RBI is working in selective cities, but not everywhere,''
Black said. ``Once most kids finish with it (at age 16) they don't
think about going on to play high school or college ball. The next
thing you see them doing is dunking in a park. Maybe RBI needs to
have people like Frank Robinson, Juan Marichal, Willie Mays and
Larry Doby go out and talk to the kids. Let them know they can make
it all the way. Being a professional baseball player beats the
nine-to-five job most of them will end up with.'' &QL; 
Black scouts needed &QL; 
Like Black, Stewart, who won 168 major-league games, wonders aloud
how much of an effort scouts, the lifeblood of baseball, make in
getting into the inner city or to predominantly Black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predominant race of scouts is White,'' said Stewart, one
of four minority assistant general managers in baseball. ``You
can't get them to go into a neighborhood like the one I grew up in.
They just don't feel comfortable or safe. I grew up in Oakland, the
same place that produced Willie Stargell, Joe Morgan, Rickey
Henderson, Frank Robinson and myself. Are you telling me baseball
players stopped coming out of Oakland?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cleveland outfielder David Justice: ``Obviously they aren't
scouting in Black neighborhoods. The talent is there. Maybe the
scouts just aren't looking in the right places. To me, the
shrinking number is not amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Negro League great Buck O'Neill, a member of the Hall of
Fame and the man who discovered Lou Brock while he was playing at
Southern University in Baton Rouge, La.: ``It's a problem all over
baseball. We've all got to do a better job of getting the Black
kids to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest perceptions baseball has been fighting for
decades is the preponderance of White front office officials. Of
the 30 general managers in the game, none belong to a minority
race. Commissioner Bud Selig recently sent out a letter ordering
each club to identify five minority candidates for future posts.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig himself has been criticized recently after he hired
four new vice presidents over the winter. All were White. &QL;
