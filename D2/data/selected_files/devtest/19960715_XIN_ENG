<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Demands Re-Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's largest opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) threatened here today not to
accept the outcome of the general elections to be held late this
year if a re-registration of voters is not done.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Secretary General Sebastian Zulu said the UNIP led by
foremer President Kenneth Kaunda rejects the registration of
voters exercise conducted by Nikuv Computers of Israel because it
was done in breach of electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nikuv did not work under the supervision of the
Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said if the re-registration of voters is not possible
before the end of October, the elections must be conducted under
the 1991 register.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said Kaunda will contest the presidency despite the new
constitution, which bars Kaunda from doing so because his parents
are Malawi immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Zuzu also demanded President Frederick Chiluba, who signed a
constitution amdndment bill into law at the end of last May,
prove he is a Zambian citizen by birth or he also must be
disqualified. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jewish Communities Council Proposes to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Yesha, the Council of Jewish
Communities in Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza, has
proposed to establish eight new Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report today, the council hopes to
triple the number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip within the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Yesha's spokesman Yechiel Leiter told Israel Radio today that
the council plans to raise the proposal with the government which
has spoken openly about returning the Jewish settlements to the
national priority.
</P>
<P>
The report said the council intends to increase the population
of settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by 300,000 to half a
million residents.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaigns in May, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had repeatedly said that he would promote the
developments of Jewish settlements "in all parts of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu revealed in the U.S. last week that the previous
Labor government increased the settlements' population in the
West Bank and the Gaza strip by 50 percent, to a total number of
145,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
"I assume that nobody here expect us to do less than the Labor
government," said Netanyahu at a joint press conference with
U.S. President Bill Clinton following their meeting in the White
House in Washington last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jews are "entitled to live anywhere in the land
of Israel," but he quickly added that no decisions have been made
by the government on settlements in terms of scope and location.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that at a meeting with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher during the same visit, the premier pointedly refused a
request to commit that no new settlements would be built.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
today that he intends to put France on the move again by carrying
out reforms in economic, social and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, the president promised to urge the
government to carry out reforms in sectors of banking system,
employment and others to revive the economy of a country that has
refused reforms for too long.
</P>
<P>
The impending reforms would include facilitating bank loans by
enterprises, reducing income tax, curbing inflation and fighting
unemployment by cutting working hours.
</P>
<P>
He said some small and medium-sized enterprises are finding it
difficult to get low-interest loans from the banks while inflation
stays always at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president also promised that the state will lower income
taxes in 1997 budget due to be presented to the National Assembly in
September.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the unbearably high taxes is probably the
strongest expectation of the French people today, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Urges Assad to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
today called on his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad to show
more flexibility and resume dialogue with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, during a tour of the strategic Golan Heights, stressed
that "peace with Syria is of utmost importance" and called on
Assad to be "more flexible" to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Weizman expressed his concern over the recent "negative"
reactions from the Arab world to the change in the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
The election victory in May of the hardline Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu has alarmed the Arab world, prompting several
bilateral and multi-lateral summit meetings among the Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, 11 Arab leaders issued a warning at the
Cairo Arab summit, demanding the new Israeli government continue
the Israeli-Arab peace process.
</P>
<P>
Weizman singled out Egypt, the first Arab country that signed a
 peace treaty with Israel, for failing to promote the
understanding between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Soul-searching is required on part of both Israel and Egypt on
why the bilateral ties are not as hoped when the two signed the
peace treaty," said Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Egyptian ties have failed to make major progress
since the two sides signed the peace treaty in 1979, because
of a series of disputes over the Israeli-Arab peace process and
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Egypt has been playing a leading role in the Arab
world in forming a united front against Netanyahu's government,
which has announced to take a tougher line in the future peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, while vowing never to relinquish the Golan Heights,
has called for the resumption of direct talks with Syria. But
Syria has rejected the call as long as Israel refuses to return
the heights it seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with
visiting Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat to
discuss the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at coordinating the positions of the
two leaders ahead of the scheduled meeting between Mubarak and
Netanyahu Thursday in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
This will be the the first meeting that Netanyahu holds
with an Arab leader since he took power in June.

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests 50 Palestinian Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces have
arrested 50 activists from the Popular Front for Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The security forces suspected that members of the PFLP, led
by George Habash, were involved in the recent shooting attacks
against Israeli civilians in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army and security forces had charged that certain
members of the PFLP were responsible for several attacks in May
and June in areas around the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, an Israeli couple was killed in a drive-by
shooting near Beit Shemesh, some 30 kilometers from Hebron. Their
seven-month-old son sitting in the back seat of their car
survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said cartridge castings found at the scene
indicated a link with a PFLP terror cell which had carried
out a number of attacks in the Hebron area.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 30 other PFLP activists are already in
detention, along with some 300 members of Hamas, the Islamic
Resistance Movement, and the Islamic Jihad organization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian police in the West Bank town of Bethlehem
Saturday night beat back demonstrators who tried to force
their way into a local prison where their relatives were being
held.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Palestinian protesters clashed with police, throwing
stones and blocking traffic outside the prison to press their
demand that the Palestinian National Authority release their
relatives being held for militant Islamic activities.
</P>
<P>
No injury or damage was reported.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Leaders Call for Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli trade union leaders
today called for staging a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest
against the government plans to cut the budget and accelerate
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The leaders made the decision at a meeting of the Israeli
General Trade Union (Histadrut).
</P>
<P>
The strike, to be held from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time, is
expected to paralyze the country as it involves nearly all public
sectors, including all government ministries, local authorities
and state-owned corporations.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the Histadrut's intensified campaign against the
government's decision to cut the budget and accelerate the
privatization of state companies.
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led government approved on July 7 to cut 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars from next year's budget, a decision that has aroused
outcries from the lower and middle income earners.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz denounced that the cuts, which
will reduce education, health and social welfare allocations,
were based on giving the rich at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that Histadrut would fight a "long struggle"
against the government's new economic program.
</P>
<P>
Peretz sent a letter Thursday to Finance Minister Dan Meridor
to demand suspension of the planned measures and opening
negotiations to "distribute the budget cuts more justly among the
population."
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut is demanding that about half of the 1.5 billion
dollars in budget cuts be transferred from the lower income
earners to other sectors so as to protect the weaker section of
the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the new government's economic program, the
privatization process of the state companies will also be
accelerated, a move expected to cause mass lay-offs in public
sectors.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, about 400,000 workers staged a one-hour warning
strike to protest the government's new economic plans.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration States Call for Arab Unity, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The eight Damascus Declaration
states today called for strengthening Arab solidarity and adhering
to the land-for-peace formula as one of the basic principles for
the ongoing Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was spelled out in a final communique released today by
the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration member states
following their two-day meeting in the Omani capital of Muscat.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the foreign ministers reaffirmed the
necessity of sticking to the firm stance unanimously adopted by
the Arab leaders in the Cairo summit last month.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders vehemently called for strengthening Arab
solidarity in response to the hopes and aspirations of the Arab
nations in view of the critical importance of the coming stage.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also reaffirmed the firm attitude of
their respective countries with regard to the requirements of the
peace process and necessity of adhering to the principles, on the
basis of which the peace process was launched in the Madrid
conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that by doing so it would help guarantee a
complete Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights to
the June 4, 1967 borders and a complete and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon and Lebanon's west Beqaa to the
internationally-recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also demanded that Israel completely
pull out of all Palestinian territories it has occupied.
</P>
<P>
The ministers renewed their support for Syria's just demands
for the establishment of a just, durable and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East on the basis of the international law and
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The ministers further demanded that Israel join the Nuclear
non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and subject all Israeli nuclear
establishments to international inspection as specified by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
This, they said, is a preliminary step to turn the Middle East
region, including the Gulf, into a zone free of weapons of mass
destruction, with nuclear arms in particular.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the ministers called upon Iraq to fully
commit itself to the implementation of relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions adopted following its aggression against
Kuwait in 1990. They also demand Iraq to release all Kuwaiti
prisoners of war and return all properties it seized during the
1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The participants renewed their support for the sovereignty of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the three Red Sea islands of
Greater Tonub, Lesser Tonub and Abu Moussa in a territorial
dispute with Iran. They voiced their backing of peaceful means
pursued by UAE to restore its sovereignty over these islands.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also voiced solidarity with Bahrain in its
struggle to maintain internal security and stability. They also
expressed their strong rejection of any outside interference with
the internal affairs of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the ministers discussed means of
coping with violence and international terrorism, condemned a
terrorist bombing in the Saudi Arabian town of of Dhahran last
month, and reiterated their full support for Saudi Arabia in its
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of the Damascus Declaration member states,
which began Saturday evening, was attended by foreign ministers of
the declaration's member states, namely, Egypt, Syria and the six
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The GCC groups
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the 14th meeting of the the Damascus
Declaration states will be held in Egypt in January 1997.

ties with Israel if its new, hard-line government backs away from
the commitments its previous governments have made to the Middle
East peace.

The Arabs are especially concerned by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of negotiations on the principle of
exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Plans to Build More Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to build
new power stations in a bid to prevent possible electric
shortage in the future, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
When the construction of new stations completes, the energy
production capacity is expected to reach 107 billion kwh.
Turkey's already existing power capacity will increase to 21.217
megawatts(mw) up from the current 18.000 mw, according to a
report from the Turkish Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1995, per capita electricity
consumption was 1.378 kwh, which is considerably lower than the
average of the world (2.250kwh).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's energy demand increases approximately 14-15 percent
each year, this requires an additional three billion kwh power
production," said energy officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 86.3 billion kwh energy was produced, 50.8 billion
kwh of which was supplied from thermic power plants and the
other 35.5 billion kwh from hydraulic sources.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's national power company TEAS produced 83 percent of
the total energy output in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency quoted Energy Minister Recai Kutan as
saying that "We will begin work with scientists soon and the first
step will be taken in 1997" to revive plans for a nuclear power
plant in an attempt to meet its rising power demand despite
protests from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
"With six years we will have a nuclear plant," Kutan
said. "Turkey should definitely go for a nuclear plant. We have
raw materials for it."

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Required to Get Permission to Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign scientists and naturalists
studying bird life in Turkey's wetlands "must have legal
permission from the Foreign Ministry," the Anatolia News Agency
said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted officials from the ministry as saying that
the foreign naturalists, who greatly outnumber their Turkish
counterparts, often neglect to obtain the necessary authorization.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists who visit the wetlands must have legal permission
from the Foreign Ministry," one official said. "According to the
law, any unauthorized shooting or taking of pictures is prohibited
in these areas."
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the bird species there can only be
observed under the control of government officials, but many
foreign visitors do not follow this legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
They said that the rarity of some species in the wetlands and
the fragility of the habitats necessitate regulation of
visitors. Turkey's wetlands or "bird paradise" have become
important touristic attractions and centers of scientific study
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"People cannot just carry out any work or research in these
areas. These wetlands cannot be used for anything except
observation. So everybody should get permission before visiting,"
the officials said.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Serb Civil Council said today
it would fight for the reconciliation of Bosnian citizens of
different ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Sarajevo, the council, a democratic movement,
said it would back opposition parties in the Serb state Republika
Srpska during the pre-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by about 400 delegates and officials,
including representatives of Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb parties and
associations, according to Tanjug news agency report from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
President of the Serb Civil Council Mirko Pejanovic said the
council's strategic goal was to speed up reintegration processes
in Bosnia-Herzegovina as called for by the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Pejanovic said the council would back the coalition of five
Serb opposition parties in September elections in Bosnia, because
he said it had offered guarantees for preservation of multi-ethnic
and single Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>

Premier of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation Hasan Muratovic,
who also attended the meeting, said his government was firmly

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: First U.S. Trip Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, upon his return home this evening from his first
official visit to the U.S., hailed the agreements he reached with
the U.S. government as a success.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Ben-Gurion Airport upon
his return, Netanyahu said the five-day trip was a "good"
one that helped him reach "widespread understanding" with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
During the first official visit since he assumed office in
June, Netanyahu held talks with President Bill Clinton and
other senior officials, addressed the joint session of the
Congress and met with American Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also traveled to New York where he visited the Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu hailed a number of "important" agreements reached
between the U.S. and Israel on the development of ballistic
deterring systems and new anti-rocket laser systems in Israel,
joint efforts to combat terrorism and establishment of a joint
working group to search for the Israeli missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
However, during his meeting with President Clinton, the
differences between the two sides over the new government's
hardline approach toward future peace process were apparent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. failed to persuade Netanyahu to compromise his
tougher line by accepting the land-for-peace principle in order
to facilitate the continuation of peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu created three so-called pillars of his
peace policies: security, anti-terrorism and democratization of
Israel's Arab neighbors. These are expected to become major
obstacles in achieving future progress of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his planned visit to Egypt, Netanyahu stressed
the importance of Egypt in the peace process. He said that he
would invite Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to visit Israel
when the two meet in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the call issued by Jewish settler leaders today
for the expansion of the settlements in Palestinian territories,
Netanyahu said that his government had no difference with the
U.S. government on the need of the natural growth of Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "it is the government and not
any outside body to take the decisions."
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of cheerful right-wing activists turning
out to welcome Netanyahu and his entourage, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert said that Netanyahu's visit was very "positive and
constructive".
</P>
<P>
"I call it as an introduction of Bibi Netanyahu to the
American policy-makers and the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party has denounced Netanyahu's U.S.
trip as a "failure" that has destroyed the joint Israeli-U.S.
efforts to advance the peace process, anticipating a roll-back
of the bilateral ties to that before 1992 when the Labor
took over power.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Promoting Rural Economic and Social Development (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two fundamental changes of overall importance were proposed at
the fifth plenum of the Party's 14th Central Committee held in
September 1995. They are changes from the planned economic
structure to socialist market economic structure and from
extensive to intensive management mode.
</P>
<P>
The policy decision about the two changes was made by the Party
Central Committee and the State Council, based on an analysis of
China's economic situation and development trend, said Jiang,
adding that it is applicable to agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The reform of economic structures in China began in rural
areas and has become world-renowned, but it is far from a complete
success, Jiang said. It is an arduous task to deepen the rural
reform in accordance with the requirement of building a socialist
market economic system, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Further reforms should be made in rural management, market
operations, government support and protection of agriculture,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the reform of management systems, Jiang said it is
necessary to adhere for a long time to the contract system based
on households with the remuneration linked with output, and the
dual system which combines operations of collectives and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
A fairly large-scale management system should be adopted in
places where conditions are suitable and farmers are enthusiastic
about it. The farmers' initiatives must be respected and no
arbitrary orders should be made, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Promoting Rural Economic and Social Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A speech by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin that encouraged strengthening the country's
agricultural foundation, deepening rural reform, and promoting the
overall economic and social development, was carried on the front
page of today's "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
The national paper also published a commentary calling on
localities to study Jiang's speech in order to unify their
understanding of successful agriculture practices and rural work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), said that during his inspection tour of Henan
Province in early June he was pleased to see changes in rural
areas and to get a look at the Summer grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
"To win this year's grain harvest is still a central task of
the agricultural front," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China reported an overall increase in agricultural production
last year. If the 1996 harvest is good, there will be more farm
products on the market, and farmers' income will rise, which will
help cut inflation.
</P>
<P>
As grain production is a major influence in agriculture, the
president called on people in all walks of life to attach
importance to it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central authorities have repeatedly stressed
that agriculture be placed first in the overall economic plan for
several reasons: because of the need created by China's vast
population and less-cultivated areas; the need to maintain the
national economic development and social stability; and the
strategical consideration of keeping and strengthening China's
independent and initiative position in international competition.

<HEADLINE> China Likely to Cut Interest Rate: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to further lower
its interest rates, following a cut just two months ago, central
bank governor Dai Xianglong said at a press conference in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The continuous fall in retail prices has created favorable
conditions for interest rate adjustment, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
"If the price remains stable or drops further, it's likely that
the central bank will cut the interest rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the People's Bank of China governor did not give a
timetable for such a cut, only saying it would occur "sometime in
the future."
</P>
<P>
China's macro-economy now is at its best since 1993, Dai
said. Retail prices grew 7.1 percent in the first half of this
year and 5.9 percent in June, over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
In China, retail prices depend largely on food prices. A
predicted good harvest of this summer's crops and adequate storage
of grain are major factors behind the retail price fall, the
banker said.
</P>
<P>
When adjusting the interest rate, Dai Xianglong said, the
central bank will, as it did before, take into account prices, the
money supply, and the interests of depositors, financial
institutions and lenders and their bearing ability.
</P>
<P>
The date and ratio of an interest rate cut are yet to be fixed
by portfolios of the central bank, he said. And "a cut in interest
rate does not mean that China will change its current tight
monetary policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, China has made 22 adjustments to its
bank savings and loan interest rate since 1979, the most recent in
May, when China lowered the interest rate on savings deposits by
0.98 percentage points, and that for loans by 0.75 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the cut in interest rates has not affected savings
deposits, dispelling earlier speculations that the cut had slowed
savings growth.
</P>
<P>
China's individual deposits surged to 3.546 trillion yuan at
the end of June, jumping by 570 billion yuan in the first half of
this year, or 170 billion yuan more than the increase over the
corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Not to Back ECOMOG's Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not agree to any move
to withdraw the west African peacekeeping, or ECOMOG, from the
crisis-ridden Liberia, particularly when there is an urgent need
for a truce among the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
It is out of the question to do so because ''if we abandon
Liberia, you will in fact throw Liberia into the hands of various
faction leaders, who want it the way it is now'', Nigeria's
Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi said here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
What is happening is that ''they are all holding on to
separate territories and looting those territories, mining
diamond or gold in these various territories, so they do not care
about the ordianary citizen'', he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated the importance of the support to
ECOMOG from the international community so that the warring
nation could come to rest in due course.
</P>
<P>
''Perhaps it will be important to enhance the spirit of ECOMOG
through the support from international community by way of
encouraging its members and give it peace enforcement
capabilities to bring about a peaceful atmosphere in the
country,'' Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
He said it wis also important for the warring leaders in
Liberia to abide by the Abuja peace accord signed last year which
was recognised in the last meeting of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) in Accra, Ghana, as the only viable
framework for peace.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian foreign minister, there are three
major ingredients toward achieving peace in Liberia: ''There must
be a permanent and a realistic ceasefire, there must be a
willingness on the part of the faction leaders and to have peace
in their country, there must be substantial assistance from the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the outcome of the meeting of ECOWAS heads of
state, scheduled to be held in the Nigerian capital of Abuja in
two weeks time, would encourage the internation community to
invest more in the Liberian situation.
</P>
<P>
As scheduled, a meeting of the ECOWAS nine-nation ministerial
committee on Liberia is to open today in Abuja to kickstart the
tottering peace process aimed at restoring order to the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which precedes the summit of the heads of state
billed for July 26, is expected to review the latest situation in
Liberia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turning Debt-Laden BBC Around No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Although the Bank of Thailand is
trying hard to rescue the Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) from
collapse, many Thai bankers are doubting whether the effort is
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
The BBC is plagued with some 78 billion baht (3.12 billion US
dollars) of low-quality debts through irregular deals with
politicians and some of its own top executives.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to investigate its problems and prevent it from
collapse, the central bank has taken over the BBC and has
completed a rehabilitation plan for it, including mobilizing of
new funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the move is not generally accepted as a wise one.
</P>
<P>
Some bankers have cautioned that with such a heavy burden of
low-quality debts, it would be almost impossible for the new
control management to turn the bank around.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the BBC's bad debts alone amounted to some 30
billion baht (1.2 billion US dollars), which it would have to
write off before it can entertain any prospects of profitability.
</P>
<P>
Even if the BBC could attain a two-percent return rate on
assets, which is the level of the country's top commercial bank --
the Bangkok Bank Limited., it would still take the BBC almost 10
years to write off the huge amount.
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts believe that it will take years before
the public fully restores its confidence in the bank's security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
With the competition in the banking industry growing, the BBC
is finding it hard to recruit a competent management team to
replace the control committee, which is running the bank for the
time being, the analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Bangkok Post, the efficiency of
the BBC's staff is among the lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The BBC's clientele base also seems discouraging as many of its
major clients took loans on overvalued collaterals or refused to
repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
And the size of the clientele base is limited as well due to
the bank's conservative operations for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that it is no easy job to improve and expand
the client base at the same time.

<HEADLINE> India Ready to Discuss "No War Pact" With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- India is prepared to discuss a
"no war pact" with neighboring Pakistan, Indian External Affairs
Minister I. Kumar Gujral said at a session of the Lok Sabha (lower
house) today.
</P>
<P>
He added that India wanted to discuss with Pakistan the entire
gamut of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Pakistani Prime Minister wrote a letter to
her Indian counterpart Deve Gowda, suggesting wide-ranging and
comprehensive dialogues and resumption of talks at the
foreign-secretary level.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Benazir Bhutto a week ago, Gowda agreed to the
resumption of talks at the foreign-secretary level to discuss all
the bilateral issues, including those with divergent views.
</P>
<P>
Gujral noted that the Indian government has already taken steps
to improve the bilateral relations by importing books from
Pakistan and relaxing restrictions on issuance of Indian visas to
Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over the Kashmir territory have led to long-standing
tension between India and Pakistan, which went to war three times
in the past 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expects to Dominate Long-Staple Cotton Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- With a good harvest in sight and
liberalization of cotton exports and imports, Egypt could regain
its traditional domination of the world market for long-staple
cotton in the 1996-97 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian English-language daily, The Egyptian Gazette, today
quoted Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali as saying that the
cotton crop is in good condition and the perennial problem with
pests has been under control this year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has planted nearly one million acres of cotton crop,
compared with 720,000 acres last year, the paper quoted officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well in the next few months before harvesting,
Egypt could reap 350,000 tons of cotton this year, an increase of
nearly 35 percent over the 260,000 tons produced last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers will be free to export their cotton under
the government's new policy, with which and a promising harvest,
Egypt could export more than 150,000 tons of cotton in the 1996-97
marketing year starting on August 1.
</P>
<P>
This volume of cotton exports will be enough to reinstate Egypt
as the dominant force in the long-staple market, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
For years, the government has diverted much valuable
long-staple cotton to the domestic textile industry instead of
exporting it and importing cheaper varieties in its place.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also imported cotton from California and Arizona
only, on grounds that cotton from other areas may carry dangerous
pests and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Wahba, an expert on cotton, said that the government
has allowed the import of short-staple cotton from Syria this
year. He said that Egypt has also been considering importing
cotton from Australia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and other areas of the
United States except California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
The expert admitted that the amount of Egyptian cotton

long-staple cotton market, where they have already fallen to
around 1.30 U.S. dollars a lb.
</P>
<P>
"But if Egypt gains 60 percent of the market this year, then
other producers will get out of it and Egypt could end up
dominating the market," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices would also encourage foreign spinners to switch to
Egyptian cotton because of the quality advantage, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mekong Subregion Growth to Benefit All: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the greater Mekong
subregion (GMS) will benefit all parties involved, a Thai official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been an active supporter of investment cooperation
in the subregion, which covers Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,
Vietnam and China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose has never been to form regional blocs: indeed the
opposite is true," Staporn Kavitanon, secretary-general of
Thailand's Board of Investment (BOI), said at the opening ceremony
of a business workshop on GMS investment.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that by cutting regional tariffs, by reducing
non-tariff barriers and promoting transparency in operations, we
make the entire region more attractive to foreign investors,"
Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
He described the GMS growth as a key to Thailand's future
competitiveness, noting that multinational corporations can
establish a base in the country as they branch out into the
subregion.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, the second organized by the Thai BOI, aims to
provide opportunities to build bridges between investors and the
governments in the subregion.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event is being attended by 16 official delegates
from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and China's Yunnan province
and more than 100 representatives from Thailand's public and
private sectors.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of passengers carried
on air services to and from Australia increased by 9.8 percent
during the year ended March 1996 over the previous 12 months.

<HEADLINE> 3 Nations to Be ASEAN Full Dialogue Partners: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas announced here today that China, India and Russia will be
upgraded to full dialogue partners of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the annual conference of ASEAN foreign
ministers to be held here from July 20-21.
</P>
<P>
That brings to 10 the total number of ASEAN's dialogue
partners, the foreign minister said at a news briefing held in the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's existing dialogue partners are Australia, Canada, The
European Union, Japan, South Korea, The United States and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said the upgrading of the three countries will promote
cooperation between ASEAN and its dialogue partners in political
and economic fields. "The two sides will have direct dialogue on
regional peace, stability and other issues of common interest,"
noted the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also announced that Myanmar will be given the observer
status of the ASEAN at the annual meeting. That will bring the
number of observer countries to four, namely Laos, Cambodia, Papua
New Guinea and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The observer status is the second step before entry into ASEAN.
After a country gains full observer status, it could become
eligible to apply for full membership.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the agenda of the coming ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Post
Ministerial Conference (PMC), Alatas said that ASEAN senior
officials will hold a series of preparatory meetings from July 16
to 19.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN was formed in August 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei joined the grouping in
1984 and followed by Vietnam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the ASEAN member countries meet
annually in each member state in turn according to alphabetic
order. Indonesia, as the 1996 host country, assumed chairmanship
of the ASEAN Standing Committee for hosting this year's AMM, PMC
and ARF.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting will focus on economic cooperation and
stability in this region.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Probes Tax Cuts for Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is studying amendments
to its 50-year-old Taxation Law to cut the existing taxes of 55
percent for foreign companies operating in the country, according
to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Ministry's Assistant Undersecretary for
Financial Affairs Fawzi Al-Qassar told Kuwaiti official news
agency KUNA Sunday evening that "the (Finance) Ministry aims
to impose the same taxes on all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti firms
and grant certain incentives for some kinds of commercial
activities."
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on the extent to which the finance
ministry is planning to cut from the 55 percent level.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the amended law would not be biased
in favor of the public sector and would include criterion which
would be applied on both national and foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing Taxation Law, the 55 percent taxes imposed
by Kuwait is much higher than those in Europe and America where
taxes do not exceed 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are about 800 registered foreign companies operating in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait collected a total of 90 million Kuwait dinars (297
million U.S. dollars) in form of taxes from the foreign
corporations last year.
</P>
<P>
Taxes collected in fiscal years 1994-95 and 1993-94 were even
higher due to larger investments, particularly in reconstruction
sector, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qassar reportedly denied that consumers would bear the brunt
of the new taxes.
</P>
<P>
"The Finance Ministry is seeking to establish a stable economic
condition with a balanced taxation system which will not harm
middle and low-income people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Government Easing Tight Monetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's recent
decision to ease controls on the monetary market has caused
concern among economists.
</P>
<P>
They are worried that the decision could lead to losing control
of inflation and growing current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Of late, cabinet members are talking about easing monetary
market control so as to help sectors such as property, a step some
economists describe as "premature."
</P>
<P>
During the past year the Bank of Thailand's tight policy has
given the economy a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the government has been encouraging banks to
lower their interest rates and stimulate the property sector.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa promised to
extend more incentives, including tax breaks and special interest
rates, to property developers.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank, whose the operation is supposed to be
independent and free from government intervention, countered with
a warning that easing monetary policy to favor only one business
could damage the entire economy and insisted that tight financial
control of the property sector was essential.
</P>
<P>
The sluggishness of the property sector was caused by an
oversupply since 1990, some economists say.
</P>
<P>
"The country's economy is in the slowdown cycle, and any
premature measures to stimulate it could lead to long-term
problems," said Dr. Arporn Chewakrengkai, former director of the
Economic Policy Analysis Department of the Thai National Economic
and Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Without "premature" intervention from the government, the
economic growth this year should be 7.5-7.8 percent and the
current account deficit should fall to below 7 percent of gross
domestic product, she said, adding, "but if the government wants
economic growth to stand above 8 percent, the deficit will also
blow to over 8 percent."
</P>
<P>
She said high economic growth did not mean the economy is
healthy or balanced. Favoring only certain business groups could
upset the economic stability and balance.
</P>
<P>
With the inflation rate for the first half of the year at 6.8
percent, it is still a big question if it can be controlled at the
5.5 percent target set by the government.
</P>
<P>
When the government decides to stimulate the economy, it will
make it difficult to control inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Chartchai Parasuk, assistant vice-president of National Finance
and Securitties Plc, agreed it was not safe enough for the
government to ease its monetary line.
</P>
<P>
Although some bankers urge the government to leave the central
bank alone in handling monetary situation, Suchai Chaovisith,
director-general of the Internal Trade Department, said it was
normal for the government to provide stimulation if it believed
the economy had been bottomed out and to cool the economy if it
was overheating.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had decided to boost the economy because
of public calls for action as many business sectors had become
sluggish in the first half of the year.

dollars) from 10.7 billion pesos (411 million dollars), the bank

</P>

billion pesos (650 million US dollars) in the first half of this

and New Zealand will be subject only to the same domestic
surveillance arrangements which apply to local foods," Fischer
was quoted by the release as announcing.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement will remove significant costs to industry on
both sides of the Tasman, and remove barriers to growth in
trans-Tasman food trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, customs inspection will continue for "risk classified"
foods.
The two countries have agreed to develop a joint list of risk
classified foods and will continue to inspect foods listed as risk
classified.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Sahara African Microbiologists To Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Soft Landing of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy experienced a
successful soft landing in the first half of 1996, as inflation
fell to the lowest level in more than three years.
</P>
<P>
The national economy has continued to see rapid growth, with
the Gross Domestic Product expanding by about 10 percent in the
six-month period, according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
The national retail price index rose in June, up 5.9 percent
over a year ago, resulting in an average increase of 7.1 percent
in the January-June period, the State Statistics Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The single-digit price rise was compared to a record high of
21.7 percent in 1994 and 14.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, fixed-asset investment grew at a
moderate pace of around 20 percent, and a minor foreign trade
surplus of 880 million U.S. dollars was recorded.
</P>
<P>
Those figures indicate that the state's macro-economic control
measures since late 1993 have been adequate, without causing
stagnation -- a combination of low economic growth and high
inflation, said Wang Tongsan, an economist with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the macro-economic situation has been
developing soundly, and I expect the trend to be maintained in the
second half of this year," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Statisticians warned that problems linger in the state sector,
with 49 percent of state-owned industrial enterprises suffering
losses.
</P>
<P>
As part of a rescue package, the central authorities have taken
measures in the past three months that include lowering interest
rates and providing additional bank loans to those firms. Reform
of the state sector has also been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
While the measures begin to take effect, state-owned
enterprises are most likely to enjoy a gradual improvement in
their management in the following months, economists said.
</P>
<P>
But government officials seem to be against an overall
loosening in monetary policy now, regarding tight macro-economic
control as essential for further scaling down inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The latent pressure for price rises still exists, and we have
to stick to the stringent policy while speeding up structural
readjustment," said an official from the State Planning
Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Legal Affairs Mininster and
member of parliament (mp) Remmy Mushota and another mp Patrick
Katyoka have lost their cabinet and parliamentary positions in a
financial scandal of 210 million Kwacha (about 170,000 U.S.Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted a statement of a state house
spokesman as saying on Sunday night that President Frederick Chiluba
had endorced the rcommendations of a tribunal probing the two that
they be penalized for breaching procedures including tender and
financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
The report of the tribunal from the supreme court was submitted to
the president last Friday. It said that Mushota was found guilty
of contravening the ministerial and parliamentary code of conduct by
erroneously awarding a printing contract to Katyoka's First Factors
Company.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that sourcing and releasing of
the 210 million Kwacha were done correctly but that Mushota was
overzealous on how to have it disbursed.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows One in Every Ten Shanghainese Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One out of every ten people in
Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and
poor eating habits.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and
11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are
obese, and these figures are close to the average weight
proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's
"Wen Hui Bao Daily."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of
Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research
Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University.
</P>
<P>
People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of
becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher
than in females, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Educational background was also related to the incidence rate,
which is lower in well-educated people, especially in females.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city dwellers, are
obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards
have greatly improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage
in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in
fat and calories, another survey of Beijing's overweight people
showed.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn people who are overweight have increased
tendencies toward cardiovascular and cerebral disease, diabetes,
and kidney and liver disease.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM: Netanyahu Deviates from Peace Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was seeking another peace different from that launched
in Madrid in 1991, a leading newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's recent call for dismantling
Hezbollah, Boueiz reiterated that the bases defined in the 1991
peace conference in the Spanish capital were "the principle of
exchanging land for peace and an implementation of the
international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon was committed to the peace launched in Madrid, the
bases of which are clear and evident," the foreign minister was
quoted by the conservative An-Nahar daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Washington last week, the Israeli Likud
leader and prime minister announced that a good start toward fresh
peace talks with Syria would be "to convince Syria that it must
dismantle Hezbollah," the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite militant
group that spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"What Netanyahu suggested is another peace, a new peace, a
peace demanding a re-start of the peace negotiations from the
beginning and a peace based on principles different from those
of Madrid," the foreign minister told reporters in his Beirut
residence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ready to go backward in (for) his sake," Boueiz
underlined, "but if the Israeli position is totally identical
with what was agreed upon in Madrid, Lebanon is ready and
prepared to resume the peace talks."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister announced that representatives from the
United States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon had achieved
progress in their recent meeting in Washington on the operation
mechanism of a cease-fire monitoring committee in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Lebanese foreign minister at the
weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher informed
Boueiz the breakthrough reached by the representatives of the
five state in their meeting in the U.S. capital on the
previous day.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Ends Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
left here today, ending a short visit to Egypt during which he
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle
East peace process, particularly on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met Mubarak Sunday at an air base in Bilbeis, some 50
kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, together with Egyptian Minister of Defense and
Military Production Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, attended a ceremony
marking the graduation of a class of Egyptian pilots at the Air
Force Academy in Bilbeis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters Sunday that he discussed with Mubarak
"the recent developments in the region and their impact on the
peace process." He gave no details.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that the hard-line policy of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the peace
process in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has voiced opposition to resuming Arab-Israeli
negotiations on the principle of land-for-peace and to the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital. The Palestinians have viewed their self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank as a step to statehood.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has also vowed to build new Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been playing a role as a mediator in negotiations between Israel
and the Arabs, particularly the Palestinians.

TANGSHAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Although memories of the Tangshan
earthquake remain fresh, 20 years have been long enough to heal the
pain, bitterness, and mostly the fear caused by the deadliest
natural disaster in China's history.
</P>
<P>
In Tangshan, an industrial city only a five-hour drive
from Beijing, most citizens are well-acquainted with aftershocks,
which have shaken the city more than 20,000 times since the great
quake on July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of quakes, because I know very well how to deal
with them, even ones as strong as the one 20 years ago," said Li
Jing, a middle-school teacher.
</P>
<P>
Like Li, many Tangshan people no longer turn pale at the
mention of earthquake, because they have learned from it.
</P>
<P>
Within seconds in the early hours of July 28, the Tangshan
quake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale, devastated the
100-year-old city and killed 240,000 people.

"I can clearly remember that when the walls of my house shook
suddenly, I jumped down and rolled under my wooden bed. It saved
my life," Li recalled. "The experience taught me that solid
furniture is the best shelter in the house when an earthquake
occurs."
</P>
<P>
Li's experience is shared by his fellow-citizens, as sales are
holding steady in the city for simply-designed, solid wood
furniture -- a style not as common in showrooms in different parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to individual experience, lectures, pamphlets and
news broadcasts have played an important role in spreading
seismological knowledge and emergency rescue tips among Tangshan
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The city's legislative body named July 28 as Tangshan's
Anti-Earthquake Day, and activities are held annually to provide
seismological education.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake-Hit City Out of Shadow of Terror (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Zhanying, a worker with the Tangshan Iron and Steel
Company, said he has learned the basics about earthquakes,
self-protection and first-aid by attending activities sponsored by
a team of earthquake forecasters.
</P>
<P>
"I learned that it would take more than 1,000 years for another
strong quake to hit our city again," he explained." Many of us now
can take moderate and minor quakes calmly."
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1995, an earthquake measuring 4.9 on the Richter
Scale hit suburban areas of Tangshan, but caused little panic
among local residents.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I felt the house shaking, I realized that another
aftershock had come. A lamp was swaying slightly that morning,"
recalled Wang.
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was just a minor quake, so I continued to put on my
clothes, wash my face and have breakfast," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang's courage also stems from confidence in his housing unit,
which was, like thousands of other buildings -- either five- and
six-story apartment buildings or highrises higher than 100 meters
-- erected during the past 20 years on earthquake-ruined land.
</P>
<P>
Establishing comprehensive anti-quake measures has been central
to the reconstruction of the city.
</P>
<P>
All new industrial and civil buildings are designed and
constructed to withstand an 8.0 earthquake. In houses, inner walls
are concrete, and large public buildings and highrises are made
with reinforced concrete frameworks.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Tangshan also have adopted anti-quake construction
in their housing.
</P>
<P>
"I needn't worry about quakes, because I've made my house very
firm," farmer Qi Long told Xinhua in front of his new, reinforced
concrete bungalow.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of earthquakes, because it's just no use to
feel scared," Qi said, "The safest thing I can do is to build a
solid house."

The ABS figures showed that demand for established housing
remained subdued in May. The number of finance commitments for
established housing, or loans made for purchasing existing houses,
was 1.9 percent lower than that in April and 8.2 percent lower
than that in February.
</P>
<P>
The number of loans secured for the construction and purchase
of new dwellings also fell in May.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,836 students from 47
primary schools in Sakai, Japan, have been ill from food poisoning
since last Friday, with 146 of them being hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning, which caused diarrhea, bloody stools, vomiting
and fever in the children, was believed to be a result of 0-157
colon bacillus after doctors found the bacteria in the stools of
13 hospitalized kids.
</P>
<P>
Old people and children are easily affected by the bacteria,
which can be contracted from food and drink.
</P>
<P>
Last month, three primary school students died from food
poisoning caused by the bacteria and 1,600 others in 15
prefectures fell sick.
</P>
<P>
The incident is suspected to be linked to the school lunches on
July 5, which included sea eel sushi and soup.
</P>
<P>
However, the fundamental cause for the incident has not been
determined because the bacteria has an incubation period of five
to nine days.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities have closed 92 primary schools and
kindergartens in the western Japanese city near Osaka to curb the
spread of the illness.

<HEADLINE> Botany Diversity Put under Protection in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a nature
reserve to protect botany diversity in the reservoir area of the
gigantic Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The country will invest four million yuan (about 361,000 US
dollars) in the reserve, which will be located in central China's
Yichang Dalaoling State Forest Park, 45 kilometers northwest of
the project's dam.
</P>
<P>
Approval has been granted for the reserve's design, which was
created jointly by the South Central Forest Inventory and Planning
Institute under the Ministry of Forestry, and the Wuhan Botany
Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The 5,936-hectare park, at an altitude of 900 to 2,000 meters
in the Dalaoling Mountain, has a 2,000-hectare sub-tropical virgin
forest with a diversity of plants and vegetations. Experts
consider it a rare spot in the reservoir area, and one that is
suitable for the protection of botany diversity.
</P>
<P>
The virgin forest, which will be the core of the reserve, will
be off-limits to most people: even researchers need authorized
approval.
</P>
<P>
A buffer zone, a scientific experiment zone and a management
zone also will be established in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Dalaoling Park has 856 kinds of plants, 24 of which are rare,
experts said. It also has 57 kinds of rare seed plants near
extinction, such as the metasequoia.
</P>
<P>
The park has 20 trees, each more than 200 years old, and with a
diameter of more than 100 centimeters. They are divided into 11
kinds, such as Ginkgo biloba L., Keteleeria davidiana beissn,
Tsuga chinensis pritz and Juglans regia L. Besides.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the reserve, the plants in the park will be
protected, experts said. Several plant species from the reservoir
area will be introduced into the reserve, to determine if the
plants can survive in their new environment.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to build a botany diversity protection reserve
by Longmen River in Xingshan County, a scenery and ecology
protection reserve in the Mini Three Gorges in Wushan County, and
several reserves for the protection of Chinese sturgeon, Yangtze
Sturgeon and other rare aquatic animals, officials with the Three
Gorges Project Construction Commission under the State Council
revealed.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Appeals to Overseas Developers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by preferential
treatment, foreign real estate developers are vying for China's
vast market and expect to profit well from their investments.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 5,000 overseas real estate enterprises, or 20
percent of the country's total, have participated in real estate
development in China. One-tenth of the country's total foreign
investment comes from that injected into the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, foreign real estate developers enjoy a series of
preferential policies, including exemption from investment
regulation taxes, easy access to collection of funds, and the
freedom to remit their gains abroad after paying due taxes.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the investment structure of China's real
estate sector has been greatly aided, and that most of the
overseas funds have been channeled into construction of
residential housing. Projects for building luxury villas and
office buildings have declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
China has created the Urban Real Estate Management Law and a
series of other laws and rules governing the sector, which explain
and standardize the country's real estate development.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Beijing said that during China's economic
development boom over the next 10 to 15 years, the real estate
sector will shift its focus from key cities to small and
medium-sized cities, and from coastal areas to inland regions.
</P>
<P>
In line with the State plan, the country's housing construction
is expected to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent. By the year
2000, China will build additional 230 towns and 4.2 billion sq m
of housing, and rebuild 2.9 billion sq m of old houses.

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Heading for Real Estate Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- With the Indian United Front
government pledging to accelerate economic reforms, real estate in
the capital New Delhi is set for another boom, said a study here
today.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies, which had been in a wait-and-see
manner before the country's general elections early this year,
have become interested in entering Indian markets after the Deve
Gowda government sent strong signals of continuation of the reform
process.
</P>
<P>
Though the kind of hysterical jumps in prices that New Delhi
witnessed in the last few years will not return, the boom this
time would be more sober with the prices closely following the
demand-supply situation, the study said.
</P>
<P>
While the entry of multinationals will boost the demand for
office and residential space, the expansion plans of large
national corporations are also expected to fuel the rise. Coupled
with this trend is the proverbial lack of space that the capital
suffers from.
</P>
<P>
However, strict government regulations, in the form of urban
land ceiling act, rent control act, floor space index and zoning
regulations, have restricted new development projects, industry
leaders have pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Damascus Members' Tough Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed Damascus
Declaration member countries' tough stance toward Israel while
criticizing their foreign ministers for bringing up the
territorial issue between Iran and the United Arab Emirate(UAE).
</P>
<P>
The official Iranian news agency IRNA published a statement by
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmood Mohammadi, who described the
countries' stance toward Israeli hostility as "realistic and
promising."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the communique issued by the foreign
ministers of the Damascus Declaration members is different from
that in the past.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the declaration's eight countries
ended a two-day meeting in the Omani capital of Muscat Sunday. The
Damascus Declaration groups Egypt, Syria and the six member states
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that "the new circumstances which have brought
about cooperation between Iran and Arab nations in adopting a
common stance against (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu's antagonistic policy are bright."
</P>
<P>
However, he was critical of the foreign ministers' stand in
placing the misunderstanding between Iran and UAE in their agenda.
</P>
<P>
"It was the most inappropriate timing for raising the
misunderstandings that existed among Islamic countries in their
agenda since full concentration of Moslem nations was required to
focus on the current crisis which has seriously imperiled the
interest of regional nations through the conspiracies of the
enemies of Islam," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that instead of making prejudgment in matters
related to the irrefutable sovereign right of Iran over the
Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, the wisest step of the
foreign ministers at Damascus Declaration session would have been
to encourage the UAE officials to repay Iran's foreign minister's
visit to UAE for a follow-up of the bilateral talks between the
two neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iran is willing to further pursue
cordial talks based on (UAE President) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al
Nahyan's letter to his Iranian counterpart Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranian-held islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and
Greater Tunb are claimed by the UAE. The islands are
strategically located on the route near the Strait of Hormuz in
the Persian Gulf, where two thirds of the world's oil have to pass.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will take their dispute with Iran
before the International Court of Justice in Hague.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials have rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has repeatedly urged natives of the
disputed islands in the Persian Gulf to be alert against any
aggression and defend every inch of their territory.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Exchange Reserve Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange reserve
hit a record high of 86.6 billion US dollars at the end of June,
the country's central bank governor said here today.
</P>
<P>
This represented an increase of 13 billion dollars over the
73.6 billion dollars recorded at the beginning of this year, Dai
Xianglong, Governor of the People's Bank of China, told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Dai attributed the surge in foreign exchange reserve to a
favorable balance of payments, influx of more foreign capital and
a favorable balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
The huge foreign exchange reserve has led to stable exchange
rates of Renminbi yuan against major foreign currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
One US dollar is rated at around 8.32 Renminbi yuan at

<HEADLINE> Internal Bosnian Boundary Changes Come Into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A boundary agreement between
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb entity in Bosnia,
Republika Sprska, officially came into force today without
incident, a NATO spokesman said in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
No conflicts were reported in the areas where changes were made
to the 1,050-kilometer boundary line which separates the two
sides, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbs finally agreed last
Saturday on some 40 changes to the boundary line after months of
NATO-arbitrated discussion.
</P>
<P>
The actual demarcation process will take some time owing to
the fact that there are many land mines to be cleared along the
boundary, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord which ended the nearly four-year
war in Bosnia, 51 percent of Bosnian territory will go to the
Muslim-Croat Federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.

KATHMANDU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people died in
floods and landslides caused by torrential rains in different
parts of Nepal during the last three days, reports here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Incessant rains since last weekend have played havoc in at
least 11 of the country's 75 districts, while the eastern Terai
plain region was hit worst with a death toll of five, it was
reported.
</P>
<P>
The monsoon toll could be mounting in the coming days as
reports of floods and landslides begin coming from remote areas,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka Sunday told the parliament
that an inspection team led by Water Resources Minister Pashupati
Shumbere Rana was to leave for the flood-affected areas today.

<P>
Last year the monsoon toll was nearly 100 and about 1.24
billion rupees (21.4 million us dollars) worth of property was

MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine industrial sector
continues to expand as its domestic sales in the first four months
of the year rose by 11 percent to 118.83 billion pesos (4.5
billion US dollars) over the same period last year, according to
the monthly survey of the Department of Trade and Industry.
</P>

shows that sales of 14 industries led by garments, food processing
and electronics grew while sales of 7 industries such as sugar and
textile dropped.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the increased sales of the industrial
sector during the period to higher consumer spending.

They explained that the economic expansion in the first quarter
of the year resulted in higher purchasing power of the consumers
and more funds for producers to expand their operations.

The national economy grew by 6.2 percent in the first quarter
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Standard Beer Imported to Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Almost none of Shanghai's
imported beer meets local brewing standards, while nearly all of
the domestic-made beer does.
</P>
<P>
The imported beer has a low density of raw barley content and
dioxide, and fairly high alcohol density, an investigation report
provided by a local department shows.
</P>
<P>
Local departments are strengthening the administration of
imported beer, and will penalize those dealers who sell
sub-standard beer and do not have licences to sell alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has seen fierce competition between the world's beer
producers over the past few years. Imported beer from the United
States, Germany, Japan and Australia has seized a large share of
the city's beer market.
</P>
<P>
Due to special flavor and attractive packaging, imported beer
has been the favorite of an increasing number of customers,
although it is more expensive and fails to meet standards.
</P>
<P>
To keep bad beer out of the country, experts said that beer
importers and agents should have their brew approved by local
examiners, and it should pass examinations given by local wine
administrative bureaus.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Doctorate Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Academic Degrees Committee
(ADC) under the State Council will issue a regulation late this
year to standardize the appraisal system of doctorate degrees.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yajie, ADC director, was quoted in China Daily as saying
that ADC will authorize experts to regularly assess universities
and research institutions that are authorized to offer doctorate
degree courses.
</P>
<P>
He said that by doing so, ADC hoped to upgrade the quality of
the country's doctorate students and push unqualified
doctor-training institutions to improve the quality of their
management and teaching.
</P>
<P>
Appraisal standards were made in 1981 by the ADC when China
began to practice the academic degree system, the first time ever
since the People's Republic was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
According to the standards, an institution that offers doctoral
programs should have at least three doctorate tutors, three
long-term State, ministry or provincial-level research projects,
sufficient research funds and updated teaching facilities.
</P>
<P>
Institutions are also required to produce important research
results within five years.
</P>
<P>
Last week ADC announced that 15 doctoral programs were
unqualified according the standards and would be punished. They
must improve their work and re-apply for the authorization in two
years.
</P>
<P>
Currently China has more than 2,500 doctoral programs.

<HEADLINE> MNLF to Give Up Armed Struggle Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) said it will give up its armed struggle against the
Philippine government with the creation of the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari said on Sunday that the MNLF is
giving up armed struggle since political objectives cannot be
achieved through such means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the MNLF will also work within the framework
of the 1987 constitution in pursuing its goal of alleviating the
plight of Muslims in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF now accepts constitutional measures to pave the way
for reforms and changes, he said. Nonetheless, it reserves the
right to call for several amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Describing the constitution as replete with "unfair, unjust and
iniquitous" provisions, Misuari said Mindanao did not have a
single representative in the senate as a result of these defects.
</P>
<P>
He added the MNLF plans to lobby Congress to enact a measure
which would regionalize the senate.
</P>
<P>
"We will call on the legislature to look at this move to ensure
that all Filipinos are represented," he said.

<HEADLINE> IOC 105th Session Opens in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The 105th session of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) was opened by president Juan
Antonio Samaranch here today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony of the session, Samaranch
warned that the use of performance-enhancing drugs causes
"physical and moral death". He said the Olympic movement would
continue to lead the fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"Doping is the negation of sport and its role as we understand
it," he said. "Athletes who use banned substances to improve their
performance commit a series of acts that transgress and violate
certain immutable principles.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, they destroy their health, which is the
most precious thing they possess. Doping leads to physical and
moral death because of the irreversible behavioral changes that
drug use entails."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the elimination of drugs depends not only on
"severe measures" being taken against violations but also the
educational campaigns to inform athletes and the public about this
"despicable- and dangerous-form of cheating."
</P>
<P>
"Once more the Olympic movement is demonstrating its ability to
act with concrete facts, not just words," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will hold three days of meetings, hearing reports from
Atlanta organizers, as well as those from the 1998 winter games in
Nagano, 2000 summer games in Sydney and 2002 winter games in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
On his favorite topic, Samaranch stressed the need to preserve
the "unity" of the Olympic movement, which comprises the IOC,
international sports federations and national Olympic bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Sport is now in a golden age, and this may give rise to
self-seeking interests, which could be harmful to our movement if
we fail to guard against them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the financial security of the IOC and the
Olympic movement is guaranteed through the year 2012, thanks to a
series of long-term TV rights deals - worth more than 5.5 billion
U.S. dollars. enditem

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Warns People of Destructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Youths and Sports
Minister Hayono Isman said on Sunday that increasing street
protests of late must be closely watched out to make sure that
they are not masterminded by destructive interests.
</P>
<P>
"Protests, including those staged by youths, should not
actually raise for concern because they are part of openness," the
minister said at a function here, according to official Antara
news agency today.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, youths who staged protests must really voice what
they were genuinely fighting for. "Taking to street should be
organized correctly based on fact and correct information," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that street protest was legally allowed as long as it
was positively for the interest of people at large, not for
certain interest or party.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the best way to solve a problem
was through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Many demonstrations and protests have taken place in several
big cities including Jakarta since rebels of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) held a congress to oust the party's leader
Megawati Soekarnoputri and elected the government- and
military-backed Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, the day the congress was being held in Medan, West
Sumatra, about 5,000 people staged protests against the government
in Jakarta. More than 100 people were reportedly injured when the
protesters clashed with police.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the government has showed its recognition
to the newly elected PDI leader, Soerjadi, the supporters of
Megawati are still occupying the PDI headquarters in Jakarta.

SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nine restaurants on Zhapulu
Street in Shanghai have changed their names, in response to the
idea that their suggestion of feudalism and colonism made people
feel uneasy.
</P>
<P>
One of the restaurants changed its name from "Emperor" to
"Guowang", meaning "prosperity of the country", while another
changed from "Empire" to "Nanguo", meaning southern country.
</P>
<P>
The street of eateries is located in the downtown area, with a
concentration of privately-owned restaurants and bars. Many try to
give their establishment a fashionable name without taking into
account some of the names' more unsavory associations.
</P>
<P>
At the request of certain departments and local residents who
said the names' implications and the bad influences they might
have on society made them feel ill at ease, the eateries began to
change their names.

number to 20 million, the Ministry of Public Health revealed here

Figures released by the ministry show that 750,000 people
become diabetics annually, resulting, ironically enough, in many

</P>
<P>
In Beijing 5.3 percent of those who are between the ages of 20

the figure for 1980.
</P>
<P>
The ministry set up a consultative committee recently to help
draw up plans for halting the disease. The best way urbanites can
prevent diabetes, it explained, is to adopt good living habits,
which include, mainly, a change in dietary habits.

<HEADLINE> Peace Implementation Force in Bosnia Numbers 50,046 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The international peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) has 50,046 troops in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 83 percent of whom are from NATO
member-countries.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led multi-national peace force comprises troops from
34 countries, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They are assisted by a few thousand people, who are deployed
mostly in Croatia, Hungary and Italy or in the countries which
have sent the troops.
</P>
<P>
Even seven months has passed since the IFOR peace operation
started in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the cost of IFOR's stay, which is
financed by member-countries, is still a secret.
</P>
<P>
But estimate made in late 1995 said that the IFOR mission would
cost at least 5.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, the IFOR troops' one-year
mandate in Bosnia should end on december 20, 1996. But many
believe IFOR would keep at least part of its troops in Bosnia
after the mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
The 15 NATO members have a total of 41,377 troops in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United States has contributed the largest
contingent to the IFOR with 15,281 troops, which is followed by
Britain, 8,197, and France, 6,852.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the operation, NATO planned to send into
Bosnia 60,000 troops with the most advanced weapons. The United
States has previously promised to provide 20,000 soldiers.
