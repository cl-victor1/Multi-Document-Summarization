<HEADLINE> Panthers Doctor Predicted Bure Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure's reconstructed right  
knee was destined for a series of injuries when he joined the 
Florida Panthers on Jan. 17, according to the team orthopedist. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trade, Bure twice injured his knee, and on Monday had  
a second reconstructive surgery in Birmingham, Ala. His first 
reconstruction was in 1995, after he tore his anterior cruciate 
ligament with Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Attarian told The Palm Beach Post there were problems  
with the knee when he first examined Bure -- three games after the 
goal-scoring threat arrived from the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all news to me,'' Panthers general manager Bryan Murray  
said when told of Attarian's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Attarian said his examination revealed Bure's first  
reconstruction was already stretching when the Panthers signed him, 
and ``that set him up for a series of injuries,'' Attarian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who was in Moscow when the Panthers made the trade, joined  
the team on a road trip in New York. The team asked New Jersey 
Devils physicians to look at Bure's knee and they said he was fine. 
Attarian examined Bure when the team returned to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Murray said there was little difference in Bure's healthy  
and reconstructed knee when the Panthers first examined him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fit and healthy enough to play,'' Murray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bure was diagnosed with a muscle strain Feb. 5 which could have  
actually been a partial tear, Attarian said. The Panthers signed 
Bure to a $46.5 million contract while he recovered from that 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Attarian said an arthroscopic surgery he conducted March 5 --  
after Bure's second knee injury with Florida -- showed the 
reconstruction done in 1995 had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Attarian said he knew a second reconstruction was necessary but  
Bure wanted to try to play on the injury. Bure got as far as 
practice but his knee never came close to being fit enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of information was never made public,'' Attarian said.  
``We (Attarian, Panthers president Bill Torrey and Bryan Murray) 
felt it would be OK to conceal it if he was able to play safely.''

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Absorbs Arms Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's disarmament agency is going  
out of business after a 38-year run that included the negotiation 
of international agreements aimed at controlling nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will got out of business  
at midnight, its functions being taken over by the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	John Holum, who has served as ACDA director since 1993, is due  
to become the first undersecretary of state for arms control and 
international security affairs, once he is confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency was created in 1961 as an independent voice within  
the government on behalf of arms control. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation implementing the merger states that the arms  
control office may continue to advocate a point of view which is at 
odds with that of the secretary of state, Holum said at a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something unusual is going to happen at midnight tonight, and  
that is a federal agency will disappear,'' Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cost savings of the merger already have been  
realized in the form of a 6 percent personnel cutback. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the ACDA years ``very productive,'' Holum cited the  
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty, the chemical and biological weapons conventions and the 
SALT and START treaties, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the merger process, the U.S. Information Agency also  
will be absorbed by the State Department. The merger will take 
place in October.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Five Chileans convicted in the 1989  
kidnapping of a leading businessmen should be allowed to complete 
their sentences in their home country, their spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Breno Altman, president of the Committee to Free Political  
Prisoners, said by phone the release was authorized last Friday by 
the Justice Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry confirmed the authorization but gave no further  
details. 
</P>
<P>
	The five Chileans were sentenced along with two Argentines, two  
Canadians and a Brazilian to 28 years in prison for abducting 
Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's largest supermarket chain along. 
Police rescued Diniz after six days, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year their sentences were reduced to between 15 and 18  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 16, the 10 went on a hunger strike to pressure the  
government to release them, and four days later, Canadians David 
Lamont and Christine Spencer were transferred to a Vancouver prison 
under a prisoner-transfer treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian was sent home and placed on work-release, but the  
transfer of the Chileans and Argentines was delayed ``because of 
bureaucracy,'' Altman said. He said the Argentines are expected to 
be transferred in about two weeks. 
</P>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A man accused of raping and trying to kill a  
14-year-old girl was transferred to the northern state of Chihuahua 
Tuesday after prosecutors said he may be linked to as many as six 
murders in Ciudad Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chihuahua State Attorney General Arturo Gonzalez Rascon said the  
man, Jesus Manuel Guardado Marquez -- a former bus driver -- may hold 
the key to the mystery surrounding the six-year string of killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-trial statement, Guardado said he had consensual sex  
with the 14-year-old and tried to kill her in June 1998, but denied 
involvement in any of the other killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardado was arrested over the weekend in the neighboring state  
of Durango, after he allegedly beat his pregnant wife. He also 
allegedly tried to beat the 14-year-old victim to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say about 100 women, mostly teens, have been killed since  
1993 in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. 
Independent groups say the number could be as high as 192. The 
victims were raped or sexually brutalized in 54 cases. 
</P>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City's grand central plaza, the  
Zocalo, is to be transformed into a center of blooming trees under 
a renovation design selected by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning model, by architect Cecilia Cortes Contreras, will  
reroute the traffic that now rings the huge square in order to 
focus visitors' attention on surrounding historic buildings such as 
the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The renovation, proposed by Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 1998,  
is to cost an estimated $15 million and be completed by the end of 
the year, the daily Reforma reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The design unveiled by Mexico City officials Tuesday night would  
have rows of purple-blossomed jacaranda trees and mimosas planted 
along one side of the Zocalo. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls for 18 light poles each 65-feet high which would  
generate sounds with the wind, and an alley of shorter light poles 
to light the way toward the ancient ruins of the Templo Mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the plaza will remain clear, in keeping with its  
traditional use as a center for union rallies and political 
protests.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Interpol agents in Mexico have arrested the  
former interior minister of Ecuador, Cesar Verduga, who is wanted 
on embezzlement charges for allegedly misusing $5.3 million in 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Verduga was arrested late Monday at his home in the upscale  
Mexico City neighborhood of Polanco, Mexico City newspapers 
reported Wednesday. He was taken to a prison pending Ecuador's 
formal request for extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Pablo Guerrero, said Wednesday that Verduga would  
request political asylum in Mexico because he believes the case 
against him is politically motivated, the government news agency 
Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Verduga, who was former Ecuadoran President Fabian Alarcon's  
right-hand man from February 1997 to April 1998, claims the money 
in question was used for a study, which he says he burned along 
with receipts for reasons of national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Verduga fled to the United States in April 1998 just before a  
court order for his arrest was issued. He later settled in Mexico 
City.

	The magnitude 6 quake struck at 11:54 p.m. Tuesday, about 125  
miles south of Punta Burica near the border with Panama.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemala's Supreme Court has upheld death  
sentences against three men convicted of kidnapping a woman in 1996 
and killing her. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruling, issued Tuesday, supported lower court  
decisions against Elver Alvarado, Luis Cetino and Tomas Cerrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are to die by lethal injection for the killing of  
Isabel Bonifasi de Botran. No date for execution was set. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifasi de Botran was kidnapped in southern Guatemala City on  
Nov. 16, 1996, and her body was found two months later near a 
village outside the capital.

<HEADLINE> Definition of 'Blue Moon' Corrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Once in a blue moon, a widely accepted definition  
has to be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the term ``blue moon'' itself.  
</P>
<P>
	For half a century, it's been known as the second full moon in a  
month, like the one that appeared Wednesday. But that's wrong, and 
the editors of Sky &AMP; Telescope say it's their fault: The magazine 
incorrectly defined the term 53 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to admit it,'' said Roger Sinnott, associate editor of  
Sky &AMP; Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinnott blamed the goof on an amateur astronomer.  
</P>
<P>
	James Hugh Pruett wrote a 1946 piece for the magazine after  
apparently misinterpreting a complex 1937 article in the Maine 
Farmer's Almanac that essentially, but not clearly, said a blue 
moon occurs when a season has four full moons, rather than the 
usual three. Pruett mistakenly thought that meant a blue moon is 
the second full moon within the same month. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett's mistake went unnoticed for decades. A 1980 National  
Public Radio story about blue moons used the wrong definition. In 
1986, the board game Trivial Pursuit repeated the error. When two 
full moons appeared in May 1988, ``radio stations and newspapers 
everywhere carried an item on this bit of `old folklore,''' 
folklorist Philip Hiscock wrote in the magazine's March issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sky &AMP; Telescope, based in Cambridge, discovered the error when  
it was working on an article about how January and March of this 
year featured what would have been two blue moons by Pruett's 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sky &AMP; Telescope's editors think Pruett's mistake led to  
the popular modern mis-definition of ``blue moon,'' it's unclear 
where the Maine Farmer's Almanac came up with the rule. The almanac 
is defunct. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the term ``blue moon'' has existed for centuries,  
Sinnott said his research of almanacs dating to the early 1800s 
found no precise definitions until 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	By either definition -- Pruett's or the almanac's -- blue moons  
occur about every two or three years, Sinnott said. The last blue 
moon as defined by the almanac was in May 1997. The next will be in 
February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although purists may subscribe to the almanac's point of view,  
Sinnott thinks Pruett's error will prevail. Pruett died in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meaning is so entrenched now. Nothing we can do is going  
to put the genie back in the bottle,'' Sinnott said. ``Our big 
mistake in 1946 has really caught on and there's no turning back.''

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio's Will Is Locked Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Attorneys for Joe DiMaggio asked  
for his will to be locked away, apparently to keep it out of the 
hands of collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The will was stored in the Broward County clerk's office near  
DiMaggio's home in Hollywood, where the baseball great died March 8 
after a battle with lung cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	With DiMaggio's death, the value of his collectibles has  
skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from his signature, DiMaggio's will includes the provision  
that his only son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., be given a trust fund 
that will pay him $20,000 a year. DiMaggio's great-grandchildren 
received trusts of $250,000 and $500,000.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Concentration Camps Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany said today it has ``serious  
reports'' that Yugoslav forces have set up concentration camps in 
Kosovo for ethnic Albanians rounded up in the embattled province. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a NATO country has spoken of the  
possibility of such camps amid a flood of reports that Serb-led 
forces are conducting a terror campaign to rid Kosovo of its ethnic 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping cited growing evidence  
that Yugoslav soldiers and paramilitary troops were rounding up 
Kosovo civilians in their villages. Men and teenage boys were being 
killed or interned in camps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have serious reports that there are concentration camps  
like there were in Bosnia,'' Scharping told a news conference. He 
gave no details but indicated NATO was trying to confirm their 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Kosovo Albanians' negotiator at failed peace talks  
with Yugoslavia said there were three ``concentration camps'' in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One camp was the main stadium in Pristina, Kosovo's capital,  
where 100,000 people were interned, Hashim Thaci said late Tuesday 
in an interview on German television. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Scharping had additional evidence of  
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Scharping said other reports, as yet unconfirmed, that leading  
ethnic Albanian intellectuals were executed by the Serb ``killing 
machine'' brought to mind the early phase of the Bosnian war -- as 
well as tactics used by Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a systematic extermination that recalls in a horrible way  
what was done in the name of Germany at the beginning of World War 
II, for example in Poland,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, interpreters who worked with an international  
observer force since withdrawing from Kosovo have been 
``systematically'' killed by Serbs, Scharping said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scharping said Germany also has received reports that Yugoslav  
authorities are already resettling Serbs in areas of Kosovo from 
which the ethnic Albanian population had been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer accused Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic of directing a campaign of expulsions, 
rape and killing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the primitive strategy we're faced with,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fischer has called a meeting of Balkan officials Thursday in  
Bonn to find ways to speed aid to more than 100,000 Kosovo refugees 
who have fled to neighboring countries since NATO's air assault 
began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing the urgency, Macedonia's premier met German Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder today, saying his country needs Western help to 
stave off ``economic collapse'' because of the refugee wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia has taken in 35,000 Kosovo refugees and 30,000 more  
are approaching the border, Ljubco Georgevski said.

<HEADLINE> Online Futures' Investors Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors thinking of sinking their money into  
oil futures or pork bellies now have an online option to check out 
the background and disciplinary information on some 50,000 
companies and salespeople in the commodity futures industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet database, unveiled Wednesday, ``provides  
investors with a valuable tool to protect themselves against fraud 
and abuse,'' Brooksley Born, chairwoman of the U.S. Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Named BASIC, for Background Affiliation Status Information  
Center, it is available on the Web site of the National Futures 
Association at www.nfa.futures.org. The information comes from the 
self-regulatory association, the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission and the nation's 14 futures exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The database, includes, for example, enforcement cases filed by  
the CFTC since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	A futures contract obligates a trader to buy or sell a commodity  
at a fixed price at a specific time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The database is similar to the national repository of data on  
stockbrokers' disciplinary and legal history that is jointly 
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers and 
state securities regulators. Investors are encouraged to look up 
those records before hiring a broker or making an investment with 
one they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	The new database on futures dealers or companies also can be  
used by investors to file complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC, which regulates the nation's futures markets, recently  
issued consumer advisories urging people to watch out for 
fraudulent futures schemes and to take precautions before they 
invest. 
</P>
<P>
	Born noted that in addition to TV, radio and print ads,  
fraudulent futures investment schemes increasingly are being 
promoted in Internet e-mail and ``chat rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, for example, the hottest new telemarketing fraud  
played on people's vague awareness of Asian economic turmoil and 
hunger for hefty returns to get them to invest in risky 
foreign-currency futures. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment schemes -- modeled after legitimate  
currency-market trading done by financial institutions -- were just 
a come-on and none of the money handed over was actually invested, 
according to state regulators. Investors around the country lost 
thousands of dollars, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the new database, Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman for  
the North American Securities Administrators Association, which 
represents state regulators, said that with rising numbers of 
investors going online, ``It makes great sense to make this 
information available 24 hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that investors could use the database, for example,  
to check out a salesman pitching a futures investment over the 
telephone ``while you've got him on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The database lists salespeople and companies that are registered  
with the CFTC. If a particular person or firm isn't listed, or is 
listed as having had their registration revoked, they are 
unregistered and are likely selling futures investments illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The database does not include criminal background information,  
such as felony convictions, for salespeople and companies. 
Investors must file a Freedom of Information Act request for that 
information with the CFTC. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 U.S. futures exchanges involved are the Chicago Board of  
Trade; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; the New York Mercantile 
Exchange; Amex Commodities Corp.; Cantor Financial Futures 
Exchange; Citrus Associates of the New York Cotton Exchange; the 
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Commodity Exchange; the 
Kansas City Board of Trade; the Mid-America Commodity Exchange; the 
Minneapolis Grain Exchange; the New York Cotton Exchange; the New

	Three U.S. Soldiers May Be Captured  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three U.S. Army soldiers were missing in  
Macedonia near the Yugoslav border Wednesday night after possibly 
being captured by members of the Serb military or police while on a 
reconnaissance mission, the Pentagon and NATO officials said. An 
immediate search and rescue mission was launched, involving teams 
from several NATO countries. The team had been on a daytime 
reconnaissance mission when they reported receiving ``small arms 
fire and said they were surrounded,'' according to NATO. The 
missing team was one of several Army units guarding the 
Yugoslav-Macedonia border during the ongoing NATO airstrikes 
against the Serb military in Yugoslavia.

	NATO Expands Yugoslavia Bombardment  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO widened its air assault on  
Yugoslavia Wednesday, vowing there would be ``no sanctuary'' for 
Yugoslav forces trying to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. With the 
air campaign against President Slobodan Milosevic's forces entering 
its second week, Western officials acknowledged that NATO's 
missiles and bombs had so far failed to stop Belgrade's offensive 
in the province. Thousands more refugees from the province poured 
across the frontier into neighboring countries. At least 118,000 
ethnic Albanians have fled to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, 
the U.N. says.

	Canada Celebrates New Territory

	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- Inuit chefs prepared a huge feast  
Wednesday to celebrate the creation of Nunavut, Canada's newest 
territory. Stretching deep into the Arctic, with only 25,000 
residents in an area as large as Western Europe, Nunavut is the 
product of the largest land-claims settlement in Canada's history 
and gives its Inuit majority their long-sought chance at 
self-government. Nunavut is being created out of the eastern 60 
percent of the Northwest Territories, culminating more than 20 
years of lobbying by Inuit leaders.

<HEADLINE> Technology Allows TV Ad Placement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Coca-Cola can and a Wells Fargo billboard in  
the background on a recent episode of UPN's ``Seven Days'' was the 
first prime-time test of technology that allows advertisers to have 
products digitally added to a scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The placements were done during an episode two weeks ago to  
gauge viewer reaction. The response is still being evaluated, UPN 
spokesman Paul McGuire said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has been used in sports, to add commercial  
billboards in the background of baseball games. But the practice 
could blur beyond recognition the line between entertainment and 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Product placement is popular in movies but much less so on  
television, where there are plenty of opportunities to run 
full-fledged ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it's starting to get harder to tell when the ads end and the  
show begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks sprinkle stars from their prime-time shows in the  
audience at sporting events for cameras to spot during big games. 
ABC last month promoted a show with a ``crawl'' along the bottom of 
the screen, treatment usually reserved for news bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is certainly a sense that the bleeding of the  
commercials into the programs is getting more extreme than it ever 
has been,'' said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the 
Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, networks took pains to avoid product placement.  
The results often looked awkward: Actors would drink from a beer 
bottle with a generic label instead of a Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing actual products may better reflect real life, but the  
decision on whether to use them should rest with the people making 
the shows, not with advertisers, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear whether Christopher Crowe, creator and executive  
producer of ``Seven Days,'' had a choice. He didn't return calls 
for comment. He works for Paramount, which owns both the series and 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount spokeswoman Trisha Cardoso noted that the technology  
has other uses beyond advertising. Producers may be able to insert 
special effects or background locations at relatively low cost, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technology isn't likely to replace regular commercials,  
some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it taking off like a rocket,'' said Ave Butensky,  
president of the Television Bureau of Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	People see so many commercial messages in real life -- on  
clothing, in shop windows, even in school -- that product placement 
on TV shows may be too subtle, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part this stuff becomes absolutely invisible to  
us in real life,'' he said. ``I imagine it would become invisible 
to us in imaginary life just as quickly.''

<HEADLINE> High Court To Mull States' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court increasingly sensitive to how  
individual states' authority fares when pitted against the federal 
government's power is studying an overtime-pay dispute from Maine 
that could yield a key states-rights ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing arguments today, the justices must decide by late  
June whether state governments can be sued in state courts by 
employees seeking to enforce a federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly, in over two centuries of Supreme Court  
precedent, the issue has never been squarely presented and resolved 
-- until now,'' said Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law 
professor who studied the Maine case. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of state-employed probation officers sued Maine in  
federal court in 1992, saying they were unfairly being denied the 
time-and-one-half pay guaranteed by the federal Fair Labor 
Standards Act for work over 40 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	While their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in 1996  
that the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields states from being 
sued against their will in federal court. So the probation officers 
refiled their lawsuit in state court, still depending on the 
federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine's courts, however, ruled that the 11th Amendment makes  
states immune from state court lawsuits that would be barred in 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would make the state totally immune from being sued  
by employees who allege labor-law violations, although federal 
labor officials still could sue the state to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Supreme Court, the probation officers picked up a  
powerful ally -- the Clinton administration. The court allowed 
Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the Justice Department's top 
courtroom lawyer, to argue against giving Maine such state court 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute also attracted considerable unsolicited advice for  
the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	In friends-of-the-court briefs, the probation officers' Supreme  
Court appeal is supported by the National Association of Police 
Organizations and a coalition of publishers worried about their 
right to sue states over alleged copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting Maine in such briefs are 37 other states,  
the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties and 
National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The court stunned Congress in 1995 when it struck down a federal  
law making it a crime to possess a gun near a school. The court 
said Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate 
commerce and impinged on state power when it enacted the law. 
</P>
<P>
	After its 1996 ruling limiting Congress' power to makes states  
vulnerable to being sued in federal court, the court invoked state 
sovereignty when in 1997 it struck down part of the federal Brady 
gun-control law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also has agreed to decide three other states-rights  
issues within the next year: 
</P>
<P>
	--Can states be sued for patent infringement?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can they be sued for violating a federal false-advertising law?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can state employees sue over alleged violations of the federal  
law banning on-the-job age bias?

<HEADLINE>  More Airstrikes Hit Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO moved to escalate its aerial  
bombardment of Yugoslavia today, possibly aiming strikes at the 
center of the capital Belgrade, as the conflict over Kosovo hit the 
one-week mark with no sign of ending. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's North Atlantic Council decided early today to widen the  
geographic area it is targeting, in the wake of a failed Russian 
peace mission. The first week of strikes have concentrated on 
military bases and air defense sites, including some outside the 
Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloudy weather has slowed NATO's mission. British pilots  
complained they had to abort missions overnight for the second time 
this week due to weather. They said American pilots had to launch 
anti-radar missiles to protect themselves from ground fire, 
indicating Yugoslavia's air defenses were still a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials expressed new resolve to try to cripple a  
Yugoslav military machine they say is responsible for atrocities 
and ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo Albanians, who continued to 
stream out of the devastated province today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now widening the range of military targets,'' British  
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said today on British Broadcasting 
Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. defense officials acknowledged that the assault was far  
from reaching its goals. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the 
allies were looking for ``a knockout punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians and neighboring countries have urged NATO to do  
something to halt the exodus from Kosovo. An estimated 118,000 
people have fled to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, the smaller 
of Yugoslavia's two provinces, since NATO airstrikes began March 
24. The U.N. refugee agency said today that 85,000 refugees have 
poured into Albania alone. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Macedonian border today, refugees described a line of  
cars believed to stretch more than 3 miles into Kosovo, and they 
said Serb security forces were searching passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Poised to focus on Serb military forces in Kosovo accused of  
atrocities against civilians, five U.S. Air Force B-1 long-range 
bombers prepared to fly to Europe to join B-52 bombers that have 
been launching cruise missiles at Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Missile and bomb explosions were reported at a number of  
locations today in the Belgrade area and elsewhere. Shrill hisses 
were heard before dawn in the center of the Yugoslav capital, and 
the independent Beta news agency said they were NATO planes. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no evidence the allied forces had begun bombing  
strategic targets in the center of the city, which reportedly could 
include the Yugoslav Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Missiles hit military-industrial targets outside Belgrade near  
Avala and Pancevo, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported. 
Several missiles hit southeast of the Kosovo capital, Pristina, and 
other impacts were reported around the province, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brief hopes for a political breakthrough were dashed Tuesday  
when Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov failed to persuade 
President Slobodan Milosevic to make an overture acceptable to the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic insisted that NATO attacks stop before he resume peace  
talks. He said he would pull back some of his troops in Kosovo if 
NATO halts its raids, and he declared his forces ready to fight 
``to the very end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said today the peace  
mission was a ``large failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With the current situation on the ground, it is absolutely  
impossible to engage in political negotiations,'' Solana said on 
French radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia will send warships to the Mediterranean as a protest to  
NATO airstrikes, Russian news agencies reported today. However, 
Russia has said repeatedly that its military will not become 
directly involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia. Russia also 
desperately needs loans from the West to save its faltering 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's forces are accused of continuing a terror campaign  
against majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the southern Serbian 
province that has been wracked by war since Milosevic launched a 
campaign against separatist rebels in February 1998. Serbia is 
Yugoslavia's dominant republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashim Thaci, a leader of rebel ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, told  
Germany's ZDF television that the Serbs had created three 
concentration camps, including one in a Pristina stadium that he 
said was holding 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with France's RTL radio, Thaci confirmed reports  
that Serbs had executed Fehmi Agani, a close aide to ethnic 
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton warned that atrocities against ethnic  
Albanians would weaken Serbia's claim to the separatist province 
and increase NATO's determination to destroy Milosevic's army. 
</P>
<P>
	With international monitors gone and virtually all foreign  
journalists kicked out of Kosovo, the reported atrocities are 
impossible to verify. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania's foreign minister urged Kosovo Albanians to remain at  
home and ``resist'' what he called the Serb genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a war for existence,'' Paskal Milo said. ``If this  
massive fleeing continues, Belgrade will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Albania's United Nations ambassador, Agim Nesho,  
said his country will allow its territory to be used to funnel arms 
to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army if the international community 
decides this will help save ethnic Albanians from genocide. But 
lifting the arms embargo against Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, 
would require support from all five permanent members of the 
Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Salute Lady Boilermakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Players and coaches of Purdue's Lady  
Boilermakers met on the court of Mackey Arena for one last time 
Wednesday night, capping a championship season by saying thanks to 
their fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 in San Jose, Calif., to capture its  
first-ever NCAA women's basketball title Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the team came onto the court single file, the near-capacity  
crowd erupted in cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	For senior Ukari Figgs, it was an emotional farewell after a  
four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an amazing moment,'' Figgs said, speaking from a  
podium surrounded with yellow roses and black and gold balloons. 
``I can't think of any better way to end a career than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs, Stephanie White-McCarty and Amy Shaffer are the three  
graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd again roared as White-McCarty hobbled to the podium,  
her left foot in a brace. She sprained her ankle during the final 
minutes of the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great four years,'' she said. ``I can't believe  
we're at the end of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she returned to her seat, she and Figgs hugged and the crowd  
cheered again. 
</P>
<P>
	Handing out team posters -- which read ``Purdue Women's  
Basketball, Unforgettable'' -- to fans entering the arena, elated 
Tabitha Roudebesh said winning the championship put Purdue on the 
map. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' Roudebesh said, sporting a Purdue championship  
T-shirt. ``It gives us another reason to be proud that we're from 
Purdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The student body's pride went a bit far after Sunday's victory,  
as about 2,000 students reveled on campus streets. West Lafayette 
police eventually had to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to show our support without burning couches,''  
Roudebesh said of Wednesday night's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Carolyn Peck said the team dreamed of the championship and  
made it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the first team to end Tennessee's winning streak,''  
she said. ``The first women's team to sell out Mackey Arena. Now we 
have brought Purdue the first national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck, who's leaving Purdue to become coach and general manager  
of the WNBA's Orlando Miracle expansion team, urged the crowd to 
continue supporting the women's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two freshman that know what it's like to get to the  
national championships,'' she said. ``Now don't leave them. You've

</P>
<P>
	As the rally ended, Figgs and White-McCarty approached the front  
of the stage, hoisted the NCAA trophy over their heads and slowly 
walked around the stage showing it to the screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the lights went out and ``We Are the Champions'' was  
played over the public address system as fireworks exploded 
overhead. As the song continued, the team gathered arm-in-arm, many 
of them holding bouquets of yellow roses. 
</P>
<P>
	The team filed off the stage, stopping to sign autographs and  
slap hands with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot more when you win something for people like  
that,'' Figgs said.

<HEADLINE> Woman To Give Up Baby After Mix Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They are brothers, twins born of the same womb.  
One is black, the other white. It is a baby-switching case with a 
twist -- these babies were switched before birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the only mother either 3-month-old boy has ever known will  
return the child who does not share her DNA -- the black child -- to 
his genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving him up because we love him,'' said Donna Fasano,  
37, in a handwritten statement supplied by her lawyer Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies ended up in the same womb because a doctor at a  
fertility clinic apparently mixed up Mrs. Fasano's embryos with 
those of another couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these boys are beautiful -- two precious, normal little  
boys,'' said her lawyer, Ivan Tantleff. ``They sit in the swing 
together. They sit in the tub together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case began April 24, 1998, when Mrs. Fasano underwent embryo  
implantations in the Manhattan offices of Dr. Lillian Nash. Another 
couple, Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert Rogers, sought help from 
the same clinic at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women underwent in vitro fertilization, in which their own  
eggs fertilized by their husbands' sperm were implanted into the 
uterus. Only Mrs. Fasano became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered a problem a few weeks into Mrs. Fasano's  
pregnancy, when an amniocentesis exam revealed that although she 
was carrying twins, only one was her genetic son. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic had apparently inserted some of Mrs. Rogers' eggs  
into Mrs. Fasano's uterus along with her own. Since both babies 
were healthy, Mrs. Fasano decided to carry them to term, her lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies were born in December. Mrs. Fasano said she didn't  
know the other parents' identity until the Rogerses sued Nash, two 
other doctors and the Fasanos on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't my doing,'' Mrs. Fasano said in her statement.  
``People with infertility problems should be able to go to their 
doctors and trust them to do the right thing. To them it may be a 
job; to me it's my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's health department is investigating the incident. A  
call to Nash's clinic was not returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tantleff said he is trying to arrange for visitation rights for  
the Fasanos ``so the boys grow up to know that they are brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Perry-Rogers, a nurse, and her husband, a teacher, are  
amenable to visitation, their lawyer said Tuesday. ``It's in the 
children's best interest,'' said Rudolph Silas. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said his clients will likely get custody of the little boy  
in a few weeks, after DNA tests and legal papers are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My clients are both ecstatic,'' Silas said. ``They are the  
proud parents of a 3-month-old baby boy. Of course there's some 
mixed emotions in the manner in which it's been brought to this 
point. But they're happy she made the decision she's made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Annas, a professor of health law at the Boston University  
School of Public Health, said Mrs. Fasano's decision ``seems like a 
reasonable solution but it's got to be heart-wrenching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos' phone was out of service Tuesday and the Rogerses  
did not return a call. Their lawyers said the parents did not want 
to comment, and would not divulge the babies' names. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rogerses' suit accuses Nash, Dr. Dov B. Goldstein and Dr.  
Michael Obasaju of negligence, malpractice and breach of contract. 
Goldstein ran a different clinic where the Rogerses stored their 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers agreed that the woman who gives birth is legally  
considered the child's mother regardless of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad we don't have to contest that and litigate,'' Silas  
said. ``Her decision to do it voluntarily saves us a lot of 
heartache.''

<HEADLINE> Two Alomars Better Than One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Robbie Alomar hasn't played a single  
game that counts yet for Cleveland, yet he's already being counted 
on to win the Indians a World Series trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been called the missing piece to the club's postseason  
puzzle, the one player who will finally end the Indians' 50-plus 
years of Series futility. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Alomar's spring is any indication, this could be a  
special summer and fall for the Indians and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Robbie, another ho-hum day,'' Indians pitcher Dave Burba  
yells as Alomar enters the clubhouse after going 2-for-3 with two 
RBIs against Kansas City the other day. ``Time to go home and hang 
your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he hears Burba, Cleveland's resident jokester, Alomar  
wanders over and the two share a laugh. He has only been on the 
team for a few months, but Alomar looks like he's been with the 
Indians for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, he has been part of Cleveland's extended family.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, Alomar has been everything the Indians hoped they were  
getting when they signed the nine-time All-Star second baseman last 
November as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 1-for-3 performance Tuesday, Alomar is batting .410  
during the exhibition season. He and shortstop Omar Vizquel have 
yet to combine on a jaw-dropping double play, but they're still 
getting used to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you really understand how good Robbie is until  
he's on your team,'' said Indians general manager John Hart, who 
had been trying to land Alomar the past few seasons. ``He is a 
special, special player. He's got the complete package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Alomar, the Indians got more speed, leadership and power.  
With his addition, Cleveland has an All-Star at every position, 18 
Gold Gloves up the middle, and perhaps the only lineup in baseball 
that matches up against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Indians not only have their second baseman -- they used  
16 players at the position in the last 2 1/2 years -- they have their 
second Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alomar says it's still hard to believe he and his younger  
brother are again teammates. The two played one game together in 
1988 and seven games in 1989 for the San Diego Padres before Sandy 
was traded to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we go out there (on opening day) and they say, `play  
ball,' that's when it's really going to hit me,'' Sandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie, who is 1 1/2 years younger than Sandy, said his decision to  
join the Indians was a family one, and that he did it not only to 
be with his brother but to win another World Series. He got two 
rings with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look around this clubhouse,'' he said. ``There was a lot  
of talent here before I came. Hopefully, we can put it all together 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove decided early on he would have  
Robbie Alomar, a switch-hitter, hit in the No. 3 slot in the 
batting order this season, behind Vizquel and Kenny Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove wanted to take advantage of the trio's speed to better  
set up RBI possibilities for sluggers Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez, 
and to hopefully score more early runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, though, who drove in 94 runs for Baltimore in 1994,  
hasn't been leaving many runners stranded. His 15 RBIs through 
Tuesday tie him the team lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter where I hit,'' said Alomar, who batted  
anywhere from leadoff to fifth for the Orioles a year ago. ``We 
have a great lineup from top to bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Great lineups lead to great expectations, and with Robbie Alomar  
in the fold, the bar has been raised for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be more pressure to win a fifth straight AL Central  
title. There will be more pressure to beat the Yankees, and more 
pressure to win it all for the first time since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need 25 guys to win it, not only me,'' Alomar said. ``I'm  
not going to be able to do it all alone. One guy can not do it 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, but two Alomars seem to be better than one.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises $7M, Bush Raises $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President  
Al Gore have jumped out to big fund-raising leads in their 
respective party's presidential battles, both hauling in dollars 
far faster than Bush's father did in 1987 in the last open race for 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised at least $7 million so far this year for his bid  
for the Democratic nomination, aides close to his campaign told The 
Associated Press. Gore tapped more than 40,000 donors, 77 percent 
of whom gave less than $200 each, said the aides, who expect the 
final figure to be slightly higher because money was still rolling 
in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's total is double the expected $3  
million-plus that his lone Democratic challenger, former senator 
and professional basketball star Bill Bradley, expects to report 
for the same period, according to Bradley aides. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, Texas, Bush announced he has been raising money at a  
$2 million-a-week clip since he formed his presidential exploratory 
committee March 4 and will finish the month with more than $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is eye-catching because the Texas governor, unlike  
Gore, has not hosted a single fund-raiser yet or even formally 
announced his candidacy. All of the GOP hopeful's money was raised 
through telephone and mail appeals, his aides said. Gore has had 
four fund-raising events so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is also important because Bush, if he runs, is  
considering forgoing federal financing provided to presidential 
candidates in the primaries so he can free himself from spending 
limits and better compete with millionaire publisher Steve Forbes 
for the GOP nomination. Forbes is spending much of his own money 
and has not provided his fund-raising totals. 
</P>
<P>
	To forgo federal matching funds, experts predict Bush will have  
to raise $50 million or more, substantially more than the $30 
million President Clinton raised as a popular incumbent in his 
primary re-election in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great start, but I recognize that we have a lot of  
work ahead,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential GOP presidential candidates such as Sen. John  
McCain of Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle, conservative 
activist Gary Bauer and former Red Cross chairwoman Elizabeth Dole 
are all expected to finish the first three months of 1999 with $3 
million or less in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Texas governor and Gore have raised money far faster  
than former President Bush did in the first quarter of 1987 when, 
as the vice president vying to replace Ronald Reagan in an open 
race, he raised $2.4 million and was the top fund-raiser in either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for the first three months of a two-year presidential  
election cycle still belongs to Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who raised 
more than $8 million in the first quarter of 1995 for a GOP 
presidential bid that eventually stalled and died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore and Bush efforts continue a trend over the last decade  
in which candidates raise money faster and earlier as states have 
compressed their primary election schedules to the early part of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's because the big states involved, California and New York,  
have pushed up their primaries so much and they are very expensive 
states,'' said Herb Alexander, a professor emeritus at the 
University of Southern California who has studied political 
fund-raising for four decades. ``And that is the biggest problem 
for candidates coming out of relatively inexpensive states like 
Iowa and New Hampshire -- there's not enough time to raise money 
after then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1976, Jimmy Carter had something like five weeks after New  
Hampshire and the next primary and that was the time he could raise 
money, but that doesn't exist anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign is stressing its smaller donations, hoping to  
distance the vice president from the 1996 Clinton fund-raising 
controversies over big donors. ``We have gotten support from people 
of all levels, from farmers to doctors and small business people to 
retired people, and we are very grateful,'' campaign manager Craig 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential candidates will formally report their totals to  
the Federal Election Commission on April 15.

<HEADLINE> More Taxpayers Using E-Filing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of tax returns zapped  
electronically to the IRS is growing by leaps and bounds, but for a 
majority of taxpayers paper still rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawn by the promise of swifter refunds and reduced chances of  
error, the number of people doing their taxes themselves on 
computers and filing electronically has shot up 156 percent 
compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1.7 million returns prepared on home computers through  
March 26 represent a tiny fraction of the total of 63.1 million 
returns filed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting returns prepared by professionals and simple returns  
filed over the telephone, total electronic returns have reached 24 
million, up more than 16 percent from last year, the Internal 
Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One major reason people are filing electronically is the quick  
refund turnaround time, an average of 15 days compared to a 35-day 
minimum for paper returns. And ``e-filed'' returns are easier to 
screen for simple math or processing errors and can then be sent 
back to the taxpayer for correction without major IRS hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain problems we can identify, send the return  
back to you and that way you can correct it up front,'' said Terry 
Lutes, director of IRS electronic program operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has aggressively marketed e-filing, including a mailing  
to taxpayers who used computers last year that had a new personal 
identification number to be used in place of a paper ``signature'' 
form. But most of the estimated 126 million returns the IRS expects 
to get this year still will be on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are just technophobes,'' said Eddie Feinstein,  
director of electronic commerce at H&AMP;R Block. ``They're afraid 
their data is going to be corrupted. Some people fear they're more 
likely to be audited. Some people just enjoy going down to the post 
office on April 15th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not much can be done about technophobes or the April 15 post  
office visitors. But the IRS says people should not worry that 
their returns will get messed up or fear they are upping their 
audit chances by filing electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, returns don't get sent directly through the  
Internet to the IRS. They go through providers such as Intuit -- 
maker of the leading TurboTax and MacIntax software -- or via 
professionals such as firms like H&AMP;R Block. 
</P>
<P>
	These providers transmit returns directly to the IRS service  
centers and must undergo detailed background checks first. There 
have been instances of fraud, but Lutes said it's usually a small 
professional firm attempting to sneak in a few bad returns and 
pocket the fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had an instance of anybody breaking into the  
system,'' Lutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	People can obtain computer filing software over the Internet,  
and some sites offer tax preparation services. But Gene Goldenberg, 
vice president at Block Financial Corp., said there's a reluctance 
to do taxes on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still mortally afraid to put most personal  
information directly on the Web,'' said Goldenberg, whose firm 
publishes Kiplinger TaxCut software. 
</P>
<P>
	As for audits, Lutes said IRS uses the same selection process  
for electronic returns and those on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Some glitches have occurred this year, particularly during the  
peak electronic period of late January and early February. H&AMP;R 
Block's Feinstein said the high volume caused some problems for 
preparers transmitting returns to the Cincinnati IRS service 
center, and there were initial delays in direct bank deposits of 
some refunds, but the IRS responded promptly and solved the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One other area of electronic growth for the IRS is its program  
of accepting both state and federal income tax returns at once. Out 
of 24 million federal returns filed electronically, there were 7 
million state returns attached -- an increase of 47 percent from 
last year. Thus far, 35 states offer the shared return. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Lutes said the IRS is close to its goal of 20 percent  
growth compared with last year. But it will take major changes to 
reach the long-term objective of 80 percent of all returns filed 
electronically by 2007.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Raises $6M for Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, seeking to bolster his  
front-runner standing in the polls, announced today he has raised 
more than $6 million for a possible Republican presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's presidential exploratory committee has raked in cash at a  
rate of nearly $2 million a week since opening its bank account on 
March 4 and finance chairman Don Evans said contributions still are 
being tallied. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said the $6 million was raised without  
fund-raising events, relying on mailings and ``friend-to-friend'' 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great start, but I recognize that we have a lot of  
work ahead,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored and humbled that so many friends throughout Texas  
and America are donating to my exploratory effort to encourage me 
to run for president,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and other presidential hopefuls must file reports with the  
Federal Election Commission on April 15, covering donations from 
Jan. 1 through March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's total appears to have well outpaced other Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a spokesman for Dan Quayle, who served as  
vice president under Bush's father, said Quayle was expected to 
have around $2 million raised when campaigns file reports on April 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who had a fund-raiser last week in  
New York; conservative activist Gary Bauer; and Rep. John Kasich of 
Ohio, who is spending the week raising money on the West Coast, 
also are expected to disclose at least $1 million in contributions 
for the period Jan. 1 through March 31, campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush this week said he is considering forgoing federal matching  
funds, taxpayer assistance to candidates who agree to spending 
limits. That would allow him to compete better against millionaire 
publisher Steve Forbes, whose self-financed candidacy has no 
spending restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Political experts estimate that Bush would have to raise around  
$50 million to be able to go that route.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Widening its air assault on  
Yugoslavia, NATO pounded targets today near a major Kosovo city and 
vowed there would be ``no sanctuary'' for Yugoslav forces trying to 
rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. With the air campaign against 
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces entering its second week, 
Western officials acknowledged that NATO's missiles and bombs had 
so far failed to stop Belgrade's offensive in the province. Ethnic 
Albanian refugees arriving today in northern Albania said that NATO

Clinton administration officials said today. The President's 
Council on Year 2000 Conversion reported that 92 percent of the

	NATO Expands Yugoslavia Target List  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO expanded its air campaign against  
Yugoslavia with a widened list of targets that could include top 
government buildings in central Belgrade, diplomatic sources said 
today. The sources would not say specifically that the Yugoslav 
Defense Ministry or Interior Ministry in Belgrade would be 
targeted, but one source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
that kind of government building or headquarters is now at least a 
potential target. The alliance has been faced with a faltering 
effort to halt Yugoslavia's campaign to drive ethnic Albanians from 
Kosovo.

	Powell Sees Limitations in Air War  
</P>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell said yesterday  
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will continue to have an 
advantage during the conflict with NATO unless ground troops are 
used. ``The challenge of just using air power is that you leave it 
in the hands of your adversary to decide when he's been punished 
enough,'' Powell said. ``So the initiative will remain with 
President Milosevic.'' But Powell, who was chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War, declined to give his opinion 
on when ground troops should be used against Milosevic.

	High Court To Mull States' Rights

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court increasingly sensitive to how  
individual states' authority fares when pitted against the federal 
government's power is studying an overtime-pay dispute from Maine 
that could yield a key states-rights ruling. After hearing 
arguments today, the justices must decide by late June whether 
state governments can be sued in state courts by employees seeking 
to enforce a federal labor law. ``Surprisingly, in over two 
centuries of Supreme Court precedent, the issue has never been 
squarely presented and resolved -- until now,'' said Douglas Kmiec, 
a Pepperdine University law professor who studied the Maine case.

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In the biggest liability verdict ever  
against the tobacco industry, a jury ordered Philip Morris to pay 
$81 million to the family of a man who died of lung cancer after 
smoking Marlboros for four decades. Although no smoking liability 
verdict has survived on appeal, Wall Street analysts had been 
watching this case closely to see if huge damage awards against Big 
Tobacco were now a trend. A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 
million last month to a Marlboro smoker who has inoperable lung 
cancer.

giving political speeches without a police permit. He says 
regulations stifle Singapore's constitutional guarantees of free

	Swanson Revives TV Dinner  
</P>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- When a young poultry processing  
executive proposed freezing surplus turkey and selling them as ``TV 
dinners,'' his bosses considered it a risky venture. C.A. Swanson 
and Sons initially only ordered 5,000 dinners when it introduced 
its first complete frozen meal in 1954. But the gamble paid off -- 
the company sold 10 million the first year. Recently, sales have 
declined. Last year, Americans consumed more than 160 million 
Swanson dinners, down from a peak of about 175 million in 1994. 
Now, forty-five years after transforming the industry, Swanson is 
trying to make a comeback by sprucing up its meals and spending 
millions in advertising for the first time in a decade.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Jordan is considering returning to  
the NBA as a player for the Charlotte Hornets, Fox Sports News 
reported last night. It was already known that Jordan had 
preliminary talks with the Hornets and NBA officials about 
purchasing a 50 percent share of the team. The possibility of him 
playing for the Hornets is a new twist. Fox Sports, citing 
anonymous sources close to Jordan, said one possible scenario would 
involve Jordan playing one full season for the Hornets while his 
ownership shares were held in a trust or otherwise deferred.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Tourist Slogan Still Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After 30 years, Virginia's still for lovers.  
</P>
<P>
	The travel slogan ``Virginia is for lovers'' first appeared in  
an advertisement in Modern Bride magazine in March 1969 featuring 
models dressed in period costume re-enacting the first wedding in 
Virginia, when maidservant Anne Burras married carpenter John 
Laydon in Jamestown in 1608. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three decades, the catch phrase created by a  
Richmond advertising agency has grown to become the most nationally 
recognized state travel slogan, according to a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The slogan was created by Martin &AMP; Woltz Inc. At the time, the  
average age of Virginia tourists was 50, and the agency thought it 
could get the state's business by appealing to a younger crowd, 
said David Martin, then a principal in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin McLaughlin, then a $100-a-week copywriter, came up with a  
phrase with numerous variations: ``Virginia is for beach lovers, 
Virginia is for mountain lovers, Virginia is for history lovers,'' 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm slimmed down the phrase to the catch-all ``Virginia is  
for lovers'' and added a red heart next to the text. The heart 
replaced the ``v'' in ``lovers'' five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hit a lot of people as bold and provocative,'' said Martha  
W. Steger, spokeswoman for the Virginia Tourism Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	It also inspired imitators. ``New York state called later to  
find out how we managed to get this as a slogan,'' Ms. Steger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slogan also has been copied all over the world. A tourism  
office staff member on a church mission in Prague last year saw a 
sticker that read: ``Prague is for lovers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a national survey last month involving 1,000 randomly chosen  
households, participants were given nine state names and asked if 
they knew their tourism slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	From this, 90.4 percent accurately recited Virginia's. New York  
-- ``I love New York'' -- came in second, with 36.1 percent, in the 
study commissioned by the Virginia tourism office and conducted by 
Edison, N.J.-based Bruskin Goldring Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the ad had energy about it,'' said Martin, who now  
is a brand consultant with Cadmus Communications in Richmond. ``We 
didn't have any idea that it was going to be some magical phrase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slogan works because ``it's short, it's quick, it's clear,  
but not too clear,'' said Fran Hassencahl, an assistant professor 
of communications at Old Dominion University who teaches a course 
on propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to have a significant other to be a lover,''  
Ms. Hassencahl said. ``You can be a lover of the mountains, of 
history, of the shore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's tourism agency stopped using the slogan for about  
three years in the early 1980s when Bettie Diener, then secretary 
of conservation and economic development, decided it was tired and 
worn out, Ms. Steger said. 
</P>
<P>
	An ad agency came up with a substitute: ``Virginia. Exciting  
times. Every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state used the new slogan, but apparently no one else liked  
it. ``Everyone from the Virginia Beach tourism office to hoteliers 
kept using 'Virginia is for lovers,' '' Ms. Steger said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gerald L. Baliles became governor, he brought back the old,  
familiar slogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something is working well, why change it?'' Ms. Hassencahl  
said.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Missile Supply at Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade ago, defense analysts were telling  
Pentagon procurement planners to buy conventionally armed cruise 
missiles. Presidents, they said, would want a weapon that could 
inflict damage on a specific target without risking a U.S. pilot 
over hostile territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the prediction of these analysts has come true. But  
because of inertia in developing cruise missiles as a conventional 
weapon, and problems in developing replacement designs, the 
Pentagon is worried its supply is running low. With nearly 400 Air 
Force and Navy cruise missiles used against Iraq in December and 
scores more fired against Yugoslavia over the past week, the 
Pentagon is now scrambling to avoid a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the latest NATO strikes over Kosovo and Serbia, the Air  
Force was down to 150 cruise missiles carrying conventional 
warheads. At least 30 have been launched since then. The Navy has 
more than 2,000 but is using them up at a fast rate. No cruise 
missile production line is in operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dwindling of cruise missiles is ``something we do worry  
about,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday. ``We have a 
supply now but it won't last forever. But we certainly have enough 
to continue striking important targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air power analysts have been warning Pentagon planners for at  
least a decade to buy more conventional cruise missiles for use in 
limited conflicts in which presidents would want to project power 
without risking losing a pilot, said David Ochmanek, a Rand Corp. 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is, as analysts, we've been vindicated on our  
position,'' Ochmanek said. ``The bad news is we didn't convince 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, perceptions changed as strike  
planners realized that cruise missile could be used against heavily 
defended targets without risking personnel directly. 
</P>
<P>
	A single Air Force B-52, flying outside enemy territory -- as far  
as 1,500 miles from its target -- can launch eight conventional 
air-launched cruise missiles (CALCMs) from its bomb bay and a dozen 
more from pods under each wing. Each missile carries a 3,000-pound 
conventional warhead. Navy ships and submarines as far as 1,350 
miles from a land target can launch Tomahawks carrying a 
1,000-pound conventional warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	But cruise missiles, which are satellite guided, are also  
expensive: The Tomahawks cost more than $1 million each. CALCMs, in 
current-year dollars, cost $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force announced Tuesday that the Office of Management  
and Budget was permitting it to convert 92 nuclear-tipped cruise 
missiles into CALCMs. The $51 million program will require 
congressional approval. The last such nuclear-to-conventional 
conversions rolled off the line in 1993 and the last time a new 
air-launched cruise missile was delivered was 1986. The prime 
contractor was Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, meanwhile, is seeking a $113 million emergency  
appropriation to convert 324 Tomahawks to the latest model with 
upgraded guidance and a conventional blast warhead. Raytheon Co. 
closed its Tucson, Ariz., production line in January after 
delivering the last of the new Tomahawks to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to manage the inventory very closely and we will  
meet all of our operational requirements,'' Navy Lt. Meghan Mariman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon was developing a successor to the conventional  
air-launched cruise missile -- the Tri-Service Standoff Attack 
Missile -- but canceled it in December 1994 due to spiraling costs. 
Now it is rushing another air-launched cruise missile, the Joint 
Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, for $3 billion, toward production 
by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the problems that killed the TSSAM program, defense  
analysts said the Air Force was slow to recognize that a weapon 
designed to deliver nuclear warheads had great potential for 
conventional warfare. The service's pilot culture also made it 
difficult to embrace what is essentially a pilotless jet plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy was less resistant to the concept. Navy interest in  
cruise missiles was sparked by Egypt's use of a Soviet-made Styx 
cruise missile to sink the Israeli destroyer Elath during the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War, according to a Navy paper on the subject. The 
Navy developed a production assembly line for conventional 
Tomahawks, whereas the Air Force limited itself to converting 
nuclear-tipped weapons into conventional cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 42-day air war over Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf  
War, the Navy fired 288 Tomahawks. Last December, in only four days 
of air strikes on Iraq, the Navy launched more than 300 Tomahawks. 
The Air Forced fired off 90 in last December's ``Operation Desert 
Fox,'' using up nearly 40 percent of the Air Force inventory in one 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	For the longer term, the Navy is pushing to develop a new weapon  
called the ``Tactical Tomahawk,'' which will be entirely 
re-engineered and will cost about $750,000 each. The Navy wants to 
buy 1,353 over five years. But the weapon won't be ready until at 
least 2003. Raytheon is working on the design.

<HEADLINE> Study: DNA Conducts Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Strands of DNA might someday be used as wires in computer chips  
and transistors, researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans-Werner Fink and Christian Schoenenberger of the University  
of Basel in Switzerland found that DNA conducts electricity as well 
as a good semiconductor. A semiconductor carries electricity better 
than an insulator but not as well as a conductor like copper. 
</P>
<P>
	If DNA strands could be made with a switch to turn the current  
flowing through them on and off, they could be used to build 
extremely tiny electrical devices, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fink said he knows of no metallic wires that can be made as  
small or as regular as DNA strands. A strand is 2 billionths of a 
meter thick, or one-forty-four-thousandths of the diameter of a 
medium-size human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA strands might even be able to wire themselves together.  
</P>
<P>
	Molecules at the end of DNA strands will link themselves to  
certain other molecules, so it might be possible to create a wiring 
grid by laying down these target molecules as terminals and letting 
the DNA strands attach themselves, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Schuster, a chemistry professor at the Georgia Institute of  
Technology, said he suspects electrons flow through DNA much 
differently than in a wire. And whether the research will lead to a 
practical use of DNA as wiring he called ``a wide-open question.''

<HEADLINE> Friend Corroborates McDougal Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- A longtime friend of Whitewater figures James  
and Susan McDougal testified Wednesday that she heard McDougal 
pressuring his ex-wife to cooperate with Kenneth Starr's office. 
The witness also said she heard prosecutors offer Mrs. McDougal a 
deal if she helped their investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying in Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt trial, Claudia  
Riley said she overheard a conversation between the McDougals at 
her house after the two were convicted of fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim burst into the house and grabbed Susan by the arm and  
said, `I want to talk to you.' He appeared to be in a manic phase. 
He wanted her to cooperate with the independent counsel,'' said 
Mrs. Riley, who often nursed the late McDougal through 
manic-depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan said, `Jim, I wish you well. Do what you have to do. I  
understand, but I can't do this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim said, `You do this or I'll never speak to you again,'''  
Mrs. Riley said. ``He was very, very angry. That may have been the 
first time that Susan ever said 'No' to Jim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her ex-husband were business partners of  
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater 
real estate venture. The McDougals were convicted of fraud in 1996, 
along with then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, in a Whitewater-related trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After the trial, McDougal cooperated with prosecutors but Mrs.  
McDougal refused to answer questions about the Clintons before a 
grand jury in September 1996 and again last April. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to her indictment on criminal contempt and obstruction  
of justice charges. Her trial is in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has testified at trial that she refused to answer  
the questions because she feared Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
would charge her with perjury if she didn't say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her ex-husband told her she could just say she had a  
sexual affair with Clinton because prosecutors have ``sex charges'' 
on the president that they could use to hurt him before the 1996 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Riley also testified Wednesday that she participated in a  
telephone conference call with Mrs. McDougal before her sentencing 
on the 1996 convictions and heard part of a conversation between 
McDougal attorney Bobby McDaniel and Starr prosecutor Ray Jahn. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Jahn said he would recommend probation for Mrs.  
McDougal. ``I remember the words `We could get you out of 
California and get out you of the income tax (problem),''' Mrs. 
Riley testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal testified last week that prosecutors offered to  
suggest probation instead of a jail term. She said they also 
offered to take care of embezzlement charges against her in 
California and an investigation into her federal income taxes if 
she would give them something on the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Riley testified that McDaniel asked Jahn what prosecutors  
wanted from Mrs. McDougal. ``The response was, `We know what this 
trial's about. We know who it's about and we want something from 
her,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on questioning from Myers, Mrs. Riley said she did not hear  
Jahn say he only wanted truthful testimony from Mrs. McDougal. She 
also said she did not take notes during the call and acknowledged 
having a hearing loss in one ear. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Friday with defense testimony from Julie Hiatt  
Steele of Richmond, Va., who has accused Starr of mistreating her 
in his investigation of Clinton's relationship with former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Prison Abortion Case Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A civil rights claim accusing a judge of  
sending a pregnant woman to prison to keep her from getting an 
abortion has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuriko Kawaguchi, 21, had sued Common Pleas Judge Patricia  
Cleary over the six-month prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kawaguchi eventually decided to have the baby, explaining  
she was too far along in her pregnancy. She gave birth to a girl in 
February, and was seeking about $700,000 to pay for the child's 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Pleas Judge Mark Wiest threw out Ms. Kawaguchi's claim  
last week, ruling that Ms. Cleary may have exceeded her authority 
but was immune from such lawsuits as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kawaguchi, a Japanese citizen living in Burlingame, Calif.,  
was arrested last year in a scheme to buy computer equipment with 
fake credit cards and then sell the goods. She pleaded guilty to 
forgery. 
</P>
<P>
	During Ms. Kawaguchi's sentencing in October, the judge  
questioned her at length about the pregnancy and at one point said, 
``I'm saying she is not having a second-term abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cleary, who opposes abortion, said after the sentencing that  
it ``worked out swell'' if Ms. Kawaguchi couldn't get an abortion 
as a result of her prison term.

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 6 Percent Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy finished 1998 with an explosion of  
growth but it wasn't enough to prevent the decade's first drop in 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross domestic product surged at a seasonally adjusted 6  
percent annual rate during the last three months of the year, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	That was down only slightly from the department's earlier  
estimate of 6.1 percent and was enough, with earlier quarters' 
performance, to increase the sum of all goods and services produced 
within U.S. borders by a robust 3.9 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the department's first estimate of after-tax corporate  
profits showed a drop at a 1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, 
marking the third quarterly decline of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all of 1998, profits slipped 2.2 percent, the first drop  
since 1989, when profits fell 4.8 percent in a precursor to the 
1990-91 recession. The rare decline stood in marked contrast to 
gains ranging from 14 percent to 22 percent in the middle years of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy saw a shallow profits recession last year despite  
the booming growth and very likely will recover from that in 
1999,'' said economist Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in 
New York. ``But the heyday of the corporate profits boom is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits are being pinched by the combination of increasing labor  
costs and the inability of manufacturing firms to raise prices in 
the face of stiff price competition from imports produced in 
countries with devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	A price index tied to the GDP rose just 1 percent in 1998. There  
hasn't been a rate that low since 1959, also 1 percent, and there 
hasn't been one lower since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders for  
factory goods fell 2.5 percent in February, the most in nearly four 
years. A 30.6 percent drop in aircraft orders and a 38.2 percent 
plunge for military goods led the decline, but they were joined by 
smaller drops for industrial machinery and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Wall Street has remained undaunted. The Dow Jones  
average of industrial stocks broke the 10,000 barrier for the first 
time on Monday before settling back somewhat on Tuesday. It was up 
44 points to 9,957 in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor costs are increasing because the long expansion, which  
began its ninth year in March, reduced the unemployment rate to a 
29-year low last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Plentiful jobs and surging stock prices have been the principal  
fuel of the growth in consumer spending, which represents about 
two-thirds of economic activity. It rose at a 5 percent seasonally 
adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter and 4.9 percent for all 
of 1998, the most in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wages, consumers spent some of their stock gains  
and tapped their home equity in a wave of refinancing last year 
after mortgage rates fell to three-decade lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Those, in turn, produced a big drop in the nation's savings rate  
-- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- from 2.1 percent in 
1997 to just 0.5 percent in 1998, the lowest since 1933. In fact, 
the rate was zero during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contributing to economic growth were business investment in  
computers and other new equipment, up 16.5 percent last year, and 
housing construction, up 10.4 percent, the most since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas economic turmoil, however, held U.S. exports to only a  
1.5 percent increase, the weakest in 15 years, while imports shot 
up 10.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That hurt export-dependent industries, particularly the food  
industry, which suffered a sharp reduction in profits. Other 
sectors with profit declines include fabricated metal products, 
petroleum and coal, communications and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Will Cancel Hawaii Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Notre Dame apparently will be the next school to  
opt out of a game with the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fighting Irish are scheduled to play at Aloha Stadium on  
Nov. 24, 2001, but a school spokesman said it's not worth the risk 
of playing the game given the new Bowl Championship Series rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules factor strength of schedule into whether a school  
qualifies for the BCS. A team that earns a BCS bid sees a payday of 
a minimum $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications of playing that game are different than they  
used to be,'' Notre Dame spokesman John Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii athletic director Hugh Yoshida said the Rainbows -- whose  
1991 and 1997 losses to Notre Dame were by a touchdown or less -- 
won't fight the Irish's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will cost Hawaii money -- it earned an extra  
$225,000 in revenues for the last Notre Dame game. 
</P>
<P>
	But new Hawaii coach June Jones said Notre Dame is afraid to  
play the Rainbows, who he vows will be improved by the 2001 season. 
Hawaii has lost 18 straight games, dating back two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally think, as we get to winning, we're going to have  
a harder time scheduling,'' Jones said. ``What we're going to do 
offensively, some teams are going to look at it and say, `We don't 
want to play those guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia also backed out of a game against Hawaii this coming  
season and was replaced by Washington St.

<HEADLINE> Barbara Bush Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush was ``doing very  
well'' on Wednesday night after back surgery, said a spokeswoman 
for her son, Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush talked to his mother earlier this evening and she is  
doing great,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``She feels 
great and is doing very well.'' 
</P>

	The governor said his mother had ``some type of back surgery''  
at Houston's Methodist Hospital but did not elaborate, Ms. Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President George Bush made reference to the surgery on  
Wednesday during an Indiana fund-raiser for his son, a possible 
presidential candidate. Bush told a crowd in Indianapolis that his

<HEADLINE> Three Romanian Gymnasts Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Three top Romanian male gymnasts apparently  
decided not to return to their native country following a 
gymnastics meet last week, although no one seems to know where they 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Marian Malita, Viorel Popescu and Vasile Cioana have not been  
seen since Saturday. Romanian officials think the three decided to 
stay in the United States for good, said Ron Galimore, senior 
director for the American men's gymnastics program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm told that they did leave a note saying that they planned  
to stay behind,'' Galimore said Wednesday. ``Since this has taken 
place, we've been trying to locate them on behalf of the Romanian 
Gymnastics Federation. We've taken the time to contact several gym 
club owners that have foreign athletes working or training there. 
We've been unsuccessful at locating them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no signs of foul play in the disappearance, but FBI  
officials are checking to be sure, according to a statement from 
the bureau's Richmond office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find them to encourage them to go back and  
allow us to help them come here legally,'' he said. ``I think 
they're a little young (20 to 23) and they probably have not 
thought through things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No laws prevent Romanians from emigrating, but it is difficult  
to get long-term visas to move from parts of Europe to the United 
States, said Stefan Maier, press secretary for the Romanian Embassy 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The three gymnasts have temporary visas for their visit to the  
United States. Nicolae Vieru, head of Romania's gymnastics 
federation, told private news agency Mediafax that Cioana's visa is 
good until 2000, while Malita's and Popescu's expire at the end of 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	If the athletes do approach U.S. officials and request asylum,  
their cases would be decided by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service or an immigration court judge, INS spokesman Russ Bergeron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has not heard from the gymnasts or the Romanian  
gymnastics team, Bergeron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanian team was in Richmond for a meet last Friday  
featuring American men against Romania and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians stayed at the Omni Hotel in downtown Richmond.  
Sometime after the event, Malita, Popescu and Cioana left the hotel 
and didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, when the team visited the Romanian embassy, the three  
gymnasts were already missing, Maier said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person at the embassy who was serving as a host ... was  
told by the team that they were very upset that three of them 
left,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Romanian team returned home Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	News reports from Romania said that if the three stay in the  
United States, it would most likely be to make more money. The 
average monthly salary in Romania is equivalent to $78. 
</P>
<P>
	If the three do not return to Romania, it could damage the  
nation's chances of qualifying for the 2000 Olympics, Galimore 
said. The 1999 world championships are in October, and the top 12 
teams qualify for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're definitely within the top six'' on the Romanian team,  
Galimore said. ``All three of these guys would definitely be 
players for Romania's world championships team.''

<HEADLINE> Green Party Leads Calif. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A candidate for the California Assembly  
held a slim lead today that could make her the nation's first Green 
Party state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
	With all 153 precincts reporting, Audie Elizabeth Bock had  
14,357 votes, or 50.5 percent of the vote in Tuesday's runoff 
election. Former Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris had 14,065 votes, or 
49.4 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Because an unknown number of absentee and provisional ballots  
still had to be counted, Alameda County election officials said the 
official totals may not be available for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Party said victory would make Bock its first state  
lawmaker in this country. The party is similar in philosphy to 
Green parties in various European countries, sharing goals such as 
feminism, decentralized authority, nonviolence and environmental 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not declaring victory until every vote is counted,'' said  
Bock, 53, a part-time ethnic studies instructor at Oakland's Laney 
College, who was outspent 20-to-1 by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 51, had held the Assembly seat for 12 years before he  
served two terms as Oakland mayor, a post now held by former Gov. 
Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will succeed Don Perata, who was elected to the state  
Senate last September.

	GDP Grows at 6 Percent Annual Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economy grew at a  
seasonally-adjusted rate of 6 percent in the last quarter of 1998, 
the Commerce Department said today. That gave the yearly showing of 
total production of goods and services within U.S. borders a growth 
rate of 3.9 percent for the year. A price index tied to the GDP 
rose just 1 percent for the year -- the lowest since 1959, when the 
figure also was 1 percent. Despite the healthy growth and low 
inflation, however, corporate profits dropped at a 1 percent rate 
in the fourth quarter, and were down 2.2 percent for the year their 
first drop in about a decade. In another bit of economic news, the 
Commerce Department said orders for factory goods fell 2.5 percent 
in February, the steepest decline in nearly four years. Declines 
for aircraft and military goods led the way.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case

marathon trial in mid-May. That will delay any verdict until late 
summer or early fall. The extended recess provides Microsoft and 
the government more time to try to negotiate a settlement, although 
one round of talks ended unsuccessfully late yesterday after only 
two hours. In those negotiations at the Justice Department -- 
described as cordial -- Microsoft's top legal negotiators couldn't 
reach common ground with government lawyers, a person close to the 
discussions said.

Dorfman, who has covered business news for more than 30 years, held

of the world free trade body told the members there was no chance 
of reaching a consensus about either of the two candidates. Ali 
Mchumo, the Tanzanian trade ambassador, advised the countries to 
carry out some ``soul-searching'' over the Easter break and said 
they would meet again next week. Thai deputy prime minister

giving an upbeat outlook for 1999 at its first annual earnings news 
conference today. Sales were up 6 percent for the first two months 
of this year, with increases in all divisions. Revenues were 
expected to rise at least 4 percent over 1998's record level, the 
company said. Using Europe's new single euro currency, the company 
said revenues for 1999 were expected to climb at least 4 percent to 
$161 billion $155 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> A's Name Heredia To Start Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gil Heredia was picked today to start the Oakland  
Athletic's season opener Monday night against five-time Cy Young 
Award winner Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia, who began the spring as the team's No. 4 starter,  
replaces Kenny Rogers, who said he wasn't in shape yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best fit for us going into the season,'' manager  
Art Howe said. ``He's going to give us a good outing. He's capable 
of beating anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia was chosen over Tom Candiotti, who would have pitched on  
three days' rest, and Jimmy Haynes, scheduled to pitch Friday 
against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I look shaken up or confused, it's because it's obviously a  
surprise,'' Heredia said. ``It's an honor, a prestige thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia was signed to a minor league contract by the A's in 1998  
and spent most of the season at Triple-A Edmonton. He was recalled 
on Aug. 22 and went 3-3 with an ERA of 2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been around long enough to handle the situation,'' Howe  
said. ``When we told him, he was all pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia has pitched for the Giants, Montreal Expos and Texas  
Rangers in a major league career that began in 1991. He has a 22-24 
career record.

<HEADLINE> Is Jordan Serious About Comeback? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	We can only be sure about what he WON'T do.  
</P>
<P>
	Play baseball. Save the planet. Drive the carpool much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	But what will Michael Jordan DO?  
</P>
<P>
	No matter what you hear, no one knows at the moment -- not even  
the man himself. The reason Jordan refused to shut the door on a 
return to the NBA is because no one is happier hearing his name 
echoing down every hallway. So you know how much he must be loving 
it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the weekend, the scuttlebutt was that Jordan is  
interested only in owning the league's Charlotte franchise. On 
Tuesday night, it became that he might want to play for the team, 
too. The possibilities grow more intriguing by the day. At the 
breathless pace that Fox Sports News is pushing this story, mascot 
Hugo The Hornet's job won't be safe by end of the week, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very surprised if he came back and played,'' good buddy  
Charles Barkley told Fox when cornered by the network late Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a new one,'' former running mate Scottie Pippen weighed  
in a few minutes later. ``I don't see him coming in as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the two Houston Rockets have their reasons for  
wanting Jordan as far away from a basketball court as possible. His 
absence is Barkley's best chance to acquire at least one 
championship ring. It is Pippen's only chance to get his hands on 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all their reasons are selfish ones. Barkley, like Magic  
Johnson, another Jordan intimate, want to see his friend become the 
first black owner of a major sports franchise. Both of them, as 
well as Pippen, share the same concern for Jordan's legacy that 
Jordan expressed at a retirement news conference barely 10 weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'd do a disservice to himself,'' Barkley said. ``I  
think all athletes who come back do a disservice to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, never an original thinker, concurred. ``He had a great  
career. He's going to leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will he?  
</P>
<P>
	The guess here is probably not.  
</P>
<P>
	People who have seen Jordan in recent days peg him at a good 20  
pounds heavier than his last listed playing weight of 216. He 
hardly needs the extra weight to leverage his bid to buy a 
controlling interest in the team since commissioner David Stern, 
along with just about everybody else in his home state of North 
Carolina, would like nothing more than to see Jordan ease current 
owner George Shinn on down the road. And they might even show their 
gratitude by building him that new stadium that Shinn has begged 
shamelessly for the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan is likely to want his portion of ownership without  
putting much of his own money out, and for considerably less than 
half the $250 million that Shinn is said to be asking. That's where 
the playing part of the equation apparently comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	Current NBA rules prohibit a player from owning a team and vice  
versa. But if Jordan expressed a willingness to climb back into a 
uniform, who knows what concessions the league might be willing to 
throw at his feet? 
</P>
<P>
	And if the spirit of cooperation really takes hold, who's to say  
the rest of a widely circulating wish list couldn't come true: 
Jordan's last coach, Phil Jackson, back coaching for at least one 
season; his college coach, Dean Smith, as the Hornets' president; 
his agent, David Falk, negotiating player contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The linchpin, though, is Jordan, and not just in the front  
office, but out on the floor. He might have been honest when he 
said in January that there was only a 1 percent chance of his ever 
coming back to play. But if Jordan has been watching the sorry 
state of play so far this season -- beyond the occasional cameo as 
Jack Nicholson's guest -- the percentage must be in double digits at 
the very least. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan never was any good at sitting still. There is that  
``competition problem'' that the late James Jordan talked about, an 
itch that all the golf in the world and even the dizzying heights 
of business can't quite scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan knows how silly it would seem if he came rushing back  
now, even if he only came out and admitted he is giving it serious 
thought. So for the moment, he is probably thinking about dieting 
and swearing he is going to put that new basket up at the end of

	NATO Expands Yugoslavia Air Assault  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO widened its air assault on  
Yugoslavia today, pounding targets today near a major Kosovo city. 
NATO vowed there would be ``no sanctuary'' for Yugoslav forces 
trying to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. With the air campaign 
against President Slobodan Milosevic's forces entering its second 
week, Western officials acknowledged that NATO's missiles and bombs 
had so far failed to stop Belgrade's offensive in the province.

	Refugees Pour Out of Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands more refugees streamed out of  
the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo today, some saying Serb 
police burned their homes, herded them into trains and shipped them 
off to neighboring Macedonia. Germany's defense minister said there 
were reports that Yugoslav forces have been killing or locking up 
ethnic Albanian men and teen-age boys in concentration camps. Since 
the bombing began a week ago, at least 118,000 people have fled 
Kosovo, most of them to Albania, NATO said today.

	Lewinsky Inquiry Cost More Than $6M  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent more  
than $6 million on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the overall 
investigation of President Clinton is becoming the most expensive 
in history, congressional auditors reported today. The latest 
figures bring the total cost of Starr's 4 1/2-year inquiry of the 
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to nearly $40 million. Starr 
replaced Robert Fiske, who spent $6 million. The most expensive 
independent counsel investigation to date was Lawrence Walsh's 
$48.5 million probe of the Iran-Contra scandal.

	Gore Raises $7M, Bush Raises $6M  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President  
Al Gore have jumped out to big fund-raising leads in their 
respective party's presidential battles. Gore has raised at least 
$7 million so far this year for his bid for the Democratic 
nomination, aides close to his campaign said. Gore tapped more than 
40,000 donors, said the aides. Bush announced he has been raising 
money at a $2 million-a-week clip since he formed his presidential 
exploratory committee March 4 and will finish the month with more 
than $6 million.

	Microsoft Trial To Resume in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case  
today promised to resume the marathon trial in mid-May, which would 
delay any verdict until late summer or early fall. The extended 
recess provides Microsoft and the government more time to try to 
negotiate a settlement, although one round of talks ended 
unsuccessfully late yesterday after only two hours.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 127.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices retreated on Wall Street Wednesday,  
dousing an early rally in technology stocks, as interest rates rose 
in response to several reports of the economy's continuing 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 127.10, or by 1.3 percent,  
to 9,786.16. The Dow opened higher, climbing 88.80 to 10,002.06 in 
the first hour of trading, but quickly fell back. Despite the 
decline Wednesday, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks ended the 
first quarter of 1999 with a gain of 604.73 points, or 6.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators faded in the final hour as technology  
shares trimmed early gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index lost 
14.38 points to close at 1,286.37, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index fell 18.89 to 2,461.40 after flirting with a new 
high early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component IBM, at one point up 2 15/16, closed down 1 5/16  
at 177 1/4. In Nasdaq trading, Dell ended up 1 at 40 7/8, after trading 
as high as 42 1/4. But Internet stocks held up well, with Amazon.com 
adding 7 1/2 to 172 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were adjusting their holdings ahead of the long  
weekend. Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential 
Securities, said they were ``just tired, tired, tired,'' after 
pushing the Dow industrials to their first close above 10,000 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Piskorowski said investors were also concerned about Friday's  
release of March unemployment data, especially because the stock 
market will be closed that day in observance of Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is widespread fear that a drop in the unemployment rate  
will cause interest rates to rise, as they did Wednesday following 
some strong economic reports. The yield on the 30-year Treasury 
rose to 5.62 percent from 5.58 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell after a report from the Purchasing Management  
Association of Chicago showing manufacturing strengthened in the 
Midwest during March. The regional report is often considered a 
precursor of the national purchasing managers' report due out 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had a bit of a reaction in the bond market to the Chicago  
report,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward 
Jones of St. Louis, ``although I think the silver lining is that 
the economy is still strong. What the stock market should recognize 
is that ultimately, the strength of the economy will lead to 
stronger corporate profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks were still following the lead of bonds in reacting to  
the Commerce Department's report that the nation's gross domestic 
product surged at a 6 percent annual rate during the fourth 
quarter, close to the department's earlier estimate of up 6.1 
percent. GDP increased by a robust 3.9 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A price index tied to the GDP rose just 1 percent in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	The government's corporate profit report, which is the bottom  
line for stock investors, was less upbeat. Its first estimate of 
after-tax corporate profits showed a drop at an annual rate of 1 
percent in the fourth quarter, the third quarterly decline last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all of 1998, profits slipped 2.2 percent, the first drop  
since 1989, when earnings fell 4.8 percent in a precursor to the 
1990-91 recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris dropped 2 5/8 to 35 3/16, with other tobacco stocks  
also retreating, after an Oregon jury ordered the cigarette maker 
to pay $81 million to the family of a man who died of lung cancer 
after smoking Marlboros for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks in general were lower. Coca-Cola, still reeling  
from a report of lower sales on Tuesday, was down 1 7/8 at 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 7-to-6 margin. Consolidated NYSE volume totaled 1.12 
billion shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 5.06 to 603.59, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.33 to 710.30. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.15 to 397.63. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei stock index in Tokyo dipped 0.14  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt added 0.56 percent, 
and London's FT-SE 100 index climbed 0.50 percent. The CAC in Paris 
advanced 1.35 percent, on speculation about prospects for an 
interest rate cut in France.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Hit Hard by Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Across the nation, small communities are  
finding that justice can be very expensive. Some prosecutors are 
deciding it's not worth it, especially for death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service 
agencies could lose more than $100,000 unless the county can come 
up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and 
co-defendant Aaron McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of jury selection in Henderson's trial concluded  
Wednesday with the choice of 47 prospects, who will undergo a final 
round of questioning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jasper, Texas, Judge Joe Folk said it will take county  
taxpayers three years to pay for prosecuting two defendants in the 
dragging death of a black man and three other pending capital 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can bankrupt small counties. Some county judges have said  
they won't prosecute some capital murder cases and will go for just 
murder because of the cost of a trial,'' Folk said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Okanagan, Wash., the government was financially crippled  
prosecuting Juan Duarte Gonzalez, accused of killing a policeman. 
The case is expected to cost up to $1 million, 9 percent of the 
county's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The county responded by drastically cutting spending, including  
pay raises for its 350 employees. Gonzalez even has his own line in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Pozner, president of the National Association of Defense  
Lawyers, said larger communities like Los Angeles are better able 
to absorb the costs of major prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big case in a small community can be prohibitive,'' Pozner  
said. ``But you have to make the communities responsible for 
prosecution. If you just gave them access to the state budget, 
everyone would want to do show trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-sized communities aren't immune from the financial impact of  
a high-profile case either. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, Boulder, Colo., spent $1.2 million  
investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey, and the district 
attorney spent another $400,000. No one has even been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county has a limited budget and we're restricted by state  
law how much we can raise taxes. The prospect of paying for a 
multimillion-dollar trial is staggering. We have to come up with 
the money somewhere, and if that's the case, there's going to have 
to be some budget-cutting,'' said county spokeswoman Jana Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pozner blamed prosecutors for driving up the costs in  
high-profile cases, saying they feel pressure to get more witnesses 
when the national media is looking over their shoulders. Pozner 
said defense attorneys are compelled to match prosecutors witness 
for witness, driving up the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But former federal prosecutor William Pizzi, now a law professor  
at the University of Colorado, said it's not fair to blame just the 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm critical of the system as a whole,'' he said. ``We ought  
to be able to do this in a less expensive way, but it's hard to 
reform our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzi said it is up to judges to keep expenses in check. He said  
costs could be trimmed by reforming pretrial procedures and rules 
of evidence.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Refugees Tell Tragic Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Lumnije Mehmeti doesn't mind leaving  
her home behind or that it took nearly a day to drive 30 miles. 
Even abandoning her car in the no-man's land between Yugoslavia and 
Macedonia was nothing for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God I escaped and I am still alive. Who cares what  
happens to what we left behind?'' the 28-year-old said. She came 
from Urosevac, a town outside Kosovo's capital of Pristina she said 
has almost been emptied of Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda, a 26-year-old woman next to her who asked that her full  
name not be used, had red eyes from crying much of the way from her 
town of Vitina, southeast of Urosevac. ``I don't care where I am or 
how I got here. It smells like freedom here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both were among more than 5,000 people stretching for more than  
3 miles into Yugoslavia at the Blace border crossing, near the 
Macedonian capital Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trainloads of Kosovo refugees were camped inside the  
Macedonian border today. The Macedonian army and security forces 
allowed the hundreds of refugees trying to reach the capital, 
Skopje, to camp in a field inside the border after turning them 
back the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of other ethnic Albanians were reported lined up in a  
long convoy of cars on the Kosovo side. But for a second day, 
Macedonian authorities slowed those trying to drive out of 
Yugoslavia, allowing only a trickle of vehicles through every hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's other neighbors, Montenegro and Albania, have also been  
coping with the onslaught of refugees, a total of 118,000 since 
NATO airstrikes began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	International relief agencies and governments have started  
rushing supplies to those who have reached Kosovo's neighbors in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Top U.N. relief officials planned to meet Thursday to draw up a  
new international appeal for Kosovo, given that the existing appeal 
for $64 million was no longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehmeti was one of the lucky ones. More than 3,000 of her fellow  
Kosovo Albanians spent three days atop a nearby snow-covered 
mountain without food and water, sleeping under the trees in the 
freezing cold. They said at least five people -- including two 
infants -- died in the trek. 
</P>
<P>
	To make things worse, they were unwelcome. After slogging for  
more than 18 hours through mud tracks and streams and then 
scrambling up goat tracks to reach the summit of the 4,200-foot 
mountain that separates Kosovo from Macedonia, they ran into the 
Macedonian army. 
</P>
<P>
	Although government and Albanian minority leaders have tried to  
play it down, many nationalists fear Macedonia's delicate ethnic 
balance could be affected by the influx of refugees. Ethnic 
Albanians are thought to make up as much as 40 percent of 
Macedonia's 2.2 million population. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of refugees has neared 30,000, one-third more than  
Macedonia has said it can handle, officials have made repeated 
appeals for help from neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yugoslavs behind them and the Macedonians in front of  
them blocking their way, the refugees had nowhere to go. Most were 
from villages and towns around the border, so they knew the 
frontier was mined. Cows in recent days have set off a number of 
anti-tank mines. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, no one knew they were on top of the mountain except  
for local villagers. It was only after they alerted the media and 
humanitarian agencies that their plight became known and they 
straggled down into the valley and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	For one man, the wait was especially hard. His wife had been  
shot in the town of Kacanik, close to Blace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hiding in a basement, and my wife went out, and they  
started shooting,'' he said, asking not to be identified. He sat 
over his pregnant wife in a nearby village. She had two bullet 
wounds in her thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried her on a stretcher to get her to Macedonia after  
their house was shelled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was even worse for the ethnic Albanians fleeing Pristina.  
Unlike many of the rural people on the mountain, most are 
white-collar city dwellers. The snail's pace at the border was not 
what they expected, and the realization that they also might not be 
wanted suddenly hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why they are doing this, one maltreatment to the  
next,'' said Arta, a 26-year-old university student who did not 
give her full name. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many, the wait was worth it. In Pristina, people rarely  
leave their homes, shops are closed or looted, and electricity is 
shut off at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Many said that although they had not seen any killings, they had  
heard about executions, hangings and other atrocities. Serb 
paramilitary forces and armed civilians drove through the streets 
shooting in the air and randomly looting and burning houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was becoming more and more scary every day. People are  
scared of Serb paramilitary attacks. We never know what is going to 
happen. You never sleep. You live in constant fear,'' Arta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to go varied for many. Some just decided to leave  
with their neighbors, others decided to go in groups. Yugoslav 
police made things easy for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if they organized this. Police are helping.  
Many times on the road they say faster, faster,'' said Valdan 
Haliti, a 25-year-old engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Haliti said he decided to leave early Monday along with a  
university professor after they heard a rumor that a convoy was 
being organized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shooting in the streets that morning that did it,''  
he said.

shooting in the air and randomly looting and burning houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was becoming more and more scary every day. People are  
scared of Serb paramilitary attacks. We never know what is going to 
happen. You never sleep. You live in constant fear,'' Arta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to go varied for many. Some just decided to leave  
with their neighbors, others decided to go in groups. Yugoslav 
police made things easy for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if they organized this. Police are helping.  
Many times on the road they say faster, faster,'' said Valdan 
Haliti, a 25-year-old engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Haliti said he decided to leave early Monday along with a  
university professor after they heard a rumor that a convoy was 
being organized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shooting in the streets that morning that did it,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> INS To Send 200 Agents to 11 States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service is  
deploying 200 agents to help state and local law enforcement 
agencies in 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on Tuesday announced formation  
of 45 quick response teams that will be sent to Arkansas, Colorado, 
Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted at a news conference that Congress has earmarked money  
specifically for those states, which have seen a surge in immigrant 
smuggling in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	INS moved this month to implement a new interior enforcement  
strategy that emphasizes combating criminal activities related to 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the agency will concentrate on removing criminal  
aliens and cracking down on alien-smuggling rings, counterfeiters 
of documents and employers who team with smugglers to hire 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new quick-response teams, to be in place by October, will be  
made up of special agents and detention and deportation officers 
who will detain and remove undocumented immigrants encountered by 
law enforcers in the 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will receive 31 quick response team personnel, followed  
by Missouri, with 25, and Nebraska, 23. Tennessee follows 21; Utah 
and Iowa, 20 each; Georgia and North Carolina, 16 apiece; Kentucky, 
13; Arkansas, 10; South Carolina, three; and Louisiana, two.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Help Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is looking for other ways to  
help farmers, but major changes to federal farm law are unlikely 
this year, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments come as farmers prepare for the new planting  
season, which is expected to bring low prices for the second year 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'd like to do is be out a little more in front of the  
issue,'' Glickman said Tuesday, adding that President Clinton 
telephoned him over the weekend to discuss farm issues. ``The 
issues of the farm program are getting a lot more attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Glickman warned that it is unlikely there will be major  
revisions to the 1996 farm law that gradually phases out government 
subsidies to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any movement to roll back the Farm Bill,''  
Glickman said. ``But I do think it's imperative that we plug its 
holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the administration will likely put forth some specific  
proposals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clinton administration and Congress have expressed  
interest in overhauling a crop insurance program for farmers so 
that producers will have adequate coverage during hard times. But 
crop insurance isn't the only solution, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While crop insurance will continue to be the centerpiece of  
the safety net, we're looking at a broad range of risk management 
tools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Congress passed a $6 billion emergency aid package  
for farmers. The money came as farmers were experiencing record low 
prices along with disease and bad weather in some areas. The 
government already has predicted the low price problem will linger 
this year, largely due to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices also have hit the livestock sector, particularly hog  
farmers who have gotten their lowest prices in four decades in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress already have expressed support for  
another emergency aid package for farmers.

<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Ken Cloude, who came to spring training as  
the Seattle Mariners' No. 3 starter, will start the season in the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old right-hander was optioned today to Triple-A  
Tacoma of the Pacific Coast League along with right-hander Rafael

<HEADLINE> Guidant Issues Pacemaker Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Guidant Corp. has asked doctors to monitor  
patients who wear certain Guidant pacemakers, saying the batteries 
that power the devices can wear out much sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,500 Discovery, Meridian, and Pulsar brand pacemakers --  
less than 1 percent of those sold -- are affected with the problem, 
a Guidant spokeswoman said. Batteries in the units typically last 
seven years, but could drain in six months, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Physicians have been instructed to examine patients with the  
affected devices on a monthly basis for up to six months for signs 
of premature battery failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Some patients with the faulty devices could require a new unit,  
which the company will replace for free, the company said. No 
deaths or serious injuries have been observed due to premature 
battery failure in the units, Guidant added. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Guidant fell $1.50 to close at $60.50 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis-based Guidant manufactures heart defibrillators,  
pacemakers, and other products for the heart and vascular system.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Plunge After Economic Report / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Wednesday after a regional  
purchasing managers' report exhibited unexpected strength, renewing 
fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32  
point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.62 percent, up from 5.58 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, issued by the Purchasing Management Association of  
Chicago, showed far more strength than expected. The group's index 
rose to 57 in March from 52.9 in February. Economists had predicted 
a slight decline to 52.8. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of the report raised fears that inflation -- which  
has been increasing at a relatively paltry annual rate of 1.6 
percent -- will quicken. Even though it is a regional report, it is 
seen a precursor to the national purchasing managers' report, which 
will be released Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had a bit of a reaction in the bond market to the Chicago  
report,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward 
Jones of St. Louis, ``although I think the silver lining is that 
the economy is still strong. What the stock market should recognize 
is that ultimately, the strength of the economy will lead to 
stronger corporate profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 1/16 point, while intermediate Treasury securities fell 
between 7/16 and 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, held steady 
for a third day at 1,282.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.48 percent, while  
the discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.37 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.51 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.35 percent. One-year yields rose to 
4.69 percent, while the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 from 4.69 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/32 point to 124 1/8. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.23 percent from 5.21 percent late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> BMW Wins Agreement on British Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Luxury automaker BMW and the British  
government announced an aid package Wednesday for the carmaker's 
struggling British unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and BMW agreed ``in principle on the size and nature''  
of government financing that will secure production of a new 
medium-sized car at the Rover Longbridge plant in Birmingham, 
England, according to a joint statement from BMW and the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement gave no specific figures and said the agreement  
still needed approval from the board of directors of Bayerische 
Motoren Werke AG as well as EU authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Blair said he was ``delighted'' that people could look  
forward to BMW making Longbridge a ``world class plant for the next 
century''. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW had asked for more than $324 million from the government.  
Although the government increased its opening offer of $190 
million, the final amount is thought to be short of what the German 
firm wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is now expected to press ahead with an ambitious program,  
costing hundreds of millions of dollars, to build a new range of 
cars at Longbridge and to modernize the sprawling factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure increased on Britain to conclude the deal after the  
Munich-based BMW reported earnings Tuesday that reflected troubles 
within Rover. The automaker had warned that the longer negotiations 
dragged on, the greater the likelihood of production being switched 
to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax losses in the British unit, which continues to fight  
against a strong pound and declining sales at home, dragged BMW 
profits down 28 percent in 1998 to $531 million. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested $3.57 billion in Rover since buying the  
carmaker in 1994. The unit's best-selling model has been the Mini. 
</P>
<P>
	In England, union officials welcomed the news and praised the  
government for its role in helping the plant, which now employs 
9,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has delivered its promise of not walking away  
from Longbridge. After months of damaging speculation, the clouds 
have been lifted,'' said Ken Jackson, general secretary of the 
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Rover auto workers voted to accept a radical  
restructuring deal to cut 2,500 jobs but keep the huge Longbridge 
assembly plant open.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Uniforms May Pitch Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine this: Mark McGwire walking to the plate  
with a patch on his bulging biceps advertising a burger joint. 
</P>
<P>
	Or those famed New York Yankees pinstripes -- the ones worn with  
pride by Ruth and Gehrig, DiMaggio and Mantle -- pitching an ad for 
bagels. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be coming to a ballpark near you.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is considering allowing teams to sell advertising on  
the sleeves of their uniforms. It's not unprecedented: Soccer teams 
around the world have ads on their shirts, selling everything from 
breweries to banks, often emblazoned in letters larger than those 
of the team name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I think of is somebody's bail bonds on the  
back of the Bad News Bears' uniforms,'' Baltimore pitcher Mike 
Mussina said Wednesday. ``So it's going to be my name, my number 
and Joe's Bail Bonds? That's the first thing I think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, first reported this week by the Sports Business  
Journal, could be on 1- to 1 1/2-inch square patches -- perhaps too 
small to be easily seen from the upper deck, but certainly big 
enough to be picked up in TV closeups and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR drivers are walking, talking billboards when they wear  
their track outfits. And tennis players and golfers frequently 
appear on the court and the course wearing caps with corporate 
logos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where baseball is looking to further  
market itself and maybe that's a possibility we need to look at,'' 
Seattle catcher Dan Wilson said. ``If that's one way to do it, 
that's one way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although shoes and equipment such as bats and gloves carry brand  
names and logos, ads on uniforms apparently would be a first for 
the four major U.S. team sports. Currently, the only corporate 
marking on baseball uniforms is an ``R'' for Russell Athletic, the 
manufacturer of the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about trying to find creative ways to bring valuable  
partners into baseball,'' said Tim Brosnan, baseball's senior vice 
president of domestic and international properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan wouldn't put a timetable on the discussions or when a  
final decision will be made, saying it depends ``on when things 
gel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a traditionalist, but I know all these things we're doing  
generate more revenue, and that's what we have to do,'' Florida 
Marlins manager John Boles said. If Mr. Henry (Florida owner John 
Henry) says, `This is what we're doing on the uniforms,' I'd say, 
`Looks great to me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Several officials speaking on the condition they not be  
identified said owners would have to give the final go-ahead and 
pointed out that commissioner Bud Selig moves slowly and carefully 
toward decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are active discussions about the issues that bring  
additional partners and additional sponsors into baseball,'' 
Brosnan said. ``We're kicking around a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and chief operating officer Paul Beeston did not respond  
to telephone calls seeking comment on the plan. Gene Orza, the 
union's No. 2 official, said a national sponsor might buy the 
rights to all uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks are still very preliminary. To even discuss them is  
to give them a substance they don't deserve,'' Orza said. ``But be 
assured that whatever we do, it will be tasteful, a small logo on 
the uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball would prohibit uniform ads only from tobacco, alcohol  
and media companies. Broadcasters of games are unlikely to want to 
show closeups of players wearing ads for their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ralph Nader dislikes the idea, and sent a  
letter to Selig telling him so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad enough already when outfielders are going back for a  
long drive, that fans have to see advertisements for Coca-Cola and 
other products,'' Nader wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are trying the patience of loyal fans across the country.  
Fans yearn for baseball that is free from blatant huckstering and 
crass commercialism,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the scramble to find new revenue in the 1990s, often to cover  
players' escalating salaries, teams have dramatically increased 
ballpark advertising, plastering ads on fences and -- for the first 
time -- behind home plate, where they are visible behind the batter 
from the center field television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have even sold the naming rights to stadiums -- Banc One  
Corp. will spend $66 million on the naming rights to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks' ballpark in the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Three Soldiers Missing in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three U.S. Army soldiers were missing in  
Macedonia near the Yugoslav border Wednesday night after possibly 
being captured by members of the Serb military or police while on a 
reconnaissance mission, the Pentagon and NATO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	An immediate search and rescue mission was launched, involving  
ground and helicopter teams, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army team had been on a daytime reconnaissance mission in  
the Kumanovo area of Macedonia near the southern Yugoslavia border 
when they reported ``they received small arms fire and said they 
were surrounded,'' according to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more was heard from the patrol,'' a NATO statement said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials didn't say who had them surrounded, but a  
Pentagon spokesman said it was presumed to be Serb Army, 
paramilitary units or perhaps special police forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe they have possibly been abducted,'' said Col.  
Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman. ``Right now there's a search 
and rescue effort on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger  
advised President Clinton of the missing soldiers ``and will keep 
him informed as the information becomes available,'' said NSC 
spokesman David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still determined to push forward on our sustained air  
campaign and the operation will continue'' against military targets 
in Yugoslavia, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy declined to provide further details ``that could  
potentially jeopardize the safety or well being of these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces, including ground and helicopter teams, and  
Macedonian police immediately launched an immediate search for the 
missing team, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army reconnaissance team was a part of the former U.N.  
peacekeeping operation in Macedonia called ``Able Sentry,'' which 
ended in February, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of about 1,200 troops included about 350 Americans,  
who remained in the region following the March 24 start of NATO 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia against Serb military targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has counseled from the beginning of the airstrikes  
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that Americans would 
be put at risk during NATO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, an F-117a stealth fighter went down near  
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, after it was apparently hit with a 
Serb anti-aircraft missile. It was the first time the radar-evading 
aircraft had gone down in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The American pilot was rescued six hours later.

<HEADLINE> Louis Farrakhan Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan  
continued to receive treatment Wednesday at Howard University 
Hospital, but neither Nation of Islam officials nor the hospital 
would say much about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement sent to news organizations from the Nation of Islam  
newspaper, The Final Call, said Farrakhan's treatment `continues to 
be successful and his prognosis is excellent.' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who was treated for prostate cancer several years  
ago, has been ill since early January with an undiagnosed 
condition, according to a Final Call article last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was admitted Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	At a March 19 press conference in Chicago, Nation of Islam  
Minister of Health Abdul Alim Muhammad said Farrakhan was being 
treated in Chicago, where he lives, for complications stemming from 
treatment of his prostate cancer. Alim said Farrakhan was not in 
any imminent danger and would rest for four months to recuperate 
from the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	A source within the Nation of Islam said Farrakhan, his family --  
including his wife, daughter and son-in-law -- and an entourage flew 
here Tuesday from Chicago, where Farrakhan lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan had been treated at Howard University Hospital in the  
early 1990s for the prostate condition, the source said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Player Probe Includes Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Investigators looking into possible  
cheating by University of Minnesota basketball players will be able 
to examine hundreds of documents from a woman who says she wrote 
papers for players. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Jan Gangelhoff said his firm has printed the papers  
from copies of computer disks and plans to share them with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff had shared 225 of the files with the Saint Paul  
Pioneer Press, which first reported the accusations, and will also 
print papers from additional disks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sit down with the investigators, and Jan, and a  
stenographer and go through all the papers,'' lawyer James Lord 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said Gangelhoff will show investigators those papers she  
wrote alone and those she and the players wrote together. No date 
has been set for that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she did course work for 20 players from 1993 to  
1998. Her sister, Jeanne Payer, also said she did course work for 
players during the 1997-98 school year. A third tutor, Alexandra 
Goulding, said she wrote one paper for a basketball player during 
her first tutoring session, then told officials she would not do 
such work any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Academic tutors at the university are required to sign an  
employment document that outlines their responsibilities, 
confidentiality laws and NCAA and university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The document states: ``These (NCAA) rules, for example, prohibit  
giving any item of value to student-athletes, prohibit the 
researching of or typing of student reports/papers, and prohibit 
staff from providing students with access to copy machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Gangelhoff declined to share the papers with  
university officials, saying that would make her an ally of the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigators have to have them,'' Lord said. ``The papers  
are what started the avalanche of revelations about wrongdoing at 
the university. The papers are certainly not the only place the 
investigators can be looking right now, but we want to be 
cooperative.''

whose commentary on cable network CNBC could move markets, is 
making a return -- this time on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman will be part of a team at stock research company  
JagNotes.com Inc. that will produce daily Wall Street coverage. 
Details about the column are still being worked out, though it is 
expected to begin in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got my mind, my mouth and my sources, and I'm hungry to  
get back,'' Dorfman said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman, who has covered business news for more than 30 years,  
held legendary sway on CNBC with his market commentary that could 
send stocks plunging or soaring. He stopped appearing on the 
network after suffering a mild stroke in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman was also involved in one of the most notable ethics  
controversies this decade. Dorfman was fired as a Money magazine 
columnist in 1996 for refusing to reveal confidential sources to 
his editor amid reports that authorities were investigating his 
relationship with stock promoter Donald Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman was never charged in the matter, while Kessler  
ultimately pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud and one 
count of tax evasion.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Release Cecil Fielder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Cecil Fielder's comeback with the Toronto  
Blue Jays didn't even make it to opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, who agreed last month to a minor league contract with  
the Blue Jays, was released today, a day after Toronto acquired 
Dave Hollins from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it had to do with the Hollins trade,'' Fielder said as  
he packed his gear in the Blue Jays' clubhouse, ``I just don't 
understand the change of heart by the team. I'm a little 
disappointed, I thought everything was set, but I will be OK. Life 
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, 35, split last season between the Anaheim Angels and  
Cleveland Indians, hitting a combined .233 with 17 home runs and 68 
RBIs in 117 games. He batted .264 in 17 spring training games, 
going 14-for-53 with two doubles, a team-high three homers and 11 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto also made former Chicago White Sox manager Terry  
Bevington its third-base coach, replacing Sal Butera. Bevington had 
been manager at the Blue Jays' Triple-A team at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Butera will decide in several days whether to take another  
position in organization.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Clemens Finishes Workouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- The Rocket is ready.  
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens, the New York Yankees' opening day starter,  
pitched five scoreless innings in a Triple-A game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be nerves ... I'll have excitement,'' said Clemens  
about his start Monday at Oakland. ``I'll have to control my 
excitement early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well aware that it's a marathon. I can't do it all in one,  
two, three innings. I'll be telling myself those things, but I'll 
probably let a couple go,'' the five-time Cy Young winner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for Columbus against Scranton, the Philadelphia  
Phillies' top farm club, Clemens allowed one scratch hit, struck 
out five and walked two. The right-hander threw 44 of 71 pitches 
for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely wanted to get some good work in and feel strong  
doing it,'' Clemens said. ``I felt pretty good and it went pretty 
much according to what I expected. I'm ready to get going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees acquired Clemens from Toronto last month for  
pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees LHP Andy Pettitte will stay behind when the team 
breaks camp Thursday and make his second minor league start Friday. 
He has throw just three innings this spring, including one inning 
against major league hitters on March 7 when he strained a muscle 
in his throwing elbow. ... The Yankees are very close to signing 
17-year old Dominican OF-3B Willie Pena. ... 17-year old Dominican 
RHP Ricardo Aramboles continues his impressive recovery from major 
offseason elbow surgery. He will likely pitch his first simulated 
game at the Yankees' minor league facility in approximately two 
weeks. ... Yankees minor league catcher Jaime Torres resumed off 
field workouts Wednesday, one week after undergoing thyroid cancer 
surgery.

<HEADLINE> US Raises Genocide Issue in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is coming as close  
as it can to labeling Serb atrocities in Yugoslavia genocide 
without crossing a line that could raise the legal stakes under a 
50-year-old international treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Genocide Convention, signed after World War II by most  
countries, including the United States and Yugoslavia, neither 
requires nor prohibits military intervention in a country where it 
is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pact that arose out of the Holocaust does establish  
genocide as an international crime, opens the way for criminal and 
civil charges against individuals and could bolster arguments for 
foreign intervention in another country's affairs, including the 
use of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts ``committed  
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, 
racial or religious group.'' It lists such acts as killing members 
of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to its members, 
deliberately inflicting conditions aimed at destroying the group 
and imposing measures aimed at preventing births within the group 
or forcing the transfer of children out of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions of genocide in connection with Yugoslavia first  
surfaced Monday, when State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
declared there were ``indicators genocide is unfolding in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Rubin said, ``We're talking about forced  
expulsions, we're talking about rape, we're talking about mass 
murder, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people being 
moved out of their homes.'' Calling it genocide, he said, would not 
change the response. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, President Clinton used the word without drawing  
any clear distinction between genocide and other characterizations 
used in describing Serb actions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not allow, if we have the ability to stop it, ethnic  
cleansing or genocide anywhere we can stop it -- particularly at the 
edge of Europe,'' Clinton said in a speech to an electronics 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration is now using the word, a leading human  
rights group working on the Kosovo crisis has not gone that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have been shouting about human rights  
violations in Kosovo and felt the administration was behind the 
curve,'' said Fred Abrams of Human Rights Watch. ``Now, the 
administration is out there ahead of us. We don't want to say 
genocide is not taking place, because the evidence suggests it may 
be. ... But we will wait till all the facts are in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it is genocide, Abrams said, then governments are morally  
obligated to ``do everything in their power to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington University law professor Ralph Steinhardt said  
that although the Genocide Convention does not mandate enforcement 
or military intervention, allegations of genocide were used as 
partial basis for intervention in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations could be used, Steinhardt said, if Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic is taken before the new international 
war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law answers the question of individual liability,'' he  
said. ``Collective humanitarian intervention is a little closer to 
the line,'' with wide disagreement over whether it can be 
justified.

<HEADLINE> Jones Has Clear Shot at Five Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Unlike Michael Johnson in 1996, Marion  
Jones won't have to fight for a chance to win multiple gold in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' bid to become the first female track athlete to win five  
gold medals is getting full support from the organizing committee 
(SOCOG). In Atlanta, late negotiations were needed to facilitate 
Johnson's 200-400 double. 
</P>
<P>
	But SOCOG has designed a schedule around Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've made sure we've learned from the issues of Atlanta,''  
SOCOG sports manager Bob Elphinston said Wednesday. ``In regard to 
the ability of a Marion Jones being able to undertake the program 
she wants, that's all been considered in our planning by the 
athletics experts we have on our staff and through Athletics 
Australia. I think we're well prepared in that area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will be trying to become the first woman in the sport to  
win five gold medals in one games. Fanny Blankers-Koen of the 
Netherlands is the only woman track and field competitor to win 
four golds at one games, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five golds is not just talk,'' Jones said earlier this year.  
``It is possible. If any athlete can do it, it's myself. I was born 
with a lot of talent, but I'm also a very hard worker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only catch is that of the 28 sports to be contested on the  
Olympic program, track and field's governing body the IAAF is the 
only one yet to reach a formal schedule agreement with SOCOG. 
</P>
<P>
	Elphinston said the lack of an official stamp of approval from  
the IAAF could no longer hold up the organizers from sealing the 
program for the 2000 games, which will be held in September. 
</P>
<P>
	'' We're now printing something like 9.3 million ticket  
brochures to go across Australia when our tickets are launched on 
May 20,'' Elphinston said. ``It's absolutely crucial that we 
maintain that program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elphinston said he could see no reason why the IAAF would seek  
changes to a schedule that would revolve around Jones' attempt to 
win the 100-200 double, plus the long jump, and the 400 and 
1,600-meter relays.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday, with the top  
three markets -- Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore -- closing with 
little change. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's biggest movement was in Bangkok, where share prices  
plunged after the Thai government announced a U.S. $3.5 billion 
economic package that met expectations but didn't have any 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The SET index lost 7.75 points, or 2.2 percent, to 352.01.  
</P>
<P>
	The new stimulus measures include various tax cuts, but analysts  
said most of them, such as the reductions in corporate income tax 
and personal income tax, were too small to significantly boost 
consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the blue chips fell after a volatile session on the  
last day of the country's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 22.53 points, or 0.14  
percent, to close at 15,836.59. On Tuesday, the index lost 149.72 
points, or 0.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average lost as much as 207 points early in the  
session but bounced back later as U.S. pension funds bought shares 
to dress up their performance at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices ended largely unchanged, as investors  
found no news to motivate them in a bumpy session. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index edged up just 1.99 points, or 0.02  
percent, to close at 10,942.20. The Hang Seng had rallied 2.4 
percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Wong, research manager at OSK Asia Securities Ltd., said  
most investors remain hopeful that some positive news will boost 
the market soon, such as an April government land auction, a 
possible interest rate cut and China's possible entry into the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets were closed in Indonesia for year-end  
clearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed nearly unchanged in sluggish trading in  
a holiday-shortened week. The Straits Times Index rose just 0.23 
point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,518.31. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rose on anticipation that the  
central bank would unveil plans to cut interest rates when it 
released its annual economic report after the market's close. The 
investors were left disappointed. The Composite Index rose 0.9 
percent, or 4.25 points, to end at 502.82. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Some last-minute bargain-hunting in key blue-chip issues  
lifted Philippine stocks in late trading. The PSE index rose 16.19 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,028.21. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rose on expectations of an inflow of  
funds into the stock market amid low local interest rates. The 
Kospi index edged up 0.93 points, or 0.15 percent, to 618.98. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell on the back of Wall Street's  
overnight drop. The All Ordinaries Index fell closed down 28.1 
points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,967.2. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed lower, led by losses in the  
technology sector. The Weighted Price Index lost 16.94 points, or 
0.24 percent, closing at 6,881.72. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose for a second day, led by  
market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The benchmark 
NZSE-40 capital index rose 17.12 points, or 0.8 percent, to 
2,143.18.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Entrepreneurs Go to Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- At his first day of business boot  
camp, graduate student George Shillenger broke a light sweat, took 
a deep breath and described his plans for launching a high-tech 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're building a community of science on the Internet,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	What about making money?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yes,'' he said, relaxing a bit. ``We're planning to make a  
lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpening up business plans is what this training ground for  
entrepeneurs is all about. Shillenger, who hopes to fire up his Web 
site TheScience.com this summer, was among more than 600 aspiring 
entrepreneurs this week learning some tough business lessons about 
making it in the light-speed world of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendees hope to receive some of the more than $16 billion  
in venture capital expected to be invested in startup companies 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Silicon Valley pros is staging the two-day boot camp,  
dispensing their wisdom about how to snag investment capital, 
protect inventions from bootleggers and ``create a buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry, be crappy,'' advised Guy Kawasaki, a former Apple  
Computer evangelist who now helps startups. ``Revolutionaries ship 
their product first and then they test it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Costello, who has successfully launched several major  
Silicon Valley companies including Cadence, said his most important 
advice is to focus on the positive goal, and avoid fixating on the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm flying along and there's the power pole, and I'm  
thinking, 'Don't hit that power pole. Don't hit that power pole,' 
then the next thing you know, Whap! I'm going to hit it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other advice: ``Twenty-page business plans are obsolete. Don't  
bother. Give the investor a two-page summary and a ten slide 
PowerPoint presentation,'' said Steven Bengston, who sorts through 
hundreds of proposals each year at PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Eric Witte of Harrisburg, Penn., said he came to ``make the  
transition from pipe-dreaming to pioneering. ... I have a fire in 
my belly and I'm getting old. I have a sense of urgency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his ideas is to provide Internet users an incentive --  
frequent flyer miles, bonus shopping points, even cash -- to pay 
their bills online. ``At this point the online bill providers have 
the audacity to charge the customers. That's the wrong way to do 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he spoke, the owner of a small online bill provider  
company approached, gave him his card and suggested they consider 
working together. 
</P>
<P>
	Shillenger, who met his three partners at a Yale class called  
``How To Start A High Tech Company,'' said they have already 
received close to $500,000 in investments. They hope to bring in 
much more this summer when they seek a round of venture capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're willing to forgo the big corporate salaries because  
there's something really exciting about entrepreneurship,'' said 
Shillinger. ``We just want to jump right on to that Internet 
wave.''

<HEADLINE> UConn Leaves Imprint on NCAA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A season without many memorable  
moments ended with one that will be tough to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	The final possessions of Connecticut's victory over Duke on  
Monday night in the national championship game was basketball at 
its best. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best offensive players in the game going against one  
of the defensive players. When Trajan Langdon of Duke tried to 
break down Connecticut's Ricky Moore, Moore came up with a 
defensive gem. 
</P>
<P>
	He forced Langdon into a walk with 5.4 seconds left and then  
helped in a three-man pinch that again forced Langdon into a 
turnover, this one just before the buzzer of the Huskies' 77-74 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut became the first team since Texas Western in 1966 to  
win it all in its first Final Four appearance. The victory wrapped 
up the 1990s for the Huskies, a decade that saw a lot of success 
but three tough losses in regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
	It allowed Jim Calhoun to join the list of national champion  
coaches in his 27th season, the last 13 at UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no better a coach than I was three weeks ago or no  
worse,'' he said minutes after being on a ladder, cutting down a 
net and savoring a moment. ``All I had to do was be true to my kids 
and coach the best I could and that's what I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the Final Four it was hard to find someone who didn't  
think Duke was clearly the best team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils became just the third team to win 37 games in a  
season, but the loss Monday night left Duke's Mike Krzyzewski one 
win shy of his third national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time being sad,'' said Krzyzewski, who will  
undergo hip replacement surgery next week. ``I don't coach for 
winning, I coach for relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's 64-team showcase was unable to match last year's  
tournament, which was won by Kentucky and produced one of the most 
exciting in years. But there were new names and faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga showed ``mid-major'' can be a deceiving term as the  
Bulldogs gave Connecticut a scare in the regional final. Wally 
Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and Harold Arceneaux of Weber State 
were right at home in the national spotlight. Ohio State, whose 
turnaround led all the way to the Final Four, was the feel-good 
story of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's run at four straight Final Fours and a second  
consecutive national title ended in the regional final with a loss 
to Michigan State. The Spartans joined Duke and Connecticut as top 
seeds in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some great games during the season -- Cincinnati's win  
over Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout, Duke's overtime win over 
St. John's and Miami's victory at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best was the last.  
</P>
<P>
	The closest championship game of the '90s will go down as one of  
the best ever. And there were plenty of excellent plays to back 
that opinion whether it was the stellar offense of Connecticut's 
Richard Hamilton and Langdon or the gritty defense of Moore and 
Duke's Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great game; it was a terrific game,'' Krzyzewski  
said. ``I've been fortunate to have been in a bunch of terrific 
games. We've won some and there's some we lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was more definitive.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the greatest basketball games I have ever been  
involved in,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Another Twist on Irish Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- This isn't your grandfather's ``Danny  
Boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chieftains' new album, Canadian singer Diana Krall gives  
the old Irish ballad a quiet, throaty, unembellished turn, nothing 
like what you might hear from a tenor in a shamrock tie. Backed by 
a guitar and accented by a gospel choir and an ancient set of Irish 
pipes, she has refreshed the song while staying true to its deep 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	Which seems to be what the Irish band -- still trying new things  
after 20-plus years of popularity -- had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	For the album ``Tears of Stone,'' Chieftains' founder and  
arranger Paddy Moloney set out to find prominent female singers 
from around the world whose voices might complement -- and challenge 
-- the group's famously traditional Irish instruments and 
music-making. Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, Natalie Merchant, Sinead 
O'Connor, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Joan Osborne each has a song. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chieftains have collaborated with well-known singers before,  
including Sting and the Rolling Stones on their biggest seller, 
``The Long Black Veil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was fascinated by the blend of the female voice and  
these traditional instruments,'' Moloney, 59, said in an interview. 
``It always worked better for me for a woman to sing with the 
Chieftains rather than a man. So what I wanted to do was go out 
there and invite in some of the great female singers from other 
types of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chieftains' popularity exploded in 1975, long before the  
recent renaissance in Irish music, plays and movies, with their 
soundtrack for Stanley Kubrick's ``Barry Lyndon.'' They have been 
performing for 36 years and touring the world for 25, which makes 
for a lot of contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you have to meet everybody from anybody who ever  
was born in Ireland,'' Moloney said. ``But you get to know other 
musicians, too. Festivals are grand and we were just at the Grammys 
(winning their sixth, for 'The Long Journey Home') and you see 
everybody. Everybody we asked to collaborate wanted to help, though 
it took a year and a half to get Joni Mitchell into the studio. 
Some of these ladies, like Sinead, are our old friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moloney said he had to talk Bonnie Rait into singing the  
traditional Irish love song ``A Stor Mo Chroi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She came to Dublin on a Monday and we went out and had a party  
and talked about the song that night. The following day she was in 
the studio and we only took a couple of hours. She had a tear in 
her eye with the last line and we had such a good time she stayed 
until Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Danny Boy'' wasn't in Moloney's plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I swore I would never record ``Danny Boy'' because it's been  
done to death. But when I approached Diana Krall, she said her 
mother was Irish and she always wanted her to sing that song and 
would I please consider it. So I said, 'Why not, with a voice like 
that and a jazz approach, which I was really after. ... She just 
went in with that soulful voice, as if she was at home, singing in 
her own parlor at a party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chieftains didn't do ``Danny Boy'' at a pre-St. Patrick's  
Day concert at West Point, though the audience of green-sweatered 
suburbanites likely would have preferred it to the Japanese- and 
Spanish-influenced fare that flavored the concert. Still, most of 
the program was rousing Irish music and Moloney bristles at 
suggestions that the band had veered away from tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are great classic Irish songs that go back hundreds of  
years and I've treated them that way in the musical arrangements 
and in some cases compositions. The only difference is we have big 
stars coming in from different countries and sitting in and 
performing with us. So it couldn't be any more traditional.''

<HEADLINE> Bird Hits Model Fabio in Nose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A bird has upstaged supermodel Fabio.  
</P>
<P>
	Fabio was at the Busch Gardens theme park Tuesday to help show  
off the Apollo's Chariot roller coaster. The park had promoted the 
event as ``Modern-Day `Adonis' vs. Ancient-Day `Sun God.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Early into the ride, however, a bird slammed into Fabio's face,  
cutting his nose and sending blood streaking down his chin and 
cheeks. Several women sitting near him portraying goddesses were 
splattered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabio was treated for a one-inch cut on the bridge of his nose  
and released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine, no serious injuries,'' park spokeswoman Deborah  
DeMarco said. ``I don't know about the bird's plight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``We're very sorry that it happened. It was an act of  
nature.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ambassador: Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq will most likely reject any proposal  
for renewed U.N. relations that doesn't include an end to the 
punishing sanctions imposed during the Persian Gulf War, Iraq's 
U.N. ambassador said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Saeed Hasan gave his preliminary response to  
recommendations this week by three technical panels, which met for 
a month to assess the status of Iraq's disarmament, humanitarian 
situation and reparations to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasan stressed that he hadn't read the panel's recommendations  
and hadn't received any official reaction from Baghdad. But he said 
reports of the proposals indicated ``no real solutions'' to the 
problems Iraqis face after more than eight years of sanctions which 
have crippled Iraq's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is clear,'' Hasan said in an interview.  
``Anything short of lifting sanctions, I don't think there is a way 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the humanitarian panel didn't recommend lifting the oil  
embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq had 
demanded an end to the embargo and France had suggested lifting it 
as a way to persuade Baghdad to allow U.N. oversight of its weapons 
programs resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the panel suggested a series of improvements to the  
U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Iraq sell limited amounts of 
oil to buy food and medicine for its people. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Iraq currently cannot meet the $5.2 billion limit due to  
low oil prices and production limits, the report suggests the 
council consider authorizing foreign investment to improve 
Baghdad's export abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil-for-food program, ``is not working and it won't work,''  
even with the improvements, Hasan said. ``It really destroyed the 
Iraqi economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel looking into the status of Iraq's weapons programs  
said there were still disarmament-related questions -- but said 
answers could be found through a system of monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether Baghdad could live with monitors taking over  
the more confrontational disarmament-related work of U.N. weapons 
inspectors, Hasan replied: ``Sanctions lifting is something Iraq 
might live with, not transferring certain disarmament issues to 
monitoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think all disarmament requirements have been achieved,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council is still badly divided over the December  
airstrikes which halted inspections. While discussions are expected 
to start next week, no decisions are expected for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of meat there to discuss,'' Britain's U.N.  
Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Wednesday. ``But remember that 
the politics of this has got to click in due course, and we'll see 
how the council plays out.''

<HEADLINE> Francis Leaves Maryland for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Steve Francis ended his one-year career  
at the University of Maryland, announcing he will make himself 
available for the NBA draft, where he is expected to be one of the 
top picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is time to take the next step and take on a new  
challenge,'' the junior said Wednesday. ``It's time to start a new 
and exciting chapter in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who helped lead the Terrapins to a school-record 28  
victories, made the announcement just two days after the NCAA 
championship game, to which many thought Francis would lead the 
Terrapins, either this year or next. The Terrapins fell short this 
season, going only as far as the Sweet 16 before losing to St. 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Francis averaged 17 points for a team ranked as  
high as No. 2 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really proud of Steve,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams  
said. ``I don't have any doubt he's ready to play in the NBA. It is 
obvious Steve will be a very high lottery pick. Very few people in 
their lifetime get an opportunity like Steve has in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he will finish his degree, adding that money was  
not the overriding factor in his decision to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just something that I weighed in,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis flirted with the idea of entering the NBA draft last  
season after a stellar junior college career at San Jacinto, Texas, 
and Allegany in Maryland. Francis, who grew up in Takoma Park, a 
few miles from the Maryland campus, opted to play for the Terrapins 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only year of Division I basketball, he led the Terrapins  
(28-6) in scoring (17.2) and 3-point shooting (.388) and led the 
Atlantic Coast Conference in steals (2.8). He was named first-team 
All-ACC in addition to being named second-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Three senior Maryland starters this season -- Laron Profit,  
Obinna Ekezie and Terrell Stokes -- won't return next year, leaving 
forward Terence Morris the only returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis joins forward Albert White of Missouri in leaving  
college early. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who might enter the NBA draft are: Duke's William Avery  
and Elton Brand, the latter the national player of the year; Khalid 
El-Amin and Richard Hamilton of national champion Connecticut; 
Lamar Odom of Rhode Island; Ron Artest of St. John's; Baron Davis 
of UCLA; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; Chris Porter of Auburn; and 
Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Top NBA prospects who have said they will return next season  
include junior point guards Ed Cota of North Carolina and Scoonie 
Penn of Ohio State, and DePaul freshman Quintin Richardson.

<HEADLINE>  Marine's Ex-Commander Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine aviator's former commander  
said Wednesday he lost trust in the man after learning he lied 
about using a video camera before his jet hit a ski gondola cable, 
killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came during the sentencing phase of a  
court-martial for Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to charges of obstruction of  
justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for destroying a 
videotape he shot during the tragic flight Feb. 3, 1998, over 
Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Col. Richard Muegge, who was relieved of command after  
the accident, said Schweitzer told him there was a video camera 
aboard the EA-6B Prowler, but said he didn't use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a series of very bad mistakes and errors in  
judgment,'' Muegge said. ``Something like that hurts the special 
trust and confidence you need in someone you may go to war with. 
... A Marine officer basically lives or dies by his integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was the Prowler's navigator when it clipped a ski  
gondola cable in an Italian mountain valley. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified previously that he used the camera three times to  
tape parts of the flight and once aimed the camera at his face and 
smiled. He said he and the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of 
Mission Viejo, Calif., agreed to switch the tape for a blank one so 
investigators would not get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces up to 10 years in prison and dismissal from the  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be given either the sentence reached in his plea  
agreement, which has not been disclosed, or that directed by the 
jury, whichever is more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	During opening statements, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce told the  
nine-member military jury that Schweitzer ``is not worthy of the 
trust necessary for an officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Schweitzer's lawyer said the Marine made a bad decision  
following a tragic accident, and a defense witness testified that 
Schweitzer was more upset than the other three Prowler crewmen when 
they learned of the gondola deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had his head in his hands; he was immediately tearful,''  
said Maj. Tracy Dillinger, an Air Force flight psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Schweitzer asked if children were among the victims and  
left the room to pray. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury earlier this month acquitted Ashby of manslaughter  
charges. The same charges later were dismissed against Schweitzer. 
Ashby still faces obstruction of justice charges for his role with 
the videotape and is scheduled to stand trial in April.

<HEADLINE> Students Injured in Tour Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIPTON, Calif. (AP) -- A bus loaded with fifth-graders returning  
from a trip to Sea World collided with a truck carrying 
strawberries, injuring 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``an absolute miracle'' that no one was killed, Sgt. Paul  
Schroeder of the California Highway Patrol said after Tuesday 
night's accident along a remote stretch of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, operated by KT Bus Services of Las Vegas, was one of  
two from the David Cox Elementary School in Henderson, Nev., that 
was returning from a trip to San Diego, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus collided with the back end of the rig, hurling both  
vehicles down a 40-foot embankment. The bus landed upright against 
the truck's undercarriage, scattering sleeping bags and duffle bags 
across the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers took almost an hour to reach the crash scene  
about 65 miles south of Las Vegas, said Dennis West of the San 
Bernardino County Fire Department. ``This is out there in the 
middle of nowhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver was reported in critical condition. Six people  
had moderate injuries and 33 children suffered minor injuries, West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint Rose Dominican Hospital treated 27 children and six  
adults. ``Most just have bumps and bruises,'' said Rod Davis, 
hospital president. ``They've been assessed, checked out and 
released.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 77 students and 12 chaperones were on the two buses.  
</P>
<P>
	The highway was closed for about two hours in both directions  
after the crash, and the northbound lane was shut throughout the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said investigators had not determined the cause of the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why -- if it was fatigue or what -- it's way to  
early to tell,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Britain Make Davis Cup History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- The Davis Cup started in 1900 at the  
Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, with the United States sweeping 
Britain in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the Davis Cup celebrating its centenary, the two  
nations meet again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's kind of poetic for the United States and Britain  
to be playing in the 100th year of the Davis Cup,'' said Jim 
Courier, who will play singles for the United States when 
competition begins Friday. ``We'd like to have played the tie on 
our home soil, where the first tie was played, but it's going to be 
interesting to get on with the Brits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davis Cup tennis is as pure as it comes. It's like going back  
in time and it's like being part of the history of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British are back in the World Group. And although they have  
been struggling for nearly a decade, they now have two top players 
in Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	In their way are Courier and Todd Martin, both experienced Davis  
Cup players; doubles expert Alex O'Brien; and Jan-Martin Gambill, 
who has played only one previous match. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, the two biggest names in U.S.  
tennis, declined to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the series advances to the second round against  
Australia or Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the Americans will return to the Longwood Club for  
the next stage, either in round two or the relegation round. 
</P>
<P>
	For Henman and Rusedski, both trying to earn top-five rankings  
on the ATP Tour, there is the opportunity to restore some Davis Cup 
pride to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain last played in the World Group in 1992 and slipped down  
to the European Zone Two relegation round before climbing back up 
to the world's top 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain David Lloyd even complained that Britain, with two  
players in the world's top 11, should have been seeded in the World 
Group, which would have meant avoiding the United States in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The other seven matches are: Sweden vs. Slovak Republic, Germany  
vs. Russia, Zimbabwe vs. Australia, France vs. Netherlands, Spain 
vs. Brazil, Belgium vs. Czech Republic and Switzerland vs. Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Britain isn't as deep as the other 15 teams, Henman and  
Rusedski probably will play all the singles matches and also team 
in the doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	They rarely play as a doubles team but are ideally suited as a  
right-hander and left-hander. They won an indoor tournament in 
London in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Martin is hampered by a stomach muscle injury, all four  
of the Americans could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``My priority is to play two singles matches,'' Martin said.  
``To play three matches (including the doubles) would affect my 
chances of playing on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill boosted his chances of making the doubles pairing by  
reaching the final of the Lipton Championship last weekend, when he 
was partners with Boris Becker.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Drama: Abbott at the Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jim Abbott understands the fascination.  
</P>
<P>
	While he's busy developing new offspeed pitches to aid his  
comeback with the Milwaukee Brewers, the rest of the baseball world 
seems fixated on his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Come watch the Amazing Abbott face Randy Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm not going to make any brash predictions,'' said  
Abbott, who was born without a right hand. ``We'll see. I'm going 
to pick up a bat and work hard at it and hopefully I'll be able to 
bunt with success and I'll hopefully get to face the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Randy Johnson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't gotten to do that yet, but fans have flocked to watch  
him bat, probably not even noticing who the pitcher was. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who has never batted in a regular-season game, is  
1-for-4 this spring with a sacrifice bunt. His single off Seattle 
left-hander Butch Henry last month was his third career hit in 
exhibition play. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott bats from the left side, swinging open-handed. He  
balances the bat with the wrist area of his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accustomed to the scrutiny.  
</P>
<P>
	``A long, long time ago I reconciled how my playing may be  
viewed or focused on,'' Abbott said. ``And it's a good thing. I 
mean, I'm not going to sit here and rebel against that and say, 
`I'm not different, I'm the same as anybody else.' I am different. 
My playing is different, I mean, the facts are the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a lot of good has come from that, Abbott said, citing the  
child he met last week who had lost an arm and asked the pitcher to 
show him how he tied his shoe laces. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my going out and trying to hit a baseball provides an  
inspiration or an example for them, there's really very little harm 
that can come from that,'' Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Abbott said he's just like any one else, playing for  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a greedy feeling of wanting to accumulate more and more  
great experiences,'' he said. ``As I've gotten older I've learned. 
I try to do less for the eyes and expectations of others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, the 31-year-old Abbott had always played in  
the AL, which has designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get nervous when I'm up there, just because I don't feel as  
prepared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching at least is something I've done over and over and  
over again for years. Hitting, I get up there and I feel a little 
naked,'' he said. ``There's definitely some anxiety in that 
batter's box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nervousness is what stirred Abbott to try a comeback after  
sitting out 1997 following a 2-18 season with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt when I wasn't playing, I was comfortable. There was  
ease,'' Abbott said. ``But I missed that little turning of the 
stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Abbott had no idea if he could make it back to the  
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some part of me felt my ability had just run out,'' he said.  
``But I felt I was healthy enough and young enough ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, 5-0 in five late-season starts for the Chicago White Sox  
last season, signed a one-year deal with the Brewers for $600,000 
in January with a mutual option for 2000 at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers offered him the chance to pitch a lot of innings --  
and bat for the first time since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect from him no less than what I expect from any of out  
other pitchers,'' manager Phil Garner said. ``I expect him to get 
the bunts down. Now, it might be difficult because I'm sure teams 
are going to be aggressive'' and sprint their first and third 
basemen toward home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Abbott won't be able to ``slug-bunt,'' where the pitcher  
fakes a bunt by squaring around and then pulls back and takes a 
swing, catching the fielders off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd have to keep his left hand down by the handle of the bat,  
and if he squared and they saw that, they'd know he wasn't going to 
bunt,'' Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, when nobody's on base, Abbott will swing away.  
</P>
<P>
	Abbott also owns a triple off Rick Reuschel and a single against  
Mike Myers, who is now his teammate, in spring training 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Abbott said having to hit hasn't complicated his comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's been harder; it's been more enjoyable,'' said  
Abbott, who threw a no-hitter in 1993 while with the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time in the majors, even though you love it and  
everything, you're going to worry about what can I do to achieve 
financial security?'' Abbott said.

<HEADLINE> D'backs Get Yanks, Cards Relievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Looking for experienced relievers to back  
up their high-priced starting rotation, the Arizona Diamondbacks 
acquired Darren Holmes from the New York Yankees and John 
Frascatore from the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a major league bullpen,'' Arizona general manager  
Joe Garagiola Jr. said after the trades were made Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks considered relief pitching their biggest need  
in the days leading up to next week's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, they signed Greg Swindell, and they want  
Holmes, 32, and Frascatore, 29, to give them the experience and 
depth they need as setup pitchers for closer Gregg Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in a group of four or five that we were really  
actively talking about,'' Garagiola said, ``and I'm really happy 
these are the two we would come out of this with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also agreed to pay about $1 million of the $3.45  
million Holmes is owed on the remaining two years of his contract, 
according to a baseball official who spoke on the condition that he 
not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	New York received young pitcher Ben Ford and minor league  
catcher Izzy Molina. In exchange for Frascatore, the Cardinals got 
right-hander Clint Sodowsky, who is expected to be assigned to 
Triple-A Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade will save the Yankees $527,000 in luxury tax and  
reduce their major league-high payroll to about $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was 0-3 with New York last season with a 3.33 ERA. He  
signed with the Yankees after a successful five-year stint with 
Colorado, where he was 23-13 with 46 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came from an expansion team, so I know know what it's  
like,'' Holmes said today. ``It's going to be a very energized 
atomsphere out there. They got a new stadium and signed a lot of 
quality of players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was sidelined from Aug. 1 to Sept. 4 last season with a lower  
back injury, but came on strong after that, giving up one earned 
run in his last eight appearances, lowering his ERA from 4.05 to 
3.33. 
</P>
<P>
	``For part of the year, I didn't pitch like I was capable of  
doing,'' Holmes said. ``That's probably the most bitter part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who stands 6-foot-7 and is just 23 years old, returns to  
the organization that originally signed him as a 20th-round 
selection in the 1994 amateur draft. He was Arizona's ninth pick in 
the first round of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a move I guess you can say is somewhat risky,''  
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said in Tampa, Fla. ``I think 
Arizona gets better now because they get a guy who's going to help 
immediately. We made the move with an eye to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes gives the Diamondbacks a reliever with experience as a  
closer in case Olson falters or is injured. Olson, who had 30 saves 
in 34 tries in a comeback season last year, has been bothered by a 
sore forearm this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can set up. He can close if he has to. He's another veteran  
right-hander,'' Garagiola said of Holmes. ``We scouted him a lot 
this spring. We've been after him for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore became expendable to the Cardinals because of the  
offseason acquisitions of relievers Scott Radinsky and Ricky 
Bottalico. 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore was 3-4 last season in 69 appearances with a 4.14 ERA  
after going 5-2 with a 2.48 ERA for the Cardinals in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of moxie about him,'' Arizona manager Buck  
Showalter said. ``We think he'll fit right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sodowsky, 26, also a right-hander, was 3-6 in 45 games for the  
Diamondbacks last season with a 5.68 ERA. He appeared in five games 
for Arizona this spring before being optioned to Triple-A Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for the new relievers, the Diamondbacks placed  
right-handed reliever Aaron Small on waivers with the intention of 
giving him his unconditional release and optioned left-handed 
reliever Brian Shouse to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks' bullpen staff seems set with left-handers  
Swindell and Brian Anderson, along with right-handers Holmes, 
Frascatore and Olson, who drew praise for his pitching in Tuesday's 
exhibition loss to Seattle even though he gave up four runs and six 
hits in two-thirds of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the hits barely eluded infielders and two were fly balls  
that probably should have been caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Amaury Telemaco is another possibility for the bullpen, but he  
may start the season on the disabled list with tendinitis in his 
right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Braves Cut Bautista and Graffanino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Outfielder Danny Bautista and second  
baseman Tony Graffanino were put on unconditional release waivers 
today by the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were tough ones to cut,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``They  
can both play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the cuts, Cox said he would keep first baseman Randall  
Simon. The left-handed hitter will be used mainly as a pinch 
hitter. He's hitting .286 this spring and hit .256 with 13 homers 
and 70 RBIs last season at Triple A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Bautista hit .327 in 19 games this spring with seven RBIs.  
Bautista, with the Braves since 1996, hit .250 last season with the 
Braves with three home runs and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Graffanino hit .106 in 21 spring games. He, also has been with  
the Braves since 1996. Graffanino hit .211 last season with Atlanta 
with five homers and 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bautista gets $115,574 in termination pay instead of his  
$470,000 salary, and Graffanino gets $64,549 instead of $262,500.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Use Up Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of mobile telephone users in the  
United States rose 25 percent last year to 69.2 million people, 
according to the industry's most recent figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase -- the industry's largest one-year gain -- was driven  
by fierce competition that continues to drive down monthly charges, 
said Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association, which compiled the figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In many markets, people have a choice of six different mobile  
phone providers, Wheeler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 69.2 million customers, nearly 28 percent subscribed to  
the newer digital mobile phone service, which offers improved sound 
quality and more features. The rest of the customers subscribed to 
regular analog service. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of mobile phone customers surpassed the number of  
cable TV customers in the United States -- now at 67 million -- 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your father's car phone anymore,'' Wheeler said.  
``The wireless phone has changed in the way in which people use it. 
It is now a take-me-anywhere, use me to call anywhere, treat me as 
a local call kind of service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 55.3 million people used mobile phones in the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the increased competition, customers' average monthly  
bill decreased by 7.8 percent last year to $39.43 compared to 
$42.78 in 1997, according to the industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry revenues, meanwhile, rose 20 percent last year to $36.6  
billion, compared with $30.5 billion in 1997. That reflects 
customer growth and an increase in the amount of time people talk 
on their mobile phones, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenues include ``roaming'' fees that customers pay when  
using their phones outside core service areas.

<HEADLINE> IBM Pushes Web Privacy Disclosures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With $60 million earmarked for Internet ads, IBM  
will be twisting some arms to make Web sites more forthright about 
how they take notes on their visitors and what they do with that 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, $60 million amounts to a tiny fraction of the $2  
billion spent on Internet ads in 1998 and the $4 billion that some 
see being spent on Internet ads in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	And even as the second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, IBM's  
reach is limited, with its ads appearing on just 780 sites in a 
World Wide Web of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, most consumer advocates were encouraged by  
Wednesday's news that IBM plans to pull its ads from any Web site 
that doesn't state its policy on collecting and using information 
on Web users' interests, finances and spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the fierce debate over Internet privacy protection -- and  
whether the industry or the government should regulate it -- there 
was plenty of doubt about the impact and scope of IBM's new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, IBM won't be evaluating the substance of those  
policy statements, and that may not provide much more protection 
for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too easy to write a really bad privacy policy that  
contains a lot of apple-pie public relations statements,'' said 
Jason Catlett, the head of Junkbusters, a privacy group based in 
Green Brook, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	And unless Microsoft, the most prolific Web advertiser, follows  
suit, the initiative may not go very far. The software maker was 
silent on the topic Wednesday, declining to comment on IBM's move 
or its plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a constructive thing for IBM to have done, but it will  
only make a difference if IBM is the first of many who do same 
thing,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he expects a recent FTC survey to show that the number  
of sites with privacy statements has risen from 14 percent a year 
ago, Pitofsky added that ``It's not just a matter of percentages. 
You want to know the quality of the notice'' and whether people are 
given a clear opportunity to give permission for their information 
to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move was designed ``to help build consumer confidence in  
the use of the Internet as a medium for conducting business,'' said 
spokesman John Bukovinsky, noting that only 30 percent of the sites 
where the company now advertises post their privacy policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The action by IBM comes two weeks after the Better Business  
Bureau announced a program to bestow a seal of approval on Web 
sites with full disclosure. Trust-E, an industry-funded privacy 
organization, already offers a similar seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, say some observers, is that cryptic privacy  
statements and seals of approval may quickly become as commonplace 
-- and ignored -- as the fine print on contracts or those rambling 
notices from credit card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real boiler plate stuff really. You wonder how many  
people, once these policy disclosures are posted everywhere, will 
read them,'' said Cathy Taylor, editor Adweek's IQ publication 
covering online media. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, however, isn't looking to baby-sit consumers or  
make them pay better attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't replace action and the judgment of consumers,'' said  
the FTC's Pitofsky. ``It's generally accepted by a wide range of 
people concerned about these issues that if you give consumers 
notice and the opportunity to consent or not consent, that's 
adequate. Whether they exercise their right and withdraw consent, 
that's up to consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many consumer advocates are looking for the government to  
step in, insisting the industry will never offer the level of 
protection provided in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``European nations are more sensitive to this than we are,''  
said Roland Rust, a professor of marketing at Vanderbilt University 
in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	In some countries, ``companies can't send customer information  
across national boundaries. The United Sates is lagging in that 
area,'' he said. ``The average consumer on the street is just 
beginning to understand the degree to which companies accumulate 
information about them.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Begins Settlement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s top legal negotiators met  
with government lawyers for two hours behind closed doors but 
couldn't reach common ground in the first settlement talks since 
the Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust case last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no plans to meet again today, although neither side  
ruled out future talks, said a source close to the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations, described as cordial, were held Tuesday  
evening at the Justice Department, according to the person, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	During a status hearing on the trial today, U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson said he wants to resume the trial May 10 
for both sides' rebuttal cases. The trial was originally scheduled 
to resume in April after a six-week recess, but Jackson is occupied 
with a criminal case taking longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	If he's not done with the other case by May 10, Jackson said, he  
wants to resume Microsoft the first Monday after the criminal case 
goes to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	On the courthouse steps after the hearing, the government's lead  
attorney, David Boies, said both sides had agreed not to discuss 
any settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are going to be productive settlement discussions,  
they must not take place publicly,'' Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts agree an out-of-court settlement in the interim is  
unlikely because the sides remain far apart on central issues after 
nearly five months of a bitter courtroom fight. Wisconsin's 
attorney general, James Doyle, said before the talks that he didn't 
expect them to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	But the seriousness assigned to Tuesday's negotiations was  
evident in the roster of lawyers who participated. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was represented by Boies, its top litigator in  
the case; Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the 
Justice Department's antitrust division; attorneys general from 
Iowa and Connecticut; and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft dispatched William Neukom, its top in-house lawyer and  
former senior partner in the law firm of Bill Gates' father; 
Richard Urowsky, the architect of a controversial 1995 Microsoft 
settlement with the government; and legal consultant Charles Rule, 
who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division during the 
Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	For Microsoft, a courtroom loss years ago in another important  
legal fight remains a clear reminder of the perils of taking an 
unyielding position at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Microsoft chose to stand defiant and risk a  
verdict in a lawsuit that bears striking parallels to its current 
courtroom troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of illegally bundling a competitor's technology into its  
dominant computer operating system, Microsoft lost that case in 
1994 and was ordered by jurors to pay $120 million in damages to a 
small industry rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very tough and aggressive in everything they do,''  
said Morgan Chu, the lawyer who represented Stac Electronics Corp. 
in failed settlement talks with Microsoft in 1993 but beat the 
software maker in court a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true in the way they market products, the way they  
conduct business negotiations -- and it's true in the way they 
conduct litigation,'' Chu remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Stac had accused Microsoft of patent  
infringement for including its ``Stacker'' data-compression 
technology in its MS-DOS operating system, the precursor to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in the current antitrust trial alleges that  
Microsoft bundled Internet software with Windows to try to crush 
rival Netscape Communications Corp. It also holds that Microsoft 
introduced a ``polluted'' version of a new technology by Sun 
Microsystems Inc. to stem its widespread use. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in Microsoft's current case, Gates testified personally  
in 1993. But Stac lawyers used Gates' own e-mail to try to 
discredit him, much as the government has done over past weeks in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost the Stac case for $120 million and was ordered to  
recall versions of its software with the technology. It later 
settled with Stac for $83 million by promising not to appeal. The 
same jury also awarded Microsoft $13.6 million in a counterclaim.

<HEADLINE> WTO Delays Decision on Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization missed its latest  
deadline today in the search for a new chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting that lasted less than half an hour, the chairman of  
the general council of the world free trade body told the members 
there was no chance of reaching a consensus about either of the two 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, the Tanzanian trade ambassador, advised the  
countries to carry out some ``soul-searching'' over the Easter 
break and said they would meet again next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai deputy prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and former New  
Zealand premier Mike Moore are ``very, very close,'' said WTO 
spokesman Keith Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo told the delegates certain countries have said they will  
not throw their support behind one candidate or the other, making 
it impossible to build a consensus. The WTO always works by 
consensus and has never held a vote in its four-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has been deadlocked on a replacement for Renato  
Ruggiero since late last year when it first missed a December to 
make the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The position is seen as a key one as the WTO faces the  
challenges of global economic turmoil and also tries to mediate in 
the damaging banana trade war between the United States and the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though one candidate, Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan  
Abouyoub, has dropped out of the race, the organization has been 
unable to decide on a single choice. A third candidate, former 
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren, has insisted he will not drop 
out even though he enjoys little support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggiero has said he intends to leave at the end of April, and  
that he will not stay on under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The members now hope to make an official appointment at the  
WTO's scheduled general council meeting on April 14.

<HEADLINE> Church Loses Tax Status for Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court decision stripping a church of  
its tax-exempt status for running anti-Clinton ads may diminish 
political activity from the pulpit, activists on both sides of the 
issue said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's decision backed the Internal  
Revenue Service, which had revoked the tax-exempt status of the 
Church at Pierce Creek near Binghamton, N.Y., for running newspaper 
advertisements against Bill Clinton in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a church had lost its tax exemption for  
partisan political actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, which ran in USA Today and The Washington Times, warned  
``Christian Beware'' and stated: ``Bill Clinton is promoting 
policies that are in rebellion to God's laws.'' The ad sought 
donations to help pay for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of political activism by churches seized on the decision  
as providing more ammunition to challenge the tax-exempt status of 
religious institutions engaged in partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pastor who ran the ad warned of a chilling effect on the  
church's role to speak out on moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every time the church decides to say something about morals  
in the public arena, they have to stop and look over their shoulder 
to see what the IRS is going to say, they're no longer in control 
of their own words,'' said the Rev. Daniel Little, now pastor of 
Landmark Church in Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Mark Troobnick, a lawyer with the American Center for Law  
and Justice, a conservative legal organization that represented the 
church in court: ``There will be a hesitancy for churches to speak 
out concerning the moral stance of politicians in particular and 
campaigns generally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said  
he did not expect any resistance to distribute the group's voter 
guides in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate noted that none of the churches that have given out the  
guides in the past had lost tax-exempt status. He also said the 
coalition planned to distribute a record 70 million guides next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall outcome of this case is an exception to the rule.  
It will not be a deterrent to active churches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of Americans United for Separation of  
Church and State, which has challenged the Christian Coalition's 
voter guides, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is so clear that it is the death knell for  
church politicking in election campaigns,'' Barry Lynn said. ``Now 
people on the Religious Right and elsewhere no longer can claim 
that they're in court and about to win a case. They were in court 
and they have lost big time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church, which had sued to overturn the IRS decision, plans  
to appeal Tuesday's ruling.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Civil Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jenny Jones' talk show ``did everything  
but pull the trigger'' in the shooting death of a guest who had 
gone on the program to reveal his secret gay crush, an attorney 
suing the show for $50 million told a jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the victim, Scott Amedure, is suing the show, its  
distributor and its producers, claiming their ``ambush'' TV tactics 
drove Jonathan Schmitz to shoot Amedure days after the episode was 
taped in 1995. The show never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual, had been invited on  
the show to meet his secret admirer. That turned out to be Amedure, 
an acquaintance, who described his sexual fantasies involving 
Schmitz as the audience whooped and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for ``The Jenny Jones Show'' said in his opening  
statement Wednesday that his clients are not responsible because 
Schmitz knew that the secret admirer could be either a man or a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney James Feeney added that he has witnesses who will  
testify that Schmitz and Amedure had a sexual relationship after 
the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Schmitz was convicted of murder, but the conviction was  
overturned because of an error in jury selection. He is awaiting a 
retrial. His lawyers admitted he killed Amedure but contended the 
show humiliated Schmitz, who already was fighting alcoholism, 
depression and a thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure family attorney Geoffrey Fieger told the jury in his  
opening statement that the show ``did everything but pull the 
trigger and they must be held accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger also said the program failed to adequately look into  
Schmitz's background, specifically that he had been treated for 
manic depression and had attempted suicide four times. Fieger said 
that when Amedure revealed his crush, Schmitz heard the audience's 
laughter and ``was descending into madness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney said there was no reason to examine the mental health of  
a guest and that after the shooting, Schmitz never told police he 
felt he was tricked, deceived, or lied to about the show's topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not what Jonathan Schmitz said. That's not how he saw  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Feeney said he could ``present very extensive  
evidence'' of a sexual relationship between Amedure and Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger -- who successfully defended Dr. Jack Kevorkian in his  
assisted suicide trials and unsuccessfully ran for governor last 
year -- said those claims are irrelevant and can't be corroborated 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones herself is not being sued but is listed as a witness,  
and Feeney said she will probably testify Monday.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Glut Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as investors interpreted a government report 
as showing there will be no end soon to a supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, gasoline futures soared.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures tumbled in an expression of skepticism about a  
U.S. Agriculture Department report detailing spring planting 
intentions and current supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported farmers will plant 1.6 percent fewer  
acres of spring wheat other than durum, but analysts said recent 
beneficial weather -- timely rains and mild temperatures -- likely 
could cause farmers to change their minds about what they will 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if the spring wheat acreage declines, market  
participants are concerned about growing inventories in the face of 
weak world demand, particularly since the much-larger winter wheat 
crop is expected to be sizable. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA reported wheat remaining from last year's harvest  
jumped 24 percent to 1.445 billion bushels from 1.167 billion 
bushels at the same time last year. That's the largest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mild spring temperatures also are expected to help foster early  
corn planting, analysts said. That could negate the government's 
mildly supportive view that farmers will plant 2.5 percent fewer 
acres this year to corn, the first time since 1995 that acreage has 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn stockpiles, meantime, have risen 15 percent, to 5.696  
billion bushels. That was more than 100 million bushels above trade 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA also said soybean farmers will plant 73.11 million  
acres, or 1 percent fewer than last year's 73.94 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
	AgResource Co. analyst Dick Loewy said, however, that early  
planting intentions typically are revised upward. He expects final 
soybean plantings to edge closer to 75 million acres by June. 
Barring a weather disaster, that would lead to another record 
harvest at a time when world demand continues to lag far behind 
last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also face heavy pressure from expectations the  
quick pace of South American harvesting will lead to greater export 
competition, virtually shutting out the United States with cheaper 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery tumbled 13 1/4 cents to $2.90 3/4 a bushel;  
May corn fell 6 1/2 cents to $2.25 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 7 1/2 cents 
to $1.14 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 17 3/4 cents to $4.83 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline futures soared, briefly boosting crude above  
$17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after weekly 
inventory figures showed sharp declines in available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that  
unleaded gasoline stocks fell 5.43 million barrels last week, or 
2.5 percent, to 215.995 million barrels. The declines were nearly 
twice that of analysts expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices at the pump across the country have soared, in part  
because world oil producers agreed to take an additional 2.1 
million barrels daily off the market. But analysts say the bigger 
problem is refinery production troubles in California, one of the 
largest U.S. driving markets. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of those production problems are ending, the  
situation has boosted concern about spot shortages of gasoline 
going into the busy summer driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	The April gasoline contract, which expired Wednesday, rose 1.6  
cents to 54.14 cents a gallon; May crude fell 4 cent to $16.76 a 
barrel; April heating oil rose .30 cent to 44.68 cents a gallon; 
May natural gas fell 2.3 cents to $1.990 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Salute Lady Boilermakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Players and coaches of Purdue's Lady  
Boilermakers met on the court of Mackey Arena for one last time 
Wednesday night, capping a championship season by saying thanks to 
their fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 in San Jose, Calif., to capture its  
first-ever NCAA women's basketball title Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the team came onto the court single file, the near-capacity  
crowd erupted in cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	For senior Ukari Figgs, it was an emotional farewell after a  
four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an amazing moment,'' Figgs said, speaking from a  
podium surrounded with yellow roses and black and gold balloons. 
``I can't think of any better way to end a career than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs, Stephanie White-McCarty and Amy Shaffer are the three  
graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd again roared as White-McCarty hobbled to the podium,  
her left foot in a brace. She sprained her ankle during the final 
minutes of the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great four years,'' she said. ``I can't believe  
we're at the end of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she returned to her seat, she and Figgs hugged and the crowd  
cheered again. 
</P>
<P>
	Handing out team posters -- which read ``Purdue Women's  
Basketball, Unforgettable'' -- to fans entering the arena, elated 
Tabitha Roudebesh said winning the championship put Purdue on the 
map. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' Roudebesh said, sporting a Purdue championship  
T-shirt. ``It gives us another reason to be proud that we're from 
Purdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The student body's pride went a bit far after Sunday's victory,  
as about 2,000 students reveled on campus streets. West Lafayette 
police eventually had to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to show our support without burning couches,''  
Roudebesh said of Wednesday night's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Carolyn Peck said the team dreamed of the championship and  
made it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the first team to end Tennessee's winning streak,''  
she said. ``The first women's team to sell out Mackey Arena. Now we 
have brought Purdue the first national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck, who's leaving Purdue to become coach and general manager  
of the WNBA's Orlando Miracle expansion team, urged the crowd to 
continue supporting the women's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two freshman that know what it's like to get to the  
national championships,'' she said. ``Now don't leave them. You've 
got to stay with them through thick and through thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the rally ended, Figgs and White-McCarty approached the front  
of the stage, hoisted the NCAA trophy over their heads and slowly 
walked around the stage showing it to the screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the lights went out and ``We Are the Champions'' was  
played over the public address system as fireworks exploded 
overhead. As the song continued, the team gathered arm-in-arm, many 
of them holding bouquets of yellow roses. 
</P>
<P>
	The team filed off the stage, stopping to sign autographs and  
slap hands with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot more when you win something for people like  
that,'' Figgs said.

<HEADLINE> 'Melissa' Virus Losing Its Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The danger from the fast-moving e-mail virus  
known as Melissa has appeared to ebb as several diluted versions 
appeared on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers cautioned, however, that a threat still remains.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are malicious virus writers out there, but they're not  
using these techniques,'' said Dan Schrader, director of product 
marketing for Trend Micro Inc., an antivirus company in Cupertino, 
Calif. ``They will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on  
Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers to 
fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and 
swamping e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	While there have been no reports of permanent damage from  
Melissa, it disrupted the operations of thousands of companies and 
government agencies whose employees were temporarily unable to 
communicate by e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives to its victims disguised as an e-mail from a  
friend, with a note in the subject line saying that an important 
document is attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The attachment is a Microsoft Word document that lists Internet  
pornography sites. Once the user opens the attachment, the virus 
digs into the user's address book and sends infected documents to 
the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the variations that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name  
Melissa.A -- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil 
electronic filters that are designed to detect and delete the 
original message, Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another variant, ``Papa,'' appeared Monday afternoon. It  
attaches a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document which, when opened, 
sends out 60 e-mails, however Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent 
it from working. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our analysis we don't feel it's anywhere near the threat  
that Melissa is,'' said Steve Trilling, a director of research at 
Symantec, a maker of virus detection software. 
</P>
<P>
	A third virus, called ``Mad Cow Joke'' has also appeared,  
Schrader said, and works like Melissa, sending itself to 20 people 
in the victim's e-mail address book. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of all the variants is that virus writers will find  
them on the Internet, correct the bugs and distribute them further. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, an executive with a Cambridge, Mass.-based software  
company said he had found clues linking the virus to a 
still-unidentified writer using the computer handle ``VicodinES''. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, which makes  
operating systems and software tools, said he thinks the author 
distributed it using an account stolen from America Online 15 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago Smith revealed that the popular Microsoft Office  
software applications place a secret serial number in documents 
that can be used to identify a particular computer user. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith theorized that this ``digital fingerprint'' might be  
useful in finding the author of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith posted this theory on an Internet discussion group Friday  
and received an e-mail from a Stockholm University student, who 
pointed out similarities between the work of a known virus writer 
who used the computer name VicodinES and Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also discovered that in December 1997, the same America  
Online account that sent out Melissa had posted a similar virus. 
Smith found digital fingerprints linking the virus writer called 
VicodinES to that virus. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES also is the name of a narcotic painkiller made by  
Knoll Laboratories. At company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.J., 
spokeswoman Linda Mayer said Tuesday that all she knows about 
Melissa is what she's read in newspapers.

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 6 Percent Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy finished 1998 with an explosion of  
growth but it wasn't enough to prevent the decade's first drop in 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross domestic product surged at a seasonally adjusted 6  
percent annual rate during the last three months of the year, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	That was down only slightly from the department's earlier  
estimate of 6.1 percent and was enough, with earlier quarters' 
performance, to increase the sum of all goods and services produced 
within U.S. borders by a robust 3.9 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the department's first estimate of after-tax corporate  
profits showed a drop at a 1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, 
marking the third quarterly decline of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all of 1998, profits slipped 2.2 percent, the first drop  
since 1989, when profits fell 4.8 percent in a precursor to the 
1990-91 recession. The rare decline stood in marked contrast to 
gains ranging from 14 percent to 22 percent in the middle years of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy saw a shallow profits recession last year despite  
the booming growth and very likely will recover from that in 
1999,'' said economist Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in 
New York. ``But the heyday of the corporate profits boom is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits are being pinched by the combination of increasing labor  
costs and the inability of manufacturing firms to raise prices in 
the face of stiff price competition from imports produced in 
countries with devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	A price index tied to the GDP rose just 1 percent in 1998. There  
hasn't been a rate that low since 1959, also 1 percent, and there 
hasn't been one lower since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders for  
factory goods fell 2.5 percent in February, the most in nearly four 
years. A 30.6 percent drop in aircraft orders and a 38.2 percent 
plunge for military goods led the decline, but they were joined by 
smaller drops for industrial machinery and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Wall Street has remained undaunted. The Dow Jones  
average of industrial stocks broke the 10,000 barrier for the first 
time on Monday before settling back somewhat on Tuesday. It was up 
44 points to 9,957 in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor costs are increasing because the long expansion, which  
began its ninth year in March, reduced the unemployment rate to a 
29-year low last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Plentiful jobs and surging stock prices have been the principal  
fuel of the growth in consumer spending, which represents about 
two-thirds of economic activity. It rose at a 5 percent seasonally 
adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter and 4.9 percent for all 
of 1998, the most in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wages, consumers spent some of their stock gains  
and tapped their home equity in a wave of refinancing last year 
after mortgage rates fell to three-decade lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Those, in turn, produced a big drop in the nation's savings rate  
-- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- from 2.1 percent in 
1997 to just 0.5 percent in 1998, the lowest since 1933. In fact, 
the rate was zero during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contributing to economic growth were business investment in  
computers and other new equipment, up 16.5 percent last year, and 
housing construction, up 10.4 percent, the most since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas economic turmoil, however, held U.S. exports to only a  
1.5 percent increase, the weakest in 15 years, while imports shot 
up 10.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That hurt export-dependent industries, particularly the food  
industry, which suffered a sharp reduction in profits. Other 
sectors with profit declines include fabricated metal products, 
petroleum and coal, communications and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Black Widow Remote Control Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CERRITOS, Calif. (AP) -- The manufacturer and distributor of a  
remote-control car starter recalled the product after reports it 
caused doors to randomly lock and engines to run after the driver 
has left the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerritos-based distributor David Levy Co. said the problems were  
relegated to less than 1 percent of the thousands of units sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the problems we've discovered are due to battery  
voltage in cold weather,'' said company president David Levy. ``The 
weather causes a voltage drain and the main processor on the 
circuit board reacts to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said customers have several options.  
</P>
<P>
	``They can return it to the place where they bought it for a  
refund or a new main processor that we've supplied,'' he said. 
``Most consumers who have had problems already have returned the 
units, but a majority haven't had problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to manufacturer Precision Engineering Industries Inc., in  
North Hollywood was answered by a recording that said the offices 
were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics and  
appliance store, announced Wednesday it would stop selling and 
installing the Black Widow RAS-200 remote control car starter.

<HEADLINE> Study: DNA Conducts Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Strands of DNA might someday be used as wires in computer chips  
and transistors, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans-Werner Fink and Christian Schoenenberger of the University  
of Basel in Switzerland found that DNA conducts electricity as well 
as a good semiconductor. A semiconductor carries electricity better 
than an insulator but not as well as a conductor like copper. 
</P>
<P>
	If DNA strands could be made with a switch to turn the current  
flowing through them on and off, they could be used to build 
extremely tiny electrical devices, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fink said he knows of no metallic wires that can be made as  
small or as regular as DNA strands. A strand is 2 billionths of a 
meter thick, or one-forty-four-thousandths of the diameter of a 
medium-size human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA strands might even be able to wire themselves together.  
</P>
<P>
	Molecules at the end of DNA strands will link themselves to  
certain other molecules, so it might be possible to create a wiring 
grid by laying down these target molecules as terminals and letting 
the DNA strands attach themselves, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	They reported their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Schuster, a chemistry professor at the Georgia Institute of  
Technology, said he suspects electrons flow through DNA much 
differently than in a wire. And whether the research will lead to a 
practical use of DNA as wiring is ``a wide-open question.''

<HEADLINE> Inmate Charged With Raping Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRACKVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- An inmate has been charged with raping a  
9-year-old girl numerous times in the prison's visiting room over 
the past year, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child said inmate John Mims, 34, sexually assaulted her  
during most of her 16 visits to Schuylkill County Prison since 
April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims knew when the visiting room guard was occupied and used  
that opportunity to assault the child, Trooper Jeffrey Szczecina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims' wife accompanied the child, a relative of hers, on each  
visit from April 4, 1998, to January 23, 1999, and knew her husband 
was abusing the girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims was arrested Friday at the prison and was arraigned on  
felony counts of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife was arrested at her home and charged with felony counts  
of criminal conspiracy to commit rape and endangering the welfare 
of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims has been incarcerated at the prison since Jan. 6, 1998,  
after he violated parole related to a 1993 convenience store 
robbery, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Probe Widens in N.M. Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- A woman accused in a bizarre  
kidnap-sexual torture case told an acquaintance she joined her 
boyfriend in the tortures for the adrenalin rush. 
</P>
<P>
	John Branaugh also said Cindy Lea Hendy told him four to six  
people had been killed, mutilated and dumped in Elephant Butte 
Lake, 150 miles south of Albuquerque -- and that more bodies were 
buried in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no indication from police that bodies have been  
found, but authorities have not ruled out the possibility of 
homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very dark, very disturbing case for everyone  
involved,'' state Public Safety Secretary Darren White said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said more than 100 investigators would follow leads  
across at least three states in a case White described as ``so 
vile'' that he feared victims may not wish to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said: ``We believe the nightmare is behind bars.''  
</P>
<P>
	David Parker Ray, 59, and Ms. Hendy, 39, have been charged with  
25 counts, including kidnapping, aggravated battery and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began to unfold when an Albuquerque woman escaped from  
the home March 22 wearing only a padlocked metal collar attached to 
a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	She told authorities she had been kidnapped and tortured over  
three days, finally breaking free while Ray was away. Ms. Hendy hit 
her with a lamp, and she lashed back with an ice pick, according to 
an affidavit filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos found at the house include a picture of her, restrained  
and stretched with ``torture instruments,'' investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	After her escape, a woman from nearby Truth or Consequences came  
forward with a similar story. She said she entered the couple's 
house last month looking for cake mix, and was bound to a table, 
molested with a sexual device, jolted with electrodes attached to 
her breasts and forced to perform oral sex on Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she persuaded her captors, whom she apparently knew, to  
release her Feb. 21 along a highway. Charges in her case were 
brought Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Costales, Ray's attorney, has said his client is  
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Branaugh said the couple kept torture devices in a wood and  
glass case they called ``the toy box,'' and that Ms. Hendy told him 
she participated for the ``adrenalin rush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Branaugh said he initially didn't believe Ms. Hendy because she  
made the remarks while drunk. He said he told police after seeing a 
television report about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hendy, who has three children in the Seattle area, moved to  
New Mexico in 1997 to avoid arrest, her son told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still shocked. I can't really believe it. She ain't the  
person who would do this kind of thing,'' said Shane Larson, 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hendy was a suspect in a Seattle-area equipment theft in  
1995, and reportedly had been charged with forgery, drug possession 
and posession of stolen property since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have examined the dusty half-acre lot around Ray's  
double-wide trailer home for several days, and the search for 
victims and witnesses now covers Arizona, Texas and northern 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone fragments found in Ray's yard were not human, police said.  
They said they had no immediate plans to dig in Ray's yard or drag 
nearby Elephant Butte Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Elephant Butte is a sleepy town in the shadow of the Sierra  
Caballo mountains, heavily reliant on lake-based tourism. The 
influx of national media and authorities has overwhelmed the 2,500 
residents in a community with one stoplight, a few shops and 
trailers along dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel violated,'' Mayor Bob Barnes said at a town meeting  
Tuesday night. ``Things have just crashed in on us.''

<HEADLINE> Off-Duty LA Cops In Softball Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Off-duty police officers were clubbed with  
baseball bats and one pulled out a gun during a bench-clearing 
brawl after an umpire changed a call from ``safe'' to ``out'' 
during a coed softball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Three off-duty LAPD officers were attacked and one officer  
pulled a gun in self-defense, yelling ``Freeze! LAPD!'' to the 
attackers, police Cmdr. David Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One cop was down getting thumped and one of the officers  
pulled a gun,'' Kalish said. ``The officers are victims. It's being 
investigated as a criminal matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting erupted Monday night in suburban Granada Hills  
after the referee's call. 
</P>
<P>
	The game involved members of the Quakes, which includes at least  
four LAPD officers, and the Aztecs, made up of park league players.

<HEADLINE> Driver in Van Crash Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- The driver accused of vehicular homicide  
in a van crash that killed seven young magazine sales people cried 
as the charges were read in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Holmes, 20, stood mute when asked for a plea. The court  
entered innocent pleas on his behalf before holding him on $47,500 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Holmes, of Clinton, Iowa, was driving a van with 13  
other young people selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door when 
it overturned on Interstate 90, spilling bodies onto the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people died and five were seriously injured. Two remained  
in critical condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened as Holmes tried to switch seats with a  
passenger when he saw a police officer preparing to pull him over 
for speeding, authorities said. His driving license was not valid 
in Wisconsin because of a string of traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The occupants of the van, who ranged in age from 15 to 25, had  
been selling magazines for YES, an affiliate of Subscriptions Plus 
of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin labor officials have cited Subscriptions Plus for a  
child labor violation involving a 15-year-old Madison girl injured 
in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Labor officials have also cited the company for  
allegedly not having workers' compensation coverage for 123 
administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscriptions Plus has denied wrongdoing in both cases.

<HEADLINE> Reagan's Grandson Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former President Reagan's grandson, arrested  
for allegedly trying to break into a car, has pleaded no contest to 
one count of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Reagan, 20, faces up to three years in state prison,  
prosecutor Lea Purwin D'Agostino said Tuesday. He also faces 
prosecution on four other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan and a friend, Christopher Lopez, were arrested in  
November by police who said the pair tried to enter parked vehicles 
by pulling on the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had a briefcase, cellular phone, pager, clothing and  
money stolen from a nearby car at the time of their arrest, 
prosecutor John Spillane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, the son of talk show host Michael Reagan, was charged  
with two counts of auto burglary, one count of grand theft and one 
count of petty theft, Spillane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's grandson had pleaded innocent to auto burglary  
and grand theft in January. Sentencing was set for May 4.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Use Up Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of mobile telephone users in the  
United States rose 25 percent last year to 69.2 million people, 
according to the industry's most recent figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase -- the industry's largest one-year gain -- was driven  
by fierce competition that continues to drive down monthly charges, 
said Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association, which compiled the figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In many markets, people have a choice of six different mobile  
phone providers, Wheeler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 69.2 million customers, nearly 28 percent subscribed to  
the newer digital mobile phone service, which offers improved sound 
quality and more features. The rest of the customers subscribed to 
regular analog service. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of mobile phone customers surpassed the number of  
cable TV customers in the United States -- now at 67 million -- 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your father's car phone anymore,'' Wheeler said.  
``The wireless phone has changed in the way in which people use it. 
It is now a take-me-anywhere, use me to call anywhere, treat me as 
a local call kind of service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 55.3 million people used mobile phones in the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the increased competition, customers' average monthly  
bill decreased by 7.8 percent last year to $39.43 compared to 
$42.78 in 1997, according to the industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry revenues, meanwhile, rose 20 percent last year to $36.6  
billion, compared with $30.5 billion in 1997. That reflects 
customer growth and an increase in the amount of time people talk 
on their mobile phones, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenues include ``roaming'' fees that customers pay when  
using their phones outside core service areas.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Thursday morning on  
selling by overseas funds as Japanese stocks rebounded on continued 
buying from foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.84 yen at midday, down 1.14 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 118.97 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 265.48 points, or 1.68 percent,  
to close the morning session at 16,102.07. On Wednesday, the 
average lost 22.53 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved lower against the yen in  
thin trading on selling by overseas funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 128.00 yen, down from 128.59  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices advanced amid expectations for  
active buying by both foreign and domestic institutional investors 
in the new Japanese fiscal year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continued buying from foreign investors is supporting the  
market,'' said Harushige Kobayashi of Meiko National Securities Co. 
``But the market may remain range-bound around current levels 
before testing the further upside in the middle of April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors also welcome recent news of drastic  
corporate restructuring by major manufactures. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Mitsubishi Electric soared after the company announced  
plans Wednesday to cut 10 percent of its global work force in an 
effort to erase growing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 24.12 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,291.34. 
The TOPIX had fallen 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous

	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.730

<HEADLINE> Swiss WWII Task Force Disbanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss government announced  
Wednesday it was disbanding a special crisis task force looking 
into the country's role in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The controversy has been settled,'' a government statement  
said, adding the task force would be broken up immediately. The 
group was set up in October 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	It was designed to give the official government response and  
coordinate action over claims that neutral Switzerland acted as the 
banker for the Nazis and that millions of dollars deposited in 
Swiss bank accounts by Jewish holocaust victims were never 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, agreed  
to pay out $1.25 billion in settlement of the claims from Jewish 
groups for money left in accounts at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement between the Swiss banks and the World Jewish  
Congress together with the class-action plaintiffs has finalized 
all financial claims on Switzerland,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Foreign Affairs Department said any work left  
over from the task force would be handled within the department.

	WORK LIKE YOUR DOG: Man's best friend has a better time than the  
typical American worker, according to author Matt Weinstein. His 
book about having more fun at work is called ``Work Like Your 
Dog.'' Weinstein says dogs approach their work -- being our pets -- 
with dedication, loyalty and sensitivity, as well as joy, 
enthusiasm and a willingness to see work as play. So, he says, take 
a cue from the family pooch and bring a playful attitude to the 
job; it will go a long way toward making work more interesting and 
rewarding. Weinstein has some advice for managers: Do not repress 
the natural urge to play. Encourage your staff to take breaks 
during the day to have a little fun. Order in pizza once a week.

swing. And be sure to dress right -- assume that the golf club 
expects players to wear slacks, and bring a sport jacket in case 
one is required to enter the club lounge.

	WARNING SIGNS: Are your days at your current job numbered? Are  
you about to become a downsizing casualty? Andrew DuBrin, a 
management professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, says 
employers often give off signals that can tell a staffer that he or 
she is losing favor at work or is on the way out -- for example, if 
employees suddenly find themselves out of the loop when it comes to 
meetings and important memos or e-mail. Another sign is when plum 
assignments are suddenly being given to other people. If your memos 
and phone calls to important managers are not being returned, 
that's also an indication. And a noncommittal or icy response when 
you do get through on the phone is a tip-off, too.

<HEADLINE> Hal's Pal Wins Berkeley Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- Hal's Pal returned with a flourish from a  
six-month layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old, showing no signs of the foot problems that  
sidelined him, outdueled Wild Wonder in the stretch for a 
half-length victory in Wednesday's 48th running of the Berkeley 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first race since last October for Hal's Pal, who  
earned a $75,000 first prize to boost career earnings to $526,428. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had problems with his feet so we took him out of  
training for a while,'' trainer Ben Cecil said. ``It gave him a 
chance to put his feet down and put on some weight. And he seems to 
have thrived since then. I knew this horse was a lot better than 
people have given him credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil said Hal's Pal, racking up his seventh win in 27 career  
starts, actually cracked a front hoof again two days before he was 
scheduled to be shipped to northern California from Hollywood Park 
near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran today in a three-quarters shoe. It was a little bit of  
a worry but my blacksmith got it straightened out and he was 
fine,'' Cecil said. 
</P>
<P>
	The race set up nicely for Hal's Pal's closing style with Wild  
Wonder and odds-on favorite Mud Route fighting for the lead for 
much of the race. Hal's Pal charged up to challenge turning for 
home and wore down Wild Wonder, who lost for the first time in five 
starts at Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, with jockey Brice Blanc, covered the mile in 1:34.96  
and returned $14.20, $5.20 and $3.60. Wild Wonder paid $4.20 and 
$3.20 and Worldly Ways returned 5.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavily favored Mud Route faded to last in the seven-horse field  
after forcing the pace.

<HEADLINE> Feds Expect To Meet Y2K Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly all federal government agencies have  
fixed and tested their ``mission-critical'' computer systems and 
should be ready to accurately process data come Jan. 1, 2000, 
Clinton administration officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion reported that 92  
percent of the government's 24 largest agencies are Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	``These systems have gone through the full stages of not only  
analysis and assessment, but remediation, testing and 
implementation,'' said the council's chairman, John Koskinen. 
``Implementation includes installing the upgraded or replaced 
systems wherever they're in operation, not only domestically but 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made on the self-imposed deadline the  
council had imposed on federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said 13 of the 24 federal departments now report their  
mission-critical systems are 100 percent compliant. Among them, the 
Social Security Administration and the Departments of Education, 
Labor, Interior and Veterans Affairs. Except for one, the remaining 
agencies have fixed and tested at least 85 percent of their 
computers systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agency for International Development has not fixed any  
of its critical systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines might assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government  
Reform Committee's subcommittee on government management, was 
encouraged by 92 percent compliant rate but said ``we should have 
had it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to do the real serious work, which is test it in  
an operational environment,'' he said. ``If we can test it and it 
still works, that's fine. But time's a wasting.''

<HEADLINE> Republican Kasich Hunts for Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The name of John Kasich, the powerful member  
of Congress who wants to be president, doesn't ring many bells in a 
town where cinematographers and movie producers have broader 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is that?'' wondered Mike Garner as Kasich and an entourage  
left a restaurant during the Republican's swing through California 
this week in search of money and votes. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released last week showed just 4 percent of California  
Republicans favored Kasich over his GOP rivals. But the Ohioan 
believes he can connect with California, which is holding its 
primary earlier than ever next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Californians like the underdog, they like `against the grain.'  
I'm clearly both,'' he said in an interview Tuesday over a 
breakfast of eggs and bacon. He left the fresh fruit untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	There is plenty about the telegenic congressman that could  
appeal to Californians. He is young, 46, self-confident and 
straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, preaches the  
need to reinforce families, religion and volunteerism. Most of all, 
he rails against the ``the elites'' and says the government should 
``keep its mitts off'' citizens and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has spent most of his adult life in government work, but  
insists he's no Beltway insider, reminding listeners that he is the 
son of a mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am of the people,'' he says. ``My dad couldn't get me on the  
Little League team, let alone in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit to telecommunications giant Nortel Networks in  
the Silicon Valley, Kasich derided Vice President Al Gore for 
claiming to have helped create the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kasich, who compares his work in Congress to ``bending  
steel,'' is himself given to speaking in superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the biggest supporter of tax cuts in the Republican Party  
-- I mean, of anybody who's ever served in public office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also claimed he was the first to use the Web to announce his  
bid for the GOP nomination. Lamar Alexander made such a declaration 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other candidates who have crossed the country seeking  
support and dollars this year, Kasich soon must file fund-raising 
reports with federal officials for the first quarter, which ends 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He likens his campaign to climbing Mount Everest, and he knows  
that reaching the White House won't be possible without the 
financial oxygen -- ``the Os,'' in his own parlance -- supplied by 
Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and San Francisco entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't give me the Os, I'll die on the mountain,'' he  
said, adding that he's not above begging for the help.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Begins Settlement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s top legal negotiators met  
with government lawyers for two hours behind closed doors but 
couldn't reach common ground in the first settlement talks since 
the Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust case last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no plans to meet again today, although neither side  
ruled out future talks, said a source close to the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations, described as cordial, were held Tuesday  
evening at the Justice Department, according to the source, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were to appear in court today to talk with U.S.  
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson about the schedule for the 
trial, currently in a six-week recess. Jackson is occupied with a 
criminal case taking longer than expected, and the Microsoft trial 
may not resume until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts agree an out-of-court settlement in the interim is  
unlikely because the sides remain far apart on central issues after 
nearly five months of a bitter courtroom fight. Wisconsin's 
attorney general, James Doyle, said before the talks that he didn't 
expect them to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	But the seriousness assigned to Tuesday's negotiations was  
evident in the roster of lawyers who participated. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was represented by David Boies, its top litigator  
in the case; Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the 
Justice Department's antitrust division; attorneys general from 
Iowa and Connecticut; and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft dispatched William Neukom, its top in-house lawyer and  
former senior partner in the law firm of Bill Gates' father; 
Richard Urowsky, the architect of a controversial 1995 Microsoft 
settlement with the government; and legal consultant Charles Rule, 
who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division during the 
Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	For Microsoft, a courtroom loss years ago in another important  
legal fight remains a clear reminder of the perils of taking an 
unyielding position at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Microsoft chose to stand defiant and risk a  
verdict in a lawsuit that bears striking parallels to its current 
courtroom troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of illegally bundling a competitor's technology into its  
dominant computer operating system, Microsoft lost that case in 
1994 and was ordered by jurors to pay $120 million in damages to a 
small industry rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very tough and aggressive in everything they do,''  
said Morgan Chu, the lawyer who represented Stac Electronics Corp. 
in failed settlement talks with Microsoft in 1993 but beat the 
software maker in court a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true in the way they market products, the way they  
conduct business negotiations -- and it's true in the way they 
conduct litigation,'' Chu remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Stac had accused Microsoft of patent  
infringement for including its ``Stacker'' data-compression 
technology in its MS-DOS operating system, the precursor to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in the current antitrust trial alleges that  
Microsoft bundled Internet software with Windows to try to crush 
rival Netscape Communications Corp. It also holds that Microsoft 
introduced a ``polluted'' version of a new technology by Sun 
Microsystems Inc. to stem its widespread use. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in Microsoft's current case, Gates testified personally  
in 1993. But Stac lawyers used Gates' own e-mail to try to 
discredit him, much as the government has done over past weeks in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost the Stac case for $120 million and was ordered to  
recall versions of its software with the technology. It later 
settled with Stac for $83 million by promising not to appeal. The 
same jury also awarded Microsoft $13.6 million in a counterclaim.

<HEADLINE> Minor Rail Disruptions Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Railroad disruptions are inevitable following  
the June 1 split of Conrail, but their impact is likely to be 
minor, the head of one of Conrail's new owners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Snow, chairman and chief executive officer of CSX Corp.,  
said slowdowns will occur in the first several hours of the 
transition as computers are shut down and reprogrammed, forcing a 
temporary shift to manual operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.3 billion takeover of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk  
Southern Corp. has come under scrutiny in light of a major service 
meltdown that followed the 1996 merger of Union Pacific Railroad 
with Southern Pacific Rail Corp. in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow likened the adverse effects from the computer shutdown and  
other, unforeseen problems to those of ``a freak ice storm that 
slows the railroads for a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We work out of those in a few days,'' he told reporters. ``We  
just don't see anything that is going to create a ... replay of the 
Western sorts of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Union Pacific gridlock lasted several months and caused  
major delivery delays. It spawned several lawsuits by shippers and 
a drive in Congress to give federal regulators more oversight over 
the rail industry, something rail companies believe would hinder 
their ability to invest and grow. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Conrail takeover date approaches, rail executives are  
seeking to play down the significance of any problems by suggesting 
that disruptions are inevitable. At the same time, they seek to 
bolster confidence among shippers by stressing lessons learned from 
the Union Pacific disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX will keep most of the Conrail management teams in place and  
will test its computer networks to make sure the computers from the 
various railroads can to talk to one another after the split, Snow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company also has increased its workforce and  
locomotive holdings to limit the impact of any problems. That, he 
said, came at considerable expense to the company, whose earnings 
and incomes dropped in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect things will go bump in the night, so we have  
contingencies ... and more assets and people than you really 
need,'' he said. ``Will there be some difficulties? Yes. You have 
to anticipate some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern spokeswoman Susan Terpay said her company had  
contingency and backup plans to address problems as they occurred. 
``As much planning as you put into something, it's not possible to 
predict everything that's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved by the federal Surface Transportation Board  
last summer, is the most complex and most extensive rail 
transaction in U.S. history, covering nearly 45,000 miles of tracks 
among the three railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Although each company is spending $1 million a day on interest  
payments, executives have proceeded cautiously toward reaping the 
benefits of the deal in order to avoid repeating the Union Pacific 
mishaps. The companies could have implemented the deal as early as 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail, there's no doubt about the fact that we will set  
railroading back a long way and will invite enormous government 
attention,'' Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when 
Philadelphia-based Conrail began operating as a monopoly that 
Congress created out of six bankrupt railroads. CSX operates out of 
Richmond, Va., and Norfolk Southern is based in Norfolk, Va.

<HEADLINE> Airport Boots Customs Supervisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service transferred a white  
supervisor after allegations that black passengers were unfairly 
targeted for inspections at Hartsfield Atlanta International 
Airport, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale O'Connor, the white supervisor of the passenger inspection  
team, is being transferred to the cargo division, while Robert 
White, a black supervisor, is being shifted from another division 
to head the 16-member inspection team, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is also assigning a black Customs official from  
another city to be acting head of the service's Atlanta office 
while a permanent replacement is sought for its recently retired 
chief, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Customs Service spokesman Dennis Murphy confirmed  
there were changes but declined to identify the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes are an effort to bring fresh perspectives to  
passenger processing in Atlanta,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said today he could not comment on the newspaper's  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., asked for a formal  
investigation into allegations of racial discrimination by customs 
inspectors at the airport. Lewis made his request in a letter to 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who oversees the Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter cited a recent report by WAGA-TV alleging that  
customs inspectors at Hartsfield are more likely to detain blacks 
than whites. The report said 90 percent of those sent from the 
airport to hospitals to be X-rayed for drugs were black, but only 
20 percent of blacks detained by customs officers were carrying 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers clearly indicate that customs has been engaged  
in discriminatory practices that have infringed on the fundamental 
rights of thousands of African-Americans and other travelers,'' 
Lewis wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the newspaper's report, Lewis said today he was  
pleased to see that Customs administrators appear to be taking some 
action, but Congress still needs to look into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee is conducting a review of the  
Customs Service's enforcement and commercial operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of racial discrimination in customs inpections have  
surfaced elsewhere. In Chicago, more than 80 black females have 
filed a class-action lawsuit claiming they were singled out for 
strip searches at O'Hare International Airport because of race and 
gender.

	Aid Approved for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Agency for International Development  
sent a disaster relief team to Albania today to assess the growing 
humanitarian crisis stemming from the Serb crackdown in Kosovo and 
the NATO airstrikes against the Serbs. President Clinton also 
authorized $50 million ``to address the urgent humanitarian needs 
of refugees who fled Kosovo,'' Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
He said the money would be drawn from an emergency contingency fund 
and the Department of Defense. Half will be sent to the U.N. High 
Commission on Refugees and half will pay for food and shelter.

	Refugees Complain About Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Refugees arriving today in northern  
Albania complained that NATO airstrikes in southern Kosovo have 
been ineffective as Western officials expressed new resolve to try 
to cripple the Yugoslav military. Refugees said bombs were hitting 
military buildings abandoned by the Yugoslav army and soldiers now 
were staying in homes left behind by fleeing ethnic Albanians. U.S. 
Gen. Wesley Clark has called for more firepower to accelerate the 
mission, but he has warned airstrikes would not be enough to stop 
attacks against civilians reportedly spearheaded by Serb militia 
units.

	Jurors To Sentence Marine Navigator

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- An Air Force psychologist testified  
today that Marine Capt. Joseph Schweitzer was ``immediately 
tearful'' when he learned 20 people had died as a result of a 
flight on which he served as navigator. The psychologist said 
Schweitzer was the ``most distressed'' of the four crew members on 
the EA-6B Prowler that hit a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps on 
Feb. 3, 1998, and sent a gondola plunging to the ground. Schweitzer 
pleaded guilty to two charges in connection with the destruction of 
a videotape of the flight. A jury is considering his sentence. He 
could face up to five years in prison for each charge.

	Audit: Federal Bookkeeping Woeful  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government still does a woeful job  
of keeping its financial books, but they are better than they were 
in fiscal 1997, according to an audit released today. Comptroller 
General David Walker, who heads the General Accounting Office, told 
the panel that 24 federal agencies don't properly account for ``a 
majority'' of their $466 billion in assets. The audit revealed 
numerous other problems, including inadequate data on loans and 
liabilities such as veterans' benefits, poor computer security, and 
even lack of documentation to support the costs of many day-to-day 
government operations.

	Study: DNA Conducts Electricity  
</P>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Strands of DNA might someday be used  
as wires in computer chips and transistors, a study suggests. 
Hans-Werner Fink and Christian Schoenenberger of the University of 
Basel in Switzerland found that DNA conducts electricity as well as 
a good semiconductor. A semiconductor carries electricity better 
than an insulator but not as well as a conductor like copper. If 
DNA strands could be made with a switch to turn the current flowing 
through them on and off, they could be used to build extremely tiny 
electrical devices, the researchers said.

libeled McDonald's Corp. by accusing it of selling food that can 
cause heart disease. Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that Dave 
Morris and Helen Steel were justified in claiming that regular 
customers face a heightened risk of heart trouble. The judges also 
said it was fair to say McDonald's subjected its employees to poor 
conditions and paid them badly. The judges reduced the amount of 
damages the two must pay to $61,300 from $92,700.

of retirement to play for the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan has had 
preliminary discussions with NBA commissioner David Stern and 
Hornets owner George Shinn about buying 50 percent of the team. Fox 
Sports reported last night that Jordan was considering playing a 
full season for the Hornets while his ownership shares were held in 
a trust or deferred.

<HEADLINE> Films Study Legacy of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Twenty years after her husband returned  
from Vietnam in a flag-draped casket, his dog tags encrusted with 
blood, Barbara Sonneborn woke up one morning determined to write 
about her grief. 
</P>
<P>
	Those first words begun as a letter to her husband became the  
Academy Award-nominated documentary ``Regret to Inform,'' a poetic 
and powerful memoir that considers the legacy of the Vietnam War 
for widows on both sides of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The lasting impact of another war compels Emiko Omori, director  
of ``Rabbit in the Moon,'' to revisit the makeshift desert barracks 
where she and 120,000 other Japanese Americans spent World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	And 50 years after the Japanese army lost that war and thousands  
of its sex slaves were freed, Korean women have begun to step out 
of the shadows of shame to force the Japanese to acknowledge their 
war crimes. Dai Sil Kim-Gibson's feature documentary, ``Silence 
Broken: Korean Comfort Women,'' gives voice to their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silence Broken'' made its worldwide premiere at the recent San  
Francisco International Asian American Film Festival. The two other 
movies are fresh from award-winning premieres at the Sundance Film 
Festival in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are about war, though none is about combat. Perhaps  
representing a new generation of war films, they focus not on the 
soldiers who fought and died but on the women and families left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women suffer differently from men during war,'' says Omori,  
who also served as Sonneborn's cinematographer in Vietnam. ``Women 
bear children and are the caretakers. They're not the ones with the 
guns; they're just trying to live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The films show how war, in robbing women of health, family and  
hearth, tested loyalty, faith and trust. They also question what 
compelled women to keep silent about their suffering for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did find myself avoiding the war but it's something that  
informs our lives,'' Omori says. ``It's still one of the first 
things someone will ask a (Japanese-American) stranger about our 
age: 'What camp were you in?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonneborn's husband, Jeff Gurvitz, went off to war in January  
1968. She learned of his death eight weeks later, on the day she 
turned 24. 
</P>
<P>
	For years her husband's death haunted her. During those years  
vets were branded ``baby killers.'' She encountered only one other 
war widow. When a tape he recorded arrived after his death, she 
packed it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an unpopular war. We had another element to deal  
with, and that was: What did they die for? And what did they do 
when they were there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took her 20 years to summon up the courage to listen to the  
tape of her husband's voice and to seek answers. In 1992, she went 
to Vietnam -- where the war is called the ``American War'' -- 
accompanied by translator Xuan Ngoc Evans, a South Vietnamese woman 
whose first husband was killed in combat and whose second husband 
was a U.S. soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to do something about women, widows on both sides  
of the conflict,'' says Sonneborn. ``It was so emotional, so 
profoundly emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film, produced by Janet Cole, is a moving mix of memoir,  
interviews and some stunning archival footage. It won a directing 
award in the documentary category at Sundance but lost the best 
documentary feature prize at the Oscars to ``The Last Days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Omori says shooting ``Regret'' and hearing the women's stories  
of survival influenced her own film, then in its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me an understanding about our camp experience,'' she  
says. ``I got real interested in what was happening with the 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her own mother died of a bleeding ulcer a year out of the camps.  
The family tucked away her photos and the urn carrying her ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It occurred to me ... that we never talked about the camps,  
and I had always felt that our mother's death was connected to the 
camps,'' says Omori. She had always felt her mother was too 
traditionally Japanese to survive such indignities. 
</P>
<P>
	Omori's mother was born in the United States but raised in  
Japan. Her father was Japanese-born. But Omori and her older 
sister, Chizuko, were Americans, 1 1/2 and 12 years old when the 
Omoris were interned in an Arizona camp in 1942 after the Japanese 
bombed Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	While there, sleeping on hay-filled sacks and sharing one room  
with two other families, internees were ordered to fill out a 
questionnaire designed to determine their loyalty. Would they serve 
in the U.S. Army? Would they give up allegiance to the Japanese 
emperor? 
</P>
<P>
	Some asked for repatriation to Japan; others proved their  
loyalty by enlisting. But there also was a little-known resistance 
by ``no-no boys,'' those who rejected both questions. The questions 
``sliced through the camps like a knife,'' dividing families. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Americans left the camps a fractured community that has  
never completely recovered, she says. Simply looking at the night 
sky reminds Omori of the struggle she inherited: At first she'd see 
the man in the moon, then she'd see the rabbit of Japanese 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the government asked of us was to stop seeing the  
rabbit,'' she says in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful and well-crafted, the film won documentary  
cinematography honors at Sundance. Footage from home movies taken 
before the war and inside the camps provide a rare glimpse into 
Japanese-American life in the 1940s; government reels now betray 
the travesty of the incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, in Asia, the Japanese surrender meant freedom  
for 200,000 women in military brothels, most of them Korean. For 
four decades, the women listened silently as the Japanese denied 
forcing them into sexual servitude. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the women began stepping forward. They speak in  
``Silence Broken: Korean Comfort Women'' of being seized by 
soldiers, of girls as young as 12 forced to see up to 100 men a 
day. Many were beaten, drugged and made infertile. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman refuses to feel shame though she lost the chance to  
bear children and claim her place in Korean society. ``I want to 
die as a daughter of Korea,'' she says proudly, clad in an elegant 
traditional gown. 
</P>
<P>
	In all three films, moments of serenity contrast with brutal  
images of torture and death. Water laps at a boat in Vietnamese 
waters, a voice soars in song. A waterfall roars in the Korean 
mountains. The snowcapped Sierra rises above the cacti of the 
Manzanar camp. 
</P>
<P>
	There is beauty even in a landscape of horror. Years after the  
barracks were torn down, a farmer dug up a rusty oil barrel that 
internees had filled with tiny, polished stones, each painted with 
a word. 
</P>
<P>
	She and other survivors are like those river rocks, Omori says.  
</P>
<P>
	``To bury them like a time capsule, people wanted us not to  
forget how we had all shattered and scattered and couldn't come 
back together in quite the same way. They've become messengers,'' 
she says. ``When I would want to give up, they were a reminder that 
I owed it -- to my history, to the community -- to finish.''

<HEADLINE> GM Plant Plans May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Motor Corp.'s ambitious plans to build a  
new type of assembly plant that uses fewer workers likely will be 
delayed because of union opposition, GM's president acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said Tuesday that GM's April deadline to  
begin construction of the so-called ``modular'' assembly plants may 
have been unrealistic. But he also said that discussions with the 
United Auto Workers on the issue have been productive. 
</P>
<P>
	GM wants to replace its aging small-car plants in Lansing,  
Mich., and Lordstown, Ohio, with the new type of plant in which 
parts suppliers have a larger role in assembling the cars. Such 
plants already are in operation overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a modular plant, preassembled parts modules are delivered to  
the plant by outside suppliers. Far fewer UAW workers would be 
needed to assemble each car because most of the subassembly work 
would done by the lower-cost suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner's comments at the New York International Auto Show came  
two days after UAW President Stephen Yokich attacked GM's plan as 
``just another way to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits.'' 
Details of the plan are already under negotiation with the plants' 
UAW locals and their national leadership in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said the plan, called ``Project Yellowstone,'' will  
never work if the union doesn't sign on. He said GM was receptive 
to alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can proclaim that that's the only formula,''  
he said. ``So we're kind of wide open to discuss various issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National contract talks with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler  
unit of DaimlerChrysler AG begin in June. Yokich said modular 
assembly would be a major issue in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	If GM fails to reach agreement on Project Yellowstone before  
contract talks, the project could be delayed until fall at the 
soonest. GM's current contract expires in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes slower than faster, that's the consequence we'll  
have to face,'' Wagoner said. ``Hopefully, it doesn't take that 
long. But I think we want to try to stay with this idea. I haven't 
in any way given up trying to find something that will work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said talks so far have been constructive. But he  
declined to comment on Yokich's blunt criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GM executives privately discounted Yokich's comments as  
political posturing intended to boost the union leader's tough 
image before the UAW rank and file. Yokich made his remarks at the 
UAW's triennial bargaining convention in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	GM says it loses up to $1,000 on each small car it builds and  
that it needs to find ways to reduce its costs if it's to continue 
building small cars in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said GM was doing better than expected in North America  
so far this year but was falling behind in Europe because of weak 
sales in Germany. He disputed a report that GM had backed off its 
1999 financial goals in a meeting with Wall Street analysts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no backing off,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker has set what it calls a ``stretch  
goal'' to earn $4 billion this year in North America and $900 
million in Europe. It expects to lose about $150 million in Asia 
and about the same amount in Latin America. Wagoner said a stretch 
goal is the best GM believes it can do if ``if everything goes 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wagoner said it will be tough for GM to meet its goal of 32  
percent of the U.S. market this year. Although vehicle demand is 
exceeding expectations, GM already is producing at full capacity 
for many of its vehicles, especially its high-profit trucks. When 
demand exceeds production and buyers have to wait for their orders, 
some customers end up in competitors' showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's market share shrank to about 29 percent last year from 31  
percent in 1997, in large part because of last summer's strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With strong markets it makes it harder to get share but easier  
to make it on the bottom line,'' he said. ``So it's a problem I can 
deal with.''

<HEADLINE> Driver in Van Crash Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The driver accused of vehicular homicide in  
a van crash that killed seven young magazine sales people cried as 
the charges were read in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Holmes, 20, stood mute when asked for a plea. The court  
entered innocent pleas on his behalf before holding him on $47,500 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Holmes, of Clinton, Iowa, was driving a van with 13  
other young people selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door when 
it overturned on Interstate 90, spilling bodies onto the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people died and five were seriously injured. Two remained  
in critical condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened as Holmes tried to switch seats with a  
passenger when he saw a police officer preparing to pull him over 
for speeding, authorities said. His driving license was not valid 
in Wisconsin because of a string of traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The occupants of the van, who ranged in age from 15 to 25, had  
been selling magazines for YES, an affiliate of Subscriptions Plus 
of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin labor officials have cited Subscriptions Plus for a  
child labor violation involving a 15-year-old Madison girl injured 
in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Labor officials have also cited the company for  
allegedly not having workers' compensation coverage for 123 
administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscriptions Plus has denied wrongdoing in both cases.

<HEADLINE> Coles Removed As Torch Relay Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian IOC member Phil Coles was  
removed from his role as the Sydney 2000 Olympics torch relay chief 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles did not attend the SOCOG board meeting in which Anna Booth  
was selected to replace him as chair of the torch relay committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be moving forward and we need a chairperson that's  
available,'' said SOCOG president Michael Knight. ``It's pretty 
clear that Phil's circumstances have not been the best of late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is under investigation by the IOC for accepting excessive  
hospitality from the Salt Lake bidders that won the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also being investigated following his ex-wife's claims  
that he took jewelry from a Greek businessman associated with 
Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied the jewelry allegations and has not made any  
public statements since returning to Australia last week following 
the IOC's extraordinary session in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG board members and the president of John Hancock insurance  
company, a major Olympic sponsor, have urged Coles to resign but 
the 67-year-old said he won't quit his post. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight led the decision to remove Coles as the torch relay chief  
and said he was concerned about poor publicity concerning Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear to Phil that I thought it was in his best  
interests not to continue on the board and he made it clear to me 
that he intended to continue,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates said he and  
Coles' fellow IOC member Kevan Gosper abstained from Thursday's 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm unhappy for Phil, I just didn't involve myself today''  
Coates said. ``It involved someone I've worked with for a long time 
and in Kevan's case, as he said, it involved an Olympic 
colleague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight also said Coles informed him Sunday that he wanted to  
return to SOCOG if cleared by the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Digging Begins in N.M. Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- Authorities began digging Wednesday  
around a trailer where two women say they were sexually tortured 
and the number of officers involved in the case increased to almost 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not begun to do any major excavation. We are doing  
some selective digging by hand,'' FBI agent Doug Beldon said of the 
joint state-federal investigation into the torture allegations 
against David Parker Ray and Cynthia Lea Hendy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women accused Ray and Ms. Hendy of holding them in chains  
separate days-long incidents of torture this winter. Ray, 59, and 
Ms. Hendy, 39, have been charged with 25 counts, including 
kidnapping, aggravated battery and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no indication from police that bodies have been  
found, but authorities have not ruled out the possibility of 
homicides. An acquaintance said Ms. Hendy told him Ray had killed 
four to six people, mutilated the bodies and dumped them in 
Elephant Butte Lake, 150 miles south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	She said other bodies were more buried in the desert, the  
acquaintance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beldon said agents used hand shovels, metal detectors and  
electronic probes to measure soil density for any indication of 
recent excavation or burial. He said he expected the work at the 
couple's trailer to wrap up within four days. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Ron Lopez said defense attorneys Wednesday  
waived arraignment on the criminal complaint and set a tentative 
April 12 trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both defendants say their clients are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray's co-workers are flabbergasted by the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Glen Parks, a volunteer who works at the Elephant Butte State  
Park visitor center, said Ray was the ``neatest, cleanest, politest 
person you could ever want to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was a maintenance worker at the state park for about five  
years, fixing vehicles and heavy machinery in a garage on the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hendy wrote to a judge last December as part of a domestic  
complaint against a former boyfriend that she ``drinks too much'' 
and was on drugs to treat manic depression.

<HEADLINE> Klan Not Allowed To Adopt Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Anne Arundel County has scrapped its  
adopt-a-road program rather than let the Ku Klux Klan participate 
and have its signs posted along a mile of roadway. 
</P>
<P>
	County Executive Janet Owens said she did not want highways to  
become forums for political statements, especially by organizations 
``that have a history of racism and violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan was more interested in attention than picking up trash  
in the county east of Washington, D.C., she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan approached the county last summer about joining 26  
community and civic groups that periodically clean litter from 
roads. The county posts two signs identifying the organization that 
keeps the stretch of road clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Owens said she had only two choices -- kill the program or  
refuse to let the Klan participate and undertake an expensive court 
battle to defend the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Kelly, head of a Klan organization that he said has  
members in 11 states, called the decision ``childish and 
immature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly denied that his group advocates hatred and violence and  
said Ms. Owens ``doesn't know my group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we agreed to dropping the KKK on the signs and just  
put the Knights of the Invisible Empire,'' Kelly said.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Firm Closes After Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSEO, Mich. (AP) -- The founder of the fireworks company where  
five people were killed in an explosion this week says he is 
closing the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Although government officials said Tuesday they had no reason to  
shut down Independence Professional Fireworks Co., William 
Richardson told investigators that fireworks manufacturing would 
cease at the plant, the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's explosion followed a December blast in which seven  
people died at the site about 80 miles southwest of Detroit. Among 
the victims of the latest blast was Robert Slayton, the company's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us he'd lost his best friend,'' Detective Sgt. Ken  
Hersha of the state police told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A charred wall was all that remained of a small building that  
exploded Monday just 100 yards from the rubble of the Dec. 11 
blast. Several cars near the site also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know what the cause was,'' said Sonny Wilson of the  
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``There are a lot 
of questions. What we're trying to do is make the scene safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the December blast is also continuing.

	Independence is among the country's largest makers of display  
fireworks shells.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Allowed To Sell Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission on  
Tuesday rejected an attempt by AT&AMP;T to stop BellSouth Corp. from 
continuing to market a prepaid card that people can use anywhere in 
the country to make long-distance and other phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed a complaint to the FCC in January contending the  
arrangement violates a provision of a 1996 law that bars BellSouth 
and the nation's four other regional Bell telephone companies from 
providing long-distance service to their local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FCC disagreed. The commission concluded that the  
arrangement is legal and does not reduce BellSouth's incentives to 
open its local telephone markets to long-distance companies and 
other rivals that want to offer competing local phone services, an 
FCC official said 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law says a Bell company must open its market to  
competitors and get FCC approval before it may provide 
long-distance service to local customers. No Bell has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance service for the card is being provided by an  
unaffiliated company, U.S. South Communications, although the card 
is marketed by BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has defended the legality of the card, which the  
company began marketing inside and outside the company's nine-state 
local phone region in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are gratified by the decision,'' said Jim Harralson,  
general counsel of BellSouth Long Distance Inc. ``This is a win for 
consumers who now continue to have greater choice and convenience 
in paying for long-distance calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has been selling various forms of popular prepaid  
cards since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was filed under a new process to quickly resolve  
disputes. The FCC issued its decision 60 days after receiving the 
complaint. It's the FCC's first decision under the new process, 
which is called the rocket docket.

<HEADLINE> Comic Gary Morton Dies at 74 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Gary Morton, the Borscht Belt comic  
who married Lucille Ball and became her executive producer, has 
died. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton died Tuesday at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital, said John  
Caranci of Wiefels &AMP; Son Funeral Directors in Palm Springs. The 
cause of death wasn't disclosed, but Daily Variety reported he died 
of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton, a stand-up comic, married Miss Ball after she divorced  
Desi Arnaz, her ``I Love Lucy'' sidekick. Morton and the actress 
were married for 29 years; Miss Ball died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive producer of Miss Ball's ``The Lucy Show,''  
which aired 1962-68, ``Here's Lucy'' from 1968-74 and ``Life With 
Lucy,'' which was canceled after two months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also had supporting roles in films, including ``Lenny''  
in 1974 and ``Postcards From the Edge'' in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Morton Goldaper in New York City, Morton became a popular  
nightclub comedian in New York, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and the 
Borscht Belt before Miss Ball brought him to Hollywood and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	After their marriage, Morton became involved with Miss Ball's TV  
career as warmup comedian for her second CBS sitcom, ``The Lucy 
Show,'' for which ex-husband Arnaz was executive producer for a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon Miss Ball's sale of Desilu to Paramount in 1967, she formed  
a new company, Lucille Ball Productions, naming Morton vice 
president. That company produced ``Here's Lucy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Morton continued to do the warmups for the  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also produced several Lucille Ball television specials  
through the 1970s, and other specials and films for television, 
including ``Bungle Abbey'' in 1981 and ``Sentimental Journey'' in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In motion pictures, he was executive producer of the 1983 ``All  
the Right Moves,'' which starred Tom Cruise as a high school 
football star. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife of three years, Susie McAllister.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds McLain Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Embezzlement charges against former Detroit  
Tigers pitcher Denny McLain and business partner Roger Smigiel were 
upheld by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain and Smigiel, former co-owners of Chesaning's Peet Packing  
Co., appealed their 1996 convictions for stealing more than $2.5 
million from the company's pension fund and then laundering the 
money. They argued the jury instructions were improper, evidence 
was admitted in error and that they should have received separate 
trials, U.S. Attorney Saul A. Green said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel on Monday unanimously rejected their  
claims in an unpublished opinion, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message was left with McLain's lawyer Thursday evening seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain and Smigiel have been in prison since 1997. As a result  
of the ruling, McLain, 55, of Brighton, Mich., will continue to 
serve his eight-year sentence and Smigiel, 47, of Boca Raton, Fla., 
will continue a seven-year sentence, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain and Smigiel bought Peet Packing in January 1994 and  
quickly took the money from the company's $12 million pension fund, 
according to trial testimony. The Chesaning, Mich., company went 
bankrupt in June 1995, and more than 200 workers lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, the major leagues' last 30-game winner in 1968, also  
faces trial on federal charges that he took part in a scheme 
involving fraudulent phone cards. John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, son of 
the imprisoned boss of the Gambino crime family, also took part in 
the fraud, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, 54, pitched for the Detroit Tigers from 1963 to 1970. He  
recorded 31 victories in the Tigers' World Series championship 
season of 1968. His last major league season was 1972, when he was 
28.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Upbeat for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG today reported its  
sales rose 6 percent in the first two months of this year and 
predicted revenue and operating profit for all of 1999 would rise 
at least 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the projections, executives also sought to play  
down trans-Atlantic culture clashes in the company formed by last 
year's takeover of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical aspects of last year's merger, such as coordinating  
global sales and purchasing, were on track, they said, and savings 
were already being realized. DaimlerChrysler said its previously 
announced target of $1.4 billion of merger-related savings would be 
achieved this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up 6 percent for the first two months of this year,  
with increases in all divisions, the company said at a news 
conference at Stuttgart, where it is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue is expected to rise at least 4 percent over 1998's  
record level, and co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said growth in 
operating profit ``will definitely match sales growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to economic stability on both sides of the Atlantic ... we  
are confident of continued success in 1999, despite some tough 
challenges around the rest of the world,'' said co-chairman Robert 
J. Eaton, who headed Chrysler before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Europe's new single currency, the company said revenue for  
1999 is expected to climb to 137 billion euros, or about $147 
billion at current exchange rates, from 131.8 billion euros in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said almost half of 1998's record $10.2 billion  
operating profit came from the Chrysler passenger car and truck 
division, which includes Plymouth, Jeep and Dodge. Chrysler's 
contribution was $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But while business operations are merging at a ``great pace,''  
Schrempp said, ``the human integration, that's a process that's 
going to take longer ... because we have to take into consideration 
human feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those difficulties were partly responsible for DaimlerChrysler's  
decision this month not to buy into ailing Nissan Motor Co. of 
Japan, said both Schrempp and Eaton. Last weekend, France's Renault 
bought a 37 percent stake in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to focus on making sure our merger is successful,''  
Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint projects already are under way in areas like sales and  
marketing and combined financial service. The U.S.-built Mercedes 
M-Class off-road vehicle begins European production in May at 
Chrysler's Jeep plant in Graz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also have been defections of Chrysler executives to  
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., with some reports 
suggesting the Americans felt Germans were being favored for top 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a later teleconfernce with U.S. reporters, Schrempp bristled  
at repeated questions about the American defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would need somebody from Ford or General Motors we would  
buy it as well, but we don't need that,'' Schrempp said. ``We also 
don't need their know-how. You can quote me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The co-chairmen described the departures as normal.  
</P>
<P>
	``What is the big deal of seven people ... having left? ... No  
deal whatsoever, happens all the time and will continue to happen. 
And by the way, it will happen very soon at the other two companies 
in Detroit as well,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said he, too, was unconcerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a management team as attractive as we have, you  
always have people trying to lure them away,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton has said since the deal was announced last May that he  
would leave DaimlerChrysler within three years and leave Schrempp 
as sole chairman. He declined today to say if he might leave sooner 
than that, as some analysts expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that I would be here until I felt the  
integration is going well,'' Eaton said. ``But Juergen Schrempp and 
I agree that a company can have only one CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler headquarters is divided between Stuttgart,  
former home of Daimler-Benz, and Auburn Hills, Mich., former home 
of Chrysler. The company has started its own jet shuttle between 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 reporters from around the world packed a Stuttgart  
concert hall for the news conference, which was translated into six 
languages and transmitted live on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Dying in Mexico City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A glowing red sun set in a cloudless sky, a  
light breeze blowing through the stadium. And, on this perfect 
night for baseball, the home team had a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all but a few hundred of the 25,000 seats were empty when  
the Mexico City Tigers rallied in the eighth inning to beat the 
Cancun Lobstermen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to see how few people come,'' said Carlos Hernandez,  
a 41-year-old trauma surgeon who had a section all to himself just 
to the first-base side of home plate. ``It's really such a pretty 
stadium, and it's so nice to sit out here in the evening. All 
that's missing is a little human warmth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a common complaint among baseball fans in the Mexico City  
area, the country's political, financial and cultural capital and 
home to one out of five Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
	What once was baseball fever has been tamed by bitter memories  
of a players' strike and news media that largely ignore the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's national television channels, which crowd the airwaves  
with soccer, NFL football and professional wrestling, haven't 
broadcast a Mexican baseball game in years. The only way to see 
Mexican league play is on ESPN2, alongside strongman contests and 
beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	The major national newspapers banish baseball to the inside  
pages of their sports sections, behind soccer, boxing, NBA 
basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	So it should be little surprise that interest has dropped off.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to playing without fans,'' said Matias Carrillo,  
the Tigers' star right fielder who drove in the winning run this 
spring evening. ``We play with enthusiasm, but if there were fans 
we'd play with more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet in much of the country, ``beisbol'' is the sport of  
kings. Just ask Carrillo, who is from Sinaloa state on the Pacific 
coast, or Hernandez, who's from the Gulf of Mexico state of 
Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Mexico City, local television stations transmit games  
and people listen on radio for the latest score. Baseball players 
are celebrities and children play in leagues, hoping to make it big 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the San Diego Padres and the Colorado Rockies open the  
major league season in Mexico on Sunday, they will do so in 
Monterrey, a northern city where baseball still dominates. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is still immensely popular across the entire north of  
the country, where more contact with the United States helps the 
sport. But even in many places with no U.S. link, baseball still 
reigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Only an hour north of Mexico City, a mountain town called  
Omitlan de Juarez has no soccer fields. Its baseball stadium is the 
town's pride and is home to weekly games by three local teams -- 
children, teen-agers and adults, all amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Sunday, the Omitlan Parrots were down 19-2 to the  
state champions, the Zimapan Miners. 
</P>
<P>
	But it didn't matter. About 300 fans packed the bleachers,  
whooping and ringing cowbells with every hit. Those who didn't fit 
in the stands gathered on nearby roofs to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer's a tough thing to go up against with games on TV all  
the time,'' said Omitlan manager Daniel Garcia, a 38-year-old 
industrial engineer. ``But boys see their fathers playing, and we 
try to pass on our values. If not, baseball would be finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Omitlan, at least, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing since I was 3, and I don't play anything  
else,'' said Mario Ruben Rodriguez, 12, a center fielder on his 
Little League team. ``I'll play until I die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans point to television for baseball's drop in popularity  
the last decade or two. They accuse the two television networks, 
both of which own soccer teams, of favoring soccer for financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican TV networks once broadcast games, then went to the  
championships only, and now have dropped baseball altogether. 
Antonio de Valdez, sports coordinator for Televisa, Mexico's 
biggest television network, conceded that baseball isn't a 
profitable broadcast because of its slow pace and the uncertainty 
of a game's length. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become a regional broadcast rather than a national  
one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also blamed the drop-off on a strike in the early 1980s  
in which the players walked out on full stadiums to demand higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very sad memory,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alejandro Merlos is 23 years old and doesn't remember the  
strike. But he sure knows about the empty stands. A beer vendor at 
the Mexico City ballpark, he struggles to make $4 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work on commission, and it's hard to make anything  
nowadays,'' he said. ``And every year it gets worse.''

<HEADLINE> Church Ads Spurs Tax Status Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that a church  
should lose its tax-exempt status because it ran ads saying that 
voting for Bill Clinton would be a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman on Tuesday upheld a 1995  
decision by the Internal Revenue Service to strip the Church at 
Pierce Creek of its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means that followers may no longer deduct church  
donations from their taxable income and the church will have to 
file corporate tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500-member congregation, an unaffiliated Protestant group,  
now worships as the Landmark Church. Among its members is Randall 
Terry, founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's pastor said the decision threatens freedom of  
speech as well as freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have to start as church to consider what the  
government might do to you if you speak on moral issues, that's the 
exact problem,'' the Rev. Dan Little said Wednesday. ``This is 
scary stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four days before Clinton defeated President Bush in 1992, Pierce  
Creek bought full-page ads in The Washington Times and USA Today 
attacking Clinton's morals. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a watchdog  
group, complained to the IRS that the ads were political and 
violated the church's tax-exempt status as a nonpartisan group. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he found no prior instance ``in which a church so  
brazenly claimed responsibility for a political advertisement in a 
national newspaper and solicited tax-deductible donations for that 
political advertisement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman's decision will be appealed, said Colby May, a  
spokesman for the American Center for Law and Justice.

<HEADLINE> Indians Look but No Deal in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Cellular phones, pagers and fax  
machines were all invented for guys like John Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland general manager is a mover and shaker, and it's  
been about this time the last two years that he has decided to mix 
things up with his Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Hart pulled the string on a blockbuster deal just a  
week before the season opener, sending Kenny Lofton to the Atlanta 
Braves for Marquis Grissom and David Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Indians were less than 48 hours away from opening  
in Seattle when Hart acquired pitcher Dave Burba from Cincinnati 
for first baseman Sean Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	Can we expect a three-peat from Hart?  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a gaping hole on this club,'' he said Wednesday.  
``Sure, we're always looking, and if the right thing ever presents 
itself, and we can help our club, then yeah, we'll go. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now, we've got five starters, a solid bullpen, a  
quality everyday club, nobody's hurt and a young bench. There's not 
a priority like there has been in years past that we needed to do 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh oh. Don't think for a second Hart would let priority get in  
the way of a good deal. He loves to tinker with his ballclub and 
admits not a day passes that he isn't working the phones to see 
what other teams are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a part of me just doing my job,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' search for a bonafide No. 1 starter has linked  
several big-name, big-salaried pitchers to the Indians in recent 
months, most notably Curt Schilling, Kenny Rogers and Kevin Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart wouldn't confirm reports that he has had serious  
discussions in recent days with Oakland about Rogers. The 
34-year-old went 16-8 with a 3.17 ERA for the Athletics last 
season, and would give the Indians a lefty starter for the first 
time since Greg Swindell in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably not a pitcher that is out there that we  
haven't talked about,'' Hart said. ``But with any pitcher, and that 
includes Rogers, we've had no more than cursory talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who has also drawn interest from other teams this  
spring, has been bothered by inflammation in his left elbow and 
hasn't pitched more than three innings in any start during the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Appier, the Indians have had scouts tailing the  
right-hander around Florida for a month. Appier is trying to come 
back from arthroscopic shoulder surgery and the Indians may be 
waiting to see how he pitches during the regular season before 
talking seriously with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not someone we're looking at right now,'' Hart said. ``I  
don't know how he'd fit at this point, considering the money and 
the players he would cost us, and the way our rotation is already 
set up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's Schilling. After saying his only remaining goal  
was to pitch again in the postseason, the Philadelphia ace recently 
called the Indians ``the surest lock in baseball to get to the 
postseason. Even more than the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, Hart isn't dialing Philadelphia GM Ed Wade's  
area code. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even call him anymore,'' Hart said. ``He said he's  
(Schilling) not available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean he won't be later this summer, especially  
if the Phillies get off to a slow start and are out of the NL 
wild-card race by the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	The only area where Hart feels the Indians are shallow is in  
their pitching depth. He's been scanning the waiver wire to pick up 
some insurance in case one of Cleveland's starters gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the luxury of a Bartolo Colon of Jaret Wright  
down in Triple-A anymore,'' said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	One name that caught his eye was Hideo Nomo, released last week  
by the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is that right now it's going to be hard to put him  
on our club. We don't think from what we've seen he's ready to step 
in and take over a starting job from anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Tour Bus Crash Injures 40 in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIPTON, Calif. (AP) -- A tour bus loaded with children collided  
with a truck carrying strawberries on a remote stretch of 
Interstate 15 late Tuesday, injuring 40 people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened at about 10 p.m. in the northbound lanes of  
the highway that connects Southern California with Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what caused the crash, but the bus ended up in  
a ditch, said Dennis West of the San Bernardino County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is out there in the middle of nowhere,'' he said. ``We've  
had patrol cars on the road for an hour who still haven't gotten to 
the scene because it's so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver was reported to be in critical condition, six  
people suffered moderate injuries and the 33 children aboard had 
minor injuries, West said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its mostly just bumps, bruises, scrapes and scratches,'' he  
said of the children's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who were returning to the Henderson, Nev., area,  
were being taken to a Las Vegas hospital for observation, West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nipton is 65 miles south of Las Vegas near the California-Nevada  
line.

<HEADLINE> Cops Kill Suspect in Texas Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man suspected in the shooting deaths  
of his girlfriend and three other Abilene women was killed 
Wednesday in a gun battle with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers pulled over a white car on a Fort Worth highway about 9  
p.m. and someone in the car pulled a gun, police told Abilene TV 
station KTXS. Shots were exchanged, killing 19-year-old Arthur 
Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman had been sought as a suspect in the Monday night  
shootings of his girlfriend, Sandy Witt, 20, Penny Estrada, 21, 
Naomi Martinez, 23, and Erica Arispe, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Goodman may have killed Ms. Witt in her apartment  
because she would not provide him with a false alibi in connection 
with an undisclosed crime he was suspected in. 
</P>
<P>
	The other victims were killed because they happened to be at the  
apartment, police said. A fifth victim, an apartment maintenance 
man, was wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman was charged Tuesday with capital murder. Police also  
wanted to question his 16-year-old brother, who might have been 
with him when the shooting happened, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers also suspect Goodman in the Sunday night shooting of a  
16-year-old boy who survived.

<HEADLINE> Diet Drug Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- A company hid evidence that half of the  
popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart 
problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp. 
for $110 million said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is believed to be the first to reach a courtroom  
over the issue of heart valve damage caused by fen-phen or Redux, 
and experts said a victory for the woman could prove key to other 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-member jury was seated to hear the case, filed by Sandra  
Moore against American Home Products Corp., the parent of 
pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales and marketing people said if you put a black box  
warning on this product you are going to see sales of the product 
cut in half,'' Michael McGartland said during opening statements of 
the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were making a lot of money,'' he said. ``It doesn't take  
a rocket scientist to figure out what the motivation was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore, a former Alvarado resident who now lives in Missoula,  
Mont., claims she wasn't warned about the risks of taking 
fenfluramine, marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin, or 
dexfenfluramine, a similar drug sold by the company as Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenflurmaine and Redux have been taken off the market.  
Fenfluramine makes up half of the ``fen-phen'' combination 
prescribed to thousands of patients to promote weight loss. The 
other half, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when 
taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Bill Sims said he looks forward to putting the  
facts before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of misinformation circulating about these drugs  
and why they were voluntarily withdrawn from the market,'' he said. 
``We are going to tell it like it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found mild heart valve damage after Ms. Moore, 52, took  
fen-phen for 10 months in 1996. She is now on medication for her 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection in Diet Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- A woman who blames a popular diet drug  
combination for her heart trouble has gone to court to take on the 
world's seventh-largest drug maker in a closely watched case. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were expected to begin later today in the  
lawsuit filed in state district court by Sandra Moore against 
American Home Products Corp., parent of pharmaceutical company 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection continued this morning with about 50 people  
remaining in the pool. Prospective jurors were being questioned 
extensively about their knowledge of the drugs, said Ms. Moore's 
attorney, Michael McGartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only two people on the panel didn't know about fen-phen,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore, who now lives in Missoula, Mont., claims she wasn't  
warned about the risks of taking fenfluramine, marketed by 
Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin, and dexfenfluramine, a similar drug later 
sold by the company as Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	The two drugs, which have been yanked from the market, make up  
half of the so-called ``fen-phen'' combination prescribed to 
thousands of patients to promote weight loss. The other half, 
phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when taken alone 
and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found mild heart valve damage after Ms. Moore, 52, took  
fen-phen for 10 months in 1996. Now on medication for her 
condition, she seeks damages exceeding $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has congestive heart failure and heart valve disease as a  
result of taking the pills,'' McGartland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is believed to be the first to reach a courtroom  
over the issue of heart valve damage, and experts said a victory 
for her could prove key to other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to encourage a lot of lawyers and clients that are  
right now sitting back and watching,'' said Dallas attorney Kip 
Petroff. ``I know for a fact that (American Home Products) is 
banking on winning so it'll have the exact opposite effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reportedly spent millions settling five cases  
involving primary pulmonary hypertension. Defense lawyer Bill Sims 
said he looks forward to putting the facts before the Texas jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of misinformation circulating about these drugs  
and why they were voluntarily withdrawn from the market,'' he said. 
``We are going to tell it like it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine carried labels starting in 1988 warning that in  
rare instances it caused primary pulmonary hypertension, a 
potentially fatal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst has been hit with hundreds of lawsuits since it  
pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food 
and Drug Administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart  
valve damage.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Civil Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- ``The Jenny Jones Show'' and its  
distributor ``lit the fuse'' that led to a guest's shooting death, 
an attorney for the victim's family said today during opening 
statements in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A waitress, a machinist, a retiree and a decorator are among  
jurors chosen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure was killed in 1995, three days after revealing a  
crush on a heterosexual acquaintance, Jonathan Schmitz, during a 
taping of the show. Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder 
in 1996, but the conviction was overturned last fall because of an 
error in jury selection. Schmitz's retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends in the $50 million lawsuit that the  
show's producers lied to Schmitz about the gender of his admirer, 
disregarded warnings about the dangers of surprising guests and had 
no concern about Schmitz's mental state. The suit names the show, 
distributor Warner Bros. and producer Telepictures Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement for the family, attorney Geoffrey  
Fieger said he will show ``that they lit the fuse that resulted in 
Jonathan Schmitz committing this god-awful and unspeakable act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger said talk shows are driven to capture audience share,  
which influences how much advertisers pay for time. ``And so people 
like Jonathan Schmitz and Scott Amedure are like profits. They're 
not people to be concerned about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement, Telepictures attorney James Feeney  
said that after the shooting, Schmitz never told police that he 
felt he was tricked, deceived, or lied to about the show's topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not what Jonathan Schmitz said. That's not how he saw  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney also said that before the taping, Schmitz suspected the  
secret crush might be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Feeney said earlier today that he has witnesses  
who will testify that Amedure and Schmitz had a sexual encounter 
after the show's taping. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question they had a relationship and it was sexual  
and that Scott Amedure told his mother of that,'' Feeney told 
reporters. He didn't immediately bring up the allegation as he 
began his opening statement this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz made no such claim when he was on trial.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled in a pretrial motion this morning that Feeney  
must give Feiger the names of the witnesses alleging the two men 
had an affair. If Fieger finds those witness' stories questionable, 
he can request an evidentiary hearing on whether they can testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger today called such testimony prejudicial and irrelevant  
and questioned whether such witnesses or testimony even exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is listed as a witness in the case. Feeney said it was  
likely she would testify early next week.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Johnson Feeling Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks fans can breathe a  
sigh of relief. Randy Johnson pitched six no-hit innings in a minor 
league game Wednesday and said he felt no hint of the strained 
right groin that had caused him to miss his previous start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good,'' he said. ``I'm ready to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 left-hander had his fastball clocked at 97 mph and  
his slider at 83 to 86 mph, an indication that despite the minor 
injury that altered his spring training timetable, he's in shape 
for Monday's opening day showdown against Kevin Brown at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's enough to beat the Dodgers, I won't know until I  
get over there,'' Johnson said, ``but I feel confident enough that 
I'm leaving spring training with the arm strength that I wanted and 
the mentality that I wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson threw 89 pitches -- 39 balls and 50 strikes -- in game for  
Arizona's Triple-A club against the Chicago White Sox Triple-A 
team. A strong, gusty wind blew at Johnson's back throughout the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping his balance must have been tough with the wind blowing  
the way it was, but I think he handled it very well,'' manager Buck 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson walked four, hit a batter and struck out five. Only  
three balls were hit out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get the most out of today's game,'' Johnson said.  
``Health-wise, I felt good. I threw the amount of pitched Buck 
wanted and I threw the amount of innings I set out to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was able to work on all his pitches, both from the windup and  
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's encouraging,'' Showalter said. ``You couldn't ask for  
anything better in terms of pitch count.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the spring, Johnson's well-documented moodiness has  
been nowhere to be seen. He's been cooperative with reporters, 
patiently signed autographs and made all the public appearances 
that were asked of him. During Wednesday's game, he was at the 
entrance to the dugout to high-five a Triple-A player who homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first spring training down here and people have been  
very nice and cordial,'' Johnson said. ``At the restaurants I went 
out to, they'd say how excited they were about the season. They've 
welcomed me here, so it's going to be a lot of fun this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's pleasant spring was interrupted when he strained his  
right groin during pitcher's fielding practice March 23. He missed 
his scheduled start last Friday and Showalter decided to have him 
pitch in a minor league game Wednesday rather than in the 
Diamondbacks game against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any symptoms that it's still there, but I'll ice  
it and continue to strengthen it between now and my next start,'' 
Johnson said. ``It was definitely a plus being able to pitch today 
and not having any problems.''

<HEADLINE> Young People Are Buying Less Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- True or false: Young people love to buy music,  
they crave rock 'n' roll and record stores are their favorite 
places to shop for sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Answers: False, false and false, at least for increasing numbers  
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer profile of music buyers issued by the Recording  
Industry Association of America offers insights into a business 
buffeted by change from several directions. 
</P>
<P>
	People ages 15 to 29 -- the bedrock of a youth-obsessed industry  
-- are buying less music, the survey found. This age group accounted 
for 39 percent of music purchases in 1998, down from 42 percent the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, music is much more ubiquitous for young  
people,'' said Hilary Rosen, RIAA president and chief executive. 
``You can get it on the radio, get it on MTV, get it on the 
Internet. There are many more choices out there to get music for 
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the MP3 technology, computer users are able to sell or  
trade copies of songs through the Internet, an activity that's 
causing major headaches now for the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Internet distribution is a small factor in the trend.  
But Siddiq Bello, publisher of industry newsletter The MP3 Impact, 
suggested Wednesday that the availability of music in cyberspace is 
responsible for a real dent in sales, particularly among people 
ages 15 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers 30 and older bought half the music sold last year,  
compared with 34 percent a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the young age group is shrinking, Rosen said. The  
industry has also heard from many young people who didn't like much 
of the new music put out last year, RIAA spokeswoman Alexandra 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock 'n' roll is still the most popular category of music, but  
its slip is showing. Rock accounted for just under 26 percent of 
the music sold last year, down from 33 percent in 1997 and 42 
percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest rock stars of the past decade, such as  
R.E.M., Pearl Jam and U2, have found their influence on music 
buyers has dipped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock sales are highly dependent on radio airplay, and more  
stations are playing oldies instead of new music, Rosen said. It's 
also a genre dominated by white males, and women bought more music 
than men in 1998 for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock is also losing its dominant status to rap and rhythm 'n'  
blues. Rap's stake of the marketplace has doubled over the last 
decade. Rap and rhythm 'n' blues together accounted for 23 percent 
of sales last year, up from 16 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin music is also booming, its sales up 25 percent last year,  
in large part because record companies have begun courting this 
demographic, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominance of record stores as the most popular shopping  
destination is also fading, although more slowly in the past few 
years. Fifty-one percent of consumers bought music in record stores 
last year, down from 72 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost-cutting retailers like Wal Mart and Best Buy are taking up  
a larger share of the marketplace. Just over 1 percent of consumers 
bought music through the Internet last year, a category the 
industry only started counting in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer profile is based on 3,051 telephone and Internet  
interviews conducted by Chilton Research Services.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Nears Breaststroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- South Africa's Penny Heyns missed a world  
record by just three-hundredths of a second Thursday as she led 
qualifying in the women's 50-meter breaststroke at the world 
short-course swimming championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns, the Olympic champion and long-course world record holder  
at 100 meters, won her heat in 30.80 seconds, just behind the world 
mark of 30.77 held by China's Han Xue. For the first time, FINA, 
swimming's world governing body, is offering awards of $15,000 for 
any world record broken at this meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Han was fourth fastest among the 16 qualifiers for Thursday  
night's semifinals. Her 31.70 was behind the 31.19 of Japan's 
Masami Tanaka and the 31.63 of Britain's Zoe Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe led the pace in heats for the  
200-meter freestyle, where the Australians hope to break the oldest 
men's short-course record still on the books -- Italian Giorgio 
Lamberti's 1990 time of 1 minute, 43.64 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Klim, the long-course world champion in the 200 freestyle and  
100 butterfly, won his heat in 1:45.20. Thorpe, the long-course 
world champion at 400 meters, won in 1:45.56. Dutch swimmer Pieter 
van den Hoogenband was third in his heat behind Italy's 
Massimiliano Rosolino and Johan Kenkhuis, but his 1:47.16 put him 
sixth fastest among the eight qualifiers for Thursday night's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	Klim was second fastest in qualifying for the 100 butterfly.  
Britain's James Hickman, who holds the world record of 51.02, led 
qualifiers in 51.78. Klim, in the same heat, was second fastest in 
51.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian world record holder Matthew Dunn was fifth fastest in  
qualifying for the men's 400-meter individual medley. He won his 
heat in 4:13.47, while Israel's Mickey Halka was the fastest 
qualifier in 4:12.74. 
</P>
<P>
	American Jenny Thompson, who holds the world records in three  
other events, was the fastest qualifier in the women's 100 
freestyle in 53.34, with Dutch swimmer Inge de Briujn and 
Slovakia's Martina Moraacova tying for fastest in another heat in 
54.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Rodolfo Falcon was fastest in the 50 backstroke in 24.71.  
</P>
<P>
	Other fastest qualifiers were Denmark's Sophia Skou in the  
women's 200 butterfly, Ukraine's Dmytro Kraevskyy in the men's 50 
breaststroke, Japan's Mai Nakamura in the women's 100 backstroke, 
and Canada's Joanne Malar in the women's 400 individual medley.

<HEADLINE> Home Health Outfit Settles for $61M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Olsten Corp., one of the nation's largest home  
health companies, said its Kimberly Home Health Care subsidiary 
will plead guilty to federal criminal charges and pay $61 million 
to settle a government fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal charges against Kimberly Home Health Care stemmed  
from a whistleblower lawsuit filed against hospital giant 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. charging Medicare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Justice Department, Columbia bought several  
Florida home-health agencies at artificially low prices from 
Kimberly, and then paid Olsten inflated fees to manage the 
agencies, apparently as a way to obtain more Medicare 
reimbursements from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia has been the target of a federal billing fraud  
investigation for more than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten said Tuesday that $10 million of the $61 million  
settlement would be paid in fines and penalties. Olsten did not 
disclose the specific criminal charges to which Kimberly Home 
Health Care will plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten said it has been assisting the government in its Medicare  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Melville, N.Y.-based Olsten said it will take a special  
after-tax charge of $70 million for the first quarter in connection 
with the settlement and a cost-cutting restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten said it will eliminate 8 percent of its 400 health  
staffing branch offices in the United States and Canada as part of 
the realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it will leave the hospice business and a  
number of home medical equipment markets; close or consolidate 15 
nursing branch offices across the United States, and continue a 
streamlining of billing and collection services. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading, shares of Olsten fell 37 1/2 cents to $6, on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Two slow-moving storm systems were menacing much of the West and  
the Southeast today, while March was going out like a lamb from the 
Southwest across the central Plains to the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure moving off the coast was expected to keep skies  
clear across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, allowing 
temperatures to climb well above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sluggish low pressure system over the Gulf Coast was  
bringing showers to Alabama, Georgia and western Florida, with 
significant rainfall totals expected. The bad weather should spread 
into the western Ohio Valley and Carolinas by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds gusting over 35 mph were expected in the Great Lakes and  
across the Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plains should remain dry through the day, but afternoon and  
evening thunderstorms -- featuring large hail and damaging winds -- 
were possible in Nebraska and South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong winds were also forecast in the southern and central  
Rockies and into the desert Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the rest of the West was expecting precipitation due to  
a low pressure area moving across northern Nevada and into Utah. 
Significant snowfall was forecast across the Intermountain West and 
the higher elevations of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Oregon and California expected rain showers, while dry  
weather was forecast for Washington and Montana. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Waddell Overcomes Injury To Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was the biggest win of Oza James Waddell Jr.'s life -- a  
second-place finish as the driver of Hutt Girl, an 8-year-old 
pacing mare, in a race for $2,500 claimers. 
</P>
<P>
	The race last week at Los Alamitos in Cypress, Calif., was a  
psychological victory as far as the 37-year-old Waddell was 
concerned. It was his first drive in a betting race. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell is paralyzed from the waist down, a result of being shot  
during a dispute at a party in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Waddell, who has had a trainer's license for many  
years, has driven in several qualifying races, but due to 
opposition by people in the sport, he was unable to get a 
provisional license to drive in a betting race until he went to 
court and won. He got the provisional license two weeks ago and 
hopes to get a regular license.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I proved I was no more of a danger, no more of threat of  
getting hurt than anybody else,'' Waddell said of his second-place 
finish behind 10-1 shot Hutt Girl, 3 3/4 lengths behind Canterbury 
Tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the Waddell's satisfaction was the reaction  
immediately after the race of driver Jim Lackey, who had opposed 
Waddell being permitted to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, `O.J., it was a great drive out there,''' Waddell  
said. `You were very cool out there, very safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference in Waddell's sulky and others is that the  
seat is two inches higher. He wears orthopedic braces to keep his 
legs straight in the stirrups, and the braces have latches that can 
be easily released in case of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the night even more special for Waddell, who grew up on a  
horse farm at Fontana, Calif., and now lives at Rialto, Calif., 
were the numerous family members and friends on hand, including his 
father, who had a stroke 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Waddell, who prefers to be called Oza -- ``I'm  
trying to get away from O.J., especially here in California.'' -- 
was a good enough wide receiver to be offered a football 
scholarship at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came that fateful party.  
</P>
<P>
	Waddell said there was some pushing and shoving and that one of  
those involved left and returned with a gun and shot him. The 
assailant was convicted, but Waddell's world was in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked my father to take me to the top of the hospital and  
throw me off,'' he recalled. ``He said, `Hey man, you're name is 
Waddell and Waddells are no quitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father also told him, ``You sit in a wheel chair the same  
way to sit in the sulky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has just taken a long time for Waddell to prove to doubters  
that once he's sitting in sulky, he's not just along for the ride, 
but that he is a competitive harness-racing driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win, but second place is all right with me,'' he  
said after his initial drive. ``I think I proved that I belong in 
this sport and that I'm serious about competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before ending a recent interview, Waddell said, ``If you can,  
put a word in for Christopher Reeve (the actor, who was paralyzed 
from the neck down when he fell off a horse). He's been a real 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So has Waddell -- to a lot of people.

<HEADLINE> McClelland, Crawford Named Top Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires don't like baseball players rating them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I give no credence whatsoever to those ratings,'' umpires  
union head Richie Phillips said Tuesday. ``I think they're patently 
absurd. I've even been told that some players had their kids fill 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim McClelland and Jerry Crawford are the top umpires, according  
to a survey by the players association, and Ken Kaiser and Charlie 
Williams are the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Players rated umpires on physical condition, physical and mental  
toughness, accuracy of calls on the bases, accuracy of calls at the 
plate, consistency, temperament, respect for players and overall 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	McClelland topped the AL ratings, followed by Jim Joyce, Rich  
Garcia, John Hirschbeck, Mike Reilly and Drew Coble. Kaiser was 
32nd and last, with Durwood Merrill 31st, Ted Hendry 30th, Joe 
Brinkman 29th and Dale Ford 28th. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, president of the umpires union, was tops in the NL,  
followed by Ed Rapuano, Ed Montague, Randy March, Frank Pulli and 
Jeff Kellogg. Williams was 36th and last, with Eric Gregg 35th, Joe 
West 34th, Bruce Froemming 33rd and Harry Wendelstedt 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Froemming are among the most confrontational umpires.  
West was last in the NL in both the respect for players and 
temperament categories and Froemming was next to last in both. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they thought players penalized  
confrontational umpires in their ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey was a players association initiative, and the  
players are certainly entitled to their opinion,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``I will point out that umpire popularity was a 
factor, and the skills and qualities of many fine umpires were 
distorted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, who is taking increased responsibility for  
umpires in his role as executive vice president of baseball 
operations in the commissioner's office, thought players ``were 
serious in their effort and tried to be as systematic and objective 
as possible.'' He said he didn't look at the survey until it became 
public this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the outset of my involvement with the umpires, I didn't  
necessarily want to be to be swayed by prior opinion,'' Alderson 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig declined  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at a guy like Bruce Froemming and how many times he's  
assigned by the league president to work big, important games, and 
then you see him rated next to last, what does that mean?'' 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew that worked last year's AL championship series, which  
was heavily criticized, had four members with poor ratings: Tim 
Welke (10th), Jim McKean (12th), Jim Evans (20th), John Schulock 
(21st), Larry Young (22nd) and Hendry (30th). 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series crew fared much better. It included Garcia  
(third), Tim Tschida (eighth) and Dale Scott (ninth) from the AL, 
and Crawford (first), Mark Hirschbeck (10th) and Dana DeMuth (11th) 
from the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings, which were distributed to players, were first  
reported earlier this week by the New York Post, USA Today and the 
Philadelphia Daily News. A copy was obtained by The Associated 
Press on Tuesday from a baseball source on the condition he not be 
identified.

<HEADLINE> Cassandra Wilson Honors Miles Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cassandra Wilson has no problem with paying  
tribute to Miles Davis on her new album, ``Traveling Miles.'' It's 
just a matter, she said, of separating Miles Davis the man from his 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old Wilson -- who has consistently sought to expand  
her role as a female jazz singer to assert herself as a composer, 
arranger and bandleader -- believes that ``women bring something 
very special'' to making jazz, hearing and constructing the music 
differently from men. 
</P>
<P>
	Her warm and spiritual approach contrasts with Davis'  
swaggering, macho image. The legendary trumpeter generally 
disdained working with female singers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to accept other human beings and their  
frailties,'' Wilson said. ``Now Miles Davis perhaps was not an 
exemplary person in terms of the way that he treated women, but you 
have to look at the total picture of Miles Davis and this 
incredible amount of music that he gave us. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his music, we see so much humanity. ... We hear all of the  
emotion, and we hear him able to deliver this emotion in such a 
beautiful, fine acute sense. He's able to pinpoint emotions 
beautifully, the way a singer does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, Wilson has immersed herself in Davis'  
music. She was commissioned by Jazz at Lincoln Center to give a 
six-night concert series interpreting Davis' music in December 
1997. Wilson then spent months reworking her interpretations for 
the recording of ``Traveling Miles,'' which was just released by 
Blue Note. She is now performing music from the album with her band 
on a six-week U.S. concert hall tour that runs through mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer has sought to reach out beyond the core jazz  
audience, appearing on the cover of Essence magazine and in an ad 
campaign for Coach leather goods. She also took part in last 
summer's Lilith Fair tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing when more and more people -- especially  
Americans -- begin to realize that this music we call jazz is so 
much a part of the fabric of our lives,'' she said. ``It's 
important to recognize and support it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson considers ``Traveling Miles'' to be the final part of a  
trilogy that began with her breakthrough 1993 album ``Blue Light 
'til Dawn'' and continued with the Grammy-winning ``New Moon 
Daughter'' in 1996. The basic building blocks linking the trilogy, 
she said, are ``the beauty and majesty of the blues'' and ``jazz -- 
the blues' favorite daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On her previous albums, Wilson acknowledged some of her musical  
roots with an eclectic repertoire that encompassed Mississippi 
Delta blues (Robert Johnson and Son House), folk (Joni Mitchell and 
Van Morrison), country (Hank Williams) and pop (U2, Neil Young and 
The Monkees), as well as her own originals -- all sung in her husky, 
sensual contralto voice. 
</P>
<P>
	But on ``Traveling Miles,'' she goes back to her earliest and  
perhaps most important musical influence. As a young girl growing 
up in Jackson, Miss., she was exposed to Davis' music through her 
father, bassist and guitarist Herman Fowlkes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first music that I heard as a 5- or 6-year-old was Miles  
Davis' `Sketches of Spain' because my father was a real big fan of 
Miles,'' recalled Wilson, who lives in a Harlem apartment building 
where Duke Ellington once lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the record I remember the most because it had such an  
expansive feel to it. ... It was different from the rest of the 
jazz albums that my daddy listened to a lot. ... It lent itself to 
a child's imagination really easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has remained Wilson's spiritual father through the years.  
The spare, understated arrangements on her most recent albums evoke 
Davis' use of space. As a bandleader, she shares Davis' knack for 
putting together a strong supporting cast, featuring such 
top-flight musicians on ``Traveling Miles'' as bassist Dave 
Holland, cornetist Olu Dara, guitarist Pat Metheny and Steve 
Coleman, a saxophonist who helped Wilson break into the New York 
scene in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Davis, Wilson believes in breaking the rules, by changing  
styles and using the pop hits and rhythms of the day. Her lyrics to 
the title song, which she wrote after Davis' death in 1991, could 
just as easily apply to the singer as to the trumpet innovator: 
``Traveling Miles-Crossing time-Shifting style-Traveling Miles and 
Miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In `Traveling Miles,' you have a melody that meanders,'' she  
said. ``... It's a song about traveling physically and also about 
traveling spiritually, traveling to the music, always in motion, 
celebrating that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides four original compositions inspired by Davis' music,  
Wilson crafted her own lyrics to instrumental numbers either 
written by Davis or played by his band, including such classics as 
``Seven Steps to Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson doesn't try to re-create the sound of any of Davis' bands  
-- her core group on many of the pieces has two guitarists, a 
percussionist and rhythm section, but no front-line horn player. 
</P>
<P>
	But her choices for the album, which she produced, recap every  
major phase of Davis' career. The trumpeter's bluesy, lyrical 
approach of the '50s is represented by ``Someday My Prince Will 
Come'' and ``Blue in Green.'' From Davis' innovative 1960s quintet, 
there are ``Seven Steps to Heaven'' and Wayne Shorter's ``ESP.'' 
His influential 1969 ``Bitches Brew'' album -- which used electronic 
instruments and rock rhythms -- yields the funky ``Run the Voodoo 
Down.'' And from the '80s, when Davis' electronic band turned anew 
to ballads and popular songs of the day, comes Cyndi Lauper's 
``Time After Time'' and Marcus Miller's ``Resurrection Blues 
(Tutu).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson spent almost a year sifting through Davis' immense  
repertoire to find those tunes that worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you choose a song, it's generally because you can get  
inside of it, you can inhabit it,'' she said. ``I found that the 
material really came to me instead of me going after it. It would 
just pop out and it would resonate and make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Z-Car Will Return in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ailing Nissan Motor Co. plans a needed image  
transfusion: The Japanese automaker confirmed Wednesday it will 
resurrect the Z sports car that helped make it an automotive force 
in the United States back in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Z-car was known as the Datsun 240-Z and was largely  
a U.S. phenomenon. It was inexpensive, fast, sporty and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version, which will debut no later than the 2002 model  
year, will simply be called the ``Z.'' It will be sold worldwide; 
officials said that in some markets, it may be branded as a 
Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Renault SA announced last week that it was buying a 37  
percent stake in debt-ridden Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement at the New York International Auto Show  
was made by Minoru Nakamura, president and CEO of Nissan North 
America Inc., who borrowed a theme from the baseball movie ``Field 
of Dreams'': ``If you build it, they will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura stood on a stage amid a fake cornfield and shouted,  
``We will build it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said the strong positive reaction to the Z concept car  
since it was unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show convinced 
executives in Japan to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been overwhelmed with letters from all over the world to  
go forth,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design 
International in La Jolla, Calif. ``This a company that needs to 
get back in the business of doing passionate products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan wants the Z to be more than a niche vehicle and hopes its  
price in the mid-$20,000 range will make it more affordable than 
most of the two-seaters that have crowded the sports car market in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reincarnation represents a big gamble for Nissan.  
</P>
<P>
	If the car succeeds, it will help erase Nissan's reputation for  
bland styling and lure more customers into Nissan showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Should it flop, it will exacerbate Nissan's woes. The company is  
mired in nearly $20 billion in debt and is about to embark on the 
$5.4 billion deal with Renault, in which the French automaker plans 
to subject Nissan to a heavy dose of cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the motivation the corporation needed during what  
has been, after all, rather difficult times for us with our minds 
on a few other things, such as learning French and staying in 
business,'' Hirshberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the Z, while risky, seemed like just the right thing to do  
at exactly this kind of time,'' he said. ``It says to the world, 
`We're playing hardball.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirshberg said the concept car, which was created in just four  
weeks, will be further refined and that the finished production 
model will be ``bolder.'' It likely will be rear-drive and powered 
by either a four- or six-cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan plans to follow up the coupe with a convertible.  
</P>
<P>
	``While it will retain some reference to its heritage, it will  
not be a `retromobile.' It will be a forward-looking car because we 
think the car has to resonate with people for whom `Z' is just a 
letter in the alphabet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan picked New York for the announcement because the original  
240Z was unveiled here in October 1969. The show opens to the 
public Saturday and runs through April 11.

<HEADLINE> More Taxpayers Using E-Filing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drawn by the promise of swifter refunds and  
reduced chances of error, Americans are warming up to electronic 
tax filing -- but paper still rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people doing their taxes on computers and filing  
electronically has shot up 156 percent compared to last year. But 
the 1.7 million returns prepared at home on computers through March 
26 represent a tiny fraction of the total of 63.1 million returns 
filed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting returns prepared by professionals and simple returns  
filed over the telephone, total electronic returns have reached 24 
million, up more than 16 percent from last year, according to 
Internal Revenue Service figures released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One major reason people are turning to electronic filing is the  
quick turnaround time for a refund, an average of 15 days compared 
to a minimum of 35 days for a paper return. And ``e-filed'' returns 
are easier to screen for simple math or processing errors, which 
can then be sent back to the taxpayer and corrected without major 
IRS hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain problems we can identify, send the return  
back to you and that way you can correct it up front,'' said Terry 
Lutes, director of IRS electronic program operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has aggressively marketed e-filing, including a mailing  
to taxpayers who used computers last year that had a new personal 
identification number to be used in place of a paper ``signature'' 
form. But most of the estimated 126 million returns the IRS expects 
to get this year still will be on paper, despite these advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are just technophobes,'' said Eddie Feinstein,  
director of electronic commerce at H&AMP;R Block. ``They're afraid 
their data is going to be corrupted. Some people fear they're more 
likely to be audited. Some people just enjoy going down to the post 
office on April 15th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not much can be done about technophobes or the April 15 post  
office visitors. But the IRS says people should not worry that 
their returns will get messed up or fear they are upping their 
audit chances by filing electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, returns don't get zapped directly through the  
Internet to the IRS. They go through providers such as Intuit -- 
maker of the leading TurboTax and MacIntax software -- or via 
professionals such as firms like H&AMP;R Block. 
</P>
<P>
	These providers transmit returns directly to the IRS service  
centers and must undergo detailed background checks first. There 
have been instances of fraud, but Lutes said it's usually a small 
professional firm attempting to sneak in a few bad returns and 
pocket the fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had an instance of anybody breaking into the  
system,'' Lutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	People can obtain computer filing software over the Internet,  
and some sites offer tax preparation services. But Gene Goldenberg, 
vice president at Block Financial Corp., said consumer research 
shows a reluctance to do taxes on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still mortally afraid to put most personal  
information directly on the Web,'' said Goldenberg, whose firm 
publishes Kiplinger TaxCut software. 
</P>
<P>
	As for audits, Lutes said IRS uses the same selection process  
for electronic returns and those on paper. While the electronic 
returns are easier to check for errors, that doesn't make them more 
likely to be audited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found no reason to believe that e-filing is  
disadvantageous in terms of the audit process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some glitches have occurred this year, particularly during the  
peak electronic period of late January and early February. H&AMP;R 
Block's Feinstein said the high volume caused some problems for 
preparers transmitting returns to the Cincinnati IRS service 
center, and there were initial delays in direct bank deposits of 
some refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a period of time there, it was painful,'' he said. But  
Feinstein said IRS responded promptly and solved the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One other area of electronic growth for the IRS is its program  
of accepting both state and federal income tax returns at once. 
With paper, that would have been unwieldy, but only a few IRS 
keystrokes send the electronic state version to the proper place. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of 24 million federal returns filed electronically, there  
were 7 million state returns attached -- an increase of 47 percent 
from last year. Thus far, 35 states offer the shared return. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Lutes said the IRS is close to its goal of 20 percent  
growth compared with last year. But it will take major changes to 
reach the long-term objective of 80 percent of all returns filed 
electronically by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the comfort level is beginning to grow. We want to be  
in a position to grow with it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Pour Out of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands more refugees streamed out of  
the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo Wednesday, some saying 
Serb police burned their homes, herded them into trains and shipped 
them off to neighboring Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's defense minister said there were reports that Yugoslav  
forces have been killing or locking up ethnic Albanian men and 
teen-age boys in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States approved $50 million in urgent new aid to the  
refugees, which included the first significant numbers from 
Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Their accounts were similar to those 
told by people fleeing other parts of the province in Serbia, the 
main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, like cattle we were put on the street. We didn't  
know where to go. We left the house open and nothing is there 
now,'' said Sabri Hajzeri, 30, an artist from Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	With international monitors gone and virtually all foreign  
journalists kicked out of Kosovo, the refugees' claims were 
impossible to verify. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's U.N. representative, Vladislav Jovanovic, denied on  
CNN that Serbs were forcing ethnic Albanians to leave Kosovo and 
accused NATO of manufacturing an artificial human catastrophe 
because it is losing support for the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Tuesday from Germany said ethnic Albanian leader  
Ibrahim Rugova had been injured and had gone into hiding. However, 
Serb authorities on Wednesday allowed a small group of interviewers 
to see Rugova at his Pristina home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here for eight days after my return from Paris  
(peace talks) with my family. I would like to say only that I am 
alive,'' Rugova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bombing began a week ago, at least 118,000 people have  
fled Kosovo, most of them to Albania, NATO said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, which had been blocking entry by many Kosovo  
refugees, finally relented and allowed about 8,000 people to cross 
the northern border Wednesday as international officials scrambled 
to set up emergency reception centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration offered $50 million in food and  
supplies that will be delivered by U.S. military airlift. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those in Macedonia, thousands more fled into  
Albania and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, although officials 
in both places said it was impossible to provide an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, citing  
refugee reports, said Serb forces may have expelled up to 50,000 
ethnic Albanians from the southwestern town of Pec and then burned 
and looted shops and homes throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said there was growing  
evidence that Yugoslav forces have set up concentration camps in 
Kosovo for ethnic Albanian men and teen-age boys. He gave no 
details but indicated NATO was trying to confirm their existence. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Pristina refugees interviewed on the Albanian border  
said they had firsthand information about ``concentration camps'' 
but several claimed they had head rumors of them. 
</P>
<P>
	At a border crossing inside Macedonia at Blace, two trainloads  
of Kosovo refugees camped out Wednesday and hundreds of other 
ethnic Albanians were entering by car and foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers joined about 14,000 other Kosovo Albanians whom  
the United Nations estimates had already entered Macedonia, a 
former Yugoslav republic, since NATO air attacks began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had spent more than a day in the no-man's land separating  
Yugoslavia and Macedonia. They claimed Serb police torched their 
homes, packed them into a train for Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left (my neighborhood) while my house was still burning,''  
said Selvete Gujunovsci, 28, a mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albanian capital Tirana, the army, aided by the  
International Red Cross, began setting up a tent city for about 
2,000 Kosovo refugees brought there from the border in the last few 
days. Albanian soldiers were distributing clothing, but some 
refugees complained that there were only six toilets for hundreds 
of people.

forces have been killing or locking up ethnic Albanian men and 
teen-age boys in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States approved $50 million in urgent new aid to the  
refugees, which included the first significant numbers from 
Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Their accounts were similar to those 
told by people fleeing other parts of the province in Serbia, the 
main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, like cattle we were put on the street. We didn't  
know where to go. We left the house open and nothing is there 
now,'' said Sabri Hajzeri, 30, an artist from Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	With international monitors gone and virtually all foreign  
journalists kicked out of Kosovo, the refugees' claims were 
impossible to verify. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's U.N. representative, Vladislav Jovanovic, denied on  
CNN that Serbs were forcing ethnic Albanians to leave Kosovo and 
accused NATO of manufacturing an artificial human catastrophe 
because it is losing support for the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Tuesday from Germany said ethnic Albanian leader  
Ibrahim Rugova had been injured and had gone into hiding. However, 
Serb authorities on Wednesday allowed a small group of interviewers 
to see Rugova at his Pristina home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here for eight days after my return from Paris  
(peace talks) with my family. I would like to say only that I am 
alive,'' Rugova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bombing began a week ago, at least 118,000 people have  
fled Kosovo, most of them to Albania, NATO said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, which had been blocking entry by many Kosovo  
refugees, finally relented and allowed about 8,000 people to cross 
the northern border Wednesday as international officials scrambled 
to set up emergency reception centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration offered $50 million in food and  
supplies that will be delivered by U.S. military airlift. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those in Macedonia, thousands more fled into  
Albania and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, although officials 
in both places said it was impossible to provide an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, citing  
refugee reports, said Serb forces may have expelled up to 50,000 
ethnic Albanians from the southwestern town of Pec and then burned 
and looted shops and homes throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said there was growing  
evidence that Yugoslav forces have set up concentration camps in 
Kosovo for ethnic Albanian men and teen-age boys. He gave no 
details but indicated NATO was trying to confirm their existence. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Pristina refugees interviewed on the Albanian border  
said they had firsthand information about ``concentration camps'' 
but several claimed they had head rumors of them. 
</P>
<P>
	At a border crossing inside Macedonia at Blace, two trainloads  
of Kosovo refugees camped out Wednesday and hundreds of other 
ethnic Albanians were entering by car and foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers joined about 14,000 other Kosovo Albanians whom  
the United Nations estimates had already entered Macedonia, a 
former Yugoslav republic, since NATO air attacks began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had spent more than a day in the no-man's land separating  
Yugoslavia and Macedonia. They claimed Serb police torched their 
homes, packed them into a train for Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left (my neighborhood) while my house was still burning,''  
said Selvete Gujunovsci, 28, a mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albanian capital Tirana, the army, aided by the  
International Red Cross, began setting up a tent city for about 
2,000 Kosovo refugees brought there from the border in the last few 
days. Albanian soldiers were distributing clothing, but some 
refugees complained that there were only six toilets for hundreds 
of people.

<HEADLINE> Investment Firm To Pay $2.8 Million Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York investment firm and one of its  
executives will pay close to $3 million to resolve a complaint that 
the company withheld a crucial document when asking antitrust 
regulators to bless a $320 million nursing home buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackstone Capital Partners II Merchant Banking Fund L.P. will  
pay the maximum $2.8 million civil penalty. Fund general partner 
Howard Lipson agreed to pay $50,000, according to a civil lawsuit 
and settlement filed jointly Tuesday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement marked the first time an executive was held  
individually liable for violating the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust 
law, said Federal Trade Commission antitrust chief William J. Baer. 
The 1976 law is designed to give antitrust regulators a window for 
vetting certain kinds of proposed mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC and the Justice Department Antitrust Division said  
Blackstone did not turn over a memorandum that raised antitrust 
concerns about the 1996 deal to buy a Batesville, Ind., chain of 
nursing homes and cemeteries called Prime Succession Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipson was singled out because he certified that information  
given to antitrust regulators was complete, when he knew or should 
have known it was not, Baer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipson, who still works for Blackstone, declined to comment. A  
lawyer for the firm, Charles E. Koob, did not return a telephone 
call requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackstone filing omitted ``one of the most central  
documents in defendant Blackstone's possession,'' the complaint 
said. The internal memo identified Blackstone's partner in the 
deal, Loewen Group International Inc., as a competitor to Prime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lipson knew the transaction might draw the attention of the  
antitrust agencies and he also knew that any significant delay to 
the transaction might jeopardize its consummation,'' a statement 
from the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	No regulators caught the potential antitrust problem before the  
Prime deal went through, but the FTC discovered the missing 
document some months later when Loewen filed papers in a separate 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	After inquiries from the FTC, Blackstone amended its filing and  
submitted the missing document. Loewen, headquartered in Burnaby, 
British Columbia, and a U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay $500,000 to 
settle a similar complaint a year ago.

<HEADLINE>  Soccer Rocker Hits Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- At the top of a hill overlooking  
Interstate 35, the goateed face of Alexi Lalas looms from a 
billboard two stories high. Next to his face, two words: ``Soccer. 
Rocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on the other half of the billboard, one-quarter the size of  
Lalas' face, appears the logo of Lalas' latest team, Major League 
Soccer's Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lalas isn't bigger than the team, the red-haired defender,  
once a fixture on the U.S. national team, is clearly one of the 
biggest things to hit Kansas City in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the nation's most recognizable soccer player,  
Lalas is a bona fide off-field celebrity -- a veteran of late-night 
television, a TV pitchman (remember the ESPN spot with Keith 
Olbermann smashing Lalas' guitar right in the middle of ``Michael, 
Row Your Boat Ashore''?) and a rock musician with his own CD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's my shtick,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	It's an act that's playing well in Kansas City.  
</P>
<P>
	Lalas already is in line for his own radio show. The 28-year-old  
player can't go out for an evening without being approached by 
streams of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's gratifying when people just come up and say,  
`Welcome to town,''' said Lalas, who came to the Wizards with 
national team goalkeeper Tony Meola in an offseason trade with the 
New York-New Jersey MetroStars. ``It's never been a drag, never 
been a hassle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of attention is just what the Wizards need. They  
ranked last in attendance in the 12-team MLS last year, averaging 
8,072 fans -- the only team below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS commissioner Doug Logan has said attendance in Kansas City  
remains a concern. And critics of the trade say the Wizards really 
need someone to jump-start an offense that scored just 45 goals 
last season, second-lowest in the league. The team hasn't scored 
yet in two losses this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Which raises a question: Were Lalas and Meola -- especially Lalas  
-- brought in to draw fans or produce winning soccer? 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the trade based on their playing abilities,'' general  
manager Doug Newman said. ``The fact that they are also marquee 
names and very marketable is certainly a bonus, but we don't make 
any trades based on marquee issues. We have to put the team 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Meola, who could miss half the season with a knee injury,  
bristles at being cast in the role of box-office draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been saying since I got here that my major purpose is to  
win games,'' he said. ``All the other things are so secondary to 
me. If they happen, they're great. But if they don't happen, that's 
what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lalas, the first American to play in Italy's top league,  
says he's heard the word ``savior'' used more than once since he 
arrived -- and not because of his soccer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He shies at characterizing himself as the solution to the  
Wizards' attendance woes, but he embraces the role of soccer 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of my responsibility,'' he said. ``I have my  
soccer goals, which are first and foremost -- but I also have goals 
off the field, and to increase attendance and awareness is one of 
my goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As proud as I am when we win and when I do well on the field,  
I'm just as proud as when people recognize players, and come up to 
me on the street and say they're coming to the game -- because 
that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to introduce Americans to pro soccer was the main  
reason Lalas left the Italian club Padova for MLS when the league 
formed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing against the guys who stayed over there, but I made a  
personal choice,'' he said. ``I could have stayed over there and 
made money -- not that I'm not making money here. But this was 
something important to me, that when I was done I wouldn't just 
left something on the field but off the field, to have done 
something for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ron Newman likes the idea of having high-profile U.S.  
players on his roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me, and I screamed quite loudly three years ago,  
that it's here that the American icons should be,'' the coach said. 
``There's not enough Mexicans in this area, enough Colombians, 
enough Irish, enough Brits -- so there's not that ethnic base for 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move by the league, and now Kansas City  
has to take the opportunity to make it work.''

<HEADLINE> College Teams Combine for 16 HRs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico and New Mexico State  
combined for 16 homers at Lobo Field on Tuesday, one shy of the 
NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lobos, who won 28-18, hit 10 homers, eclipsing the school  
record of six. New Mexico State (12-21) tied its school record with 
six homers. Louisville and Western Illinois combined for an 
NCAA-record 17 home runs in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Scott Candelaria hit two home runs with five RBIs to  
lead the way for New Mexico (15-19-1) as eight starters homered. 
Ironically, second baseman Lon Yamaguchi, the school's career 
leader with 36 home runs, was the only Lobos starter not to homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lobos' 28 runs also set a school single-game record, while  
their 28 hits were two shy of the school mark set against Hawaii in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico, leading 8-7 in the third inning, blew the game open  
with 10 runs on nine hits, including a solo homer by Candelaria, 
and two-run homers by outfielders Mike Campbell and Miguel Montiel. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Steve Elzy went 5-for-6 with five RBIs for the Lobos.  
Third baseman Aaron Sisk was 3-for-6, and has homered in six 
straight for New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Chris Weekly hit two homers and drove in six runs for  
New Mexico State, which had 21 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Vance Bonner (4-2) picked up the win despite allowing 10 runs on  
11 hits in four innings. Aggies starter Pat Leach (2-7) allowed 18 
runs, 10 earned, on 18 hits in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	All nine Lobos starters had at least two hits and two runs  
scored, while every Aggies starter had at least one hit.

<HEADLINE> GM Not Compelled To Buy Saab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of General Motors Corp. appeared  
to be a cautious shopper Tuesday when asked about the prospects for 
buying the 50 percent of Sweden's Saab Automobile AB that GM does 
not yet own. 
</P>
<P>
	GM President G. Richard Wagoner Jr., said his company was in the  
process of analyzing whether it makes sense to expand its Saab 
investment, but that so far he saw ``no compelling reason'' to 
exercise the option. 
</P>
<P>
	``This co-ownership has worked out pretty well,'' he told  
reporters during the media preview of the New York International 
Auto Show. ``I can't think of a single incident where having two 50 
percent owners resulted in not doing what was right for the 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM acquired half of Saab from the Swedish holding company  
Investor AB for $600 million in 1989 and has an option to buy the 
remaining half for the six months starting on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Saab's chief executive suggested that an  
acquisition might be costly, given the automaker's recent sales 
gains and improving financial balance sheet.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 38 After Being Up 88 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were moderately lower today as  
interest rates rose in response to several reports of the economy's 
continuing strength. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 38.02 at 9,875.24. The Dow rose as high as 10,002.06, up 
88.80, in the first hour of trading but quickly retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, a Dow component, was down 3 3/16 at 34 5/8,  
translating to a 13-point loss in the blue-chip index. Philip 
Morris and other tobacco stocks fell after an Oregon jury ordered 
the cigarette maker to pay $81 million to the family of a man who 
died of lung cancer after smoking Marlboros for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 3.82 at 1,296.93, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 0.74 at 2,496.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues edged past advancers with 1,435 up, 1,538 down  
and 563 unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came 
to 693.45 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks came under pressure after prices fell and yields rose in  
the bond market in response to a report from the Purchasing 
Management Association of Chicago. The report, which showed that 
the manufacturing sector in that region strengthened during March, 
is considered a precursor of the national purchasing managers' 
report due out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year Treasury traded at 5.62 percent, up  
from 5.58 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross  
domestic product surged at a 6 percent annual rate during the 
fourth quarter, close to the department's earlier estimate of up 
6.1 percent. GDP increased by a robust 3.9 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A price index tied to the GDP rose just 1 percent in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	But the government's corporate profit report, which is the  
bottom line for stock investors, was less upbeat. Its first 
estimate of after-tax corporate profits showed a drop at an annual 
rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, the third quarterly 
decline of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all of 1998, profits slipped 2.2 percent, the first drop  
since 1989, when earnings fell 4.8 percent in a precursor to the 
1990-91 recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had a bit of a reaction in the bond market to the Chicago  
report,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward 
Jones of St. Louis, although I think the silver lining is that the 
economy is still strong. What the stock market should recognize is 
that ultimately, the strength of the economy will lead to stronger 
corporate profts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks in general were lower. Dow component Procter &AMP;  
Gamble was down 1 5/16 at 98 13/16. Coca-Cola, still reeling from a 
report of lower sales on Tuesday, was down 2 1/4 at 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow member IBM was up 3/16 at 178 3/4 Dell was up 1 31/32 at 41  
27/32 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Pledge Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The prime ministers of Britain  
and Ireland resumed negotiations with Northern Ireland's 
politicians today in hopes of keeping the nearly year-old peace 
accord from unraveling over the IRA's refusal to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	But the marathon efforts of Britain's Tony Blair and Ireland's  
Bertie Ahern suffered a setback when the Irish Republican Army 
issued a much-anticipated policy statement that failed to mention 
disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and Ahern have been trying since Monday to get local  
politicians to agree on terms for forming a new Protestant-Catholic 
government, the centerpiece of last year's Good Friday agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the landmark accord depends on forming the 12-member  
government, which is supposed to receive powers gradually from the 
British and pursue joint policy-making with Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholics bill the latter step as likely to promote the eventual  
abolition of Northern Ireland, a Protestant-majority state founded 
in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	But the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, is  
insisting the IRA -- now 20 months into a truce after violently 
destabilizing Northern Ireland for 27 years -- must start to disarm 
before the outlawed group's Sinn Fein party can receive two posts 
in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous IRA statements, the group has insisted it will never  
surrender its weapons, even though the peace accord requires the 
group to completely disarm by May 2000 in cooperation with an 
international commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's statement emphasized that the IRA's cease-fire would be  
all it had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past five years, we have called and maintained two  
prolonged cessations of military operations to enhance the 
democratic process and underline our definitive commitment to its 
success,'' the statement said. ``We have contributed in a real and 
meaningful way to the creation of a climate which would facilitate 
the search for a durable peace settlement. IRA guns are silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he arrived for today's talks, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel  
McLaughlin reiterated his party's position that any IRA arms 
gesture was ``absolutely unachievable in the context of this 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After talking with Blair and Ahern late Tuesday, Ulster Unionist  
negotiators emphasized peaceful words would not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still waiting for Sinn Fein and the IRA to honor their  
side of the agreement,'' said Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, 
who would lead the government. He said his supporters required 
``deeds, not more words. We have had more than enough words from 
Sinn Fein.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Wilson Has Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- New York Mets pitcher Paul Wilson  
had reconstructive surgery on his right elbow Wednesday, an 
operation that is expected to sideline him for 9-12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 25, the top pick in the 1994 draft, found out earlier  
this month that he had torn a ligament. Dr. James Andrews performed 
the surgery in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has not pitched in the major leagues since 1996.  
Following surgery on his right shoulder, he wasn't able to play in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An elbow injury last year limited him to only 57 innings in the  
minors last year. He was supposed to start this season at Triple-A 
Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Rocker Hits Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- At the top of a hill overlooking  
Interstate 35, the goateed face of Alexi Lalas looms from a 
billboard two stories high. Next to his face, two words: ``Soccer. 
Rocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on the other half of the billboard, one-quarter the size of  
Lalas' face, appears the logo of Lalas' latest team, Major League 
Soccer's Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lalas isn't bigger than the team, the red-haired defender,  
once a fixture on the U.S. national team, is clearly one of the 
biggest things to hit Kansas City in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the nation's most recognizable soccer player,  
Lalas is a bona fide off-field celebrity -- a veteran of late-night 
television, a TV pitchman (remember the ESPN spot with Keith 
Olbermann smashing Lalas' guitar right in the middle of ``Michael, 
Row Your Boat Ashore''?) and a rock musician with his own CD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's my shtick,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	It's an act that's playing well in Kansas City.  
</P>
<P>
	Lalas already is in line for his own radio show. The 28-year-old  
player can't go out for an evening without being approached by 
streams of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's gratifying when people just come up and say,  
`Welcome to town,''' said Lalas, who came to the Wizards with 
national team goalkeeper Tony Meola in an offseason trade with the 
New York-New Jersey MetroStars. ``It's never been a drag, never 
been a hassle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of attention is just what the Wizards need. They  
ranked last in attendance in the 12-team MLS last year, averaging 
8,072 fans -- the only team below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS commissioner Doug Logan has said attendance in Kansas City  
remains a concern. And critics of the trade say the Wizards really 
need someone to jump-start an offense that scored just 45 goals 
last season, second-lowest in the league. The team hasn't scored 
yet in two losses this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Which raises a question: Were Lalas and Meola -- especially Lalas  
-- brought in to draw fans or produce winning soccer? 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the trade based on their playing abilities,'' general  
manager Doug Newman said. ``The fact that they are also marquee 
names and very marketable is certainly a bonus, but we don't make 
any trades based on marquee issues. We have to put the team 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Meola, who could miss half the season with a knee injury,  
bristles at being cast in the role of box-office draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been saying since I got here that my major purpose is to  
win games,'' he said. ``All the other things are so secondary to 
me. If they happen, they're great. But if they don't happen, that's 
what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lalas, the first American to play in Italy's top league,  
says he's heard the word ``savior'' used more than once since he 
arrived -- and not because of his soccer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He shies at characterizing himself as the solution to the  
Wizards' attendance woes, but he embraces the role of soccer 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of my responsibility,'' he said. ``I have my  
soccer goals, which are first and foremost -- but I also have goals 
off the field, and to increase attendance and awareness is one of 
my goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As proud as I am when we win and when I do well on the field,  
I'm just as proud as when people recognize players, and come up to 
me on the street and say they're coming to the game -- because 
that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to introduce Americans to pro soccer was the main  
reason Lalas left the Italian club Padova for MLS when the league 
formed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing against the guys who stayed over there, but I made a  
personal choice,'' he said. ``I could have stayed over there and 
made money -- not that I'm not making money here. But this was 
something important to me, that when I was done I wouldn't just 
left something on the field but off the field, to have done 
something for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ron Newman likes the idea of having high-profile U.S.  
players on his roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me, and I screamed quite loudly three years ago,  
that it's here that the American icons should be,'' the coach said. 
``There's not enough Mexicans in this area, enough Colombians, 
enough Irish, enough Brits -- so there's not that ethnic base for 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move by the league, and now Kansas City  
has to take the opportunity to make it work.''

<HEADLINE> Activists Win Some Vs. McDonald's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A pair of vegetarian activists won a partial  
victory Wednesday in their struggle to overturn a court decision 
that they libeled McDonald's Corp. by accusing it of selling food 
that can cause heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that Dave Morris and Helen  
Steel were justified in claiming that regular customers of the 
hamburger chain face a heightened risk of heart trouble. The judges 
also said it was fair to say McDonald's subjected its employees to 
poor working conditions and paid them badly. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges upheld much of the original judgment, however.  
</P>
<P>
	They agreed with the trial judge that Morris and Steel had  
defamed McDonald's by claiming its products were poisonous and 
increased the risk of cancer and that the company contributed to 
starvation and deforestation in developing countries where it buys 
much of its beef. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charge about food poisoning is especially serious for  
companies engaged in the restaurant business, as are those about 
cancer risks, to the extent that those were not justified,'' the 
ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges reduced the amount of damages that Morris and Steel  
must pay to $61,300 from $92,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great vindication for the campaign against  
McDonald's,'' Morris said after Lord Justice Malcolm Pill announced 
the ruling at the Royal Courts of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Campaigners around the world have now the backing of the  
British courts in their opposition to McDonald's business 
practices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 45, and Steel, 33, were seeking to reverse a 1997  
judgment that they had slandered McDonald's by distributing 
leaflets entitled ``What's wrong with McDonald's? Everything they 
don't want you to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case, known widely as ``McLibel,'' lasted 314 days in court  
and was the longest trial in English history. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Restaurants Ltd., the British division of the Oak  
Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp., issued a statement saying it 
welcomed Wednesday's ruling for upholding key parts of the original 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central issue of nutrition, the statement said:  
``McDonald's has always stressed the importance of a balanced diet 
and lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although McDonald's won the original judgment, it was  
embarrassed when the trial judge ruled that large parts of the 
leaflet were true. The judge agreed that McDonald's was responsible 
for animal cruelty, that it exploited children through its 
advertising and that it paid its workers in Britain poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, an unemployed single parent, and Steel, a part-time  
bartender, conducted their own defense, while McDonald's, the 
largest U.S. fast-food restaurant company, is estimated to have 
spent $16 million on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists said they planned to appeal Wednesday's ruling to  
the House of Lords, Britain's highest court.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Warship To Monitor NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Adding a show of force to its protest against NATO  
raids on Yugoslavia, Russia said Wednesday it is sending a warship 
to the Mediterranean and putting others on standby. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came the same day Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov returned to Moscow after failing to persuade Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to revive talks on ending the Kosovo 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said one warship of the Black Sea  
Fleet would leave Friday and another six were also ready to go ``to 
ensure Russia's security when the defense ministry considers it 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense ministry is also considering more decisive actions  
that will be recommended to the leadership if the situation 
changes,'' Sergeyev said, refusing to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin and other top officials have said  
repeatedly that Russia will not get involved militarily in the 
conflict around the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appearance of a Russian naval squadron in the  
Mediterranean would irk NATO commanders and add to already tense 
situation in the region, where U.S. and allied warships are 
deployed for operations against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
the move was not a ``particularly helpful gesture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large  
deployment might send to Belgrade and other countries in the 
region,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev did not say what kind of ship Russia was sending first.  
In Turkey, the foreign ministry said it had approved a Russian 
request for passage through the Bosporus, beginning Saturday, of 
one cruiser, two destroyers, two patrol ships and three support 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
	While any Russian deployment of warships would likely be  
symbolic, it's a step up in the Russian response, which so far has 
remained largely limited to vociferous verbal protests. Moscow has 
also recalled its representative at NATO and suspended all contacts 
with the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Russian politicians have demanded that Russia break the  
international arms embargo on Yugoslavia and supply Belgrade with 
air defense missiles and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional governor Alexander Lebed, a presidential hopeful and  
former general, called Wednesday for sending air defense missiles 
to Yugoslavia in some of his strongest statements yet on the NATO 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must declare that we will render military and technical aid  
to Yugoslavia with the aim of supporting the civilian population,'' 
said Lebed, adding that Russia should declare Yugoslavia a ``zone 
of strategic interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, Lebed argued on NTV television that the  
military help to Yugoslavia would help save Europe from what he 
described as U.S. domination. ``Their idea of peacemaking is 
hitting a mosquito on your forehead with an ax,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian military is in shambles and the nation badly  
needs foreign loans to crawl out of one of the worst recessions 
ever experienced by an industrial country. That effectively 
deprives Russia of an opportunity to give military help to its 
Yugoslav ally and confines its response to symbolic steps. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Russian news reports, the Black Sea Fleet is  
suffering an especially acute fuel shortage and has had little 
training lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the Russian capital following his meeting with  
Milosevic in Belgrade, Primakov said the Yugoslav leader gave a 
``signal'' that he was ready to revive peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia will continue efforts to end this not clever and  
tragically wrong decision to continue the military action against 
Yugoslavia,'' Primakov said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks End Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index slipped in  
volatile trading today, the last day of Japan's fiscal year. The 
dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.98 yen at late afternoon, down 0.02 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also lower than its level of 120.36 
yen in New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 22.53 points, or 0.14  
percent, closing the day at 15,836.59. On Tuesday, the index lost 
149.72 points, or 0.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened the session slightly higher following  
weakness in Nikkei futures and an overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average soon moved into negative territory on  
profit-taking following the market's recent strong gains, losing as 
much as 207 points before reducing some of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The average has climbed about 15 percent this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. pension funds were buying for window dressing purposes  
throughout the day,'' said Dhia Amir, senior institutional sales 
trader at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that buying was outpaced by domestic  
profit taking and selling by investors with bonds linked to the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was moderate, with about 480 million shares changing  
hands on the exchange's first section, compared with Tuesday's 
turnover of 464 million shares. Advances outnumbered retreaters 716 
to 460, with 137 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,267.22. 
The TOPIX had risen 0.57 points, or 0.04 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar moved as high as 120.98 yen earlier today  
on strong buying from Japanese financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback later shed its early gains on selling by  
Japanese exporters and overseas players, including U.S. funds, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was relatively range bound in Tokyo today, the last day  
of Japan's fiscal year. Japan's new fiscal year begins on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.90 yen and 120.98 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.59 yen, lower  
from 128.78 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.745 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.740 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE>  New Mexico Hoops Eyes NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- On his first day in town, newly hired  
New Mexico coach Fran Fraschilla promised to turn the Lobos' 
schedule from fast food to filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about New Mexico-UConn?'' Fraschilla said. ``The only way  
to get to the top is to go after the guy at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 40, was hired Saturday to take over a program that  
under Dave Bliss gained moderate national prominence. The Lobos 
have been to the NCAA tournament seven of the last nine years -- 
losing in the second round the past four seasons -- and have been 
ranked in the Top 25 for 54 consecutive weeks over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent seasons the Lobos also have gained notoriety for  
playing too many home games against some of the weakest teams in 
Division I. That trend hit an all-time low this season when the 
home schedule included teams like Sacramento State, Arkansas-Pine 
Bluff and Texas-Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the constant refrain emanating from New Mexico's  
athletic department has been that the Connecticuts, Dukes and 
Michigan States aren't willing to come play New Mexico in The Pit. 
</P>
<P>
	They will, said Fraschilla, if the Lobos are also willing to  
play them at their place. And he's also counting on getting a 
little help from television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, the way those kind of games are made is through  
TV,'' he said. ``I know a lot of people that don't want to come 
play here. But sometime you can get TV to twist some arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla is confident the Lobos can toughen their schedule,  
provided they're willing to sign home-and-home agreements with top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go on the road, you want to play the toughest  
competition that you can so that it will help you build a program 
like we want in regard to recruiting, with regard to getting ready 
for your conference and with regard to putting together a strong 
RPI (power rating) for postseason play,'' Fraschilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we build the program and build the schedule with it, one of  
the things I'm excited about is playing games that get us national 
attention,'' he said. ``The long term goal is to win a national 
championship. How long that will take, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla met Tuesday with the New Mexico players. Among them,  
Lamont Long, a junior who would be the Lobos' leading returning 
scorer. But Long has said he is considering leaving early to enter 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have the chance to coach him because he's  
obviously going to be one of the best guards in the country next 
year,'' Fraschilla said. ``And I think the way we'll play will fit 
his style. But if he has a chance to go high in the draft, that may 
be what he and his family choose to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla has six years of head coaching experience. He coached  
four years at Manhattan, taking the Jaspers to two NCAA tournaments 
and then two years at St. John's, where he led the Red Storm to the 
1998 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired two months later and Fraschilla has said his  
interest in the then vacant job at Arizona State ``ruffled some 
feathers'' with St. John's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Fraschilla said, he's where he belongs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there's a better match for me,'' he said.  
``I'm a very spiritual guy and I can tell you this has all happened 
for the best. Down the road, if you told me I'm going to stay here 
15 years and coach the Lobos and retire at 55, I'd be very happy 
with that.''

<HEADLINE> NIH To Unveil Vaccine List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new list of ``best buys'' in vaccine  
research highlights vaccines for some little-publicized but 
devastating diseases in newborns and better nationwide flu 
immunization. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health sought advice on priorities  
for funding vaccines against diseases that do not get as much 
attention as, for example, AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the prestigious  
National Academy of Sciences that advises the government, analyzed 
which potential vaccines would offer society the greatest benefits, 
both by preventing deaths and general suffering as well as by 
saving on health-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which is due out soon but was previewed at a vaccine  
meeting this week, is not a list of vaccines that doctors most 
want. Instead, it advises NIH and private companies how to 
determine which potential vaccines would bring the most bang for 
the investment buck -- offering examples of ``best buys'' that could 
save both money and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the ones we really want society to invest in ...  
sort of a no-brainer,'' said panel chairman Dr. Robert Lawrence of 
Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
	They include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A cytomegalovirus vaccine. CMV is so common that almost  
everyone is exposed at some point. But about 5,000 infected 
newborns a year suffer serious complications, including death or 
retardation, Lawrence said. A vaccine could be developed within 
seven years with an investment of $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Group B streptococcus is a widespread bacterium that sometimes  
causes serious disease in adults, but the biggest risk is in 
pregnant women who pass it to their newborns. Childbirth infects 
one in 500 newborns each year. Ten percent die, and up to half 
suffers some neurologic damage. Antibiotics can help at-risk 
pregnant women, but a vaccine could be completed within seven years 
with a $400 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Many elderly Americans now are vaccinated against strep  
pneumonia. But the vaccine does not protect against strains of the 
bacteria-caused pneumonia found in all regions, and expanding its 
use to newborns significantly could cut meningitis and even ear 
infections that the germ also can cause, Lawrence said. Better 
vaccines could be developed within three years with $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investing $450 million to expand flu vaccinations to more  
Americans significantly could cut the 30 million annual influenza 
cases each year. Flu kills about 20,000 Americans a year, 
hospitalizes 50,000 to 300,000 and costs billions in medical care 
and lost workdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Less cost-effective but still promising vaccines included ones  
to fight ulcer-causing H. pylori bacteria, liver-destroying 
hepatitis C, and cervical cancer-causing human papillomavirus.

<HEADLINE> Vizquel Pleased Contract Mess Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- All the worrying Cleveland fans did  
over the winter about Omar Vizquel and his contract seems pretty 
silly now as spring training winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vizquel's request to have his deal renegotiated was denied  
by the Indians during the offseason, it touched off weeks of 
hand-wringing as to what might happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel, one of Cleveland's most popular players, hinted at  
delaying his arrival at training camp in protest. There were even 
rumors the Indians were thinking about trading Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	Just great, Indians fans thought. Figures. We finally get  
Roberto Alomar to play second base, and now our Gold Glove 
shortstop is leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, Vizquel isn't going anywhere. And he's not mad at the  
Indians, either. Or if he is, he's not showing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Vizquel has been his fun-loving self, recently  
dancing around the Indians' clubhouse before an exhibition game to 
the Latin beat of a CD of Salsa music. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the field, Vizquel, who played with 16 different second  
baseman in the past two seasons, has had instant chemistry with 
Alomar. The Indians' double-play duo looks like it's been together 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with,'' Vizquel said of his headline-making contract  
situation. ``I'm not even thinking about it anymore. What was done 
was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel's decision to ask the Indians to rip up his deal irked  
some teammates, especially Sandy Alomar, who was the most outspoken 
critic of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel hasn't changed his stance, just softened it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I deserved the right to go up to my general manager  
and the owner of the team and talk about my contract situation,'' 
he said. ``At this point, it's not on my mind anymore. I'm trying 
to focus on getting to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Alomar to Cleveland's roster of All-Stars gives  
the Indians a good shot at finally ending a 51-year World Series 
title drought. Alomar's presence has already given the club one of 
the best double-play combos in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams are stopping to watch us take infield practice,''  
Indians coach Brian Graham said. ``They're something special, and 
the exciting thing is that there was no adjustment. They were on 
the same page on Day 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During batting practice, the two put on quite a show. Alomar  
lines up a grounder, and after scooping the ball, flips it in one 
motion right over the bag to Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said he wasn't surprised he and Alomar clicked right  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all we really have to work on is knowing where he  
likes the ball (on a double play turn) and where I want the ball,'' 
he said. ``We don't need to make a perfect throw every time. I 
think instincts will take over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel played 151 games at short last year, and there were  
times, he said, when it felt like there was a different second 
baseman there each time. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 alone, David Bell, Jeff Branson, Joey Cora, Shawon  
Dunston, Torey Lovullo, Jeff Manto and Enrique Wilson, stepped 
through the revolving door at second to play alongside Vizquel 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it bothered me that much,'' Vizquel said. ``I  
just wish I could have had an everyday player that I could 
communicate with all the time instead of having to change partners 
every two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a challenge for me to try and adjust to each one of  
them. But now having a guy like Robbie out there is going to make 
my job much easier. Obviously, it's going to bring my game level a 
little higher having a guy with that kind of talent beside me.''

<HEADLINE> Student Loans' Report Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department maintains it saves  
money through providing direct college loans to students and 
parents rather than subsidizing loans made by mostly private 
lenders. The department's internal watchdog begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent report, the department's inspector general concludes  
that low interest rates mean low costs, but when interest rates are 
high, the government pays more to make the loans in its 
direct-lending program than it recovers from borrowers repaying 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says outdated computer equipment is at least one  
source of the extra costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials disputed the findings. They said  
the report used outdated figures for 1996 and 1997, and that it 
made unfair comparisons between the government's actions and how 
the best private lenders would manage the loan program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't believe for a second that the numbers in the study are  
right,'' said Greg Woods, in charge of improving management of the 
department's student financial aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics dispute that the program costs less to run and passes  
the savings to students. Currently, rates for borrowers vary in 
both programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent report is ammunition against the program, they say.  
</P>
<P>
	``It paints a bleak picture of the Education Department as  
efficient managers,'' said Mark Cannon, the Coalition for Student 
Loan Reform, which lobbies for private lenders. ``It shows that 
there is $100 million annually that is going to bureaucrats and not 
to students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven A. McNamara, acting Education Department inspector  
general, insists the report is not questioning the department's 
management of either program. He noted that the report also said it 
is difficult to compare the costs of the two loan programs fully 
because they vary each year, depending on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance officials continue to fight over the two major types of  
loans offered to student borrowers. For many years, the government 
paid subsidies to private lenders so they would make the loans. In 
1994, the government said it could save borrowers money by taking 
out the middleman and started a lending program of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton angered Republican lawmakers and private  
lenders with his budget plan to give the program more funding and 
cut the private lenders' federal subsidy. Direct loans account for 
a third of the $32 billion student-loan market. 
</P>
<P>
	A department plan to offer rebates to student borrowers using  
electronic payments was announced Monday at a meeting of college 
financial aid officials.

<HEADLINE>  New Mexico Hoops Eyes NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- On his first day in town, newly hired  
New Mexico coach Fran Fraschilla promised to turn the Lobos' 
schedule from fast food to filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about New Mexico-UConn?'' Fraschilla said. ``The only way  
to get to the top is to go after the guy at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 40, was hired Saturday to take over a program that  
under Dave Bliss gained moderate national prominence. The Lobos 
have been to the NCAA tournament seven of the last nine years -- 
losing in the second round the past four seasons -- and have been 
ranked in the Top 25 for 54 consecutive weeks over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent seasons the Lobos also have gained notoriety for  
playing too many home games against some of the weakest teams in 
Division I. That trend hit an all-time low this season when the 
home schedule included teams like Sacramento State, Arkansas-Pine 
Bluff and Texas-Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the constant refrain emanating from New Mexico's  
athletic department has been that the Connecticuts, Dukes and 
Michigan States aren't willing to come play New Mexico in The Pit. 
</P>
<P>
	They will, said Fraschilla, if the Lobos are also willing to  
play them at their place. And he's also counting on getting a 
little help from television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, the way those kind of games are made is through  
TV,'' he said. ``I know a lot of people that don't want to come 
play here. But sometime you can get TV to twist some arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla is confident the Lobos can toughen their schedule,  
provided they're willing to sign home-and-home agreements with top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go on the road, you want to play the toughest  
competition that you can so that it will help you build a program 
like we want in regard to recruiting, with regard to getting ready 
for your conference and with regard to putting together a strong 
RPI (power rating) for postseason play,'' Fraschilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we build the program and build the schedule with it, one of  
the things I'm excited about is playing games that get us national 
attention,'' he said. ``The long term goal is to win a national 
championship. How long that will take, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla met Tuesday with the New Mexico players. Among them,  
Lamont Long, a junior who would be the Lobos' leading returning 
scorer. But Long has said he is considering leaving early to enter 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have the chance to coach him because he's  
obviously going to be one of the best guards in the country next 
year,'' Fraschilla said. ``And I think the way we'll play will fit 
his style. But if he has a chance to go high in the draft, that may 
be what he and his family choose to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla has six years of head coaching experience. He coached  
four years at Manhattan, taking the Jaspers to two NCAA tournaments 
and then two years at St. John's, where he led the Red Storm to the 
1998 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired two months later and Fraschilla has said his  
interest in the then vacant job at Arizona State ``ruffled some 
feathers'' with St. John's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Fraschilla said, he's where he belongs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there's a better match for me,'' he said.  
``I'm a very spiritual guy and I can tell you this has all happened 
for the best. Down the road, if you told me I'm going to stay here 
15 years and coach the Lobos and retire at 55, I'd be very happy 
with that.''

<HEADLINE> New Hannibal Lecter Book Is Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Fans of the cannibal Hannibal Lecter  
will get another serving of the character this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Tom Harris has finished the sequel to ``Silence of the  
Lambs,'' the book that sold 10 million copies and was turned into 
an Academy Award-winning movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Jodie 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris finished ``Hannibal'' on March 23. Dell plans to release  
it June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hannibal'' features the reappearance of FBI Special Agent  
Clarice Starling. It opens seven years after Lecter's stunning 
escape from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of his earlier victims uses agent Starling as bait to draw  
the doctor into an intricate and unspeakable design for revenge,'' 
according to the publisher's news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris created Lecter in his 1981 novel ``Red Dragon'' and  
reintroduced him in 1988 in ``Silence of the Lambs.'' ``Red 
Dragon'' was made into the movie called ``Manhunter.''

<HEADLINE> Driver Survives Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Her car was rear-ended in dense fog,  
launched into a moving freight train and dragged for miles along 
the tracks -- and a bruised and sore Amber Scott remembered nearly 
every detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just sitting there, waiting for the train,'' Ms. Scott  
recalled Tuesday, a day after her brush with death. ``I looked in 
my rearview mirror and I saw it (a truck) coming. I just gripped 
the steering wheel and closed my eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she opened them, she saw the driver's side door of her 1989  
Pontiac Grand Am pinned to the train's side and the car's front 
stuck under it. The train pushed on, dragging the car and its 
frightened passenger with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Ball State University student grabbed her  
cellular phone and called for help. Her first instinct was to call 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom! Mom! I need help,'' Patricia Scott heard her daughter  
scream. ``Mom, I've been hit!'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the roar of the train in her ear, Ms. Scott could hear only  
a voice on the phone -- maybe an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared,'' she said. ``But I just knew I couldn't sit  
there and be scared. I knew I had to help myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called 911 twice, believing that police would be able to  
trace her call and find her. Her cries for help were barely audible 
over the steady roar of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm being dragged ... by a train! Oh, please help!'' she  
cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott said she briefly thought about rolling out her  
passenger side door but decided against it. Authorities estimated 
the train's speed at 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Her car was attached to a middle car of the Conrail train -- and  
the conductor had no way of knowing what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I scooted down in my seat some, and I just waited,'' said Ms.  
Scott, who was wearing her seat belt. ``I prayed the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't remember much of what happened after her car hit a  
railroad signpost at another crossing and finally broke free. She 
was shaken up -- and the car was a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Schroeder, 25, the driver of the pickup that slammed into  
Ms. Scott's car, has been cited for not having insurance. 
Authorities said the warning lights were working at the crossing, 
but there is no gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott's family is thankful to have her home and safe.  
</P>
<P>
	``Her presence of mind has just absolutely astounded me,'' her  
mother said. ``I'm so proud of her. You know there had to be arms 
around her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ms. Scott: ``It hasn't really all sunk in that I've made it  
through a real life and death experience. I feel like it was a 
miracle.''

<HEADLINE> LPGA's Andrews Prefers Cold Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Calif. (AP) -- Cool weather might be just the thing to  
heat up Donna Andrews' golf game. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Northern California weather was less than  
perfect for the $600,000 Longs Drugs Challenge. But Andrews' game 
was on target at Twelve Bridges Golf Club. She shot a final-round 
69 to beat runnerup Carin Koch by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, third last year in earnings but only 49th so far this  
season, wouldn't mind seeing bad weather again as she defends her 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually like the cold weather,'' said Andrews, a nine-year  
LPGA veteran from Pinehurst, N.C. ``It's what I'm used to at home, 
it's what I practice in all winter. This town reminds me a lot of 
home, the weather, the trees, the climate. I love coming back 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fond memories are easily recalled. One of the biggest came when  
Andrews birdied the 16th, pulling ahead of Koch for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell Donna had been there before, she knew what to  
do,'' said Koch, whose second place was her best career finish. 
``You could tell she was fired up. This was not new to Donna, she's 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews will defend her title with many of the tour's top  
players on vacation following last week's Dinah Shore at Rancho 
Mirage. Only six of the top 20 on the money list are in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them is Annika Sorenstam, who likes the tight layout at  
Twelve Bridges. She won the tournament in 1997 and finished third 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinah Shore winner Dottie Pepper is also expected to play, even  
though she missed Wednesday's pro-am because of the flu. Pepper is 
second on the money list, trailing Karrie Webb, who skipped this 
event for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other current top-20 players in the field are Juli Inkster, Kris  
Tschetter, Liselotte Neumann and Maria Hjorth. 
</P>
<P>
	Also scheduled to play are Hall of Famer Pat Bradley, Michelle  
McGann and Jan Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Divots:* Koch had the best individual round a year ago,  
shooting a 6-under-par 66 the first day. ... The tournament will 
increase its purse to $700,000 next year and $800,000 in 2001. ... 
Nos. 1 and 18, which have been criticized in the past, have been 
renovated for the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Dying in Mexico City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A glowing red sun set in a cloudless sky, a  
light breeze blowing through the stadium. And, on this perfect 
night for baseball, the home team had a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all but a few hundred of the 25,000 seats were empty when  
the Mexico City Tigers rallied in the eighth inning to beat the 
Cancun Lobstermen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to see how few people come,'' said Carlos Hernandez,  
a 41-year-old trauma surgeon who had a section all to himself just 
to the first-base side of home plate. ``It's really such a pretty 
stadium, and it's so nice to sit out here in the evening. All 
that's missing is a little human warmth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a common complaint among baseball fans in the Mexico City  
area, the country's political, financial and cultural capital and 
home to one out of five Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
	What once was baseball fever has been tamed by bitter memories  
of a players' strike and news media that largely ignore the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's national television channels, which crowd the airwaves  
with soccer, NFL football and professional wrestling, haven't 
broadcast a Mexican baseball game in years. The only way to see 
Mexican league play is on ESPN2, alongside strongman contests and 
beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	The major national newspapers banish baseball to the inside  
pages of their sports sections, behind soccer, boxing, NBA 
basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	So it should be little surprise that interest has dropped off.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to playing without fans,'' said Matias Carrillo,  
the Tigers' star right fielder who drove in the winning run this 
spring evening. ``We play with enthusiasm, but if there were fans 
we'd play with more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet in much of the country, ``beisbol'' is the sport of  
kings. Just ask Carrillo, who is from Sinaloa state on the Pacific 
coast, or Hernandez, who's from the Gulf of Mexico state of 
Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Mexico City, local television stations transmit games  
and people listen on radio for the latest score. Baseball players 
are celebrities and children play in leagues, hoping to make it big 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the San Diego Padres and the Colorado Rockies open the  
major league season in Mexico on Sunday, they will do so in 
Monterrey, a northern city where baseball still dominates. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is still immensely popular across the entire north of  
the country, where more contact with the United States helps the 
sport. But even in many places with no U.S. link, baseball still 
reigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Only an hour north of Mexico City, a mountain town called  
Omitlan de Juarez has no soccer fields. Its baseball stadium is the 
town's pride and is home to weekly games by three local teams -- 
children, teen-agers and adults, all amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Sunday, the Omitlan Parrots were down 19-2 to the  
state champions, the Zimapan Miners. 
</P>
<P>
	But it didn't matter. About 300 fans packed the bleachers,  
whooping and ringing cowbells with every hit. Those who didn't fit 
in the stands gathered on nearby roofs to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer's a tough thing to go up against with games on TV all  
the time,'' said Omitlan manager Daniel Garcia, a 38-year-old 
industrial engineer. ``But boys see their fathers playing, and we 
try to pass on our values. If not, baseball would be finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Omitlan, at least, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing since I was 3, and I don't play anything  
else,'' said Mario Ruben Rodriguez, 12, a center fielder on his 
Little League team. ``I'll play until I die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most fans point to television for baseball's drop in popularity  
the last decade or two. They accuse the two television networks, 
both of which own soccer teams, of favoring soccer for financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican TV networks once broadcast games, then went to the  
championships only, and now have dropped baseball altogether. 
Antonio de Valdez, sports coordinator for Televisa, Mexico's 
biggest television network, conceded that baseball isn't a 
profitable broadcast because of its slow pace and the uncertainty 
of a game's length. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become a regional broadcast rather than a national  
one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also blamed the drop-off on a strike in the early 1980s  
in which the players walked out on full stadiums to demand higher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very sad memory,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alejandro Merlos is 23 years old and doesn't remember the  
strike. But he sure knows about the empty stands. A beer vendor at 
the Mexico City ballpark, he struggles to make $4 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work on commission, and it's hard to make anything  
nowadays,'' he said. ``And every year it gets worse.''

<P>
	OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Former major league umpire Steve Palermo has  
been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Palermo's career was ended in 1991 when he was shot and  
partially paralyzed while helping two women who were being attacked 
in Texas.

</P>
<P>
	He was released from the county jail after posting a $300 bond.

<HEADLINE>  NYC Cops Charged in Shooting Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with  
murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail 
of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a 
painful examination of police tactics and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree 
murder. They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no  
criminal record, was shot 19 times Feb. 4 in his vestibule by 
members of an elite street-crime unit looking for a rape suspect. 
Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo 
had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already strained  
relationship with the black community, and many have accused him of 
failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Wednesday: ``We should allow the criminal justice  
system to now operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
even though District Attorney Robert Johnson had asked that they be 
held without bail. The officers left the courthouse together 
shortly after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told the judge: ``On Feb. 4 in the vestibule in his own  
building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless 
when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him. 
... These four defendants intended to take his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving court, one of the officers, Carroll, shook hands  
with supporters and said in a quivering voice, ``I want to thank 
the New York City police officers and the Street Crime Unit for 
their undaunted support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were immediately suspended from their jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the intentional murder  
count ``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying? That they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' the lawyer asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said in court that Johnson  
had ``succumbed to a political agenda. My client is innocent of all 
charges. There was no crime on February 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have  
been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged 
police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the 
perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by 
police stop-and-search tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo's friends  
and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute 
arraignment. About 1,000 demonstrators stood outside the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the slaying, the street-crime unit has been ordered to  
wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the 
predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case also reflects tension over police attitudes and tactics  
nationally. Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was 
worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine 
the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand  
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing  
because they saw one officer on the ground. McMellon supposedly 
slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended a tribute to a police officer killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of 
the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall 
our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

<HEADLINE> Kansas City Gets First Female Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kay Waldo Barnes was elected the city's  
first female mayor with help from a famous relative, cousin Walter 
Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes defeated Mayor Pro Tem George Blackwood on Tuesday by 59  
percent to 41 percent, according to final returns. Barnes received 
45,146 votes to Blackwood's 31,319. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's first black mayor, Emanuel Cleaver, was barred by law  
from seeking a third term after eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The race had been expected to be close. Both candidates had  
worked primarily behind the scenes of city government, offering 
little name recognition to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel honored and humbled by the voters,'' Barnes said. The  
victory came on her 61st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwood conceded, saying: ``We gave it our best shot.''  
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign Barnes focused on bringing a fresh  
perspective to running the city, which has been plagued by 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Three City Council members have been convicted of felonies and  
several other public officials have been investigated in a federal 
corruption probe that began in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want us to be a city where neighborhoods flourish,  
businesses grow and we're proud of this place we call home,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes is president of Kay Waldo, Inc., a human resource  
development consulting firm. She was a member of the City Council 
from 1979-1983. She will be inaugurated April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Cronkite, who lived in Kansas City for a time as a boy, visited  
earlier this month to attend fund-raisers for his first cousin. The 
82-year-old former CBS anchorman said it was the first time in 60 
years he had endorsed a candidate, adding, ``Bloodlines made that 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwood, 59, has been a City Council member for eight years  
and mayor pro tem for four. He had served on the board of directors 
of the National League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwood's campaign was dogged by questions about drinking. He  
was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol 
in 1995 and went through a diversion program to have the arrest 
wiped from his record.

<HEADLINE> Agent Says Jordan Will Not Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Michael Jordan's agent said today there is ``absolutely no  
truth'' to a report the five-time MVP is considering coming out of 
retirement to play for the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has had preliminary discussions with NBA commissioner  
David Stern and Hornets owner George Shinn about buying 50 percent 
of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports News, citing unidentified sources close to Jordan,  
reported Tuesday night that one scenario being considered by Jordan 
would have him playing one full season for the Hornets while his 
ownership shares were held in a trust or deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sources apparently heard Jordan say he has to ``stay  
in shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely no truth to it,'' agent David Falk said in  
a statement from his Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets spokesman Harold Kaufman had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Jordan pronounced himself ``99.9 percent''  
retired. Since then, he has said he hasn't picked up a basketball 
since hitting the final shot of his career -- the game-winner in 
Utah at the end of Game 6 of the NBA Finals, his sixth title with 
the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario of him playing next season, according to Fox, also  
would include Phil Jackson being brought in to coach the team for 
one year and Dean Smith, Jordan's college coach at North Carolina, 
being brought aboard as team president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan issued a statement Monday confirming his interest in  
owning half the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage,'' Jordan said, ``the discussions are very  
preliminary and I am unsure whether I will be able to make an 
investment on terms that are acceptable to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington and starred at North Carolina,  
said staying involved in the NBA would be a ``fulfilling personal 
and business challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, as a North Carolina native, I would welcome the  
opportunity to be involved in growing the Hornets into an elite NBA 
team,'' Jordan said. ``It would be premature to comment any 
further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets have said no dates were set for the two sides to  
meet again, but both parties agreed to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan previously gave up basketball in October 1993 to pursue a  
career in professional baseball, then returned to the NBA in the 
spring of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Serb Hackers Disrupt NATO E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO said Wednesday that Yugoslav  
computer hackers are inundating its web site with viruses and 
firing off thousands of e-mails each day, overloading the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been dealing with some hackers in Belgrade who have  
hacked into our web site and caused line saturation of the 
server,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our e-mail system has also been saturated by one individual  
who is currently sending us 2,000 e-mails a day, and we are dealing 
with macro viruses from Yugoslavia into our e-mail system,'' Shea 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said the disruption was limited to the web site  
and e-mail system and was not affecting military computers. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO began air assaults on Yugoslavia last Wednesday in response  
to a deadly, widespread Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanians in 
the southern province of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Religious Symbols on Graves Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Boca Raton  
can tear down crosses, stars of David and other monuments in the 
municipal cemetery because the decorations are not essential for 
religious practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was believed to be the first of its kind in the  
nation and the first under Florida's Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act of 1998, which says governments cannot impose a ``substantial 
burden'' on people's freedom of religious expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Kenneth Ryskamp said Wednesday that families who decorated  
graves with religious symbols, plants, stones and other items will 
not have their religious rights trampled if they cannot keep the 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boca Raton cemetery permits only a horizontal plaque at the  
foot of each grave. The city claimed the religious monuments were 
an obstacle for maintenance workers and violated seldom-enforced 
rules against vertical decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 families sued the city to stop the removal of the  
items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly are going to appeal,'' said Howard Simon, executive  
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which 
had filed the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge offered several reasons why he ruled against the  
families, who claimed they were never given a copy of the 
cemetery's regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	First, he said, there are Catholic and Jewish cemeteries with  
similar regulations prohibiting large or vertical grave coverings 
or statues, and those cemeteries haven't been found to impede 
religious expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said the families do not own the cemetery plots;  
rather, they own the rights to burial in that public land. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is free to remove the items, but probably will hold off  
until the appeals are exhausted, said Beverly Pohl, an attorney for 
the city.

	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Fleeting Image, a 6-year-old who had been  
winless since the first running of the Irish O'Brien Stakes last 
year, won the race again Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Get Huge Welcome Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut fans at the celebration of the  
Huskies' first men's national basketball title had a dual purpose 
for attending: convincing Richard Hamilton to stay for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton flirted with leaving before his junior year for the  
NBA. Speculation on whether he or sophomore guard Khalid El-Amin 
will return for another year has heightened during the Huskies' 
successful run and Monday's national title win over Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 at a pep rally chanted ``One more year'' for  
Hamilton, the Final Four MVP. He scored 27 points against Duke in 
the Huskies' 77-74 national title win. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun said neither Hamilton nor El-Amin has  
approached him yet on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my job to convince them to stay. It never has and  
never will,'' he said. ``These are young people going through the 
process. It is their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the school's winningest coach has counseled players in the  
past. Former standouts Donyell Marshall and Ray Allen sought his 
advice before coming out their junior years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, the top pick of the Golden State Warriors, wasn't  
ready to go, but the price was right, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going to be offered between $45 million and $55 million  
and the salary cap was coming the next year,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, approached his coach  
twice. The first time was his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him if he was happy and he said `I love college,'''  
Calhoun recalled. Allen chose to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he asked me his junior year if he was ready, I said `You  
are more than ready.' He obviously made a great decision. He's 
going to be an NBA All-Star shortly,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday was not just about saying goodbye to Hamilton,  
El-Amin or anyone. It was Thanksgiving in Connecticut and a time 
for recognizing the top team in the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You stood by us. You believed,'' senior point guard Ricky  
Moore told the crowd. ``We didn't let you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bus carrying Calhoun and his national champions traveled the  
35 miles from the airport to campus Tuesday, but it took them 
through the heart and hearts of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists pulled off along the highway. Families, jumping and  
waving, ran from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The journey back home was incredible,'' Calhoun said.  
</P>
<P>
	And once inside Gampel Pavilion, the team was embraced by a  
standing-room-only crowd of more than 10,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun reflected on the journey he began 13 years ago to build  
the No. 1 team. A big bump in the road was 1990's heartbreaking 
loss to Duke. A buzzer-beater by Christian Laettner kept the 
Huskies from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We returned to Storrs to have you mend our broken heart,''  
Calhoun said. ``Yesterday, we ... broke some hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	The title was the first for the men's team in school history and  
the first for a New England team since Holy Cross won the 
tournament in 1947. The UConn women brought home the national title 
in 1995 with a 35-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team and coaches sat on a raised platform in front of the  
student section, the same section Calhoun has saluted each time he 
has walked off after a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't wait to come back home to you and bring back the  
national championship,'' Calhoun told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at Bradley International Airport, about 2,000 fans  
cheered and screamed as the players mingled in the crowd. Leigh 
Anne Crocco of West Haven jumped frantically up and down as her 
hero, Jake Voskuhl, gave her a high-five. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year-old was breathless for a moment before announcing,  
``Jake touched my hand!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of the pep rally, the team walked off the podium  
and shook hands with some of the fans and proceeded in a slow 
victory lap around the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was all said and done, Duke had a magnificent season --  
up to a point,'' Calhoun said. ``The great thing about our sport is 
you settle things on the court. This was supposed to be the year of 
the Blue Devils.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to one of the scores of signs and banners held up in  
Gampel, ``1999 was the Year of the Dog.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Stays With Smart Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler remains committed to  
its Smart mini-car despite disappointing sales figures since the 
October launch, co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The figures are not what we hoped for,'' he said at the  
company's annual news conference. ``But we remain positive and will 
wait and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported selling 17,000 of the colorful two-seaters  
in 1998, below its target of 20,000. It recently revised 
expectations for 1999 down from 130,000 to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the length of a full-size sedan, the truncated  
gas-saver sold only in Europe is aimed at young city drivers. But 
many have reportedly been put off by the price, which is higher 
than some cars with the traditional four seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to spur sales, DaimlerChrysler's Micro Compact Car Smart  
subsidiary, which builds the car in Hambach, France, just added 
more basic equipment, such as seat cushions and better glass, and 
cut the base price by $280 to $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is introducing a turbodiesel version this year  
with better mileage, and plans a convertible model for spring 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said management changes have also been made.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a new product make a lot of money'' right  
away, he said. ``It's a big challenge, but we really believe in the 
concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The German trade paper Auto-Zeitung reported Wednesday that  
DaimlerChrysler intends to introduce a four-seat family version in 
three years, a souped-up Smartster in 2003, and a Smart-Van in 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart spokeswoman Simone Maier declined to comment on the  
report, but said, ``There will definitely be more new models'' in 
coming years.

<HEADLINE> Poetry Festival Set for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Edgar Allan Poe's ``The Raven'' will be read in  
a cemetery, rappers will hold a war of words and cowboy poets will 
sing their songs. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be an open mike for poets seeking fame, and readings  
by those who've found it: Pulitzer Prize winner Galway Kinnell, 
``Iron John'' author Robert Bly and U.S. Poet Laureate Robert 
Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	All the above -- and more -- will unfold at the People's Poetry  
Gathering, April 9 to 11, in cafes, parks and auditoriums around 
Manhattan. The festival will celebrate poetry from sonnets to 
hip-hop, from Montana to Brazil, from the verse of 18th-century 
Scotsman Robert Burns to publication on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival is being organized by City Lore, a group that  
preserves folk culture, and Poets House, which sponsors readings 
and maintains a large poetry library. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poetry is the ultimate populist art because everybody can do  
it,'' said City Lore's director, Steve Zeitlin. ``We're trying to 
create a festival that involves and includes literary poets, but 
also includes new inner city poets and ethnic and folk 
traditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnell, one of the most prominent poets attending, will share a  
stage with, among others, a Brazilian poet whose mimeographed works 
are hung from clotheslines in his homeland for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole flowering of poetry is a wonderful thing, and there  
are many more petals than there used to be,'' said Kinnell, who 
will also do a reading of Federico Garcia Lorca's works. ``Having 
everybody involved like this is kind of exhilarating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bly will be reading Pablo Neruda's ``Ode to My Socks'' and  
holding a workshop on mythology and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a tour of Germany recently and found that poetry never  
really got out of the university there,'' Bly said. ``There are no 
poetry readings in Germany. But here we've had a very healthy 
tradition of bringing poetry outside the university and off the 
page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bly will also discuss oral traditions with Kewulay Kamara, a  
Sierra Leone poet who comes from a long line of West African oral 
historians. ``Their role in society is quite different from the 
role of artists in Western society,'' Bly said. ``These were ... 
the ambassadors, the masters of ceremonies, the people who 
orchestrated coronations. The word is what brings people together -- 
not money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamara's work is performed to music and partly improvised -- not  
unlike the rap lyrics to be featured at the festival's hip-hop 
slam, a spoken-word contest in which participants try to out-rhyme 
each other. Contestants get a minute or two each, over several 
rounds, while a deejay plays recorded rhythms. Whoever gets the 
most applause, wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes so fast,'' said Isaac Collazzo, 22, of Brooklyn, who  
belongs to a group called Braggin' Rites that is organizing the 
contest. ``This is very confrontational. It's a battle, 
basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other slams at the festival include ``Head-to-head Haiku'' --  
using the Japanese verse form -- and a Puerto Rican decima contest, 
in which a sentence is literally pulled out of a hat and a 10-line 
poem is composed ending in that line. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman Alexie, who wrote the screenplay for the acclaimed movie  
``Smoke Signals,'' will be featured in a ``Heavyweight Bout'' slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love poetry panels,'' said Alexie. ``Poets love to fight.  
Fiction writers get on panels and they pat each other on the back, 
but poets fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hobo poet U. Utah Philips says his mission at the festival will  
be ``mooching food and finding a safe warm place to sleep. I will 
then, with my cohorts, spout and spew tramp ribaldries, raucous 
rusticana and fecal badinage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philips has been performing and preserving railroad lore, union  
songs and other Americana in the tradition of Woody Guthrie for 
over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Several events feature cowboy poets, including Wally McRae, 63,  
a Montana rancher. ``Everybody is supposed to write about where 
they come from,'' he said. ``That's what it's about -- it's who we 
are and what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae added that most people have misconceptions about cowboys,  
but he tries to live up to the image by wearing boots, a hat and a 
horsehair belt with a silver buckle. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival also offers sessions on the blues, Asian writers  
and Yiddish female poets, along with workshops on how to memorize a 
poem and on writing renga, a Japanese poem composed while drinking 
sake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Raven'' will be read in Marble Cemetery on the Lower East  
Side. There will be a drinking tour of pubs frequented by the 
literati, and a haggis-and-Scotch banquet at the Algonquin Hotel in 
honor of Robert Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before has there been an attempt like this to bring  
together such a wide array of poets,'' said slam impresario Bob 
Holman, co-producer of the PBS series ``The United States of 
Poetry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To have a festival where you can taste poetries from around  
the world, and find the music in poetry that you can sing to and 
dance to -- as opposed to something you have to have explained to 
you -- is a milestone in the renaissance of poetry.'' 
</P>

<P>
	I taught my good dog, Maggie  
</P>
<P>
	To lay down when I commanded  
</P>
<P>
	I also taught her ``Set''

<P>
	I'll teach her next to speak, I said

<HEADLINE> Cassandra Wilson Honors Miles Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cassandra Wilson has no problem with paying  
tribute to Miles Davis on her new album, ``Traveling Miles.'' It's 
just a matter, she said, of separating Miles Davis the man from his 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old Wilson -- who has consistently sought to expand  
her role as a female jazz singer to assert herself as a composer, 
arranger and bandleader -- believes that ``women bring something 
very special'' to making jazz, hearing and constructing the music 
differently from men. 
</P>
<P>
	Her warm and spiritual approach contrasts with Davis'  
swaggering, macho image. The legendary trumpeter generally 
disdained working with female singers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to accept other human beings and their  
frailties,'' Wilson said. ``Now Miles Davis perhaps was not an 
exemplary person in terms of the way that he treated women, but you 
have to look at the total picture of Miles Davis and this 
incredible amount of music that he gave us. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his music, we see so much humanity. ... We hear all of the  
emotion, and we hear him able to deliver this emotion in such a 
beautiful, fine acute sense. He's able to pinpoint emotions 
beautifully, the way a singer does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, Wilson has immersed herself in Davis'  
music. She was commissioned by Jazz at Lincoln Center to give a 
six-night concert series interpreting Davis' music in December 
1997. Wilson then spent months reworking her interpretations for 
the recording of ``Traveling Miles,'' which was just released by 
Blue Note. She is now performing music from the album with her band 
on a six-week U.S. concert hall tour that runs through mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer has sought to reach out beyond the core jazz  
audience, appearing on the cover of Essence magazine and in an ad 
campaign for Coach leather goods. She also took part in last 
summer's Lilith Fair tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing when more and more people -- especially  
Americans -- begin to realize that this music we call jazz is so 
much a part of the fabric of our lives,'' she said. ``It's 
important to recognize and support it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson considers ``Traveling Miles'' to be the final part of a  
trilogy that began with her breakthrough 1993 album ``Blue Light 
'til Dawn'' and continued with the Grammy-winning ``New Moon 
Daughter'' in 1996. The basic building blocks linking the trilogy, 
she said, are ``the beauty and majesty of the blues'' and ``jazz -- 
the blues' favorite daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On her previous albums, Wilson acknowledged some of her musical  
roots with an eclectic repertoire that encompassed Mississippi 
Delta blues (Robert Johnson and Son House), folk (Joni Mitchell and 
Van Morrison), country (Hank Williams) and pop (U2, Neil Young and 
The Monkees), as well as her own originals -- all sung in her husky, 
sensual contralto voice. 
</P>
<P>
	But on ``Traveling Miles,'' she goes back to her earliest and  
perhaps most important musical influence. As a young girl growing 
up in Jackson, Miss., she was exposed to Davis' music through her 
father, bassist and guitarist Herman Fowlkes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first music that I heard as a 5- or 6-year-old was Miles  
Davis' `Sketches of Spain' because my father was a real big fan of 
Miles,'' recalled Wilson, who lives in a Harlem apartment building 
where Duke Ellington once lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the record I remember the most because it had such an  
expansive feel to it. ... It was different from the rest of the 
jazz albums that my daddy listened to a lot. ... It lent itself to 
a child's imagination really easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has remained Wilson's spiritual father through the years.  
The spare, understated arrangements on her most recent albums evoke 
Davis' use of space. As a bandleader, she shares Davis' knack for 
putting together a strong supporting cast, featuring such 
top-flight musicians on ``Traveling Miles'' as bassist Dave 
Holland, cornetist Olu Dara, guitarist Pat Metheny and Steve 
Coleman, a saxophonist who helped Wilson break into the New York 
scene in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Davis, Wilson believes in breaking the rules, by changing  
styles and using the pop hits and rhythms of the day. Her lyrics to 
the title song, which she wrote after Davis' death in 1991, could 
just as easily apply to the singer as to the trumpet innovator: 
``Traveling Miles-Crossing time-Shifting style-Traveling Miles and 
Miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In `Traveling Miles,' you have a melody that meanders,'' she  
said. ``... It's a song about traveling physically and also about 
traveling spiritually, traveling to the music, always in motion, 
celebrating that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides four original compositions inspired by Davis' music,  
Wilson crafted her own lyrics to instrumental numbers either 
written by Davis or played by his band, including such classics as 
``Seven Steps to Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson doesn't try to re-create the sound of any of Davis' bands  
-- her core group on many of the pieces has two guitarists, a 
percussionist and rhythm section, but no front-line horn player. 
</P>
<P>
	But her choices for the album, which she produced, recap every  
major phase of Davis' career. The trumpeter's bluesy, lyrical 
approach of the '50s is represented by ``Someday My Prince Will 
Come'' and ``Blue in Green.'' From Davis' innovative 1960s quintet, 
there are ``Seven Steps to Heaven'' and Wayne Shorter's ``ESP.'' 
His influential 1969 ``Bitches Brew'' album -- which used electronic 
instruments and rock rhythms -- yields the funky ``Run the Voodoo 
Down.'' And from the '80s, when Davis' electronic band turned anew 
to ballads and popular songs of the day, comes Cyndi Lauper's 
``Time After Time'' and Marcus Miller's ``Resurrection Blues 
(Tutu).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson spent almost a year sifting through Davis' immense  
repertoire to find those tunes that worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you choose a song, it's generally because you can get  
inside of it, you can inhabit it,'' she said. ``I found that the 
material really came to me instead of me going after it. It would 
just pop out and it would resonate and make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Swimming Tightens Rules on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Swimming's governing body adopted new rules  
Wednesday in an effort to make it harder for drug cheats to evade 
detection and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also said swimmers at the world short-course  
championships in Hong Kong this week would be asked to give blood 
samples voluntarily to a group studying ways to detect illegal use 
of growth hormones to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests will be separate from those normally carried out at  
swimming competitions, and the results will be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The governing body, FINA, listed 22 doping cases among swimmers  
in 1998, 10 outside competition. FINA conducted 802 
out-of-competition tests last year, and national federations 
conducted another 1,185. 
</P>
<P>
	In 345 tests in 1999, no positive cases have been reported, FINA  
executive director Cornel Marculescu said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a FINA congress, the body's president, Mustapha  
Larfaoui of Algeria, criticized governments for not doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised at the lack of cooperation and unity in  
governments in dealing with their responsibilities in this fight 
against doping,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Doping Control Review Board will have eight members,  
primarily medical or chemical experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The board would ``be able to advise on doping issues in a far  
more sophisticated way than in the past,'' said Ross Wales, a vice 
president of the FINA Bureau, the organization's executive body. 
</P>
<P>
	Wales said the board could advise FINA on cases it was likely to  
lose in the courts for scientific or legal reasons. It also could 
advise on cases where swimmers with valid medical reasons should be 
allowed to use otherwise banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the rules also include a list of prohibited  
substances, divided into those always banned and those banned only 
during competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those permitted out of competition are stimulants that  
might be found in cold remedies and such drugs as marijuana. Wales 
said that during competition, the drugs on this list might have 
performance-enhancing results for some athletes in some 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules do not change punishments, including some of  
sport's toughest suspensions -- a minimum of four years for a first 
offense involving steroids and masking agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for blood testing volunteers follows a report by Dr.  
Christian Strasburger of the International Olympic Committee 
Medical Commission that a blood test could be used to catch 
cheaters using synthetic human growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, however, wants the test method proven reliable on both  
sexes and all ethnic groups so it can be defended in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth hormones gained prominence just before the 1998 swimming  
world championships when Australian customs officers caught Yuan 
Yuan of China bringing in the substance. FINA suspended her for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same meet, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for  
drugs considered masking agents to hide the presence of other 
substances. They were suspended for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA officials were asked Wednesday whether the large number of  
out-of-competition tests of Chinese swimmers reflected China's past 
record of positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Marculescu replied that the number reflected the number of  
Chinese swimmers who stand high in the rankings. Swimmers in the 
top 10 are tested more often, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For 42 years, school janitor Jesse  
Williams puffed three packs of Marlboros a day, never believing the 
cigarette company would sell him something that would kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two years to the day after he died of lung cancer, a jury  
ordered Philip Morris to pay the biggest liability award ever 
against the tobacco industry, $81 million, for lying about the 
risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``My late husband had a dying wish,'' widow Mayola Williams said  
after Tuesday's verdict. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies 
stop lying about the health problems of smokers ... so that other 
people will understand that they are being used, just plain used, 
for the gain of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second major financial blow this year against the  
world's largest cigarette maker. A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 
million last month to a Marlboro smoker with inoperable lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides that case, U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking  
liability cases only three times -- twice in Florida and once in New 
Jersey. All three verdicts were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, industry watchdogs and Wall Street analysts said the  
Oregon award may open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As little as three years ago most people thought the tobacco  
industry was invulnerable. This case shows we have a crack in the 
dam,'' said John Banzhof, executive director of Action on Smoking 
and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be even easier the third, fourth and fifth time  
around,'' he said. ``It's like sharks smelling blood. These cases 
have spread a lot of chum in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added analyst Gary Black, with the New York brokerage firm  
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co: ``This will persuade the industry to 
start thinking the tide may be turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said the tobacco industry  
has a 40-year history of prevailing in such cases, and he promised 
to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this verdict, it was not supported by the  
evidence,'' Cofer said. ``It was a product of passion and 
prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which found Williams and the company to be equally  
negligent, awarded his wife and six adult children $1.6 million in 
compensatory damages, and $79.5 million in punitive damages for 
lying about the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had sought $101 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor with the Portland  
school system, as a nicotine addict who believed the company when 
it said there was no link between smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died at age 67, just five months after he was diagnosed  
with small-cell carcinoma, the deadliest form of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Multnomah County Circuit Court jury, which  
included three smokers and four former smokers, spent a little more 
than two days reviewing a month of technical and often conflicting 
testimony from experts in such areas as cancer diagnosis, radiology 
and the chemistry of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, attorneys for the Williams family cited  
internal Philip Morris documents to bolster their claim that the 
company long knew about the cancer-causing potential of cigarettes 
and hid that information from its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' attorney, Raymond Thomas, called the tobacco  
company ``willful, malicious, sneaky'' in its efforts to keep 
smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	One juror, April Dewees, said she and other panelists were  
angered by what they saw in the company documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Phillip Morris) want it to be everyone's responsibility  
but theirs,'' she said. ``Are people really making an informed 
decision when they don't have the information?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cofer said Williams was well aware that smoking could harm his  
health and could have quit ``if he'd wanted to badly enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, tobacco giants reached a $206 billion settlement  
with states, but that doesn't end individual and class-action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to the latest big verdict was swift. Philip Morris  
stock ended Tuesday as the biggest loser on the Dow Jones 
industrial average, dropping 8 percent. Its plunge helped push 
other tobacco stocks down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why?'' asked Thomas. ``Because what the whole world  
wants to know is whether they are going to be able to get away with 
it or is it over. And Wall Street voted today with the jury.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Faces Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- After he was convicted of racketeering and  
grand theft in state court, the Rev. Henry Lyons apologized for his 
crimes and said he was ready to accept his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president of the powerful National Baptist Convention  
USA was to return to court today to receive his sentence, expected 
to be three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 27, jurors convicted the 57-year-old minister of bilking  
more than $4 million from companies wanting to sell cemetery 
products, life insurance policies and credit cards to convention 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also was convicted of stealing nearly $250,000 from the  
Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild 
black churches burned in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 16, Lyons stepped down as head of the convention, one  
of the nation's largest and most influential black denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he avoided a second trial by pleading guilty to  
federal charges of evading taxes, engaging in fraudulent activities 
and lying to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' sentencing in federal court is scheduled for June 18.  
Those charges carry a total possible sentence of 75 years and heavy 
fines.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Trunk Releases for Fords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said it will be the first major  
car maker to install an emergency trunk release as a standard 
feature on a wide range of cars. 
</P>
<P>
	All Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars sold in the United States and  
Canada will include this feature, Ken Kohrs, a Ford vice president, 
said at the New York Auto Show on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The system features a cable-operated release inside the trunk. A  
T-shaped handle will be made of phosphorescent material so it glows 
in the dark, Ford said in disclosing details of a feature already 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen children have died in the past decade after  
inadvertently locking themselves inside trunks, according to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Last summer, the 
victims included 11 children ages 2 to 6 -- five in Utah, two in 
Greensboro, Pa., and four in Gallup, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. announced last December that it would have  
trunk release handles available for installation as optional 
equipment by this spring.

<HEADLINE> Dealing With Tyrants Is No Easy Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seemed a familiar pattern: the United  
States conducting airstrikes against the country of an 
authoritarian ruler who ignored repeated threats and reneged on 
earlier promises. 
</P>
<P>
	Didn't that just happen a few months ago with U.S. and British  
airstrikes against Iraq? 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to  
agree to stop his offensive against Albanian-speaking citizens of 
the Serbian province of Kosovo and sign a peace agreement -- just as 
it wants Saddam Hussein to keep his post-Gulf War commitments to 
allow international inspections of weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar example of possible broken promises, the Clinton  
administration and members of Congress are alarmed that 
communist-run North Korea might be continuing to develop nuclear 
weapons -- in violation of a 1994 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	How can the United States get its adversaries to live up to  
pledges extracted largely by the threat of force? 
</P>
<P>
	Not easily, when the adversaries are iron-fisted leaders such as  
Milosevic and Saddam, suggested Janusz Bugajski, director of East 
European studies for the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody has arbitrary power in the country, then they act  
arbitrarily. Whether they sign agreements or not, they can't be 
trusted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why force is needed,'' Bugajski added. ``Signing a  
paper is meaningless with Milosevic. We should have dealt with him 
in a similar way eight years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, said ``we have a different calculus 
now'' and that's why the administration finds itself dealing more 
often with leaders it considers to be thugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The world of superpowers was made up of ``fairly cautious  
actors,'' Biden suggested. ``We are dealing now with a group of 
tin-armed dictators -- malevolent, dangerous dictators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys don't operate under the same rational basis that we  
do. They are cunning. They are smart. But they have fewer cards to 
play, and their cards are less obvious,'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quality of thug-dom may be intensified by the rhetoric used  
by presidents and politicians in describing adversaries as evil -- 
to help rally public support for confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if someone had listened to Winston Churchill and stood up  
to Adolf Hitler earlier? How many people's lives might have been 
saved?'' Clinton said last week of NATO's decision to confront 
Milosevic militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush made the same Hitler comparison in talking about  
Saddam in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Fidel Castro has long been demonized by American  
political leaders, as has Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma  
who now teaches at Harvard, said it is problematic knowing that a 
totalitarian leader may be agreeing to something only because of 
the threat of force -- and then to see him repeatedly break his 
promise. ``It's a little like the `Peanuts' comic strip, where the 
football always gets yanked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes, there really is no alternative. ``You always have  
to keep trying in any case until it's clear it won't work. We try 
to do everything we can to avoid having a military solution,'' said 
Edwards, who was the senior Republican on the House Appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations. 
</P>
<P>
	As to demonizing enemies, ``I think everyone needs to demonize  
our enemies. When you're dropping bombs on people, it's easier if 
you think they're pretty awful people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When dictators break their word, it's important to not delay the  
inevitable, suggested Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. ``Here 
we are in 1999 at the end of what historians agree has been the 
bloodiest century in the history of the world. And we know how the 
blood was created and why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened because there were evil dictators or aggressive  
leaders in countries who felt that their own space was not big 
enough and that they had to expand it,'' she said in defending the 
use of force against Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he's troubled by a process  
in which pledges are extracted from foreign leaders by military 
force -- or with a promise to stop using force -- as in dealing with 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is using our armed forces as a process of negotiating,  
not for the purpose for which we maintain our military to defend 
our national interests abroad,'' Stevens said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Corp. Leases Electric Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Southern Co. plans to to lease at least  
400 electric cars and trucks to its employees over the next four 
years, giving the utility holding company one of the nation's 
largest fleets of electric-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Co. Chairman A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg kicked off the  
lease program Wednesday by loaning two Ford Ranger electric 
vehicles to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. He was joined by 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who said electric vehicles 
generate 35 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two goals for this program,'' Dahlberg said. ``We want  
to help create the mass market for automakers to produce electric 
vehicles nationally and help clean the air by removing the tail 
pipe emissions of hundreds of cars from roadways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dahlberg said Southern employees will have the chance to lease a  
Ford Ranger truck for $150 a month or a General Motors EVI sports 
car for $200 a month. The payments will be automatically deducted 
from employees' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 electric vehicles will be leased each year over the  
next four years, officials said. That number may be increased based 
on employee demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Co., based in Atlanta, is the parent of Georgia Power,  
Alabama Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric. 
It already has about 190 electric vehicles, including 147 operated 
by Georgia Power and 35 used by Alabama Power.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Labs' Security Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department says three of its 12  
nuclear weapons facilities, including the one at Los Alamos, get a 
less than satisfactory security rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The report sent to Congress said the Los Alamos National  
Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a 
department transportation facility continue to demonstrate security 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	The three facilities received a ``marginal'' security evaluation  
as opposed to ``satisfactory'' for the other nine facilities, 
according to the report, which was released Tuesday after 
classified portions were deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos has been the focus of a three-year espionage  
investigation stemming from concerns that top-secret warhead 
material at the facility may have fallen into Chinese hands during 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The report to Congress also expressed concern about the  
difficulty protecting secrets in an era of the Internet. New 
guidelines are being developed to evaluate the impact on security 
because of the ``voluminous'' data available through ``the vast 
array of ... DOE web sites,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he planned to use an extra  
$8 million he has requested from Congress for security to create 
better ``fire walls'' and intrusion detection devices in the 
department's classified and unclassified computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the unclassified version of the report, Richardson  
said that while a ``marginal'' rating indicates some security 
shortcomings, nuclear materials and sensitive information continue 
to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report projects that all facilities will reach an overall  
satisfactory rating in 1999 if the present corrective actions 
already underway continue on their present course,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily censored report provided no details of the security  
lapses cited.

Jones starred in ``The Music Man.'' Now the trouble's in her 
hometown.

<HEADLINE> Airport Replaces White Supervisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A white customs supervisor at the Atlanta airport  
was replaced with a black one after the agency was accused of 
unfairly singling out black travelers for searches, an inspector 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale O'Connor, the white supervisor of the 16-member passenger  
inspection team, was transferred to the cargo inspection division, 
said Cathy Harris, a customs inspector who is suing the agency for 
alleged discrimination against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Robert White, a black supervisor, is being shifted from  
another division to head the passenger inspection team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the Customs Service in Washington,  
declined to confirm the personnel moves. But he did say the agency 
has reassigned some staff members at Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's issues that have been raised in Atlanta and we want to  
take a serious look here,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said he could not comment. White did not immediately  
return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., asked the Treasury Department  
for an investigation into allegations, including Ms. Harris', of 
racial discrimination by Hartsfield customs inspectors. The Customs 
Service is part of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' letter cited a report by WAGA-TV alleging that Hartsfield  
customs inspectors are more likely to detain blacks than whites. 
The report said 90 percent of passengers X-rayed for drugs were 
black, but only 20 percent of blacks detained by customs agents 
were carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that these personnel changes will bring about  
some greater degree of fairness in the way people are treated as 
they pass through the Atlanta airport,'' Lewis said Wednesday. But 
he added that Congress still needs to look into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris, a customs inspector in Atlanta and Miami for 13  
years, has filed several complaints over the last four years, 
alleging discrimination in inspections and saying she has been 
subjected to discrimination and sexual harassment. Customs 
officials have declined to discuss her case. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of racial discrimination during the customs process  
have surfaced nationwide. In Chicago, more than 80 black females 
have filed a class-action lawsuit claiming they were singled out 
for strip searches at O'Hare Airport because of race and gender.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Omar Epps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Omar Epps is currently starring in ``The Mod  
Squad,'' but he has his eye on a role that would give him even more 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watch, I'm going to be the first black president of the United  
States,'' he predicts. ``If Reagan can do it, I know I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epps, 25, isn't short on ambition: He has a rap album scheduled  
for release later this year. He is also directing music videos and 
writing scripts for TV development. 
</P>
<P>
	His 10-year plan is a formidable one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be a conglomerate. I'll have my multimedia company  
running. I'll be the new Miramax. ... So by the time I turn about 
45 or 50, I'll run for president,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Epps' track record, he has a pretty good shot at  
accomplishing his goals. A graduate of New York's prestigious High 
School of Performing Arts, Epps drew early acclaim in ``Juice,'' 
co-starring Tupac Shakur, followed by ``The Program,'' ``Major 
League II'' and ``Higher Learning,'' directed by John Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
	He gained more fans with his role in ``Scream 2.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Epps hit it big with his role as Linc in the film ``The Mod  
Squad,'' a remake of the popular TV series that ran from 1968 to 
1973. The film, co-starring Claire Danes and Giovanni Ribisi, 
remains true to the premise of the original series -- three juvenile 
delinquents given a second chance by working with the police 
department -- but with a '90s spin. 
</P>
<P>
	Epps recently completed filming for ``Breakfast of Champions,''  
based on the novel by Kurt Vonnegut and starring Bruce Willis and 
Nick Nolte. He is also among a group of young actors, including 
co-star Ribisi, featured on the cover of the April issue of Vanity 
Fair magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How is your Linc different from the 1970s version played by  
Clarence Williams III? 
</P>
<P>
	Epps: Clarence Williams' Linc was an icon, and you really can't  
prepare for that; you're already stepping into a character. So all 
I could do is open him up, and that's exactly what I wanted him to 
do, just let him be a bit more colorful, maybe smile a bit more. 
But there weren't very many opportunities because he's written like 
he's a certain guy. And when I watch the old stuff, I just try and 
keep the nuances of the character, and just take the rest from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What drew you to wanting to do a remake of a TV series?  
</P>
<P>
	Epps: It was a great idea, but what got me excited was once  
Claire and Giovanni were attached. The opportunity to work with 
them, that's what put it over the top. I respect their work, but 
it's just an interesting mix. We respected one another's 
differences, and we see eye to eye, and we just naturally got 
along, and you don't get that often. When you get that, it's like 
90 percent of your work is done by showing up on the set. 
</P>
<P>
	3. What sparked your interest in acting?  
</P>
<P>
	Epps: It all spawned from writing, because I was a writer since  
I was 8 -- poetry, plays, screenplays, love letters, music, 
whatever. Being a writer, acting came from just trying to emote off 
of the paper, and once I found a stage, that was it. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How did you get involved with rap?  
</P>
<P>
	Epps: I've been doing music for like nine, 10 years. I'm  
starting an independent label called The Label. The name of my 
album is 'The Birth.' My music is me, that's my passion. It's not 
someone else's words I'm delivering, there's not a director's 
version that's not edited, it's me. This is what I come home and do 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
	5. You've been writing scripts -- would you like to direct?  
</P>
<P>
	Epps: Not for like 10 years. You have to appease everybody. When  
everything goes right, everyone runs past you and gives kudos to 
the crew, the actors. When anything goes wrong, everyone looks at 
you -- 'Well, he didn't know how to handle it.' It's the most 
selfless job in the world, and it takes so long. ... I ain't got 
that kind of patience.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For 42 years, school janitor Jesse  
Williams puffed three packs of Marlboros a day, never believing the 
cigarette company would sell him something that would kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two years to the day after he died of lung cancer, a jury  
ordered Philip Morris to pay the biggest liability award ever 
against the tobacco industry, $81 million, for lying about the 
risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``My late husband had a dying wish,'' widow Mayola Williams said  
after Tuesday's verdict. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies 
stop lying about the health problems of smokers ... so that other 
people will understand that they are being used, just plain used, 
for the gain of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second major financial blow this year against the  
world's largest cigarette maker. A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 
million last month to a Marlboro smoker with inoperable lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides that case, U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking  
liability cases only three times -- twice in Florida and once in New 
Jersey. All three verdicts were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, industry watchdogs and Wall Street analysts said the  
Oregon award may open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As little as three years ago most people thought the tobacco  
industry was invulnerable. This case shows we have a crack in the 
dam,'' said John Banzhof, executive director of Action on Smoking 
and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be even easier the third, fourth and fifth time  
around,'' he said. ``It's like sharks smelling blood. These cases 
have spread a lot of chum in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added analyst Gary Black, with the New York brokerage firm  
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co: ``This will persuade the industry to 
start thinking the tide may be turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said the tobacco industry  
has a 40-year history of prevailing in such cases, and he promised 
to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this verdict, it was not supported by the  
evidence,'' Cofer said. ``It was a product of passion and 
prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which found Williams and the company to be equally  
negligent, awarded his wife and six adult children $1.6 million in 
compensatory damages, and $79.5 million in punitive damages for 
lying about the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had sought $101 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor with the Portland  
school system, as a nicotine addict who believed the company when 
it said there was no link between smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died at age 67, just five months after he was diagnosed  
with small-cell carcinoma, the deadliest form of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Multnomah County Circuit Court jury, which  
included three smokers and four former smokers, spent a little more 
than two days reviewing a month of technical and often conflicting 
testimony from experts in such areas as cancer diagnosis, radiology 
and the chemistry of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, attorneys for the Williams family cited  
internal Philip Morris documents to bolster their claim that the 
company long knew about the cancer-causing potential of cigarettes 
and hid that information from its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' attorney, Raymond Thomas, called the tobacco  
company ``willful, malicious, sneaky'' in its efforts to keep 
smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	One juror, April Dewees, said she and other panelists were  
angered by what they saw in the company documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Phillip Morris) want it to be everyone's responsibility  
but theirs,'' she said. ``Are people really making an informed 
decision when they don't have the information?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cofer said Williams was well aware that smoking could harm his  
health and could have quit ``if he'd wanted to badly enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, tobacco giants reached a $206 billion settlement  
with states, but that doesn't end individual and class-action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to the latest big verdict was swift. Philip Morris  
stock ended Tuesday as the biggest loser on the Dow Jones 
industrial average, dropping 8 percent. Its plunge helped push 
other tobacco stocks down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why?'' asked Thomas. ``Because what the whole world  
wants to know is whether they are going to be able to get away with 
it or is it over. And Wall Street voted today with the jury.''

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Suit vs. Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Wednesday  
allowed 14 public agencies in an Orange County investment pool to 
sue Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the brokerage they accuse of helping to 
bankrupt the county in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The court unanimously denied review of a lower-court ruling  
reinstating the suit by government agencies from around the state 
who turned down the county's offer to share in its settlement. The 
suit seeks nearly $80 million in damages, interest and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage,  
of taking part in former Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron's 
violations of his duties to taxpayers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Citron's failed bets on interest rates led to $1.64 billion in  
losses for the county's investment pool, a savings bank for 
schools, cities and water and sewer districts. The losses forced 
the county to seek federal bankruptcy protection in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Citron pleaded guilty to falsifying records and violating state  
securities laws and served eight months in a prison work-release 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch agreed last year to pay the county $437.1 million  
to settle a suit accusing the firm of giving bad advice that 
contributed to the financial collapse. The company later agreed to 
pay $2 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission 
accusations that it was negligent in warning investors about the 
risk of buying the county bonds it underwrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The county and nearly 200 members of the investment pool who  
agreed to take part in its suit have shared $781 million in 
settlements so far, including the money from Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies that declined were paid $24.5 million for dropping  
their suit against the county. Their suit against Merrill Lynch was 
dismissed in 1997 by Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge 
Walter Rogers, who ruled that only the county could sue on behalf 
of pool members. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeal disagreed last December, ruling  
that pool members could try to prove the broker violated an 
independent legal duty to them. The agencies say Merrill Lynch 
fraudulently induced them to invest about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking state Supreme Court review, Ronald L. Olson, a lawyer  
for Merrill Lynch, said the appellate ruling allowing a separate 
suit by members of a trust fund would open the door to multiple 
suits in the same case, with potentially conflicting results.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Hires Harrick As Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick figures he can win another  
national championship at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending the past two years at Rhode Island, where he  
rehabilitated his reputation, Harrick was hired Wednesday as coach 
of the Bulldogs, who haven't made the NCAA tournament since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of success under former coach Ron Jirsa,  
Georgia is the kind of school that can be force on the national 
scene, Harrick said. He cited the strength of the Southeastern 
Conference and the state's strong recruiting base, evidenced by 
Monday's national title game when Duke and Connecticut each had a 
player from the same Augusta high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a terrific basketball area,'' he said. ``I'd like  
to control the state. I think we would be very, very good if we do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick came to the news conference with a stuffed dog that  
belted out the Georgia fight song, and he wasted little time 
issuing his first edict to a group of players standing in the back 
of the room 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see you guys later,'' he said. ``I want you to get  
excited about Georgia basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering through two disappointing seasons under Jirsa,  
the Georgia players were ecstatic to get a coach who has won a 
national title. Harrick guided UCLA to the 1995 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' center Robb Dryden said. ``When I heard  
the news, I was like, `He's coming here?' That should do volumes 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five returning players attended the news conference, but  
sophomore Jumaine Jones was a no-show. The All-SEC forward, who led 
the Bulldogs in scoring and rebounding, has said he plans to enter 
the NBA draft. He did not answer phone calls to his campus 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should change his decision'' because of Harrick's  
hiring, guard D.A. Layne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Vince Dooley checked with the NCAA before  
hiring Harrick, who was fired by UCLA in 1996 for his involvement 
with an illegal recruiting dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick paid the tab and allegedly lied to cover up that more  
players were at the dinner than allowed by NCAA rules. After 
sitting out the 1996-97 season, he spent two years at Rhode Island, 
leading the Rams to the NCAA tournament both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, who has long maintained that he didn't deserve to be  
fired by the Bruins, admitted Wednesday that mistakes were made and 
said he learned from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown from that,'' he said. ``I'm a better coach and a  
better human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia president Michael Adams was vice president of  
development at Pepperdine when Harrick coached at the California 
school. The two are close friends, but Adams said he would not 
tolerate the kind of infractions that occurred at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take compliance very seriously,'' Adams said. ``If a coach  
ever misled me, I wouldn't have that coach working for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at  
Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA 
tournament 14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	At UCLA, he won at least 21 games during each of his eight  
seasons, highlighted by the 31-2 team that won the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa, who had never been a head coach before he was picked to  
succeed Tubby Smith, went 35-30 in two seasons. Jirsa was fired 
March 11 after the Bulldogs were routed by Clemson in the first 
round of the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith showed the school's potential during his two-year  
stint as coach, winning 45 games and reaching the NCAA round of 16 
in 1996 before moving on to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was chosen over Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson. The  
other finalist, Delaware's Mike Brey, removed himself from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, we said our commitment would be to hire a  
proven head coach,'' Dooley said. ``Obviously, we've far surpassed 
that expectation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick received about $350,000 a year at Rhode Island, while  
his four-year contract with Georgia is worth an estimated $550,000 
annually in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will set up a yearly $100,000 annuity, similar  
to the deal for football coach Jim Donnan, that would be paid in 
full if Harrick fulfills his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry to see him leave,'' Rhode Island athletic  
director Ron Petro said. ``His expertise as a coach was appreciated 
by the university, our fans, supporters and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick hoped to bring his son, Jim Jr., to Georgia as an  
assistant coach, but the school nixed that idea because of the 
state's anti-nepotism law. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt me more than anything,'' Harrick said. ``That was  
really the only thing that delayed it.''

<HEADLINE> Czechs Stay Perfect in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Czech Republic, intent on improving its runner-up finish in  
Euro '96, won its fifth straight qualifying game Wednesday night 
with a 2-1 victory over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day featuring 16 games leading to the 2000 European  
Championships, Germany, Latvia and Spain -- with a hat trick by Raul 
Gonzalez to give him seven goals in the last two games -- took the 
lead in their groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine stayed on top despite a 1-1 tie with Iceland, and World  
Cup champion France struggled to a 2-0 win over Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, leaders in Group 1, was held to a 1-1 tie by lowly  
Belarus, the Italians' first draw after three victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Three games were postponed because of NATO air strikes against  
Yugoslavia: Slovenia vs. Albania in Group 2, Croatia vs. Malta and 
Yugoslavia vs. Malta, both in Group 8. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group 1

Italy evened the score in the 30th minute on a penalty kick by 
Filippo Inzaghi. 
</P>
<P>
	At Zurich, Switzerland, two goals from Stephane Chapuisat  
propelled the Swiss to a 2-0 win over Wales to boost their hopes of 
reaching the finals. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Riga, Latvia, Greece and Latvia's scoreless tie was enough to  
give Latvia the group lead over Norway on goal difference. Greece 
remained No. 3 with six points in five games.

twice in five minutes in the first half -- by Jens Jeremies and 
Oliver Neuville -- to beat Finland 2-0 and take the group lead from 
Turkey on goal difference. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chisinau, Moldova, Northern Ireland tied Moldova 0-0. Moldova  
has two points in five games and Northern Ireland has five in as 
many games. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group 4    	
</P>

on goal difference over France. Iceland has nine points in five 
games and Ukraine and France have 11 in five. 
</P>
<P>
	At Saint-Denis, France, the World Cup champions lacked firepower  
in struggling past Armenia 2-0 on first-half goals by Sylvain 
Wiltord and Christophe Dugarry. France has 11 points but trails 
Ukraine on goal difference. 
</P>
<P>
	At Moscow, Russia routed Andorra 6-1, with Vladimir Beschastnykh  
scoring twice.

</P>
<P>
	At Chorzow, Poland, Sweden beat Poland 1-0 on Fredrik  
Ljungberg's goal in the 36th minute. Sweden has won all four of its

</P>
<P>
	At Luxembourg, Bulgaria defeated Luxembourg 2-0 behind two goals  
from Hristo Stoichkov to keep its slim hopes alive.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Plunge After Economic Report / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Wednesday after a regional  
purchasing managers' report exhibited unexpected strength, renewing 
fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32  
point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.62 percent, up from 5.58 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, issued by the Purchasing Management Association of  
Chicago, showed far more strength than expected. The group's index 
rose to 57 in March from 52.9 in February. Economists had predicted 
a slight decline to 52.8. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of the report raised fears that inflation -- which  
has been increasing at a relatively paltry annual rate of 1.6 
percent -- will quicken. Even though it is a regional report, it is 
seen a precursor to the national purchasing managers' report, which 
will be released Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had a bit of a reaction in the bond market to the Chicago  
report,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward 
Jones of St. Louis, ``although I think the silver lining is that 
the economy is still strong. What the stock market should recognize 
is that ultimately, the strength of the economy will lead to 
stronger corporate profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 1/16 point, while intermediate Treasury securities fell 
between 7/16 and 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, held steady 
for a third day at 1,282.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.48 percent, while  
the discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.37 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.51 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.35 percent. One-year yields rose to 
4.69 percent, while the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 from 4.69 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/32 point to 124 1/8. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.23 percent from 5.21 percent late Tuesday.

much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Closely following the release of ``Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri,''  
a global conquest challenge set on a distant planet, comes 
``Civilization: Call to Power,'' a follow-up that extends the 
familiar earthly battle for dominance by nearly 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meier wasn't involved in developing the latest ``Civ'' sequel,  
devoting his time to ``Alpha Centauri,'' which picks up where 
``Civilization II'' left off, thrusting players onto an off-world 
environment in the 22nd century, where they must build a new 
society from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a brilliant continuation of what Meier started, without  
covering any old ground. Players choose one of seven rival factions 
to lead, each based on an overriding philosophy: commerce, military 
might, information freedom, ecology, humanitarianism, spirituality 
or totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtitled ``The Future of Mankind,'' players represent parts of  
a large group of explorers sent to a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri 
who split along ideological lines when their ship was hit by a 
meteor and crash landed on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is significant because players of ``Civilization II''  
could win the game by successfully launching a spacecraft to Alpha 
Centauri, Earth's nearest neighboring star. 
</P>
<P>
	A world of futuristic technology awaits to be discovered in  
Meier's newest creation, leading to dozens of possible military 
applications straight out of science fiction classics, including 
invisibility and antigravity devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Players can also learn how to function in their new environment,  
like building land bridges across bodies of water to access new 
frontiers or raising mountains around inhabited areas to impose 
natural strategic defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The controls are updated, allowing players to delegate many  
mundane tasks to computer operated subordinates. There are five 
different ways to win the game, which comes with a fully equipped 
map editor so players can remodel their new world and play the game 
out again and again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri'' (EA Sports and FIRAXIS Games,  
CD-ROM for Windows95-98, $42.95) is a wild jaunt into the distant 
future that examines the psyche of mankind in the context of an 
action-packed, society-constructing race for survival, where 
embracing the unknown is the only means for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call to Power'' is an extension of previous ``Civilization''  
games with a slew of major enhancements and an intriguing look at 
the dark side of humanity, bringing previously unused aspects of 
history into play. 
</P>
<P>
	The game covers 7,000 years, from primitive, nomadic man to 3000  
A.D. It features a streamlined interface designed to minimize the 
micromanagement required in earlier versions, making the game 
easier to play and allowing players to focus on the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The most exciting innovations come in the form of so-called  
unconventional warfare, adding subtle dimensions far beyond the 
simplistic states of peace or war players could pursue in previous 
``Civ'' incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
	None are very pretty, as fascism, slavery, terrorism, propaganda  
and hostile corporate takeovers are introduced into the mix. New 
minions one can employ include televangelists, eco-terrorists, 
lawyers, futuristic cyber ninjas, slavers and abolitionists. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the ``Civ'' experience into new arenas, players can  
construct colonies beneath the sea or in orbiting space colonies. 
The goal of the game is to defeat all rival nations, or use 
wormholes in space to make first contact with a superior alien 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Civilization: Call to Power'' (Activision, CD-ROM for  
Windows95-98, $49.95) will also be the first new game released both 
for Windows and Linux, the open-source operating system trying to 
chip away at Microsoft's monopoly of the market. Loki Entertainment 
Software will distribute the Linux version. 
</P>
<P>
	Both games support multiplayer Internet and modem play. Each is  
a credit to the strategy game software excellence brought to home 
computers by ``Civilization,'' which has sold more than 2,500,000 
copies in its first two versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difficulty for ``Civ'' junkies devoted to Meier and his  
legacy is deciding whether to buy one, or the other, or both.

<HEADLINE> Religious Order Sues Nun's Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Sister Sean Condon honored her vow of  
poverty, living for decades in a modest, shared apartment and 
dedicating her life to teaching kindergarten in a working-class 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	She honored her vow even after her parents died and left her a  
small fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my money. It's not my money,'' her brother-in-law,  
Charles Goetz, said she told him when discussing the $400,000 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sister Condon's order, the Sisters of Mercy of Providence,  
has no intention of rejecting the money. As nuns across the nation 
deal with dwindling ranks and treasuries, the Roman Catholic order 
in Rhode Island has sued Condon's estate to pay her medical and 
burial expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Condon died of leukemia in 1996 at age 53. Until her  
death, she never touched her share of the fortune, which is now 
worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the 400-member Sisters of Mercy of Providence  
insist their finances are strong and that the lawsuit is not aimed 
at shoring up their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an effort to find a new way to bolster finances,''  
said their lawyer, James Sloan III. ``All the order wants is 
Sister's will to be carried out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sisters of Mercy, whose average age is 69, rely like  
most other orders on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is some kind of spiritual rebirth in this  
country, eventually it is going to be dire'' for religious orders, 
said Arlene Violet, a former nun who trained with Sister Condon and 
left the order to become Rhode Island's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the number of nuns has dropped 25 percent in the  
past decade -- from 106,912 in 1988 to 85,412 last year, according 
to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	The median age in Catholic religious orders has risen during the  
same time, to 68 for women and 61 for men. With too few working 
members, the conference says, orders face a pension shortfall of 
$7.9 billion, or about 60 percent of their need. 
</P>
<P>
	The strife over the Rhode Island will is rooted in the decline  
of religious orders since the early 1960s, when plump-faced Marilyn 
L. Condon became a nun. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her family was well-off, she chose the Sisters of  
Mercy, which attracted mainly poor girls from the factory towns 
dominating Rhode Island. It began in Dublin in 1831 as one of the 
first non-cloistered groups of nuns. 
</P>
<P>
	She seemed suited to kindergarten, standing just 5 feet tall, so  
short that her young students at the Pawtucket school rose to her 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	When her father, the owner of a textile mill, drew up his will  
in 1965, he left Sister Condon nothing. Her future, however, seemed 
secure: She would give the order faith and a teacher's wages; in 
return, it guaranteed her health care, a pension and a modest 
living. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 1983, the prospects of a nun's life had dimmed, with many  
abandoning their vows. Sister Condon's mother, Miriam O. Condon, 
amended the will, giving the nun an equal share of the fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Condon, who died in 1990, included a proviso that Sister  
Condon would not get the principal as long as she was a nun in an 
order ``where members take a vow not to own and retain property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That phrase is at the center of the legal dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	The order allows members to keep their inheritances, so long as  
the money is held by a trustee and used only with the approval of 
the order. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, the estate claims that Mrs. Condon never  
intended her daughter to get the principal so long as she was in 
Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters of Mercy insist on a literal 
interpretation of the will and believe Sister Condon deserved 
$500,000, rather than only the $100,000 in interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In her own will, Sister Condon gave 25 percent of her estate to  
the order. If her estate were worth $500,000, the order would 
inherit $125,000 -- $100,000 more than Goetz, the executor, was 
prepared to turn over. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, based in Cumberland, is trying to recover the costs  
of Sister Condon's medical and burial expenses, and the taxes it 
paid on the interest income -- about $95,000 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has strained a long relationship between the sisters  
and the devoutly Catholic Condon family. 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site set up by Goetz, a law professor at the University of  
Virginia who stands to get more money if the order loses its suit, 
appeals to nuns to disavow the lawsuit, calling it an example of 
``greed and belligerent litigiousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Order president Sister Barbara Riley wrote a letter to members  
saying the Web site is inaccurate and part of ``a very difficult 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Young People Are Buying Less Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- True or false: Young people love to buy music,  
they crave rock 'n' roll and record stores are their favorite 
places to shop for sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Answers: False, false and false, at least for increasing numbers  
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer profile of music buyers issued by the Recording  
Industry Association of America offers insights into a business 
buffeted by change from several directions. 
</P>
<P>
	People ages 15 to 29 -- the bedrock of a youth-obsessed industry  
-- are buying less music, the survey found. This age group accounted 
for 39 percent of music purchases in 1998, down from 42 percent the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, music is much more ubiquitous for young  
people,'' said Hilary Rosen, RIAA president and chief executive. 
``You can get it on the radio, get it on MTV, get it on the 
Internet. There are many more choices out there to get music for 
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the MP3 technology, computer users are able to sell or  
trade copies of songs through the Internet, an activity that's 
causing major headaches now for the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Internet distribution is a small factor in the trend.  
But Siddiq Bello, publisher of industry newsletter The MP3 Impact, 
suggested Wednesday that the availability of music in cyberspace is 
responsible for a real dent in sales, particularly among people 
ages 15 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers 30 and older bought half the music sold last year,  
compared with 34 percent a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the young age group is shrinking, Rosen said. The  
industry has also heard from many young people who didn't like much 
of the new music put out last year, RIAA spokeswoman Alexandra 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock 'n' roll is still the most popular category of music, but  
its slip is showing. Rock accounted for just under 26 percent of 
the music sold last year, down from 33 percent in 1997 and 42 
percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest rock stars of the past decade, such as  
R.E.M., Pearl Jam and U2, have found their influence on music 
buyers has dipped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock sales are highly dependent on radio airplay, and more  
stations are playing oldies instead of new music, Rosen said. It's 
also a genre dominated by white males, and women bought more music 
than men in 1998 for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock is also losing its dominant status to rap and rhythm 'n'  
blues. Rap's stake of the marketplace has doubled over the last 
decade. Rap and rhythm 'n' blues together accounted for 23 percent 
of sales last year, up from 16 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin music is also booming, its sales up 25 percent last year,  
in large part because record companies have begun courting this 
demographic, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominance of record stores as the most popular shopping  
destination is also fading, although more slowly in the past few 
years. Fifty-one percent of consumers bought music in record stores 
last year, down from 72 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost-cutting retailers like Wal Mart and Best Buy are taking up  
a larger share of the marketplace. Just over 1 percent of consumers 
bought music through the Internet last year, a category the 
industry only started counting in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer profile is based on 3,051 telephone and Internet  
interviews conducted by Chilton Research Services.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump Nearly 12 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The price of gasoline jumped by nearly 12  
cents per gallon in the past two weeks, the steepest increase since 
1990, the American Automobile Association said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average price of self-serve regular unleaded  
gasoline increased 11.8 cents since March 16 to reach $1.088 per 
gallon, according to the AAA. This marks the largest increase since 
August 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, when gas prices increased 
23.2 cents, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for other types of gasoline had smaller increases:  
self-serve mid-grade unleaded gas is up 11.4 cents to $1.178, and 
self-serve premium is up 11.1 cents to $1.235. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, prices at the pump have soared, in part  
because world oil producers agreed to take an additional 2.1 
million barrels daily off the market, and because of anticipated 
increases in demand for spring and summer driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have also pointed to refinery production troubles in  
California, one of the largest U.S. driving markets. Gas is most 
expensive in the West, increasing nearly 14 cents in the past two 
weeks to bring self-serve regular unleaded gas to $1.243 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas is least expensive in the Southeast at $1.003, an increase  
of 10.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate survey found that gasoline prices had increased about  
8.5 cents a gallon in the two weeks leading up to March 19. The 
Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide found the 
weighted average, including all grades and taxes, had increased to 
$1.0869 cents per gallon in that time period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regional prices for self-serve unleaded:  
</P>
<P>
	--New England: up 7.2 cents to $1.054.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mid-Atlantic: up 8.8 cents to $1.032.  
</P>
<P>
	--Great Lakes: up 17 cents to $1.123.  
</P>
<P>
	--Midwest: up 11.9 cents to $1.042.  
</P>
<P>
	--Southwest: up 14.5 cents to $1.087.  
</P>
<P>
	The association's Fuel Gauge report is based on data from more  
than 37,000 transaction on March 30.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears States' Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A clearly divided Supreme Court tackled an  
overtime-pay dispute Wednesday that could yield a key ruling on 
state governments' vulnerability to being sued when they violate 
someone's federally protected rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Clinton administration and dozens of probation  
officers seeking overtime pay from Maine urged the court to rule 
that states can be sued in state courts by employees seeking to 
enforce a federal labor law. But an attorney for Maine said doing 
so would violate the state's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits against states generally are barred from federal court,  
Solicitor General Seth Waxman noted for the administration. If 
state courts also cannot be used, he said, people's federal rights 
``were written in disappearing ink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``State courts may not deny a federal right absent a valid  
excuse,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maine Solicitor Peter Brann said, ``There's no compelling  
evidence that the states surrendered ... their sovereignty.'' That 
means Congress is powerless to ``give a private individual the 
right to bring a damages action'' against any state, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maine case is one of several related controversies to be  
decided by a court increasingly sympathetic to state authority when 
it is pitted against the federal government's power. 
</P>
<P>
	The court consistently has split 5-4 in recent rulings on state  
sovereignty. In each, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and 
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy 
and Clarence Thomas prevailed over more liberal colleagues, 
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing in the 60-minute argument session suggested that  
alignment would change when the Maine case is decided, sometime by 
late June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you prevail, we're going to get some kind of hodgepodge ...  
of enforcement,'' Breyer told Brann. And Souter accused the state 
of lacking ``a coherent theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy said it was ``hard to conceive the founding fathers  
believed states could be sued in their own courts.'' And Scalia 
suggested the federal government could ``achieve its ends in 
various other ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probation officers sued Maine in federal court in 1992,  
saying they were unfairly being denied the time-and-one-half pay 
guaranteed by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act for work over 40 
hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	While their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in 1996  
that the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields states from such 
lawsuits in federal court. So the probation officers refiled their 
lawsuit in state court, still depending on the federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine's courts, however, ruled that the 11th Amendment makes  
states immune from state court lawsuits that would be barred in 
federal courts. That would make the state totally immune from being 
sued by employees who allege labor-law violations, although federal 
labor officials still could sue the state to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also has agreed to decide three other states-rights  
issues within the next year: 
</P>
<P>
	--Can states be sued for patent infringement?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can they be sued for violating a federal false-advertising law?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can state employees sue over alleged violations of the federal  
law banning on-the-job age bias?

<HEADLINE> European 200m Champion Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- European 200-meter champion Doug  
Walker was in ``total shock'' after his suspension for a failed 
drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is barred from competition pending a hearing by UK  
Athletics. The governing body of British track and field said the 
25-year-old Scot had the steroid Nandrolone in his system during an 
out-of-competition test in December. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a two-year ban, which would eliminate him from the  
world championships in August in Spain. A date for his hearing has 
not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any real explanation,'' Walker said. ``I've  
always been careful with everything I've taken. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics spokeswoman Jayne Pearce said an independent drug  
advisory committee ruled there was ``sufficient evidence that a 
doping offense has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to note that it is not a declaration of  
guilt; it is a declaration that there is a case to answer,'' Pearce 
told BBC radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee met March 23 and Walker had to wait eight days for  
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total shock,'' Walker said. ``And when I found out on  
the train this morning it was like my worst nightmare coming 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's lawyer Nick Bitel said his client has been denied  
access to full lab results in accordance with IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to know is: What is the evidence?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics To Post Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. said  
Wednesday that its third-quarter losses will be steeper than 
expected, mostly because of production delays in its workstation 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics said it expects to report a loss of up to 32  
cents a share in the quarter that ended Wednesday. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted the company would lose 7 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's third quarter, the company lost 36 cents a share  
excluding one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics said it expects revenue in the low- to mid-$600  
million range. In last year's third quarter, the company had 
revenue of $708.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the maker of powerful desktop computers said it  
hoped two new competitively priced workstations would end the 
company's financial struggles. Silicon Graphics has lost money in 
nine of the past 10 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But production delays have slowed the launch of the new SGI 320,  
a $3,995 model with two Intel Pentium chips and one gigabyte of 
memory. It was to be shipped last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've only been able to ship them in volume over the last few  
weeks,'' said Bill Kelly, vice president of corporate operations. 
``It's not uncommon with this kind of big production transition, 
but it is unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SGI 540, which has twice the power and memory of the SGI 320  
and is priced at $5,995, will ship in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said shipping of an updated model of SGI's Origin servers  
also had been delayed by a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to officially report its results for the  
quarter on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Marvels at the Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- When Martina Hingis won the  
Family Circle Cup two years ago, she was on another level. Now, her 
dominance is not so clear cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has improved so much,'' said Hingis, the  
tournament's top seed who dispatched Sylvia Plischke 6-3, 7-5 in 
her first match Wednesday. ``The Williams sisters, Lindsay 
(Davenport) took over No. 1 for a while. There are so many more 
dangerous players to watch out for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many of them have decided to pass on the event.  
</P>
<P>
	Hingis seems to have the inside track to the tournament title  
with Serena Williams and Davenport out with injuries, and Venus 
Williams' decision to skip the Family Circle. 
</P>
<P>
	However, second-seeded Monica Seles, No. 6 Patty Schnyder and  
No. 10 Conchita Martinez may challenge Hingis. They advanced, as 
did No. 13 Silvia Farina, No. 14 Elena Likhovtseva and No. 16 
Henrieta Nagyova. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis rose to No. 1 at this tournament in 1997 and, when it was  
over, had extended her streak to 31 straight match victories and 
six straight championships.

<P>
	She was 16 years old, won three of the four Grand Slams that  
year and finished with a tour-best 75 match wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hingis learned it wasn't easy to stay on top. She won  
five times, down from her 12 titles a year earlier, and took only 
one major, the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, Davenport supplanted Hingis as No. 1 and sisters  
Venus and Serena Williams began to crowd the spotlight Hingis had 
owned.

<P>
	``I know how I felt when I kind of played at the top level and  
nobody was beating me. You just feel invincible,'' Hingis said. 
</P>

consecutive wins at the Australian and Pan Pacific tournaments in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking the first set against Plischke without much  
trouble, Hingis fell behind in the second 3-0. Just as suddenly, 
she was up 5-3. Yet, she needed four more games to close out 
Plischke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had kind of relaxed after the first set,'' she said. ``I  
just should have gone for it more.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Upbeat for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG today reported its  
sales rose 6 percent in the first two months of this year and 
predicted revenue and operating profit for all of 1999 would rise 
at least 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the projections, executives also sought to play  
down trans-Atlantic culture clashes in the company formed by last 
year's takeover of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical aspects of last year's merger, such as coordinating  
global sales and purchasing, were on track, they said, and savings 
were already being realized. DaimlerChrysler said its previously 
announced target of $1.4 billion of merger-related savings would be 
achieved this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up 6 percent for the first two months of this year,  
with increases in all divisions, the company said at a news 
conference at Stuttgart, where it is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue is expected to rise at least 4 percent over 1998's  
record level, and co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said growth in 
operating profit ``will definitely match sales growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to economic stability on both sides of the Atlantic ... we  
are confident of continued success in 1999, despite some tough 
challenges around the rest of the world,'' said co-chairman Robert 
J. Eaton, who headed Chrysler before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Europe's new single currency, the company said revenue for  
1999 is expected to climb to 137 billion euros, or about $147 
billion at current exchange rates, from 131.8 billion euros in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said almost half of 1998's record $10.2 billion  
operating profit came from the Chrysler passenger car and truck 
division, which includes Plymouth, Jeep and Dodge. Chrysler's 
contribution was $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But while business operations are merging at a ``great pace,''  
Schrempp said, ``the human integration, that's a process that's 
going to take longer ... because we have to take into consideration 
human feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those difficulties were partly responsible for DaimlerChrysler's  
decision this month not to buy into ailing Nissan Motor Co. of 
Japan, said both Schrempp and Eaton. Last weekend, France's Renault 
bought a 37 percent stake in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to focus on making sure our merger is successful,''  
Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint projects already are under way in areas like sales and  
marketing and combined financial service. The U.S.-built Mercedes 
M-Class off-road vehicle begins European production in May at 
Chrysler's Jeep plant in Graz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also have been defections of Chrysler executives to  
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., with some reports 
suggesting the Americans felt Germans were being favored for top 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a later teleconfernce with U.S. reporters, Schrempp bristled  
at repeated questions about the American defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would need somebody from Ford or General Motors we would  
buy it as well, but we don't need that,'' Schrempp said. ``We also 
don't need their know-how. You can quote me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The co-chairmen described the departures as normal.  
</P>
<P>
	``What is the big deal of seven people ... having left? ... No  
deal whatsoever, happens all the time and will continue to happen. 
And by the way, it will happen very soon at the other two companies 
in Detroit as well,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said he, too, was unconcerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a management team as attractive as we have, you  
always have people trying to lure them away,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton has said since the deal was announced last May that he  
would leave DaimlerChrysler within three years and leave Schrempp 
as sole chairman. He declined today to say if he might leave sooner 
than that, as some analysts expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that I would be here until I felt the  
integration is going well,'' Eaton said. ``But Juergen Schrempp and 
I agree that a company can have only one CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler headquarters is divided between Stuttgart,  
former home of Daimler-Benz, and Auburn Hills, Mich., former home 
of Chrysler. The company has started its own jet shuttle between 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 reporters from around the world packed a Stuttgart  
concert hall for the news conference, which was translated into six 
languages and transmitted live on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> David Kelley Shows Win Peabodys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two prime-time series produced by David E.  
Kelley, Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and ABC's ``The Practice,'' on 
Wednesday won Peabody Awards for broadcast and cable excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third of the 33 awards went to programs that aired on PBS  
stations or to a PBS executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, chosen from among nearly 1,300 entries, are  
administered by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College 
of Journalism and Mass Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ellerbee won for her efforts to explain President  
Clinton's impeachment to children on her ``Nick News'' program on 
cable's Nickelodeon network. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Peabody's national advisory board, Neil Aronstam,  
said the committee consciously made Ellerbee the only winner for 
coverage of the Monica Lewinsky scandal during a year the story 
dominated the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ellerbee's straightforward explanations to her young audience  
proved to be the most insightful telling of the story to children 
and adults alike,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jac Venza, director of cultural and arts programming for  
Thirteen/WNET in New York and executive producer of ``Great 
Performances,'' won one of the PBS awards. The public broadcasting 
system also won for programs about teen-age hobos, Shakespeare, 
slavery, people with AIDS, architect Frank Lloyd Wright and artist 
Alexander Calder. 
</P>
<P>
	National Public Radio received three of the four radio awards,  
for a documentary on Paul Robeson, for the ``Performance Today'' 
series and for Charlayne Hunter-Gault's reporting from Africa. It 
is Hunter-Gault's second Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour also won her second  
Peabody for her international reporting on CNN and CBS's ``60 
Minutes.'' Robert Halmi Sr., known for family-oriented movies like 
``Alice in Wonderland,'' was also honored. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' won its second Peabody award  
for ``Flip,'' the series' final episode. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO won three awards. CBS, ABC and CNN won two awards. Two  
network newsmagazines won: CBS's now-defunct ``Public Eye with 
Bryant Gumbel, for a report by Carol Marin, and ``Dateline NBC,'' 
for a report by Maria Shriver.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Sun Offer Glimpse of Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. and America Online Inc.  
are promising new products that will make electronic commerce run 
more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture -- first announced four months ago when AOL  
agreed to acquire Internet software pioneer Netscape Communications 
-- plans to offer one-stop shopping for every facet of online 
commerce for consumers or other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it isn't dealt with in coherent way, this boom in  
e-commerce will slow down,'' said Barry Schuler, president of 
interactive services at AOL, pointing to the holiday logjams that 
overwhelmed many online businesses. ``We brought merchants to their 
knees. Their (computer) servers broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executives assigned to the Sun-Netscape alliance, which is  
yet to be named, said Tuesday the collaboration would likely roll 
out new products by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise there were few details about how they would compete  
with technology giants Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp., except to 
emphasize how the partnership would pair two companies with 
different strengths in online technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape, best known for its browser software, is a leading  
provider of programs and services for online business and the 
operator of NetCenter, the second most popular entry point to the 
World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun is a top developer of server and network technology and the  
creator of the popular Java programming language. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, he said, as user-friendly as the Internet has become,  
online shopping is not yet easy or pleasant enough to keep people 
coming back. E-mail, for example, is so simple to use that AOL's 
daily volume can be up to a third of what the U.S. Postal Service 
delivers each day, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is that online shopping is still too geeky and too  
hard to become the primary way that people shop,'' said Schuler. 
``With people going from Web site to Web site and putting in their 
credit card info again and again and again, there's a formidable 
barrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Tolliver, the president and general manager of the joint  
venture, said there will be a series of announcements in the coming 
months to detail the Sun-Netscape strategy. Tuesday's presentation 
was sketchy, he said, because the AOL-Netscape merger was completed 
less than two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Hires Harrick As Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick restored his reputation at Rhode  
Island. Now he's back on the coaching A-list. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was hired Wednesday as basketball coach at Georgia,  
completing his comeback from a recruiting scandal that led to his 
firing at UCLA three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, we said our commitment would be to hire a  
proven head coach,'' Georgia athletic Vince Dooley said. 
``Obviously, we've far surpassed that expectation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley checked with the NCAA before hiring Harrick, who guided  
UCLA to the 1995 national championship but was fired the following 
year for his involvement with an illegal recruiting dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick paid the tab and allegedly lied to cover up that more  
players were at the dinner than allowed by NCAA rules. After 
sitting out the 1996-97 season, he spent two years at Rhode Island, 
leading the Rams to the NCAA tournament both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were mistakes made and I've discussed this with coach  
Harrick,'' Dooley said. ``We go the extra mile to operate within 
the rules and regulations of the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, who has long maintained that he didn't deserve to be  
fired by the Bruins, admitted Wednesday that mistakes were made and 
that he learned from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``That which does not destroy you only makes you stronger,'' he  
said. ``I've grown from that. I'm a better coach and a better human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick received about $350,000 a year at Rhode Island, while  
his four-year contract with Georgia is worth an estimated $550,000 
annually in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will set up a yearly $100,000 annuity, similar  
to the deal for football coach Jim Donnan, that would be paid in 
full if Harrick fulfills his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry to see him leave,'' Rhode Island athletic  
director Ron Petro said. ``His expertise as a coach was appreciated 
by the university, our fans, supporters and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at  
Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA 
tournament 14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia fired Ron Jirsa on March 11 after he failed to lead the  
Bulldogs to the NCAA tournament during his two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick said it was a ``no-brainer'' to accept Georgia's offer,  
citing the strength of the Southeastern Conference, and came to the 
news conference with a stuffed dog that belted out the Georgia 
fight song. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be in a league where you can play teams like  
Kentucky and Auburn night in and night out,'' he said. ``That just 
makes your own team better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was chosen over Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, who  
was endorsed by Dean Smith and Michael Jordan, his former coach and 
teammate, respectively, at North Carolina. The other finalist, 
Delaware's Mike Brey, removed himself from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia president Michael Adams was vice president of  
development at Pepperdine when Harrick coached at the California 
school. The two are close friends, but Adams stressed that the 
decision to hire Harrick was made by Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams also warned that if Harrick made the same mistakes at  
Georgia as he did at UCLA, he would be fired again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take compliance very seriously,'' Adams said. ``If a coach  
ever misled me, I wouldn't have that coach working for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia players, coming off two straight disappointing  
seasons, were ecstatic to get a coach of Harrick's stature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' center Robb Dryden said. ``Everybody  
knows coach Harrick. When I heard the news, I was like, `He's 
coming here?' That should do volumes for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five returning players stood at the back of the room during the  
news conference, but sophomore Jumaine Jones was a no-show. The 
All-SEC forward, who led the Bulldogs in scoring and rebounding, 
has said he plans to enter the NBA draft. He did not answer phone 
calls to his campus apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should change his decision,'' guard D.A. Layne  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick hoped to bring his son, Jim Jr., to Georgia as an  
assistant coach, but the school nixed that idea because of the 
state's anti-nepotism law. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Harrick said his son told him he couldn't afford to  
turn down the Georgia job and reassured him, ``I'll be fine. I'm a 
survivor.'' Still, it was a difficult decision for the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt me more than anything,'' Harrick said. ``That was  
really the only thing that delayed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was the Pepperdine coach for nine seasons, a tenure that  
began in 1979 and included four NCAA tournament appearances and the 
only losing season of his college career, in 1986-87. Moving to 
UCLA, his teams never won fewer than 21 games in eight years, 
highlighted by a 31-2 mark during the national title season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick led Rhode Island to consecutive NCAA tournament  
appearances, including a regional final in 1998. The Rams lost to 
North Carolina Charlotte in the first round this year.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Opens HillaryNo Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says  
his bluntly named Web site targeting Hillary Rodham Clinton is a 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the mayor said 1,100 visitors to ``HillaryNo.Com''  
expressed a willingness to volunteer should Giuliani run for the 
U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican mayor and the first lady may face each other in a  
race for the Senate seat being vacated next year by New York 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Neither has officially entered 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site went online during the weekend. ``The last Web site  
that was as active was the Victoria Secrets Web site,'' the mayor 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friends of Giuliani site opens to a photo of a smiling first  
lady with her thumbs up and the message: ``U.S. Senate: For Proven 
Leaders, Not a Proving Ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With no governmental experience, never elected to any public  
office, her failed health care experiment under her belt, Mrs. 
Clinton now wants to be part of the Senate as we head into the next 
millennium,'' the Web site says. 
</P>
<P>
	The site allows people to make credit-card donations, volunteer  
for the mayor and sign a petition to ``send a clear message that 
you object to Hillary Clinton using the U.S. Senate as a stepping 
stone to higher office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail and telephone messages seeking comment from Mrs.  
Clinton's representatives, who were in Africa with the first lady, 
weren't answered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said ``the tone  
of the Web site matches the direction of the mayor's approval 
ratings -- negative, negative, negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's approval ratings have fallen since the police killing  
of an unarmed African immigrant, but the same polls show Mrs. 
Clinton's once substantial lead over the mayor slipping away.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks End Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index slipped in  
volatile trading today, the last day of Japan's fiscal year. The 
dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.98 yen at late afternoon, down 0.02 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also lower than its level of 120.36 
yen in New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 22.53 points, or 0.14  
percent, closing the day at 15,836.59. On Tuesday, the index lost 
149.72 points, or 0.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened the session slightly higher following  
weakness in Nikkei futures and an overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average soon moved into negative territory on  
profit-taking following the market's recent strong gains, losing as 
much as 207 points before reducing some of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The average has climbed about 15 percent this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. pension funds were buying for window dressing purposes  
throughout the day,'' said Dhia Amir, senior institutional sales 
trader at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that buying was outpaced by domestic  
profit taking and selling by investors with bonds linked to the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was moderate, with about 480 million shares changing  
hands on the exchange's first section, compared with Tuesday's 
turnover of 464 million shares. Advances outnumbered retreaters 716 
to 460, with 137 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,267.22. 
The TOPIX had risen 0.57 points, or 0.04 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar moved as high as 120.98 yen earlier today  
on strong buying from Japanese financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback later shed its early gains on selling by  
Japanese exporters and overseas players, including U.S. funds, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was relatively range bound in Tokyo today, the last day  
of Japan's fiscal year. Japan's new fiscal year begins on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.90 yen and 120.98 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.59 yen, lower  
from 128.78 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.745 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.740 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For 42 years, school janitor Jesse  
Williams puffed three packs of Marlboros a day, never believing the 
cigarette company would sell him something that would kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two years to the day after he died of lung cancer, a jury  
ordered Philip Morris to pay the biggest liability award ever 
against the tobacco industry, $81 million, for lying about the 
risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``My late husband had a dying wish,'' widow Mayola Williams said  
after Tuesday's verdict. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies 
stop lying about the health problems of smokers ... so that other 
people will understand that they are being used, just plain used, 
for the gain of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second major financial blow this year against the  
world's largest cigarette maker. A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 
million last month to a Marlboro smoker with inoperable lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides that case, U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking  
liability cases only three times -- twice in Florida and once in New 
Jersey. All three verdicts were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, industry watchdogs and Wall Street analysts said the  
Oregon award may open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As little as three years ago most people thought the tobacco  
industry was invulnerable. This case shows we have a crack in the 
dam,'' said John Banzhof, executive director of Action on Smoking 
and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be even easier the third, fourth and fifth time  
around,'' he said. ``It's like sharks smelling blood. These cases 
have spread a lot of chum in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added analyst Gary Black, with the New York brokerage firm  
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co: ``This will persuade the industry to 
start thinking the tide may be turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said the tobacco industry  
has a 40-year history of prevailing in such cases, and he promised 
to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this verdict, it was not supported by the  
evidence,'' Cofer said. ``It was a product of passion and 
prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which found Williams and the company to be equally  
negligent, awarded his wife and six adult children $1.6 million in 
compensatory damages, and $79.5 million in punitive damages for 
lying about the dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had sought $101 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor with the Portland  
school system, as a nicotine addict who believed the company when 
it said there was no link between smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died at age 67, just five months after he was diagnosed  
with small-cell carcinoma, the deadliest form of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Multnomah County Circuit Court jury, which  
included three smokers and four former smokers, spent a little more 
than two days reviewing a month of technical and often conflicting 
testimony from experts in such areas as cancer diagnosis, radiology 
and the chemistry of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, attorneys for the Williams family cited  
internal Philip Morris documents to bolster their claim that the 
company long knew about the cancer-causing potential of cigarettes 
and hid that information from its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' attorney, Raymond Thomas, called the tobacco  
company ``willful, malicious, sneaky'' in its efforts to keep 
smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	One juror, April Dewees, said she and other panelists were  
angered by what they saw in the company documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Phillip Morris) want it to be everyone's responsibility  
but theirs,'' she said. ``Are people really making an informed 
decision when they don't have the information?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cofer said Williams was well aware that smoking could harm his  
health and could have quit ``if he'd wanted to badly enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, tobacco giants reached a $206 billion settlement  
with states, but that doesn't end individual and class-action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to the latest big verdict was swift. Philip Morris  
stock ended Tuesday as the biggest loser on the Dow Jones 
industrial average, dropping 8 percent. Its plunge helped push 
other tobacco stocks down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why?'' asked Thomas. ``Because what the whole world  
wants to know is whether they are going to be able to get away with 
it or is it over. And Wall Street voted today with the jury.''

<HEADLINE> Bob Duval Seeks Senior PGA Major  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- If this were match play, Bob Duval  
could go 1-up on son David Duval this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair struck a golfing first last weekend, with David  
capturing The Players Championship and Bob winning on the seniors 
tour for his first professional victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Bob Duval, a 53-year-old former club pro, can do his son  
one better -- winning a major. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, who has overtaken Tiger Woods as the world's No.  
1-ranked golfer, has won 10 tournaments in 18 months. However, he 
has never won a major. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval will be going after a major of his own this week at  
The Tradition -- the Senior PGA Tour event, presented by 
Countrywide, on the Cochise Course in north Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	His path will be somewhat cleared by the withdrawal of two-time  
champion Gil Morgan, who pulled out Wednesday because of a sore 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan is the first senior since Jack Kiefer at the Canadian  
Senior Open last year to fail to defend a title. Morgan pulled out 
of last week's event after two rounds because of back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing to have to pull out of The Tradition  
this year, especially with the opportunity to win for a third 
straight time,'' Morgan said. ``You only get a chance like this 
maybe once in a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval wouldn't mind another double -- winning The Tradition,  
with his son taking the Masters a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have the first, but I think he might have one in a couple  
of weeks,'' Duval said. ``I'm not going to Vegas, but it's 
something I wouldn't bet against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval's victory last week came at the Emerald Coast Classic  
in Florida, where he beat Bruce Fleischer by two strokes. A few 
hours later, David won The Players Championship across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I taught him how to play, but not the way he's playing now,''  
Duval said. ``Nobody can teach that. You can't teach the 
concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pro at two exclusive clubs in the Jacksonville, Fla., area,  
Duval spent some of his best competitive years following his son 
from tournament to tournament. David paid him back when Bob was 49 
by urging him to prepare himself for the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won $555,601 in 1997, his first full year, and $734,573  
last year while recording three second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Morgan, Bob Duval also won't have four-time champion  
Jack Nicklaus to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who designed Cochise and four other courses at Desert  
Mountain, is rehabilitating after hip-replacment surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Nicklaus, Morgan, Don Bies and Lee Trevino, who  
elected to stay with his family, leaves only two former champions 
in the field -- Tom Shaw (1993) and Raymond Floyd (1994). 
</P>
<P>
	But there is still plenty of talent on hand, including the  
50-year-old Fleischer, who has won twice, finished second twice and 
won $532,400 in four tournaments as a rookie on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised a little by my play,'' Fleischer said. ``I don't  
feel as intimidated as I once did, especially not out here. As you 
get older, maybe the drive isn't as great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale Irwin is also seeking his first Tradition crown, and he  
makes no secret about his desire to add it to the 20 he's collected 
since turning 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good, tough golf course,'' said Irwin, who has won 16  
times in the last two seasons, with one U.S. Senior Open and two of 
his three Senior PGA Championships. ``You need to manage your game 
well to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus came back from a one-stroke deficit to beat Irwin by  
three shots in 1996, a loss that still rankles despite Irwin's 
senior-record $7,620,253 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little too aggressive,'' Irwin said. ``That's been my  
Achilles' heel my whole career.''

<HEADLINE> Is Jordan Serious About Comeback? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	We can only be sure about what he WON'T do.  
</P>
<P>
	Play baseball. Save the planet. Drive the carpool much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	But what will Michael Jordan DO?  
</P>
<P>
	No matter what you hear, no one knows at the moment -- not even  
the man himself. The reason Jordan refused to shut the door on a 
return to the NBA is because no one is happier hearing his name 
echoing down every hallway. So you know how much he must be loving 
it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the weekend, the scuttlebutt was that Jordan is  
interested only in owning the league's Charlotte franchise. On 
Tuesday night, it became that he might want to play for the team, 
too. The possibilities grow more intriguing by the day. At the 
breathless pace that Fox Sports News is pushing this story, mascot 
Hugo The Hornet's job won't be safe by end of the week, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very surprised if he came back and played,'' good buddy  
Charles Barkley told Fox when cornered by the network late Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a new one,'' former running mate Scottie Pippen weighed  
in a few minutes later. ``I don't see him coming in as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the two Houston Rockets have their reasons for  
wanting Jordan as far away from a basketball court as possible. His 
absence is Barkley's best chance to acquire at least one 
championship ring. It is Pippen's only chance to get his hands on 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all their reasons are selfish ones. Barkley, like Magic  
Johnson, another Jordan intimate, want to see his friend become the 
first black owner of a major sports franchise. Both of them, as 
well as Pippen, share the same concern for Jordan's legacy that 
Jordan expressed at a retirement news conference barely 10 weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'd do a disservice to himself,'' Barkley said. ``I  
think all athletes who come back do a disservice to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, never an original thinker, concurred. ``He had a great  
career. He's going to leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will he?  
</P>
<P>
	The guess here is probably not.  
</P>
<P>
	People who have seen Jordan in recent days peg him at a good 20  
pounds heavier than his last listed playing weight of 216. He 
hardly needs the extra weight to leverage his bid to buy a 
controlling interest in the team since commissioner David Stern, 
along with just about everybody else in his home state of North 
Carolina, would like nothing more than to see Jordan ease current 
owner George Shinn on down the road. And they might even show their 
gratitude by building him that new stadium that Shinn has begged 
shamelessly for the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan is likely to want his portion of ownership without  
putting much of his own money out, and for considerably less than 
half the $250 million that Shinn is said to be asking. That's where 
the playing part of the equation apparently comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	Current NBA rules prohibit a player from owning a team and vice  
versa. But if Jordan expressed a willingness to climb back into a 
uniform, who knows what concessions the league might be willing to 
throw at his feet? 
</P>
<P>
	And if the spirit of cooperation really takes hold, who's to say  
the rest of a widely circulating wish list couldn't come true: 
Jordan's last coach, Phil Jackson, back coaching for at least one 
season; his college coach, Dean Smith, as the Hornets' president; 
his agent, David Falk, negotiating player contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The linchpin, though, is Jordan, and not just in the front  
office, but out on the floor. He might have been honest when he 
said in January that there was only a 1 percent chance of his ever 
coming back to play. But if Jordan has been watching the sorry 
state of play so far this season -- beyond the occasional cameo as 
Jack Nicholson's guest -- the percentage must be in double digits at 
the very least. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan never was any good at sitting still. There is that  
``competition problem'' that the late James Jordan talked about, an 
itch that all the golf in the world and even the dizzying heights 
of business can't quite scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan knows how silly it would seem if he came rushing back  
now, even if he only came out and admitted he is giving it serious 
thought. So for the moment, he is probably thinking about dieting 
and swearing he is going to put that new basket up at the end of 
the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	And by not saying a word much about any of this he-is-back  
business, Jordan is doing what satisfies him more than anything but 
playing the game itself. He is listening to us talk about him doing 
it again. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Celebrity Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Brian Setzer  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Brian Setzer was born in New York on April 10,  
1959. Raised in Massapequa, N.Y., Setzer never seemed to go with 
the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was 8, he started lessons on the euphonium, a brass  
instrument that resembles a tuba. He played the euphonium for 10 
years, and the influence of horns on his music has been strong ever 
since. Even when he started guitar lessons (also at 8), his teacher 
was a saxophone player. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager, he would cut class and take the train into New  
York to hang around the jazz clubs. Underage, he would sneak into 
places such as the Village Vanguard and Village Gate. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Musical Influences:* Although Setzer was born after the first  
wave of rock 'n' roll hit in the 1950s, he has always preferred the 
music of that period. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was going to high school, even though it was the '70s,  
it was still the leftover of the '60s. It was hippie; the flower 
thing,'' Setzer said. ``I never connected with it. I had long hair 
but when I was about 15, I just cut it all off. I wanted to look 
like Eddie Cochran rather than Jim Morrison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Big break:* Brian Setzer and The Stray Cats spearheaded a  
``rockabilly'' revival in the early 1980s with such stripped-down 
hits as ``Stray Cat Strut'' and ``Rock This Town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the idea of a big band percolated in Setzer's head. On the  
tour bus, he would listen to Gene Krupa and Bobby Darin, practice 
jazz chords, and imagine how his songs would sound arranged for a 
big band. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the old 'Tonight Show,' bands would come on but Doc  
Severinsen wouldn't be included,'' he said. ``What a waste! I 
always wanted The Stray Cats on so we could play 'Rock This Town' 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brian Setzer Orchestra was born in late 1992. The 17-piece  
orchestra is a rambunctious package of rocking jazz, with Setzer's 
guitar ringing loud and clear over swinging charts. Setzer croons, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``Musically, a big band is pretty hard to beat. It's so  
rich, so powerful. Another thing is, people are tired of going out 
and looking at three or four guys with guitars. With this, there's 
so much to look at. It's entertaining. People are really intrigued 
by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Awards:* The Brian Setzer Orchestra captured two pop honors at  
this year's Grammys for ``The Dirty Boogie,'' Setzer's third album 
featuring big-band swing with a rockin' twist.

                           *Lucien Aigner    	
</P>
<P>
	GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Lucien Aigner, a photojournalist  
known for his images of Albert Einstein and Benito Mussolini, died 
Monday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian-born Aigner, brother of the noted designer Etienne  
Aigner, was among the first photojournalists to exploit the ability 
of a 35 mm camera to capture candid images of prewar Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	His image of Italian dictator Mussolini tweaking his nose was  
taken at a 1935 conference where Allies tried to dissuade Mussolini 
from an alliance with Hitler. He was able to take it only because 
his camera was inconspicuous. The shot eventually ran on the cover 
of Newsweek in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Aigner had fled Paris in 1938, when the war was looming. His  
photo of a rumpled Einstein in droopy trousers standing before a 
blackboard was taken in a Princeton classroom in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his other notable photo topics were a French sailor and  
his girl dancing in the street on Bastille Day, a smirking Hitler 
and New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a writer, radio announcer, script writer and  
producer for the Voice of America before coming to this small 
village in the Berkshires in 1954 to open a portrait studio. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his brother, survivors include two sons, two  
daughters and a sister. 

</P>

                            *Larry Cole    	
</P>
<P>
	WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Larry Cole, a reporter for the Watertown  
Daily Times for nearly 30 years, died Sunday of a heart attack. He 
was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole covered several different beats. He was covering Jefferson  
County government at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole was a member of the news team covering the 1980 Winter  
Olympics at Lake Placid that won an award from the New York State 
Publishers Association for distinguished local reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his father, a son, two daughters, a brother  
and three sisters. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Michel Crepeau    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Michel Crepeau, a longtime lawmaker known for his  
incisive questions and lyrical orations before the French 
Parliament, died Tuesday, a week after collapsing in his National 
Assembly seat from a heart attack. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Crepeau, a longtime leftist, was rushed to Cochin Hospital after  
collapsing before television cameras on March 23, minutes after 
asking a question about savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Crepeau, mayor of the Atlantic coastal town of La Rochelle since  
1971, was a member of the Radical Party of the Left. 
</P>
<P>
	He headed various ministries, including Environment from  
1981-83, Commerce from 1984-86 and Justice in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Crepeau, who was elected deputy in 1973, 1986 and 1997, was  
introduced to politics in 1948, when he joined the Radical Party. 
From 1978-81, he served as president of the Movement of Radicals of 
the Left, a small party allied with the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Crepeau served as president of the  
Radical, Citizen and Green group in the National Assembly, which 
brought together several small parties. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a presidential candidate in the 1981 election won by  
President Francois Mitterrand. 

</P>

                        *Bernhardt L. Dorman    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Bernhardt L. Dorman, a longtime  
aerospace executive and former assistant administrator for NASA, 
died Saturday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorman worked as an executive of Aerojet General Corp., which he  
joined in 1943. He helped establish the firm's rocket production 
and testing facilities in Azusa, Calif., and was among the early 
leaders in the rocket propulsion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, when Aerojet was playing a major role in the U.S. space  
and missile development effort, Dorman was named a corporate vice 
president in charge of Test Operations. He later served as 
president of Aerojet Investments Limited, a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorman took a yearlong absence from Aerojet in June 1967 to  
serve as an assistant administrator for industry affairs at NASA.

	Lapos began his journalism career at the Leader-Herald as a  
reporter in the 1950s. He was managing editor at the time of his 
retirement in 1988.

</P>
<P>
	HEART BUTTE, Mont. (AP) -- Leonard Mountain Chief, a tribal elder  
of the Blackfeet Indian tribe, movie actor and champion fiddler, 
died Monday of a heart attack. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain Chief appeared in the 1989 film ``War Party.'' He also  
played actor Steven Seagal's father-in-law in the recent film ``The 
Patriot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain Chief had roles in 17 films and documentaries since  
1948, including ``All the Young Men'' with Sidney Poitier in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranched in the Heart Butte area and was active in the  
political community, serving three terms in the Blackfeet Tribal 
Council, and as chairman of the Land Board and gambling committee. 
</P>
<P>
	An avid fiddler, Mountain Chief had played in Nashville and  
Hollywood, and in 1987 headlined a country jamboree at the 
then-College of Great Falls. Later that year he performed in a show 
with Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings and toured Russia.

	GOPESHWAR, India (AP) -- Villages inaccessible by road awaited  
food, medicine and help to dig out from their shattered homes 
today, two days after a powerful earthquake killed at least 110 
people in a remote mountain region of northern India. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong aftershock measuring magnitude 5 during the night  
toppled more houses, injuring at least 50 people in the town of 
Nandprayag, the Press Trust of India reported. A series of 
subsequent tremors, about one every hour until dawn, kept residents 
on the edge of panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the wrath of the gods. This is very unusual. We have  
never had so many shocks,'' said Vijay Prasad, the priest in charge 
of the 2,800-year-old temple of Gopinath. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical teams drove as far as they could to treat the injured.  
Villagers from deep in the mountains walked to the road for 
treatment, while others were carried across narrow mountain tracks 
on stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gopeshwar, a town of several hundred families, most people  
slept in the streets, in playgrounds and even on an army helipad, 
listening in fear as tremors dislodged more boulders from the 
hilltops and sent them crashing down scarred slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened leopards and other animals strayed into villages from  
nearby forests. One girl was killed by a leopard Monday, Press 
Trust of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 350 people were injured in Monday's quake and 2,500 houses  
destroyed. Helicopters evacuated the most seriously injured. Tents 
and makeshift shelters sprang up for the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Men walked from distant villages to plead for help from relief  
and rescue workers who have focused on the worst hit town, Chamoli, 
and on towns along the few paved roads in the Garhwal hills, 185 
miles north of New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanak Singh Dasauli said he had asked civil authorities to speed  
up deliveries of food and medicine to his village of Kiruli, well 
off the main road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our houses are destroyed and we have to sit in the open, but  
nobody seems to care,'' Dasauli said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gwai, a difficult 1,500-foot climb above the nearest road, a  
60-year-old farmer named Sartulal complained: ``All of them come to 
ask for votes when there is an election, but when the earthquake 
took place no one cared if we were dead or alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Red Cross Society sent a first relief shipment of  
tarpaulins, blankets, clothing, rice and food for 500 people and 
said it asked the International Federation of Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Societies for $95,000 to finance further efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial quake measured 6.8 magnitude, one of the strongest  
recently in India and the most powerful this century in this 
quake-prone district in the lower Himalayas.

<HEADLINE> UConn Leaves Imprint on NCAA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A season without many memorable  
moments ended with one that will be tough to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	The final possessions of Connecticut's victory over Duke on  
Monday night in the national championship game was basketball at 
its best. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best offensive players in the game going against one  
of the defensive players. When Trajan Langdon of Duke tried to 
break down Connecticut's Ricky Moore, Moore came up with a 
defensive gem. 
</P>
<P>
	He forced Langdon into a walk with 5.4 seconds left and then  
helped in a three-man pinch that again forced Langdon into a 
turnover, this one just before the buzzer of the Huskies' 77-74 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut became the first team since Texas Western in 1966 to  
win it all in its first Final Four appearance. The victory wrapped 
up the 1990s for the Huskies, a decade that saw a lot of success 
but three tough losses in regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
	It allowed Jim Calhoun to join the list of national champion  
coaches in his 27th season, the last 13 at UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no better a coach than I was three weeks ago or no  
worse,'' he said minutes after being on a ladder, cutting down a 
net and savoring a moment. ``All I had to do was be true to my kids 
and coach the best I could and that's what I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the Final Four it was hard to find someone who didn't  
think Duke was clearly the best team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils became just the third team to win 37 games in a  
season, but the loss Monday night left Duke's Mike Krzyzewski one 
win shy of his third national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time being sad,'' said Krzyzewski, who will  
undergo hip replacement surgery next week. ``I don't coach for 
winning, I coach for relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's 64-team showcase was unable to match last year's  
tournament, which was won by Kentucky and produced one of the most 
exciting in years. But there were new names and faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga showed ``mid-major'' can be a deceiving term as the  
Bulldogs gave Connecticut a scare in the regional final. Wally 
Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and Harold Arceneaux of Weber State 
were right at home in the national spotlight. Ohio State, whose 
turnaround led all the way to the Final Four, was the feel-good 
story of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's run at four straight Final Fours and a second  
consecutive national title ended in the regional final with a loss 
to Michigan State. The Spartans joined Duke and Connecticut as top 
seeds in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some great games during the season -- Cincinnati's win  
over Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout, Duke's overtime win over 
St. John's and Miami's victory at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best was the last.  
</P>
<P>
	The closest championship game of the '90s will go down as one of  
the best ever. And there were plenty of excellent plays to back 
that opinion whether it was the stellar offense of Connecticut's 
Richard Hamilton and Langdon or the gritty defense of Moore and 
Duke's Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great game; it was a terrific game,'' Krzyzewski  
said. ``I've been fortunate to have been in a bunch of terrific 
games. We've won some and there's some we lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was more definitive.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the greatest basketball games I have ever been  
involved in,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Harnisch Won't Start Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- A stiff back and three disheartening  
innings cost Pete Harnisch his opening day start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds switched to Brett Tomko for the opener after  
Harnisch had more stiffness in his back and trouble getting anyone 
out Wednesday during a 10-4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko, who is entering this third season with Cincinnati, will  
start Monday against the San Francisco Giants at Cinergy Field. 
Harnisch was pushed back to the fourth game of the season to give 
his back time to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' Tomko said of his first opening start.  
``That's what everyone strives to do. I'll do my best job. I just 
wish Pete would have been healthy. That would have been the best 
thing for the team because we can't afford to have someone else 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' top two starters have had setbacks this spring.  
Left-hander Denny Neagle is on the disabled list with weakness in 
his left shoulder and isn't expected to rejoin the rotation until 
mid-April at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch was the Reds' top winner last season at 14-7 and the  
clear-cut choice to become the No. 1 starter when Neagle was 
sidelined. Things were going fine until March 16, when he was 
pounded for eight hits and 12 runs in 2 2-3 innings against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, he felt tightness on the left side of his back. He  
developed back spasms in a start on March 21, forcing him to the 
sidelines for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	When he started again on Wednesday, the right-hander couldn't  
get the ball by anyone. Nine of the 18 Phillies that he faced 
reached base on a hit or a walk, and his back never loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch showed little emotion during the three-inning stint,  
not even when Bobby Abreu hit a three-run homer in the first 
inning. In all, Harnisch threw 64 pitches and gave up seven hits, 
two walks and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know exactly what went wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ball doesn't have the life in the hitting area that it  
normally has and I don't know why that is,'' he said. ``I'm not 
sure if it's mechanical or if my arm's not where I think it should 
be. I really can't answer that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite obvious the ball has nothing on it. They're not  
missing anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only encouraging part of the day was that Harnisch felt no  
pain in his back, an indication that it's getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not 100 percent, but I can pitch with it the way it is,''  
he said. ``It's gotten a lot better. I'm not having any pain. It's 
a little stiff, but it's nothing I can't live with until it's gone. 
Hopefully it will be gone soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is for Harnisch to stay behind in Florida when the team  
heads north and pitch in a minor league game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll push him to the back (of the rotation) and then he'll  
have plenty of time to get some treatment,'' manager Jack McKeon 
said. ``There's no sense in rushing him. You've got to go with four 
starters, so what's the difference if you're one or four -- if it's 
going to mean the extra rest and the treatment's going to help.''

	Three Soldiers Missing in Macedonia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three U.S. Army soldiers were missing in  
Macedonia near the Yugoslav border Wednesday night after possibly 
being captured by members of the Serb military or police while on a 
reconnaissance mission, the Pentagon and NATO officials said. An 
immediate search and rescue mission was launched, involving teams 
from several NATO countries. The team had been on a daytime 
reconnaissance mission when they reported receiving ``small arms 
fire and said they were surrounded,'' according to NATO. The 
missing team was one of several Army units guarding the 
Yugoslav-Macedonia border during the ongoing NATO airstrikes 
against the Serb military in Yugoslavia.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO widened its air assault on  
Yugoslavia Wednesday, vowing there would be ``no sanctuary'' for 
Yugoslav forces trying to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. With the 
air campaign against President Slobodan Milosevic's forces entering 
its second week, Western officials acknowledged that NATO's 
missiles and bombs had so far failed to stop Belgrade's offensive 
in the province. Thousands more refugees from the province poured 
across the frontier into neighboring countries. At least 118,000 
ethnic Albanians have fled to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, 
the U.N. said today.

tax filing. The number of people doing their taxes on computers and 
filing electronically has shot up 156 percent compared to last 
year. But the 1.7 million returns prepared at home on computers 
through March 26 represent a tiny fraction of the total of 63.1 
million returns filed so far. Counting returns prepared by 
professionals and simple returns filed over the telephone, total 
electronic returns have reached 24 million, up more than 16 percent

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Top Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and other major  
currencies Wednesday after a rally in Asian trading fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers had expected the dollar to rise against the yen as  
investors adjusted their positions on the last day of the Japanese 
fiscal year Wednesday. But the currency reversed course, falling 
against the yen and euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0768, up  
from $1.0715 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 118.97 
Japanese yen, down from 120.36 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4827 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4899, and 1.5095 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5117. The British 
pound rose to $1.6116 from $1.6108. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8162 German 
marks, down from 1.8255; 6.0901 French francs, down from 6.1237; 
and 1,798.56 Italian lire, down from 1,808.32.

<HEADLINE> Young People Are Buying Less Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Young people are buying less music, according to  
a new recording industry survey -- and the Internet may be partly to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The music industry shipped $13.7 billion worth of music to  
merchants in 1998, up from $12.2 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	But people aged 15 to 29 -- the bedrock of a youth-obsessed  
industry -- bought a smaller share of the music, according to a 
profile of music consumers by the Recording Industry Association of 
America. The age group accounted for 39 percent of music purchases 
in 1998, down from 42 percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, music is much more ubiquitous for young  
people,'' said Hilary Rosen, the association president. ``You can 
get it on the radio, get it on MTV, get it on the Internet. There 
are many more choices out there to get music for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-one percent of consumers bought music in record stores  
last year, down from 72 percent in 1989. Just over 1 percent of 
consumers bought music through the Internet last year, a category 
the industry only started counting in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the MP3 technology, computer users are able to sell or  
trade copies of songs online, an activity that's causing major 
headaches now for the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Internet distribution is a small factor in the trend.  
But Siddiq Bello, publisher of industry newsletter The MP3 Impact, 
suggested Wednesday the availability of music in cyberspace is 
responsible for a real dent in sales, particularly among people 
aged 15 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers aged 30 and older bought half the music sold last  
year, up from 34 percent a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock 'n' roll is still the most popular category of music, but  
its slip is showing. Rock accounted for just under 26 percent of 
the music sold last year, down from 33 percent in 1997 and 42 
percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a genre dominated by white males, and women bought more  
music than men in 1998 for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock is also losing its dominant status to rhythm 'n' blues and  
rap, which has doubled its share of the market over the last 
decade. Rap and R&AMP;B accounted for 23 percent of sales last year, up 
from 16 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin music is also booming. Its sales rose 25 percent last  
year, Rosen said.

<HEADLINE> Tom Arnold Files for Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Tom Arnold and his wife, Julie, have  
filed for divorce after 3 1/2 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing Tuesday in a Los Angeles court cited irreconcilable  
differences and said a financial settlement would be reached later, 
publicist Staci Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold, 39, was previously married to comedian and TV star  
Roseanne. That nearly four-year union ended in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, he married Julie Lynne Champnella, now 25, in  
Dearborn, Mich. It was her first marriage. The couple have no 
children.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Top Currencie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and other major  
currencies Wednesday after a rally in Asian trading fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers had expected the dollar to rise against the yen as  
investors adjusted their positions on the last day of the Japanese 
fiscal year Wednesday. But the currency reversed course, falling 
against the yen and euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0768, up  
from $1.0715 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 118.97 
Japanese yen, down from 120.36 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4827 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4899, and 1.5095 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5117. The British 
pound rose to $1.6116 from $1.6108. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8162 German 
marks, down from 1.8255; 6.0901 French francs, down from 6.1237; 
and 1,798.56 Italian lire, down from 1,808.32.

<HEADLINE> Woman Denies Stalking Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A woman accused of stalking Dennis  
Rodman told a judge she's innocent and was ordered held on $50,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Boguszewski, 36, of Bradley, Ill., pleaded innocent Monday  
to three counts of making terrorist threats and one count of 
electronic stalking. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Boguszewski allegedly e-mailed and called Rodman's former  
agent, Dwight Manley, hundreds of times to request a date with 
Rodman. In November, when she learned the messages were not 
forwarded to Rodman, she threatened to kill three employees of 
Manley's agency, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Boguszewski tried to meet Rodman by attending his games and  
a book signing and turning up at a restaurant where he was eating, 
prosecutor Tori Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Boguszewski also faces trial in Illinois on charges of  
aggravated assault against her father and aunt.

<HEADLINE>  Soccer Rocker Hits Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- At the top of a hill overlooking  
Interstate 35, the goateed face of Alexi Lalas looms from a 
billboard two stories high. Next to his face, two words: ``Soccer. 
Rocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on the other half of the billboard, one-quarter the size of  
Lalas' face, appears the logo of Lalas' latest team, Major League 
Soccer's Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lalas isn't bigger than the team, the red-haired defender,  
once a fixture on the U.S. national team, is clearly one of the 
biggest things to hit Kansas City in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the nation's most recognizable soccer player,  
Lalas is a bona fide off-field celebrity -- a veteran of late-night 
television, a TV pitchman (remember the ESPN spot with Keith 
Olbermann smashing Lalas' guitar right in the middle of ``Michael, 
Row Your Boat Ashore''?) and a rock musician with his own CD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's my shtick,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	It's an act that's playing well in Kansas City.  
</P>
<P>
	Lalas already is in line for his own radio show. The 28-year-old  
player can't go out for an evening without being approached by 
streams of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's gratifying when people just come up and say,  
`Welcome to town,''' said Lalas, who came to the Wizards with 
national team goalkeeper Tony Meola in an offseason trade with the 
New York-New Jersey MetroStars. ``It's never been a drag, never 
been a hassle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of attention is just what the Wizards need. They  
ranked last in attendance in the 12-team MLS last year, averaging 
8,072 fans -- the only team below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS commissioner Doug Logan has said attendance in Kansas City  
remains a concern. And critics of the trade say the Wizards really 
need someone to jump-start an offense that scored just 45 goals 
last season, second-lowest in the league. The team hasn't scored 
yet in two losses this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Which raises a question: Were Lalas and Meola -- especially Lalas  
-- brought in to draw fans or produce winning soccer? 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the trade based on their playing abilities,'' general  
manager Doug Newman said. ``The fact that they are also marquee 
names and very marketable is certainly a bonus, but we don't make 
any trades based on marquee issues. We have to put the team 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Meola, who could miss half the season with a knee injury,  
bristles at being cast in the role of box-office draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been saying since I got here that my major purpose is to  
win games,'' he said. ``All the other things are so secondary to 
me. If they happen, they're great. But if they don't happen, that's 
what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lalas, the first American to play in Italy's top league,  
says he's heard the word ``savior'' used more than once since he 
arrived -- and not because of his soccer skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He shies at characterizing himself as the solution to the  
Wizards' attendance woes, but he embraces the role of soccer 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of my responsibility,'' he said. ``I have my  
soccer goals, which are first and foremost -- but I also have goals 
off the field, and to increase attendance and awareness is one of 
my goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As proud as I am when we win and when I do well on the field,  
I'm just as proud as when people recognize players, and come up to 
me on the street and say they're coming to the game -- because 
that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to introduce Americans to pro soccer was the main  
reason Lalas left the Italian club Padova for MLS when the league 
formed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing against the guys who stayed over there, but I made a  
personal choice,'' he said. ``I could have stayed over there and 
made money -- not that I'm not making money here. But this was 
something important to me, that when I was done I wouldn't just 
left something on the field but off the field, to have done 
something for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ron Newman likes the idea of having high-profile U.S.  
players on his roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me, and I screamed quite loudly three years ago,  
that it's here that the American icons should be,'' the coach said. 
``There's not enough Mexicans in this area, enough Colombians, 
enough Irish, enough Brits -- so there's not that ethnic base for 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move by the league, and now Kansas City  
has to take the opportunity to make it work.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Look but No Deal in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Cellular phones, pagers and fax  
machines were all invented for guys like John Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland general manager is a mover and shaker, and it's  
been about this time the last two years that he has decided to mix 
things up with his Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Hart pulled the string on a blockbuster deal just a  
week before the season opener, sending Kenny Lofton to the Atlanta 
Braves for Marquis Grissom and David Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Indians were less than 48 hours away from opening  
in Seattle when Hart acquired pitcher Dave Burba from Cincinnati 
for first baseman Sean Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	Can we expect a three-peat from Hart?  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a gaping hole on this club,'' he said Wednesday.  
``Sure, we're always looking, and if the right thing ever presents 
itself, and we can help our club, then yeah, we'll go. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now, we've got five starters, a solid bullpen, a  
quality everyday club, nobody's hurt and a young bench. There's not 
a priority like there has been in years past that we needed to do 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh oh. Don't think for a second Hart would let priority get in  
the way of a good deal. He loves to tinker with his ballclub and 
admits not a day passes that he isn't working the phones to see 
what other teams are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a part of me just doing my job,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' search for a bonafide No. 1 starter has linked  
several big-name, big-salaried pitchers to the Indians in recent 
months, most notably Curt Schilling, Kenny Rogers and Kevin Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart wouldn't confirm reports that he has had serious  
discussions in recent days with Oakland about Rogers. The 
34-year-old went 16-8 with a 3.17 ERA for the Athletics last 
season, and would give the Indians a lefty starter for the first 
time since Greg Swindell in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably not a pitcher that is out there that we  
haven't talked about,'' Hart said. ``But with any pitcher, and that 
includes Rogers, we've had no more than cursory talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who has also drawn interest from other teams this  
spring, has been bothered by inflammation in his left elbow and 
hasn't pitched more than three innings in any start during the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Appier, the Indians have had scouts tailing the  
right-hander around Florida for a month. Appier is trying to come 
back from arthroscopic shoulder surgery and the Indians may be 
waiting to see how he pitches during the regular season before 
talking seriously with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not someone we're looking at right now,'' Hart said. ``I  
don't know how he'd fit at this point, considering the money and 
the players he would cost us, and the way our rotation is already 
set up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's Schilling. After saying his only remaining goal  
was to pitch again in the postseason, the Philadelphia ace recently 
called the Indians ``the surest lock in baseball to get to the 
postseason. Even more than the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, Hart isn't dialing Philadelphia GM Ed Wade's  
area code. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even call him anymore,'' Hart said. ``He said he's  
(Schilling) not available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean he won't be later this summer, especially  
if the Phillies get off to a slow start and are out of the NL 
wild-card race by the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	The only area where Hart feels the Indians are shallow is in  
their pitching depth. He's been scanning the waiver wire to pick up 
some insurance in case one of Cleveland's starters gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the luxury of a Bartolo Colon of Jaret Wright  
down in Triple-A anymore,'' said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	One name that caught his eye was Hideo Nomo, released last week  
by the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is that right now it's going to be hard to put him  
on our club. We don't think from what we've seen he's ready to step 
in and take over a starting job from anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Z-Car Will Return in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- The ``Z'' is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Ailing Nissan Motor Co. will bring back the Z sports car that  
helped establish it as a power in the U.S. market back in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Z-car was known as the Datsun 240-Z when it was  
introduced in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version, which will debut no later than the 2002 model  
year, will simply be called the ``Z.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's Renault SA announced last week that it was buying a 37  
percent stake in debt-ridden Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement at the New York International Auto Show  
was made by Minoru Nakamura, president and CEO of Nissan North 
America Inc., who borrowed a theme from the baseball movie ``Field 
of Dreams'': ``If you build it, they will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura stood on a stage amid a fake cornfield and shouted,  
``We will build it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said the strong positive reaction to the Z concept car  
since it was unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show convinced 
executives in Japan to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been overwhelmed with letters from all over the world to  
go forth,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design 
International in La Jolla, Calif. ``This a company that needs to 
get back in the business of doing passionate products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan wants the Z to be more than a niche vehicle and hopes its  
price in the mid-$20,000 range will make it more affordable than 
most of the two-seaters that have crowded the sports car market in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reincarnation represents a big gamble for Nissan.  
</P>
<P>
	If the car succeeds, it will help erase Nissan's reputation for  
bland styling and lure more customers into Nissan showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Should it flop, it will exacerbate Nissan's woes. The company is  
mired in nearly $20 billion in debt and is about to embark on the 
$5.4 billion deal with Renault, in which the French automaker plans 
to subject Nissan to a heavy dose of cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the motivation the corporation needed during what  
has been, after all, rather difficult times for us with our minds 
on a few other things, such as learning French and staying in 
business,'' Hirshberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the Z, while risky, seemed like just the right thing to do  
at exactly this kind of time,'' he said. ``It says to the world, 
`We're playing hardball.'''

	Hirshberg said the concept car, which was created in just four  
weeks, will be further refined and that the finished production 
model will be ``bolder.'' It likely will be rear-drive and powered 
by either a four- or six-cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan plans to follow up the coupe with a convertible.  
</P>
<P>
	``While it will retain some reference to its heritage, it will  
not be a `retromobile.' It will be a forward-looking car because we 
think the car has to resonate with people for whom `Z' is just a 
letter in the alphabet.''

	Nissan picked New York for the announcement because the original  
240Z was unveiled here in October 1969. The show opens to the 
public Saturday and runs through April 11.

<HEADLINE> GM Makes 1-Million-Vehicle Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling about 1  
million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles to change the 
brake light wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Tuesday by the company covers all full-size  
Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks and full-size sport utility 
vehicles from the 1994 model year, including the Chevrolet C-K 
pickup truck, the Suburban and Blazer SUVs, GMC Sierra pickup truck 
and Suburban and Yukon SUVs, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is recalling some chassis cabs based on the  
full-size pickup platform. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are being recalled because wiring was reversed on  
the brake switch from what was specified on a brake switch design 
drawing, according to GM and a federal safety agency that oversees 
recalls, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	With the reversed wiring, the brake switch will work but could  
wear out prematurely, resulting in loss of brake lights, NHTSA and 
GM officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the vehicles will be notified next month to bring them  
in to have the wiring repaired and the brake switch replaced at no 
cost to customers, GM said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Release Cecil Fielder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Cecil Fielder's comeback with the Toronto  
Blue Jays didn't even make it to opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, who agreed last month to a minor league contract with  
the Blue Jays, was released today, a day after Toronto acquired 
Dave Hollins from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it had to do with the Hollins trade,'' Fielder said as  
he packed his gear in the Blue Jays' clubhouse, ``I just don't 
understand the change of heart by the team. I'm a little 
disappointed, I thought everything was set, but I will be OK. Life 
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, 35, split last season between the Anaheim Angels and  
Cleveland Indians, hitting a combined .233 with 17 home runs and 68 
RBIs in 117 games. He batted .264 in 17 spring training games, 
going 14-for-53 with two doubles, a team-high three homers and 11 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto also made former Chicago White Sox manager Terry  
Bevington its third-base coach, replacing Sal Butera. Bevington had 
been manager at the Blue Jays' Triple-A team at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Butera will decide in several days whether to take another  
position in organization.

<HEADLINE> Va. Nixes Bell Atlantic-GTE Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- State regulators said Wednesday they will  
not approve a proposed merger between telecommunications giants 
Bell Atlantic and GTE, saying they lack enough information to 
conclude the deal won't hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Wednesday to ``disapprove'' the deal is short of a  
rejection, said State Corporation Commission spokesman Ken Schrad. 
Under a disapproval, the parties can file another petition with 
more information about the impact on customers, and the SCC will 
reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have said the merger would stifle competition, meaning  
Virginians would not see the savings that utility deregulation is 
supposed to produce. Bell Atlantic has 3.4 million phone customers 
in Virginia and GTE has 557,000. They control a combined 92 percent 
of the state's access lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very disappointed,'' said Paul Miller, a Bell  
Atlantic spokesman. ``This is not what we expected. And we intend 
to refile the application for merger as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to GTE was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The SCC decision is, for now at least, a partial roadblock to  
the proposed merger of New York-based Bell Atlantic and Stamford, 
Conn.-based GTE, the nation's largest and third-largest local phone 
service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, the two announced plans to merge into one company.  
The combined company, worth about $53 billion, would control 63 
million local lines in 39 states plus Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the merger to go through, it has to win approval not  
only of the Federal Communication Commission and the Justice 
Department but also from states where the companies do business. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, 28 states have either approved the merger or said they  
don't have jurisdiction to consider it. The FCC and Justice 
Department haven't yet made a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is the first state to oppose the merger.  
</P>
<P>
	If Bell Atlantic and GTE refile their merger petition, it could  
take six months for the SCC to make another ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	If the SCC says no again but the merger wins federal approval,  
the companies could still combine as long as they kept their 
Virginia operations separate.

<HEADLINE> Audit: Federal Bookkeeping Woeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From $12.6 billion in improper Medicare  
payments to unaccounted-for bullets and bombs, the federal 
government still does a woeful job of keeping its financial books, 
according to an audit released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, the second government-wide audit by the  
congressional General Accounting Office was praised as good news 
because at least things weren't as bad in fiscal 1998 as they were 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress is coming, but we've sure got a lot to do,'' said  
Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government Reform 
Committee's panel on management. 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller General David Walker, who heads the GAO, told the  
panel that 24 major federal agencies don't properly account for ``a 
majority'' of the $466 billion in assets they hold. These range 
from buildings to heavy equipment to ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't necessarily mean the assets are missing, although  
some are. But it shows most government agencies don't have the 
basic financial controls that are commonplace in any private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's financial statements, Walker said, ``do not  
provide a reliable source of information for decision-making by the 
government or the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audit revealed numerous other problems, including inadequate  
data on loans and liabilities such as veterans' benefits, poor 
computer security, vast underestimates for costs such as 
environmental and nuclear cleanups and even lack of documentation 
to support the costs of many day-to-day government operations. 
</P>
<P>
	While the full extent of improper payments made by government  
agencies is unknown, the Health and Human Services Department 
estimated that $12.6 billion of its fee-for-service Medicare 
payments -- about 7 percent -- should not have been made in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that's down from $23.2 billion in 1996, which Walker cited  
as an example of why accurate accounting matters. When the problem 
can be measured and analyzed, he said, government managers can 
better focus on finding solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Horn released his own ``report card'' that graded  
federal agencies in three financial categories: reliable 
information, effective internal controls and compliance with laws 
and regulations. Horn gave only NASA and the National Science 
Foundation an ``A'', while 12 agencies either got an ``F'' or 
hadn't submitted their statements as required by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these were my kids and their report cards, they'd be  
grounded,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. ``This is just 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all these problems, the Clinton administration's Office  
of Management and Budget expects 13 of the 24 agencies to receive 
``clean'' audits of their financial statements in fiscal 1998. That 
compares with only one in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given where we were in 1993 and the obstacles we faced, the  
progress we have made to date is extraordinary,'' said Edward 
DeSeve, OMB deputy director for management. ``We are working hard 
to resolve the problems, but much work remains to be done.''

<HEADLINE> BMW Wins Agreement on British Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Luxury automaker BMW and the British  
government announced an aid package Wednesday for the carmaker's 
struggling British unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and BMW agreed ``in principle on the size and nature''  
of government financing that will secure production of a new 
medium-sized car at the Rover Longbridge plant in Birmingham, 
England, according to a joint statement from BMW and the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement gave no specific figures and said the agreement  
still needed approval from the board of directors of Bayerische 
Motoren Werke AG as well as EU authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Blair said he was ``delighted'' that people could look  
forward to BMW making Longbridge a ``world class plant for the next 
century''. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW had asked for more than $324 million from the government.  
Although the government increased its opening offer of $190 
million, the final amount is thought to be short of what the German 
firm wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is now expected to press ahead with an ambitious program,  
costing hundreds of millions of dollars, to build a new range of 
cars at Longbridge and to modernize the sprawling factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure increased on Britain to conclude the deal after the  
Munich-based BMW reported earnings Tuesday that reflected troubles 
within Rover. The automaker had warned that the longer negotiations 
dragged on, the greater the likelihood of production being switched 
to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax losses in the British unit, which continues to fight  
against a strong pound and declining sales at home, dragged BMW 
profits down 28 percent in 1998 to $531 million. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested $3.57 billion in Rover since buying the  
carmaker in 1994. The unit's best-selling model has been the Mini. 
</P>
<P>
	In England, union officials welcomed the news and praised the  
government for its role in helping the plant, which now employs 
9,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has delivered its promise of not walking away  
from Longbridge. After months of damaging speculation, the clouds 
have been lifted,'' said Ken Jackson, general secretary of the 
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Rover auto workers voted to accept a radical  
restructuring deal to cut 2,500 jobs but keep the huge Longbridge 
assembly plant open.

<HEADLINE> Loss of Aircraft Cost $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A prototype for an unmanned reconnaissance  
aircraft crashed during a test flight, and building a replacement 
would cost $30 million, an Air Force official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Global Hawk, built by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical of San  
Diego, is the only high-altitude, long-endurance robot plane being 
considered for use by the military, which already has unmanned 
reconnaissance aircraft that operate at lower altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft that crashed Monday near China Lake was the second  
of two Global Hawks to fly in a program that already has cost $280 
million since 1994, said Col. Craig McPherson, director of 
high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned air vehicles at Wright 
Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes after taking from Edwards Air Force Base, the  
craft rolled into a dive from 41,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause wasn't yet known, McPherson said Tuesday. There have  
been no other accidents with the Global Hawk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Hawks are designed to fly at altitudes up to 65,000 feet  
with an endurance of up to 40 hours. The V-tailed aircraft has a 
116-foot wingspan and is more than 44 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	The one that crashed had been outfitted with reconnaissance  
equipment and was being readied for flights over the Nellis Air 
Force Base range in Nevada to measure its usefulness to the 
military, McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	No commitment has been made for production but three additional  
prototypes are being assembled. McPherson said replacing the one 
that crashed would cost $30 million.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Held in Mail Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A man who was arrested in the explosion of a pipe  
bomb at a U.S. Postal Service center told authorities he had mailed 
it to a Texas televangelist. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Darwin Alexander, 53, who was arrested in Las Vegas, faces  
charges of possessing components used to make bombs after police 
searched his hotel room there, authorities said. He was held on 
$24,000 bail on eight counts of possession of bomb components with 
intent to manufacture an explosive device, Officer Steven 
Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured when the bomb exploded Sunday at a Postal  
Service bulk mail center in Dallas, but the blast touched off a 
small fire. The package was on a conveyor belt about 30 feet above 
the floor when it blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger in a mail bomb is the projectiles,'' said Linda  
Kirksey, a U.S. Postal Service inspector. ``This type of device had 
the potential to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirksey said Alexander told authorities the package was  
addressed to the Rev. John Hagee, a conservative television 
evangelist and pastor of the 17,000-member Cornerstone Church in 
San Antonio. The address on the package itself was obliterated when 
the bomb went off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why this gentleman has done this is not clear at this time,''  
Ms. Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagee said he was cooperating with agents and other than that  
had no comment. Political figures like Oliver North and Elizabeth 
Dole have spoken from his pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have linked Alexander to an explosive package  
found Monday at a Greyhound bus station in Las Vegas. It was 
addressed to an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, said ATF Special Agent Tracy Hite. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas officers said they learned of Alexander on Sunday  
after he allegedly telephoned a mental health facility, saying he 
planned to use explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found him near the pay phone where he made the call,  
Meriwether said, and he let police into his room at a nearby motel. 
Meriwether described the components that investigators found in the 
motel room as pieces that could be ``readily assembled into 
bombs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motel is across the street from the bus station. Some 200  
people in small motels and businesses in the area were evacuated 
Sunday when the materials were found in the motel room, then again 
Monday when police learned about the device at the bus station.

<HEADLINE> US Official Seeks Freer China Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China should open its closed markets and  
relieve a growing frustration among American politicians and the 
public that could put trade ties at risk, a senior U.S. trade 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said the Clinton administration  
was disturbed by the dark mood in the United States, driven by a 
sense that U.S. companies were being treated unfairly -- illustrated 
by last year's $57 billion trade deficit with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need greater access across the board for industrial goods,  
for agricultural goods and for services. That is the only real 
solution,'' Daley told U.S. business executives in Shanghai, 
China's financial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley's comments mirrored U.S. demands during intensifying  
negotiations over Chinese efforts to join the World Trade 
Organization. The top U.S. trade negotiator on WTO, Trade 
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, left Beijing after a day of 
talks Tuesday, saying substantial gaps remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments appeared to dim prospects that 13 years of fitful  
negotiations over China's WTO entry could be wrapped up in time for 
Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Washington next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley, on a five-day trade mission to China, reiterated that  
negotiations are continuing but would not be held to a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a political deal. This is not a decision that  
should be driven by a visit,'' Daley told executives. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO deal, however, would brighten the atmosphere for Zhu's  
visit. President Clinton's China policy has been attacked by 
Republican critics who say it has minimized Beijing's human rights 
repression, trade surplus, military buildup against Taiwan and 
possible theft of nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley urged U.S. investors in China to lobby American workers  
and politicians about the importance of the Chinese market in an 
effort to turn the tide in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Daley met with Zhu and other senior trade  
officials in Beijing. Today, he conveyed concerns over trade to 
Wang Daohan, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Is Changing Eligibility Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The NCAA said Wednesday it could have  
changes ready in freshman eligibility standards by September that 
likely will put less weight on the standardized test scores that a 
federal judge ruled discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said it had been studying modifications in its minimum  
standards for months before U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter 
ruled in Philadelphia last week that relying on test scores ``has 
an unjustified disparate impact against African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standards -- which include minimum scores on the SAT or ACT,  
a core group of high school courses and a minimum grade-point 
average in that core -- remain in effect after the 3rd U.S. Court of 
Appeals on Tuesday issued a stay of Buckwalter's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA hope to have modifications of the standards, known as  
Proposition 16, in place by Sept. 1, said Penn State president 
Graham B. Spanier, chairman of the NCAA Division I Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not promising we will have it done by that date.  
Circumstances can change,'' Spanier said. ``The stay gives us a 
window of opportunity following our own schedule and pursuing our 
research to have something in place by Sept. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA will continue to pursue an appeal of Buckwalter's  
ruling not only because it struck down Proposition 16, but because 
it also raised other issues that needed clarification, Spanier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards were challenged by four black athletes who  
contended they were denied athletic scholarships or sports 
eligibility because they did not score the minimum on the 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests have long been a subject of debate in the academic and  
athletic worlds as to whether they are discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 16 was a refinement of Proposition 48, which was  
enacted during the NCAA convention in 1983 at the bidding of 
reform-minded university presidents who wanted tougher academic 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanier said some sort of minimum standards are needed to avoid  
revisiting ``the bad old days'' when high school athletes arrived 
on campus ill-equipped to handle the rigors of university 
academics, were exploited for their athletic ability and then 
thrown out without education or skills when their eligibility was 
used up. In studies since then, the NCAA has found athletes 
graduate at a higher rate than the general student body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA position is that it has produced sufficient evidence  
linking graduation rates to test score cutoffs under Proposition 
16,'' Spanier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modifying Proposition 16 likely will involve adjusting the  
weighting of the three components that make up the minimum 
standards, Spanier said. In particular, more weight would likely be 
given to overall performance in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show that the ``single best predictor of success is  
performance in high school,'' Spanier said. There are members of 
the NCAA board who believe high school performance ``is extremely 
important and should carry the greatest weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, standardized tests must be part of the mix and those  
that think the tests are ``irrelevant or full of bias don't have a 
good understanding of testing or measurement,'' Spanier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests keep high school teachers or counselors from inflating  
grades, Spanier said, and also provide a benchmark in the face of 
the wide disparity of high schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards of Proposition 16 remain in effect under the  
appeals court stay, meaning coaches should recruit under the same 
rules during the spring season as they have in the past, the NCAA 
said.

<HEADLINE> US Raises Genocide Issue in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is coming as close  
as it can to labeling Serb atrocities in Yugoslavia genocide 
without crossing a line that could raise the legal stakes under a 
50-year-old international treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Genocide Convention, signed after World War II by most  
countries, including the United States and Yugoslavia, neither 
requires nor prohibits military intervention in a country where it 
is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pact that arose out of the Holocaust does establish  
genocide as an international crime, opens the way for criminal and 
civil charges against individuals and could bolster arguments for 
foreign intervention in another country's affairs, including the 
use of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts ``committed  
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, 
racial or religious group.'' It lists such acts as killing members 
of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to its members, 
deliberately inflicting conditions aimed at destroying the group 
and imposing measures aimed at preventing births within the group 
or forcing the transfer of children out of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions of genocide in connection with Yugoslavia first  
surfaced Monday, when State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
declared there were ``indicators genocide is unfolding in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Rubin said, ``We're talking about forced  
expulsions, we're talking about rape, we're talking about mass 
murder, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people being 
moved out of their homes.'' Calling it genocide, he said, would not 
change the response. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, President Clinton used the word without drawing  
any clear distinction between genocide and other characterizations 
used in describing Serb actions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not allow, if we have the ability to stop it, ethnic  
cleansing or genocide anywhere we can stop it -- particularly at the 
edge of Europe,'' Clinton said in a speech to an electronics 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration is now using the word, a leading human  
rights group working on the Kosovo crisis has not gone that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have been shouting about human rights  
violations in Kosovo and felt the administration was behind the 
curve,'' said Fred Abrams of Human Rights Watch. ``Now, the 
administration is out there ahead of us. We don't want to say 
genocide is not taking place, because the evidence suggests it may 
be. ... But we will wait till all the facts are in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it is genocide, Abrams said, then governments are morally  
obligated to ``do everything in their power to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington University law professor Ralph Steinfeldt said  
that although the Genocide Convention does not mandate enforcement 
or military intervention, allegations of genocide were used as 
partial basis for intervention in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations could be used, Steinfeldt said, if Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic is taken before the new international 
war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law answers the question of individual liability,'' he  
said. ``Collective humanitarian intervention is a little closer to 
the line,'' with wide disagreement over whether it can be 
justified.

<HEADLINE> Romney: 2002 Should Be for Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Organizers of the 2002 Winter Games  
should cater to athletes, give average Utah residents access to 
tickets, and protect taxpayers from cost overruns, according to 
SLOC president Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a town meeting Tuesday night, Romney promised the  
first two but said he could not guarantee against a revenue 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	His least concern, he said, is to ``have a party for all the  
jet-setters around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's remarks represent the heart of a theme of reform,  
coming only weeks after the Massachusetts financier was appointed 
to pull SLOC from its IOC vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will replace one memory with another,'' said Romney, though  
he cautioned that Utah will forever be associated with the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the meeting was given over to questions from residents.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Morgan of Midway lauded Romney for pushing for the  
resignations of former SLOC officials who had conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resignations have taken place, but the profit remains,''  
said Morgan, questioning whether it was right for them to keep what 
they will reap through their past association with SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go back and penalize them now would be unfair,'' Romney  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One resident questioned Romney's suggestion earlier in the  
evening that seats to the most popular Olympic events should go to 
the highest bidders in order to raise money for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be many (other) events that are very affordable,''  
Romney said. But he pronounced a ``no free tickets'' rule for 
corporate sponsors and said that good seats that go unclaimed will 
be sold at the last minute to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Blair Feulner, general manager of radio station KPCW,  
pressed local SLOC members to declare whether their loyalties are 
with Games organizers or with Park City's public interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not your representative,'' replied Gordon Strachan, a  
Park City lawyer who sits on SLOC's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a representative board,'' agreed Joan Calder,  
director of the Park City Chamber-Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau and 
another local SLOC appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Brad Olch, a SLOC member, slipped in his answer, but only  
briefly, ``My allegiance is to the people of Salt -- Park City,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsors Seek Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the Olympics' top sponsors want  
``concessions for damage'' to their $50 million investments by the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
were among some 40 representatives of the 11 biggest corporate 
backers of the games who met Tuesday with the marketing leaders of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch turned down a  
Senate invitation to testify about the scandal and plans to prevent 
a recurrence, sponsors said concern remained in corporate suites 
about the bribery case and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor representatives also said IOC vice president Richard  
Pound and marketing director Michael Payne were asked for the first 
time how the IOC might make ``concessions for the damage'' to their 
sponsor commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was total bottom line,'' one official said. ``They were  
told, `We are having problems getting Olympic budgets and programs 
through because you haven't given us enough ammunition to prove it 
(the scandal) is fixed. So how are you going to make it up to 
us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors are not seeking rebates, but instead want ``items  
of marketing value,'' such as increased access to street ad space 
around the 2000 Games in Sydney, another representative said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor officials all said there was no direct response from  
Pound or Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the sponsors are concerned that ``the events of the  
last three months had slowed down the internal allocation of 
resources, a `Why don't we wait and see what's happening before 
doing X or Y for Sydney or Salt Lake?' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've probably lost 3-4 months on that, but there's still  
plenty of time to do things. I believe if they report in their 
internal process that these things are happening, that goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No ringing endorsement was issued by the sponsors in the first  
meeting since an emergency IOC assembly expelled six delegates and 
set the framework for what the committee hopes will be watershed 
reforms to its structure and membership. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also was no repeat of the sharp criticism of the last  
meeting with sponsors in mid-February, when boardroom concerns over 
the scandal's impact on the ``halo effect'' of Olympic sponsorship 
were repeated loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a much better meeting,'' Pound said. ``It didn't have  
the sense of discomfort, unease and suspicion. ... My impression is 
that they feel we do have a blueprint that looks sensible. We now 
have to build according to that plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told the Senate Commerce Committee that he would be  
unable to attend hearings April 14 on the Salt Lake City bribery 
case. He gave no reason for declining the invitation and said he 
hopes Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles, would 
be allowed to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share your concern on the need of reform for the  
International Olympic Committee and want to assure you that we are 
deeply committed to restoring the integrity of the Olympic 
ideals,'' he said in a letter to Sen. John McCain, the Commerce 
Committee chairman. ``The IOC has taken serious action to deal with 
the past and intends to continue to work with a number of people, 
including yourself, to set the IOC on the right course for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain, critical of Samaranch and the IOC since the scandal  
broke late last year, said he was ``deeply saddened'' that the top 
leader of the Olympics passed up a chance to explain ``the reform 
and ethics initiatives of the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, Mr. Samaranch doesn't understand the gravity of  
the situation for the future of the Olympic movement,'' McCain said 
from his Washington office. ``The lack of transparency and 
accountability within the IOC, that fostered a culture based on 
gifts and lavish travel, has brought a dark cloud over the 
integrity of the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation is pending that would hit the IOC squarely in its  
bank account, stripping tax breaks from the panel and its 
sponsorship deals and rerouting billions of television dollars to 
the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential aspirations,  
said his committee ``must now move forward, unfortunately without 
Mr. Samaranch's direct input, to ensure that urgently needed 
reforms are implemented.''

<HEADLINE> Third Party Proposed in Phone Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-distance customers whose telephone  
service was illegally switched would be able to take their 
complaints to a third-party group, under an industry proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and associations representing smaller  
long-distance companies on Tuesday offered the proposal, which must 
be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before it 
could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	An industry-funded panel, including representatives of large and  
small long-distance companies and consumer groups, would be created 
to field complaints, determine liability and handle refunds. The 
FCC would approve all panel members, an AT&AMP;T official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would have 30 days to determine whether an illegal  
service change occurred. If so, and a customer paid the charges, 
the offending company would have to return the total amount of 
money to the customer's original carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	That carrier would then send half of that amount to the affected  
customer in the form of a credit, the proposal states. That way, 
customers would not have to be rebilled at their normal rate and 
refund the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	If a customer was illegally switched and did not pay anything,  
they would receive the first 30 days of service free. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for supporting a third-party administrator,  
long-distance companies want to be exempted from a provision in the 
FCC's anti-slamming rules that would require companies to resolve 
disputes among themselves and pay victims the difference between 
the illegal and legal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal follows through on a suggestion by the FCC last  
year that the industry set up such a group to handle disputes over 
``slamming,'' which occurs when a person's long-distance service is 
switched without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, ``consumers will almost always get a larger  
refund and in a much shorter time than under the carrier-to-carrier 
dispute resolution system outlined by the FCC,'' contends AT&AMP;T 
General Counsel Jim Cicconi.

<HEADLINE> Surviving Octuplets Make Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Three of the seven surviving Houston octuplets  
made their world debut Wednesday and were quick to show off their 
healthy lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby girls Ebuka and Echerem, dressed in matching pink headbands  
and shirts, wailed and squirmed in their father's arms as he and 
his wife, Nkem Chukwu, were briefly interviewed on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' brother, Jioke, lay quietly in his mother's arms,  
letting out only a tiny yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are doing very well,'' said the father, Iyke Louis Udobi,  
standing in one of the nurseries at the couple's new six-bedroom 
home, donated to them last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview with Diane Sawyer served as a teaser to a longer  
story to be aired Wednesday evening on ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wednesday morning interview marked the first time the babies  
have been seen by the public since they entered the world in 
December. The four other infants remain hospitalized. One of the 
octuplets died a week after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Udobi calculated that it will take up to 42 bottles a day and  
1,000 diapers a week to care for the little ones.

<HEADLINE> MTV Names Chief of Online Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Longtime TV producer Fred Seibert has been  
tapped to lead MTV's new online services division. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, MTV Networks Online, was created last month in  
a bid to beef up MTV's presence in cyberspace. It groups together 
the already successful Web sites of MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon and 
plans to create more Web destinations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the new projects in the works call for creating a Web  
site especially for kids, with moderated chat rooms, audiovisual 
content from Nickelodeon and an online toy store, and a music 
destination with a customizable online radio feature, concert 
information and music reviews. Both are to be released later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seibert, who was MTV's original creative director before  
founding a TV production company and running Hanna-Barbera Cartoons 
Inc., said that following MTV's audience into cyberspace was a 
natural progression for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``MTV networks has avoided stumbling by constantly being in  
touch with its customers,'' Seibert said in an interview Tuesday. 
``As MTV put their foot in the water and got more feedback from the 
audience, we decided it was time for a full immersion in this 
media, the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the venture, MTV's parent company Viacom Inc. is joining  
other media giants like Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc. and Sony 
Corp. in an effort to use their music, television and movie 
materials as ways to make money online. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's other holdings include the Paramount movie studio and  
Spelling Entertainment, which produces hit TV shows such as 
``Melrose Place.'' It also owns the Blockbuster Video rental chain, 
the Simon &AMP; Schuster consumer book publisher and half of the UPN 
television network.

<HEADLINE> Jurors To Sentence Marine Navigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Nine Marine Corps officers will  
determine the sentence of a Marine aviator involved in last year's 
deadly Italian cable car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was selected Tuesday and opening arguments were to be  
held today in the sentencing phase of Capt. Joseph Schweitzer's 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to obstructing justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct justice. He admitted he destroyed a 
videotape he shot before the radar-jamming jet he was navigating 
struck a ski gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, sending 20 people 
plunging to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer could face up to five years in prison for each  
charge, dismissal from the service, loss of pay and allowances, a 
fine, a letter of reprimand and the loss of his place on the 
promotion list. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer will be given either the sentence reached in his plea  
agreement, which has not been disclosed, or that directed by the 
jury, whichever is more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., was charged with involuntary  
manslaughter and negligent homicide after the Feb. 3, 1998, 
accident. The charges were dropped after Capt. Richard Ashby, the 
pilot, was acquitted of manslaughter on March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge ruled that Schweitzer and Ashby could be tried  
for obstruction of justice because of the missing videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he swapped a tape he shot during the flight for  
a blank one after the EA-6B Prowler jet landed at the NATO air base 
in Aviano, Italy. Schweitzer said he took the tape because he 
didn't want it to be an issue in what he thought would be a probe 
only by Italian authorities. At the time, there was no Marine Corps 
criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., will be tried on  
obstruction charges next month.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Coach Stewart Might Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri basketball coach Norm Stewart will  
make an announcement Thursday regarding his future, amid 
speculation that he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday at the  
Hearnes Center in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has coached the Tigers for 32 years, declined to  
comment when reached at his home Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 64, has 731 career wins while at Northern Iowa and  
Missouri, seventh most in NCAA history. His record at Missouri is 
634-333, including 15 NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tigers have never made the Final Four, and Missouri  
hasn't won an NCAA tournament game since 1995, when it went 20-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri was also 20-9 this season, finishing in a three-way tie  
for second in the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers lost to New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was the conference coach of the year five times and was  
selected the AP's national coach of the year following the 1993-94 
season. The Tigers were 28-4 that season and made it to the Elite 
Eight, where they lost to Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Couple Seeks Culinary Delights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Food writers Jane and Michael Stern leave their  
Connecticut home every two weeks for their next culinary tour with 
a destination in mind and a map in the car. Then they get lost. 
</P>
<P>
	How else would they stumble upon what they call the greatest  
treasures of our nation -- like Frito pie? 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of radar, they rely on their internal ``foodars'' --  
their word for their instincts that direct them to good, cheap 
food, Mrs. Stern said. ``We look for a lot of cars in the parking 
lot and follow the locals -- often the police. We trust them to lead 
us to the best food in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sterns are the authors of 26 books, including the new  
``Chili Nation'' (Broadway Books, $12). 
</P>
<P>
	They are willing to eat just about anything as they chronicle  
history and cultures in their ongoing search for great American 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mrs. Stern said she ``could go without so many  
testicles in Oklahoma,'' where the delicacy also known as Rocky 
Mountain oysters and tender groin is a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is that variety of tastes that has allowed the Sterns,  
both 52, to build a career from greasy spoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think American food is just hot dogs, hamburgers and  
apple pie. But we live in such a diverse country that food gives us 
a window to American culture in every region,'' said Stern, 
munching on the Cowgirl Hall of Fame's Frito pie -- corn chips 
doused with chili fixings and eaten straight out of the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili is the closest thing to a national dish, according to the  
Sterns, because it conjures up similar images in all 50 states -- 
comfort food served in a big bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But what goes inside that bowl can range from macadamia nuts in  
Hawaii to chop suey in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipe for Cincinnati's five-way chili calls for 21  
ingredients, including chocolate and spaghetti. Stern said the 
recipe boasts a heritage not all that uncommon in this patchwork 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dish started with Greek immigrants in New York's Coney  
Island and eventually moved on to Ohio. The Sterns added cheese 
from nearby Wisconsin and traditional spices from Texas to make it 
``chili.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern described their work as cookbook authors as that of  
gatherers and collectors, passing along helpful tidbits to others, 
not standing over the stove trying desperately to invent something 
new. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like folk art, quilting and blues music, which are all  
uniquely American, we hope we are helping to carry on the tradition 
of regional food,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sterns, who also write a monthly column for Gourmet  
magazine, don't have any formal culinary training, just an 
appreciation for all the roadside joints that have been feeding 
Americans for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in New York and Tucson, Ariz., Mrs. Stern developed  
an affinity for pizza and chilis. Stern, who was born in Chicago 
and studied as far away as Russia, considers himself a 
Midwesterner. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., 25 years  
ago, when both were pursuing graduate degrees in art. But when the 
time came to get a job, they couldn't see themselves ``working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting at the Union 76 truck stop in Guilford, Conn., they  
became fascinated with all the truck-driving customers with the 
persona of the Marlboro man. 
</P>
<P>
	That interest evolved into a three-year trek across the country,  
shadowing truckers and writing their first book, ``Truckers: 
Portrait of the Last American Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While they traveled, they also kept a diary of all the diners  
where they ate. At the time, there were only restaurant guides for 
the fanciest restaurants in the biggest cities, so the Sterns 
decided to fill that void with ``Roadfood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They hope their stories and recipes help bring another part of  
the country home to their readers, Mrs. Stern said. People should 
know about the egg foo young sandwiches that are unique to St. 
Louis or the fried chicken ritual in Indianapolis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The egg foo young sandwiches add a pickle, mustard and white  
bread to the Chinese dish. In Indianapolis, fried chicken is 
automatically served with chicken noodle soup, mashed potatoes and 
string beans, the Sterns explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The food and experiences they write about is food most people  
can relate to, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the late James Beard, one of the most prominent names in  
American cuisine, had a weak spot for basic food. He loved canned 
asparagus, said Mrs. Stern, who along with her husband has won 
three James Beard Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can eat that really deluxe, fancy food every day,''  
Mrs. Stern said. Still, good food can mean different things to 
different people. And they meet all kinds of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern recalled a farmer's wife in Iowa who told them that while  
her mother baked fresh bread -- ``the kind of bread that people in 
New York or Los Angeles would call pure, fresh country food'' -- her 
biggest treat as a child was store-bought Wonder bread. It 
symbolized modernization in middle America, she had explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The food itself is not always the most important aspect of  
enjoying a dish or meal, Mrs. Stern added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to look at food in its greater context,'' she said,  
remembering the Farmers Inn in Havana, N.D., run on a rotating 
basis by local farmers and their wives. ``It's kind of like 
communism, but a commercial restaurant could never survive there. 
The community pulls together to keep it alive. That makes the pork 
roast and peach pie even more special.''

<HEADLINE> Francis Leaves Maryland for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Steve Francis spent just one season at  
Maryland, helping the Terrapins to a school-record 28 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the NBA beckons, and he is expected to be one of the top  
picks in the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is time to take the next step and take on a new  
challenge,'' Francis said Wednesday in announcing his decision. 
``It's time to start a new and exciting chapter in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 guard, a second-team All-American, averaged 17  
points a game for Maryland, which was once ranked as high as No. 2 
and lost to St. John's in the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really proud of Steve,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams  
said. ``I don't have any doubt he's ready to play in the NBA. It is 
obvious Steve will be a very high lottery pick. Very few people in 
their lifetime get an opportunity like Steve has in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis plans to finish his degree, adding that money was not  
the overriding factor in his decision to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just something that I weighed in,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis considered entering the NBA draft last season after  
playing junior college ball at San Jacinto in Texas and Allegany in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who grew up in Takoma Park, a few miles from the  
Maryland campus, chose to play for the Terrapins instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year in Division I, he led the Terrapins (28-6) in  
scoring (17.2) and 3-point shooting (.388) and led the Atlantic 
Coast Conference in steals (2.8). 
</P>
<P>
	Francis joins forward Albert White of Missouri in leaving  
college early. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who might enter the NBA draft are: Duke's William Avery  
and Elton Brand, the latter the national player of the year; Khalid 
El-Amin and Richard Hamilton of national champion Connecticut; 
Lamar Odom of Rhode Island; Ron Artest of St. John's; Baron Davis 
of UCLA; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; Chris Porter of Auburn; and 
Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Two junior point guards, Ed Cota of North Carolina and Scoonie  
Penn of Ohio State, will return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three senior Maryland starters -- Laron Profit, Obinna Ekezie and  
Terrell Stokes -- won't return next year, leaving forward Terence 
Morris the only returning starter.

<HEADLINE> Japan Limps to End of Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Expanding growth. Rising corporate confidence. More  
jobs. Japan a year ago was forecasting 12 months of resurgence and 
a welcome end to a long, painful stretch of economic malaise. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it experienced its worst year in decades.  
</P>
<P>
	The end of Japan's 1998 fiscal year today will bring an ugly  
reckoning: balance sheets soaked with red ink, soaring unemployment 
and an economy shrinking at a record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The coming year doesn't look much better.  
</P>
<P>
	``The year was so bad and the trends in much of the economy are  
so weak that very few people believe that the economy is ready for 
a sustainable recovery,'' said economist Ron Bevacqua of Merrill 
Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The recession is not just bad news for Japan -- it could delay  
other Asian countries' emergence from financial crisis and drag on 
the world economy if the boom in the United States cools down. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal year began with a major miscalculation of Japan's  
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency predicted decent if not robust  
growth of 1.9 percent -- and clung to the estimate even after the 
announcement in June that the country was officially in recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The malaise has meant one thing for Japanese companies:  
declining profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics industry has been hit especially hard. And  
Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker, was hurting so bad it hooked up 
with Renault SA of France. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearing profits have made restructuring a byword in the  
halls of some of the country's largest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics giant NEC Corp. is cutting 15,000 jobs over the next  
three years to deal with a record net loss of $1.25 billion. Sony 
Corp. is slashing 17,000 from its work force and closing factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The action in the boardrooms has been matched by the government,  
which has pulled out all the stops in a campaign to spend the 
country's way out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The tidal wave of money -- and scattered signs of life in the  
economy -- have prompted some in the government to announce that 
Japan has bottomed out and is close to a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be able to come through,'' said EPA chief  
Taiichi Sakaiya over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market has also been responding: the benchmark  
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average has gained more than 18 percent so 
far in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The predictions of recovery, however, were dealt a painful blow  
on Tuesday, when the government announced that unemployment in 
February had spiked up to a record high of 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the limited restructuring at companies has come under fire  
for trimming jobs -- and thereby keeping consumption low -- while not 
going far enough to cut excess capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Japanese companies are churning out large numbers of  
goods for a population less eager to buy them, setting up a 
dangerous deflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	The government realizes as much.  
</P>
<P>
	``Excess capacity is one of the major causes of the deflationary  
gap in the Japanese economy,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the quick fixes not working as well as hoped and deep  
structural changes a solution only for the long-term, Japan looks 
ready to head into another year of economic malaise -- though not as 
bad as the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine may be better than '98,'' said Bevacqua, ``simply  
because '98 was so lousy.''

<HEADLINE> Filmmakers Hope for a Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's as close to glamour as the New  
Directors/New Films festival ever gets: Madeline Kahn, dressed in a 
chic black pants suit and carrying a red umbrella, smiling and 
speaking in run-on sentences as she talked about the script of the 
zombie-like comedy ``Judy Berlin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't necessarily tell from reading it, what you, in  
effect, meant, do you mean this or that, what your turn of mind was 
beneath the words,'' Kahn told writer-director Eric Mendelsohn 
after a press screening at the Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judy Berlin,'' one of the opening night films at this year's  
festival, also stars Edie Falco, Julie Kavner and Anne Meara. Shot 
in black and white, the film is set in a suburban community on Long 
Island, on a day when a solar eclipse drives some already spacy 
people clear into the twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But established actors at this festival seem as out of place as  
the moon at noon. Now in it's 28th year, New Directors/New Films 
remains an important, perhaps last chance for low-budget films and 
little-known directors to receive exposure in the country's biggest 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets you a lot more attention than you might usually get,''  
said Bruce Pavlow, president of Leisure Time Features, which has 
two releases -- ``The Wounds'' and ``Sitcom'' -- in this year's 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the New York Film Festival, which is a little  
more imposing,'' said John Vanco, co-president of Cowboy Booking 
International, which is distributing ``West Beirut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This festival specifically seeks out films like `West Beirut'  
and `Trans' that aren't going to play to 2,000 screens. This 
festival is about the little films that need a little help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's hopefuls include Indonesia's ``Garin Nugroho''  
(``Leaf on a Pillow''), Norway's ``Unni Straume'' (``Thrane's 
Method'') and Lebanon's ``Ziad Doueiri'' (``West Beirut''). 
American directors looking for a breakthrough include Mendelsohn, 
Julian Goldberger (``Trans'') and Michael Polish (``Twin Falls 
Idaho''). 
</P>
<P>
	Presented jointly by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the  
film department at the Museum of Modern Art, the festival includes 
27 movies from 19 countries. Its two-week run at MOMA ends April 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	New Directors/New Films has a fine history of recognizing new  
talent. Past directors featured here include Steven Spielberg, 
Spike Lee and Wim Wenders, and among the recent films presented are 
``Buffalo 66,'' ``Smoke Signals'' and ``Living in Oblivion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as offbeat as any of the movies is the festival's definition  
of ``new.'' Many of these films have been seen at other festivals 
and only a handful of directors are actually making their debuts. 
In fact, the works of four filmmakers have been released at 
previous New Directors festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always joke that `new' means new to us,'' said Richard  
Pena, program director at the Lincoln Center society. ``When it 
comes to a second film here, basically, our motto is that if we 
like the film and it's going to help the film, we want to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Here are festival highlights (x-denotes that the film has a U.S.  
distributor). 
</P>
<P>
	--''TRANS'': Ryan Kazinski is an escapee from a Florida juvenile  
detention center. He is free -- free to carry a gun, debate the 
meaning of corn and be chased in a Laundromat. He also dances with 
an old man, gets beat up in a parking lot and learns a truly 
disgusting method for catching wild hogs. Mostly, he runs and runs. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't matter whether writer-director Julian Goldberger has  
actually lived through all this or just knows people who have. Like 
no U.S. director in years, he seems to know what it means to light 
out for the territory, even if the territory is Fort Myers. This is 
a major debut feature, a Great American Film in search of a Great 
American Distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	--''THRANE'S METHOD'': Thrane is a moody, middle-aged bachelor,  
searching for faith and in fear of temptation. His neighbor, Mol, 
is a short-haired beauty with a conveniently absent husband. The 
film starts out so dry it almost crumbles in your hands, but it 
turns into a tense, graceful dance, as the camera makes love to Mol 
in ways Thrane is too mixed up to try. For the viewer, Mol becomes 
a total object of desire. Expect, and hope, to hear more from 
Norwegian director-writer Unni Straume, and from the lead actress, 
Petronella Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	--x-''WEST BEIRUT'': A coming of age film set during a civil war.  
Or is it a civil war set during a coming of age film? Ziad 
Doueiri's wise debut takes place in Beirut, in 1975, where a 
smirking teen-ager is gradually worn down to tears. This 
Arabic-language film is the reverse of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The 
latter showed you the war but not how it changes people. The former 
limits the gunfire, but reveals the real damage. Not only that, 
``West Beirut'' has the nerve to be funny. ``Blow my fuses,'' a 
woman of a certain size urges her husband. ``Trim my circuits. Show 
me the stars, you stallion!'' (Or at least that's what the 
subtitles said). 
</P>
<P>
	--''OF FREAKS AND MEN'': Alexei Balabanov's vintage-looking drama  
begins with a montage of tinted, turn of the century photographs. 
The subject matter: The various ways to spank a woman's bare 
bottom. The subjects: the wife and daughter of a Russian 
aristocrat, who innocently predicts that the moving image will 
change the world. It will certainly change his. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace needs to be quicker, but this is still a disturbing --  
and beautifully shot -- movie about the minds behind the camera, in 
the tradition of ``sex, lies and videotape'' and Michael Powell's 
``Peeping Tom.'' It's one of those pictures in which audience 
members get up at the end and smile nervously at each other. 
</P>
<P>
	--x-''FOLLOWING'': ``Of Freaks and Men'' imagines the artist as  
pornographer. This promising British film raises (or lowers?) the 
charge to breaking and entering. A young writer follows would-be 
subjects around London, only to have one confront him and bring him 
along for some real ``interruptions'' of people's lives. 
``Following'' is written, directed and photographed by Christopher 
Nolan, who seems to have read, watched and listened to every crime 
story ever told. 
</P>
<P>
	--''ORPHANS'': Anyone lucky enough to have seen Ken Loach's ``My  
Name Is Joe'' will remember the lead actor, Peter Mullan, who has 
the cool, sharp looks and sympathetic style of a young Paul Newman. 
Turns out, like Newman, that Mullan directs films, too. ``Orphans'' 
is his debut feature, the story of four Scottish siblings who 
nearly lose their minds (and their lives) after their mother dies. 
This is an actor's movie, with dollops of dialogue, arm-waving and 
four-letter words. But it's also a moviegoer's movie, with real 
graveyard humor. Questioned about his capacity to act as sole 
pallbearer, the eldest son responds: ``She ain't heavy, she's my 
mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''LEAF ON A PILLOW'': Directed by Garin Nugroho, an acclaimed  
young Indonesian film maker, ``Leaf on a Pillow'' gets to you 
because of the tale rather than the telling. It's based on real 
events in the slums of Jakarta, where kids sniff glue, pierce their 
bodies and sleep in the streets. There's nothing memorable about 
the camera work or the script, but you respond. You respond like a 
tourist, checking out the clothes, the food, the faces, and you 
respond as a witness, rooting and fearing for the kids, admiring 
the man who cared enough to make a movie about them.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Rejects U.S. Missile Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Eleven hours of ``intensive'' talks  
have failed to convince North Korea to accept a U.S. demand to stop 
developing and exporting missiles, American negotiators said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had frank discussions ... but I can't say we have made any  
breakthrough,'' said Robert Einhorn, who headed a U.S. delegation 
in two days of missile talks with North Korean officials that ended 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for political  
and military affairs, flew in late Tuesday to brief South Korean 
officials on the talks in the North's capital, Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to fly Thursday to Tokyo to brief Japanese  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pyongyang, Einhorn said he held ``intensive, serious talks''  
with North Korean officials. While maintaining their position, 
North Korean officials agreed in principle to hold another round of 
talks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The venue and date of the next talks, the fifth since 1996, will  
be decided through consultations between U.S. and North Korean 
diplomats assigned to the United Nations in New York, Einhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	He identified North Korea as the world's No. 1 exporter of  
missile equipment and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea, he said, provided Pakistan and Iran with missile  
equipment or technology that enabled those countries to test-fire 
medium-range missiles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn said he warned North Korean officials that further  
missile tests and exports would hamper their hope of improving ties 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Developing, producing, deploying and testing missiles that can  
threaten U.S. allies and U.S. armed forces and can eventually 
threaten the United States is inconsistent with improving ties with 
the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea said Wednesday it will never change its missile  
policy under pressure from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It is North Korea's ``legitimate right of self-defense to  
develop, test and produce missiles by its own efforts to defend the 
security of the country because the U.S. is posing constant threats 
to it with enormous nuclear missiles and weapons of mass 
destruction,'' a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement, however, the spokesman said North Korea  
was willing to suspend its exports if the United States made a cash 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified spokesman's two statements were carried by the  
North's foreign news outlet, KCNA. The North reportedly is 
demanding $1 billion annually for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan wanted the United States to use the Pyongyang discussions  
to try to persuade North Korea to stop further missile tests, 
following the one that flew over its territory Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea insists the rocket was carrying a satellite into  
orbit, but Japanese officials believe it was a ballistic missile 
that could hit anywhere in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Plummet / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors interpreted a 
government report as showing there will be no end soon to a supply 
glut. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures tumbled in an expression of skepticism with a U.S.  
Agriculture Department report that detailed spring planting 
intentions and current supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported farmers will plant 1.6 percent fewer  
acres of spring wheat other than durum, but analysts said recent 
beneficial weather -- timely rains and mild temperatures -- likely 
could cause farmers to change their minds about what they will 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if the spring wheat acreage declines, market  
participants are concerned about growing inventories in the face of 
weak world demand, particularly since the winter wheat crop is 
expected to be sizable. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA reported wheat remaining from last year's harvest  
jumped 24 percent to 1.445 billion bushels from 1.167 billion 
bushels at the same time last year. That's the largest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mild spring temperatures also are expected to help foster early  
corn planting, analysts said. That could negate the government's 
mildly supportive view that farmers will plant 2.5 percent fewer 
acres this year to corn, the first time since 1995 that acreage has 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn stockpiles, meantime, have risen 15 percent, to 5.696  
billion bushels. That was more than 100 million bushels above trade 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA also said soybean farmers will plant 73.11 million  
acres, or 1 percent fewer than last year's 73.94 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
	AgResource Co. analyst Dick Loewy said, however, that early  
planting intentions typically are revised upward. He expects final 
soybean plantings to edge closer to 75 million acres by June. 
Barring a weather disaster, that would lead to another record 
harvest at a time when world demand continues to lag far behind 
last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also face heavy pressure from expectations the  
quick pace of South American harvesting will lead to greater export 
competition, virtually shutting out the United States with cheaper 
goods. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Disinfectant Fabric Developed / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Imagine a cotton T-shirt that breaks down  
pesticides into harmless particles immediately on contact or a pair 
of denim jeans that disinfects itself when it touches germs or 
viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not far off, says a University of California, Davis  
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be a breakthrough for people working everywhere  
from farms to hospitals, UC Davis scientist Gang Sun thinks his 
chemically-treated fabrics could change the way people wear their 
work clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's work involves the use of one of the most common  
disinfectants people use in their homes: chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
	His research is based on a chemical called hydantoin, which  
grabs chlorine molecules and holds them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun says the process would graft hydantoin onto cotton fabrics  
and immerse the fabric in chlorine bleach. When the fabric comes in 
contact with certain pesticides, virus or bacteria, the chlorine is 
released, disinfecting the cloth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised how quickly and powerfully it killed the  
germs,'' said Sun, whose research gained attention at a recent 
chemical conference in Southern California. ``The main purpose 
would be for hospitals -- doctors' uniforms, bedding materials -- you 
can even use it in hotels for bed sheets and towels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology also can be used by farm workers who constantly  
come in contact with low levels of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's research showed his treated fabric can break down some  
agricultural pesticides known as carbamates into small, harmless 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
	The breathable cotton clothes would be an improvement over  
impermeable clothing sometimes worn by farm workers who often work 
under the summer's intense sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that it'll replace impermeable clothing  
during heavy spraying, but when the farm worker enters the field 
for harvesting, there's still pesticide residue in the field,'' Sun 
said. ``We can use our regular clothing like T-shirts and jeans and 
we can treat them. The worker will not notice any difference, but 
have additional protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research is still under investigation as Sun continues  
testing his cloth with more pesticides and germs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Halosource Corp. purchased the licensing rights to  
Sun's chemical technology last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Williams, Halosource's chief scientific officer, said that  
although the treatment would make clothes more expensive, they 
would be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also looking at odor control, which comes from bacteria,  
fungus or mildew,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Takes Over Yugoslav Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department and Secret Service agents  
early Wednesday took over Yugoslavia's embassy buildings here, 
evicting the country's remaining diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour after the midnight deadline the United States had given  
Yugoslavia to vacate its embassy and chancery, officers arrived to 
clear and secure both buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Secret Service spokesman John Tomlinson said several people  
still in the buildings left when told to by officers, who met no 
resistance. A group of people were seen leaving the chancery in 
night clothes after the federal officers took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia announced Thursday it was breaking diplomatic  
relations with the United States because of the NATO attack on the 
country. Ties also were broken with Britain, France and Germany 
because of their participation in ``armed aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States closed its embassy in Belgrade last weekend  
and had evacuated remaining diplomats prior to NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	With neighboring streets blocked, officials first took  
possession of the Yugoslav chancery and then the ambassador's 
residence, both located just off Washington's main embassy row on 
Massachusetts Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States will respect and protect the properties  
without prejudice to the eventual settlement of property issues 
among all the successor states to the former Yugoslavia,'' said a 
statement by Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past seven years, the nations of the former Yugoslav  
union -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and today's rump 
Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro -- have been locked 
in a dispute over how to divide the assets left by the Yugoslav 
federation when it dissolved in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia has insisted that it is the sole successor state and has  
refused to turn over diplomatic missions, joint funds, or archives 
it controlled. With Wednesday's takeover, the government of 
Yugoslav will effectively lose control over the two properties in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's Office of Foreign Missions coordinated  
the takeover, which officials said is routine when diplomatic ties 
are broken. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first days of the NATO attack, which began a week ago,  
Yugoslav diplomats tried to maintain a business-as-usual atmosphere 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries without diplomatic relations with the U.S. government  
frequently maintain offices in Washington under the jurisdiction of 
a third country's embassy. Cuba, for instance, operates under the 
umbrella of the Swiss embassy, while the Iraqi interest section is 
part of the Algerian embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Milena Radovic, a spokeswoman for Yugoslavia's mission to the  
United Nations in New York, said Yugoslavia is looking for a 
similar arrangement but has yet to find a country that would host 
its interest section.

<HEADLINE> Passover Holiday Marked Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With a last-minute flurry of cleaning and  
shopping, Israelis prepared today to usher in the holiday of 
Passover, when Jews the world over mark the exodus of the ancient 
Israelites from slavery in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the holiday's start at sundown, outdoor Israeli  
markets were crowded with people buying key ingredients for the 
festive multi-course meal, or seder, during which the story of the 
Israelites' flight from Egypt is ritually recounted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this holiday,'' said Yedid Moshe, 61, buying celery,  
mint and tomatoes at Jerusalem's open-air Mahane Yehuda market, 
whose overflowing stalls of fruit, vegetables and flowers were 
watched by patrolling Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the strictly religious Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim,  
ultra-Orthodox Jews in black coats and hats used blowtorches and 
boiling water Tuesday to sterilize kitchen utensils. 
</P>
<P>
	Housewives hurried to complete exhaustive pre-Passover cleaning,  
which calls for ridding homes of each and every crumb of bread. 
That is in line with the traditional ban on leavened food items 
during the weeklong holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biblical story of the Exodus says the Israelites had to move  
fast and did not have time to let bread dough rise, so they ate 
flat unleavened bread as they fled into the desert. During 
Passover, observant Jews steer clear of any product made with 
yeast, including items like beer and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the majority of Israeli Jews do not follow the strict  
Orthodox way of life, most dive into the Passover cleaning as if 
they did. By tradition, women clean floors, rugs, windows, curtains 
and furniture, while men check the entire house with a lit candle. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before this year's holiday, a government workers' strike  
left garbage piling up on the streets. The strike ended Monday, and 
garbage collectors worked overtime to try to rid the country of the 
piles of trash, lest people inadvertently track bread crumbs back 
into a Passover-ready house. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, sale of products deemed suitable for Passover use has  
expanded into an entire industry. Even specific brands of lipstick, 
toothpicks and soap are designated as Passover-appropriate, though 
rabbis say there is no religious reason for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Conservative Rabbi David Golinkin, wonder whether the  
real significance of the holiday may get lost amid rules and 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do tend to get carried away with the minutiae of  
preparing'' for Passover, Golinkin said. ``It's important to 
remember the meaning behind the ritual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of trying to clean up bread crumbs to a rabbi's  
specifications and change their menus to eliminate what would 
otherwise be ordinary ingredients, many Israeli restaurants simply 
close during Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	Some families take the same route, locking their doors behind  
them and spending Passover at a hotel. Tens of thousands of 
Israelis flock to holiday destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tradition has its perils. Each year, Israeli ambulance services  
are called on to treat hundreds of people who get matza -- the thin 
unleavened wafer eaten instead of bread -- or bones from gefilte 
fish, another Passover favorite, caught in their throats.

<HEADLINE> Hospital, HMO Resolve Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Humana Inc., Florida's largest HMO, and hospital  
chain Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. reached a deal late Wednesday 
to continue providing care to thousands of Floridians. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the two-year contract, which is effective April 1, were  
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.3 million Humana members in Florida were in danger  
of losing coverage for using the 56 Columbia/HCA hospitals in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, disputes between health care providers and  
HMOs have become more frequent in recent years as the companies 
battle over money and control of patient care, leaving patients 
caught in a high-stakes tug-of-war. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, hospitals have given managed care organizations large  
discounts for treating their patients, hoping to recoup the losses 
by treating more patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But with hospital profits falling due to big Medicare cuts this  
year and hospitals increasingly accusing health plans of failing to 
make prompt payments, hospitals are rethinking their HMO strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia, beleaguered by a federal  
billing fraud investigation and sagging profits, says it is taking 
another look at all its HMO contracts in an effort to boost its 
bottom line. For much of the past decade, Columbia would work with 
virtually all HMOs, hoping to build business, but officials say 
that may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is not alone in the review.  
</P>
<P>
	``Each of our hospitals is now weighing every one of these  
contracts,'' said Bill Bell, a vice president with the Florida 
Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, Columbia dominates so many major markets that health  
insurers have little choice but to contract with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Practically speaking, a contract with Columbia is almost a  
requirement,'' in most Florida markets,'' said Ryan Siemers, a 
consultant with William M. Mercer in Tampa. He said Humana risks 
alienating its members by losing the Columbia contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as HMOs have boosted premiums between 5 to 10 percent  
in the past year, hospitals feel they should benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The old contract between Columbia and Humana expired Dec. 31.  
The two sides then agreed to a 90-day grace period, which was set 
to expire March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute wasn't the first time Columbia and Humana have  
battled. Last year, Humana filed for an injunction alleging that 
Columbia has refused hospital care to Humana members at least 27 
times. Columbia denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Columbia's own legal problems continue to mount. This  
week, Columbia said the Securities and Exchange Commission was 
investigating it for insider trading. Columbia officials said it is 
not unusual for the SEC to investigate a company whose stock has 
fallen sharply, as Columbia's did when the billing fraud 
allegations surfaced.

<HEADLINE> Starr Witness Steele Will Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in the Susan McDougal case  
stunned prosecutors by allowing testimony from a Virginia woman who 
says, as Mrs. McDougal does, that she was mistreated by Kenneth 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in its fourth week, the trial took a dramatic turn Tuesday  
when U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. heard testimony from 
Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va. He granted a defense request 
that Ms. Steele be allowed to testify Friday to the jury that will 
decide Mrs. McDougal's guilt or innocence on criminal contempt and 
obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is mammoth,'' said Associate Independent Counsel Mark  
Barrett after rising from his chair to address the judge about the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Barrett said, ``I think we've been on  
the defense since the defense case began, but this is a different 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a witness, Claudia Riley, testified that Jim McDougal was  
anxious to have his ex-wife cooperate with Starr's office in 1996. 
Mrs. Riley also testified that she overheard a Starr prosecutor 
tell Mrs. McDougal he could ``get you out of'' legal problems she 
had in California if she cooperated in the investigation of the 
Clintons. State prosecutors were charging Mrs. McDougal with 
stealing money from the wife of conductor Zubin Mehta and a federal 
grand jury was about to delve into Mrs. McDougal's taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele faces a May 3 trial in Alexandria, Va., charged by  
Starr's office with three counts of obstruction of justice and one 
count of making false statements in the probe involving President 
Clinton and Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer. Mrs. 
Willey alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in 1993. Ms. 
Steele says she was asked by Mrs. Willey to tell a lie that 
supported the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before Howard, Ms. Steele said she gave accurate  
information to the FBI and before the federal grand jury last year 
about Mrs. Willey but nevertheless was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Starr's prosecutors also questioned her brother, one of  
her daughters, her accountant and her neighbors and friends before 
she was indicted. She also suspected Starr's office investigated 
her adoption of her son, now 8, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett and a fellow prosecutor, Julie Myers, argued against Ms.  
Steele's testimony. They contended that it would create ``a 
minitrial'' in the trial against Mrs. McDougal and exceeds the 
court's previous order barring the defense from using evidence from 
other investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	They asked for time to file written arguments, but the judge  
said he had heard enough arguments. They asked for a continuance of 
the trial until Monday so they could get ``up to speed'' on the 
case that Starr's office brought against Ms. Steele. The judge said 
no. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (the defense lawyer) is simply presenting this to the jury  
to show modus operandi,'' Howard told prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Actor Goldwyn Tries Out Directing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Tony Goldwyn, falling in love with the  
screenplay for ``A Walk on the Moon'' was the easy part. Much 
harder was figuring out what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	He's an actor, so was there a meaty part for him? ``I tried hard  
to fit myself in, but I just didn't feel like I could act in it,'' 
says Goldwyn, wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
	What about producing? After all, his pedigree is impressive:  
Tony's grandfather was the mighty Samuel Goldwyn, whose name still 
hangs above the roaring lion at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounded good, except he'd never produced before. And it was soon  
clear he wouldn't do it alone: Dustin Hoffman, also smitten by the 
script, had signaled interest in producing. And who refuses Dustin 
Hoffman? 
</P>
<P>
	That left only ... what? Directing? Trouble was, Goldwyn was a  
novice here, too. Plus, he would be making his feature-film debut 
with a tricky story about a rocky marriage set in the summer of 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to direct,'' says Goldwyn. ``I had no intention  
of directing a film. What I wanted to do was expand my horizons as 
an actor and start to produce material that I was involved with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, alas, he was in love.  
</P>
<P>
	``I found I couldn't give it away to somebody else because I had  
such strong feelings about what needed to happen with the 
material,'' he says. ``So then the natural next step was, I said, 
'Do it yourself.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But how exactly would he go about it? Goldwyn, ever the actor,  
soon hit upon an ingenious tactic: He devised a character in his 
mind of the kind of director for whom he had always wanted to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he simply played him.  
</P>
<P>
	``To approach the same process and environment from a completely  
different way was so much fun,'' he says. ``It's like wearing 
someone else's clothes. I felt like a total impostor. I would even 
forget to say, 'Action!' and 'Cut!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Impostor or not, the gamble seems to have paid off, at least  
judging from the warm response to ``A Walk on the Moon'' at the 
Sundance Film Festival in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwyn was looking for his next acting project when he stumbled  
on Pamela Gray's script, which happened to have won the Samuel 
Goldwyn Screenwriting Award at the University of Southern 
California at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie tells of a married woman who has a very public affair  
with a blouse salesman in the Catskills, the upstate New York 
countryside where large numbers of Jews from the city used to spend 
their summer holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray had spent all her summers in the late 1960s in the  
Catskills, and recalled passing the time with wives whose husbands 
were away at work during the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Goldwyn had grown up in Los Angeles, he would often  
visit his family in New York and was aware of the Catskills 
culture. He was 9 at the time of the rock concert in Woodstock, 
which is in the Catskills area and is the scene of much of the 
action in the movie, which also touches upon the U.S. space 
program, the war in Vietnam and early seeds of the women's 
movement. The title is drawn from Neil Armstrong's moon walk, an 
important event in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	What interested Goldwyn, he says, was the story of someone  
``waking up in the morning, and saying, 'Is my life what I dreamed 
it would be?' and, 'Do I have the right to have that expectation at 
all?''' 
</P>
<P>
	He says he identified with the idea as a man but wanted to  
explore it from a woman's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 39, Goldwyn's career suddenly has a crisp new focus after  
years of quiet success on stage and brief movie appearances in, 
among others, ``Ghost,'' ``The Pelican Brief'' and ``Kiss the 
Girls.'' he played Richard Nixon's brother in Oliver Stone's 
presidential biopic, and astronaut Neil Armstrong in HBO's ``From 
the Earth to the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that I wasn't achieving my potential in the film roles  
I was getting,'' he says. ``So I said, 'Hmmm, I've got to figure 
out a way to make this more fulfilling.' Directing became that 
role. Then it all made sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being an actor himself paid off with his actors, he says. ``We  
had a shorthand. They knew that I'd been through what they were 
going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Too much so, perhaps, jokes Diane Lane, who stars as a  
straight-laced housewife tempted by freedom in the Age of Aquarius. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes he would get so in my face, he would be experiencing  
the emotions himself. I would have to say, 'O.K., this is MY line 
and you stay over THERE!''' Lane says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be trembling with tears in his eyes, he would get all  
caught up in it. I would say, 'Got it! Now put me in front of the 
camera already!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Born into the Goldwyn dynasty, Tony grew up in the posh suburbs  
of Los Angeles, the son of producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and actress 
Jennifer Howard. Grandpa Goldwyn, one of Hollywood's founding 
fathers, was the producer behind such classics as ``Guys and 
Dolls,'' ``The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' and ``Wuthering 
Heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony recalls Saturday afternoons in his boyhood gabbing with his  
grandfather after he had his second stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a guy who had, at 16 years old, made his way from  
Poland to America. He landed on a boat in Canada and literally 
walked to New York City! This was one tough, determined dude,'' 
says Goldwyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sitting in his wheelchair and we were talking. All of a  
sudden, he begins shaking. He's trying to lift himself up and tears 
are streaming out of his eyes. And I go, 'Grandpa, what are you 
doing?' And I start hugging him, to try and calm him down. He was 
so frustrated that he couldn't get out of the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember, as a 10-year-old kid, trying to give this guy  
advice: 'Look at what you've done in your life!' I said to him. 
'It's time to relax! It's time to sit back and smell the 
flowers!''' 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a huge impact on him. He told everybody about it, that  
this little kid made him feel better!'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he decided to be an actor, Tony discovered that  
extending the Goldwyn name into a third generation of Hollywood 
fame wasn't going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting out as an actor, it was horrible -- having a famous  
last name and having a family in the business,'' he says. ``When I 
started applying for work in film and television, it was very, very 
tough, because people tend to write you off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he has kept detractors off-base with his eclectic mix of  
projects, including his latest -- voicing the title role of the 
upcoming animated feature ``Tarzan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with ``A Walk on the Moon,'' he's survived a different type  
of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it,'' he says. ``I felt like I was on a great water  
slide.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reaches Efficiency Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A Boeing Co. efficiency program with a name that  
could cure insomnia has reached another milestone toward proving 
its potency. 
</P>
<P>
	This month 8,000 employees -- chiefly engineers -- were brought  
into a new, streamlined system for designing and building 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	That brings the total to 38,000 workers in eight states, Canada  
and Australia with access to four interconnected computer systems 
that are replacing more than 450 separate and sometimes 
incompatible networks in Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Material from one computer system sometimes had to be printed  
out for reinput into another, and even top managers had access only 
to some of the systems, said Garnet Hizzey, deputy director of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest change should cut the time required for design and  
production of airplane parts by roughly 75 percent, Hizzey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina McHugh, a company spokeswoman, said no jobs are in  
jeopardy from the program: Define and Control Airplane 
Configuration-Manufacturing Resource Management, or DCAC-MRM. 
</P>
<P>
	``These initiatives are for eliminating waste, not people,'' she  
said. ``Hopefully, they'll be effective in reducing costs and make 
our jobs more secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first seven phases of the overhaul, which began in February  
1996, covered production workers who built parts and assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
	This phase covers engineers who design parts. The next phase  
covers engineers who make design drawings for parts in basic 
assemblies and more complex installations, and the last two phases 
are for production workers in Boeing airplane factories in Everett, 
Renton and Long Beach, Calif. Completion is scheduled for the first 
quarter of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent change covers parts as simple as a bracket for  
an overhead panel in a 747 jumbojet, speeding the arrival of the 
product definition and specifications into the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new system, that bracket can now be in the hands of  
assembly crews within 20 days after the need for it is determined, 
compared with 80 days under the old system, Hizzey said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a rush order, it might be five days instead of 20.  
</P>
<P>
	Even parts as basic as brackets frequently are redesigned to  
satisfy airline demands for custom interior cabins, Hizzey 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal of the program is to make information on each  
custom-made part, component and assembly more widely available so 
more can be reused, rather than redesigned each time a request is 
made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We endeavor to use as many common parts as possible,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	With more standardized assembly, Hizzey said, ``we could pump  
out airplanes like beer cans.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Futurama'' may really have a future.  
</P>
<P>
	The new animated comedy from Matt Groening, creator of ``The  
Simpsons,'' scored solid ratings Sunday during an encouraging week 
for new shows. The Fox cartoon set in the year 3000 tied for 11th 
place in the Nielsen Media Research ratings last week -- 
outdistancing even ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week's prime-time competition with a 9.0 rating and  
15 share, tightening its race with CBS for the season's top spot by 
doing well on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, not normally its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with an 8.7 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.0  
rating and 12 share and Fox was at 6.5 and 11. The WB had a 3.0 
rating and 5 share, UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as impressive as ``Futurama,'' two new ABC comedies  
also had strong weeks. ``The Norm Show,'' the new comedy starring 
Norm McDonald, finished in 20th place and ``It's Like, You Know'' 
came in 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most-watched show, as it has been for each  
of the 17 original episodes this year. However, it had the lowest 
rating for an ``ER'' original since 1994, perhaps an indication 
viewers are confused by the midseason reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nickelodeon cable network celebrated a Nielsen milestone --  
with milk and cookies, of course. It was the top-rated cable 
network, on an all-day basis, for the first three months of the 
year, Nielsen said Tuesday. It is Nick's 14th straight quarterly 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Fox News Channel defeated its rival MSNBC in  
the prime-time quarterly ratings. Fox's average prime-time audience 
has increased from 79,000 households in early 1998 to 223,000 
households this year. MSNBC's prime-time average was 201,000 
households. Both news networks trailed CNN, whose ratings were 
slightly down at 747,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC points out that it leads during all-day ratings, and has  
seen more of a boost than Fox over the past week in ratings because 
of the Yugoslavian bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' finished  
in a dead heat in last week's evening news race with 8.2 ratings 
and 17 shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.0 rating and 15 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won for the quarter in nightly news. All three networks had  
lower ratings than last year, however. CBS's slip was the steepest. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 16.2; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.7, ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.9; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 12.1; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Holy Joe,'' CBS, 11.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.3.

<HEADLINE> Minor Rail Disruptions Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Railroad disruptions are inevitable following  
the June 1 split of Conrail, but their impact is likely to be 
minor, the head of one of Conrail's new owners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Snow, chairman and chief executive officer of CSX Corp.,  
said slowdowns will occur in the first several hours of the 
transition as computers are shut down and reprogrammed, forcing a 
temporary shift to manual operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.3 billion takeover of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk  
Southern Corp. has come under scrutiny in light of a major service 
meltdown that followed the 1996 merger of Union Pacific Railroad 
with Southern Pacific Rail Corp. in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow likened the adverse effects from the computer shutdown and  
other, unforeseen problems to those of ``a freak ice storm that 
slows the railroads for a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We work out of those in a few days,'' he told reporters. ``We  
just don't see anything that is going to create a ... replay of the 
Western sorts of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Union Pacific gridlock lasted several months and caused  
major delivery delays. It spawned several lawsuits by shippers and 
a drive in Congress to give federal regulators more oversight over 
the rail industry, something rail companies believe would hinder 
their ability to invest and grow. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Conrail takeover date approaches, rail executives are  
seeking to play down the significance of any problems by suggesting 
that disruptions are inevitable. At the same time, they seek to 
bolster confidence among shippers by stressing lessons learned from 
the Union Pacific disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX will keep most of the Conrail management teams in place and  
will test its computer networks to make sure the computers from the 
various railroads can to talk to one another after the split, Snow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company also has increased its workforce and  
locomotive holdings to limit the impact of any problems. That, he 
said, came at considerable expense to the company, whose earnings 
and incomes dropped in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect things will go bump in the night, so we have  
contingencies ... and more assets and people than you really 
need,'' he said. ``Will there be some difficulties? Yes. You have 
to anticipate some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved by the federal Surface Transportation Board  
last summer, is the most complex and most extensive rail 
transaction in U.S. history, covering nearly 45,000 miles of tracks 
among the three railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Although each company is spending $1 million a day on interest  
payments, executives have proceeded cautiously toward reaping the 
benefits of the deal in order to avoid repeating the Union Pacific 
mishaps. The companies could have implemented the deal as early as 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail, there's no doubt about the fact that we will set  
railroading back a long way and will invite enormous government 
attention,'' Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when 
Philadelphia-based Conrail began operating as a monopoly that 
Congress created out of six bankrupt railroads. CSX operates out of 
Richmond, Va., and Norfolk Southern is based in Norfolk, Va.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Civil Trial To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A waitress, a machinist, a retiree and a  
decorator are among the jury members chosen to hear a $50 million 
lawsuit filed against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' over a guest's 
shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by the family of Scott Amedure, 32. He was  
killed three days after after taping a 1995 episode of the show in 
which he revealed he had a crush on a heterosexual friend, Jonathan 
Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of second-degree murder in 1996, but  
the conviction was overturned last fall due to an error in jury 
selection. His retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends the show's producers lied to Schmitz  
about the gender of his admirer, disregarded warnings about the 
dangers of surprising guests and had no concern about Schmitz's 
mental state. The suit names the show, distributor Warner Bros. and 
producer Telepictures Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Warner Bros. have said they will present testimony  
to show Schmitz was never lied to and repeatedly was told his 
secret admirer might be a man or woman. Lawyers have indicated they 
also will argue that the show's responsibility ended when the two 
men walked out of the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is listed as a witness in the case, and defense attorney  
Jim Feeney said it was likely she would testify early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine jury members were selected Tuesday. Six will consider a  
verdict and the other three will be designated alternates at the 
end of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Bayer Boosts Investment in U.S. R&AMP;D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bayer Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of  
Germany-based Bayer Group, said Wednesday it would add $6 billion 
through 2004 to research and development and capital spending for 
its U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional investment would bring to $15 billion the total  
the company is investing in developing U.S. businesses since 
announcing a $9 billion investment in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending is part of a major effort to increasing Bayer's  
share of the North American consumer market, said Helge H. 
Wehmeier, president and chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based 
Bayer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer believes it can grab more of the U.S. market for consumer  
drugs, medical diagnostic equipment and chemicals, but that it is 
not likely to grow much in Europe, Wehmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that raw materials and energy cost less in the United  
States. Low inflation, exporting ease and access to top-shelf 
biotech research talent also influenced the added U.S. investment, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost in U.S. investment does not immediately translate into  
new jobs for Bayer Corp., which employs 23,400 people at 50 
manufacturing and research sites in the United States, Wehmeier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wehmeier said the company's marketing plan emphasizes the  
effects on people rather than the ingredients, hoping consumers 
will care more about what a compound will do for them than what it 
is made of. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bayer said in 1995 it would invest $9 billion on growing  
its U.S. businesses through 2000, the company has spent $5.7 
billion, leaving more than $9 billion left to spend through 2004 
with the new investment announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that $9 billion, Bayer intends to spend $5.1 billion in the  
next five years in research and development on its life sciences 
businesses -- consumer care, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics -- and $3 
billion on capital investments.

<HEADLINE>  NYC Cops Charged in Shooting Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou  
Diallo left the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they  
marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers 
pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the 
Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty  
colleagues, most of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo  
stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were 
fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert 
Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case -- a searing mix of racial politics and alleged  
depravity -- has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes 
and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President 
Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police 
misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in  
demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of 
the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- 
also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian 
immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding 
minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother,  
Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense  
relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him 
of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in  
the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now 
operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has 
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently 
believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges 
were read. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one  
count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in 
prison on the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The 
officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been 
on desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count  
``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court,  
offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went 
wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their  
clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon 
reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,''  
Brounstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for  
choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week 
to indict them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're  
police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to  
a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the  
shooting, praised the grand jury's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen  
have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would 
only say, ``I'm very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been  
ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at 
the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD 
critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

<HEADLINE> Your Ad on Mark McGwire's Sleeve? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking a new way to increase revenue, major  
league baseball is considering selling advertisements on the 
sleeves of uniforms, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative plan, teams would sell 1- to 1 1/2-inch patches  
of ads as a way to increase revenue to offset rising player 
salaries, according to the March 29 edition of Sports Business 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times today quoted an unidentified sporting goods  
executive as saying that local corporations would buy the ads, with 
the teams possibly sharing revenue over a specified minimum with 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco, alcohol and media companies would not be allowed to buy  
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball currently allows only the uniform maker's logo on the  
sleeves of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue being considered here goes beyond the scope of a  
uniform manufacturer's logo,'' a team official who asked not to be 
identified told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Smith, the vice president of licensing for Major League  
Baseball Properties, would not comment on the proposed plan, but 
told the Times: ``We're talking from A to Z about our on-field 
programs, and bringing in additional sponsors in other formats than 
we have now. But we're not close to anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, teams have placed ads on outfield walls and in  
revolving signs behind home plate. Baseball would not be the first 
to have ads on apparel. NASCAR drivers' jumpsuits are plastered 
with sponsors' ads, and golfers and tennis players also wear logos 
on their caps and T-shirts.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi to cut 14,500 jobs worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Electric Corp., the latest victim of  
Japan's prolonged recession, plans to cut 10 percent of its global 
workforce in an effort to erase growing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi, one of Japan's biggest electronics makers, said  
Wednesday it will eliminate 14,500 jobs over the next three years, 
in addition to planned cuts of 2,600 people this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will trim 8,400 jobs in Japan by the end of March  
2002 and cut 6,100 jobs at overseas subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi, which makes everything from semiconductors to  
nuclear power plants, currently employs 146,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was the latest in a series of cutbacks for corporate  
Japan as companies struggle through the country's deepest-ever 
postwar recession and the region's economic crisis. Job cuts of 
similar magnitude were also recently announced by NEC Corp. and 
Sony Corp. -- two more of Japan's electronics behemoths. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi said the plan, unveiled on the last day of Japan's  
fiscal year, would help it cut costs and improve profits over the 
next three years. Shares of Mitsubishi Electric rose 7.6 percent on 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company suffered a huge loss last year, and expects to lose  
money again in the fiscal year which ended on Wednesday, thanks to 
weak semiconductor earnings and falling sales of consumer products 
such as refrigerators and televisions in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The company forecast a group pretax loss of 80 billion yen, or  
$667 million, in fiscal 1998. Mitsubishi hopes the cost-cutting 
measures will help it boost its group pretax profit to 120 billion 
yen, or $1 billion, by March 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1997, Mitsubishi posted a net group loss of $883  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's unemployment rate has risen to a record-high 4.6 percent  
as the economic slump lingers. But layoffs are still rare at top 
firms like Mitsubishi, where employees are hired with an implicit 
guarantee of a job for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi said the job cuts will come mostly through ``large  
reductions'' in new hiring and transferring employees to related 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi also said Wednesday it will attempt to cut costs by  
trimming capital spending by 20 percent and 
research-and-development expenditures by 10 percent for fiscal 
1999. It will also cut nine positions from its 33-member board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi will also reduce the number of domestic subsidiaries  
to 140 from 180.

<HEADLINE>  NYC Cops Charged in Shooting Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou  
Diallo left the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they  
marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers 
pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the 
Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty  
colleagues, most of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo  
stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were 
fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert 
Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case -- a searing mix of racial politics and alleged  
depravity -- has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes 
and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President 
Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police 
misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in  
demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of 
the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- 
also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian 
immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding 
minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother,  
Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense  
relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him 
of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in  
the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now 
operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has 
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently 
believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges 
were read. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one  
count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in 
prison on the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The 
officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been 
on desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count  
``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court,  
offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went 
wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their  
clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon 
reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,''  
Brounstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for  
choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week 
to indict them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're  
police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to  
a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the  
shooting, praised the grand jury's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen  
have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would 
only say, ``I'm very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been  
ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at 
the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD 
critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

<HEADLINE> GM Makes 1-Million-Vehicle Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling about 1  
million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles to change the 
brake light wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Tuesday by the company covers all full-size  
Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks and full-size sport utility 
vehicles from the 1994 model year, including the Chevrolet C-K 
pickup truck, the Suburban and Blazer SUVs, GMC Sierra pickup truck 
and Suburban and Yukon SUVs, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is recalling some chassis cabs based on the  
full-size pickup platform. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are being recalled because wiring was reversed on  
the brake switch from what was specified on a brake switch design 
drawing, according to GM and a federal safety agency that oversees 
recalls, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	With the reversed wiring, the brake switch will work but could  
wear out prematurely, resulting in loss of brake lights, NHTSA and 
GM officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the vehicles will be notified next month to bring them  
in to have the wiring repaired and the brake switch replaced at no 
cost to customers, GM said.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Denies Victim Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, N.C. (AP) -- By any measure, Sylvia Cassidy was a  
victim, shot in the head by the man she lived with because she 
wouldn't tag along to the local mall. 
</P>
<P>
	But her family has been denied victim's compensation for funeral  
expenses because the 24-year-old woman, in death, is considered a 
lawbreaker. By living with her killer, she violated a 194-year-old 
statute against cohabitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a victim from top to bottom, and now the state comes  
along and says she was a criminal,'' says her mother, Diana 
Zambory. She is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Victims Compensation Fund Commission has no choice,  
says director Gary Eichelberger. North Carolina law requires a 
claim be rejected if the victim was participating in a felony or 
nontraffic misdemeanor, even ``fishing without a license,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wrestle with this every time we get a claim like this,  
especially when the victim is otherwise innocent,'' Eichelberger 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	All states offer some form of victims' compensation for medical  
bills, lost work, funeral expenses or other financial losses. Most 
bar payments if criminal activity by the victims contributed to 
their injuries or deaths. At least two, Ohio and Arkansas, deny 
claims if victims committed crimes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 50-state survey by The Associated Press found North  
Carolina the only state with laws banning adultery, fornication or 
cohabitation to cite those crimes as reasons to withhold 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina toughened its compensation law in 1994 after a  
judge ruled that a man who was shot and paralyzed while committing 
a robbery was entitled to victim's benefits upon parole. Through 
June 30, 1998, the state commission has denied 47 claims on the 
basis of cohabitation alone, Eichelberger says. 
</P>
<P>
	One came from a Greenville woman and her fiance, who were  
attacked and beaten while walking their dog one night in February 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem I see with this victim is that she was living  
with her fiance and they were not married,'' an investigator wrote 
Jan. 20. ``They still live together and are not married. I 
recommend denial -- criminal activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another dealt with a man shot 14 times and killed by his  
girlfriend. ``Although an unfortunate situation,'' an investigator 
wrote in December 1997, ``because victim and suspect were live-in 
girlfriend and boyfriend, recommendation is to deny for criminal 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 47 cases denied are a small portion of all cases considered.  
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, for example, the commission distributed 
almost $3.7 million among 914 cases and denied 771. 
</P>
<P>
	But they stand out because they seem so unfair, says Joe  
Stewart, spokesman for the state agency that oversees the victims 
commission. Furthermore, he says, 39 of the rejected cases involved 
domestic violence victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the most vulnerable -- physically, psychologically and  
economically -- are denied their claim because of this quirk in the 
law that we are seeking to change,'' Stewart says. The Legislature 
is considering a measure to allow more leeway in considering claims 
from victims who have committed misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation rules on crimes are not intended to judge morality  
but to protect boards from compensating real criminals, says David 
Beatty of the National Center for Victims of Crime in Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``If two guys are involved in a shootout over a drug deal gone  
bad,'' Beatty says, ``the one with the poorer shot shouldn't be 
rewarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio has one of the nation's toughest laws. It denies  
compensation if crime victims committed a felony within the prior 
10 years, even if the felony has no connection to their injury. One 
claim involving a violent crime was denied because the victim had 
written bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Arkansas rejects claims if victims were previously  
convicted of crimes in which they injured another person. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states, however, consider claims on a case-by-case basis.  
And even those that outlaw adultery, fornication or cohabitation 
say those crimes would not affect decisions on victims' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``A woman committing adultery should not expect to be beaten  
up,'' says Everett Mayhew Jr. of the New York State Crime Victims 
Board. ``It has to be conduct that contributes to the injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promiscuous behavior ``is not a standard that the state of  
Wisconsin has attempted to impose on crime victims,'' says James 
Haney of the state Justice Department. ``They have a tough enough 
road as it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adultery is a crime, but ``having a relationship with someone  
other than a spouse would not be an automatic disqualifier,'' Haney 
says. ``People may not approve of the fact that she is having that 
relationship, but that does not make her any less the victim of a 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's cohabitation law is rarely enforced, and Sylvia  
Cassidy's living arrangement with Marcquan McMillian provoked no 
official concern until Mrs. Zambory filed for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy's cremation and flowers cost $1,750. Her mother seeks an  
additional $2,000 to clear private land and get it properly deeded 
to allow burial of the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledges her daughter had a messy personal life.  
</P>
<P>
	By age 21, Cassidy had three sons with a man she never married.  
She gave the father custody of the two older boys when she married 
a second man. In late 1997, she angered her husband by telling 
police he was breaking into houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after, McMillian showed up at her rented trailer.  
</P>
<P>
	A friend of her husband and the brother of an old boyfriend,  
McMillian offered to protect her from her husband, who was 
threatening to kill her and her youngest son, according to Mrs. 
Zambory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy let him move in because ``Marcquan was the only one (her  
husband) was scared of,'' Mrs. Zambory says. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian moved in Dec. 3, 1997, and promptly invited others,  
including a brother, the brother's girlfriend and at least one 
other woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Their relationship was stormy from the beginning. The sheriff  
reported several occasions in which the two were ``involved in some 
serious domestic differences.'' At McMillian's trial, one of 
Cassidy's sons and a former girlfriend of the defendant testified 
they had seen McMillian point a gun at Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 28, 1998, Cassidy and McMillian were arguing about going  
to the mall. A friend tried to persuade Cassidy to leave with him. 
She declined, saying she was moving to her mother's home and had 
already packed two bags. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian shot Cassidy over her right eye from two feet away. He  
was convicted March 6 of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 
five to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Zambory wears two small charms her daughter had locked away  
from McMillian and his associates -- a tiny cow and a Dallas Cowboys 
helmet. She has little else. She keeps her daughter's ashes in a 
metal box atop a stereo stand, watched over by a wax angel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I asked for was enough to bury her, $2,000 to  
get a place cleared,'' Mrs. Zambory says. ``That's all we need. I 
didn't think it was a very big thing.''

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi To Cut 14,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. plans to reduce  
its work force by 14,500, or about 10 percent, over the next three 
years to improve its group profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi had already planned to decrease its workforce by  
2,600 people this year. It will slash 8,400 jobs in Japan by the 
end of March 2002 and cut 6,100 jobs at overseas subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, one of Japan's largest consolidated electronics  
manufacturers, makes everything from semiconductors to nuclear 
power plants. Mitsubishi currently employs 146,000 people 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement today came on the last day of the fiscal year  
and is the latest in a series of similar reform plans that are part 
of corporate Japan's efforts to ride out the worst economic slump 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics giants NEC Corp. and Sony Corp. recently announced  
job cuts on a similar scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Electric has been struggling with huge losses due to  
falling semiconductor prices and weak demand for consumer products 
like refrigerators in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects a group pretax loss of 80 billion yen, or  
$667 million, for the fiscal year which closed on Wednesday. The 
company hopes the cost-cutting measures will help it boost its 
group pretax profit to 120 billion yen, of $1 billion, by March 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs have become more common in Japan due to the long  
economic slump but are still rare at top firms like Mitsubishi, 
where employees are hired with an implicit guarantee of a job for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi said the job cuts at its parent company in Japan will  
come mostly through ``large reductions'' in new hiring rather than 
layoffs. The Mitsubishi Electric parent company in Japan employs 
46,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it will cut nine positions from its  
33-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fiscal year beginning Thursday, Mitsubishi Electric will  
cut capital spending by 20 percent and research and development 
expenditures by 10 percent, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi will also reduce the number of domestic subsidiaries  
to 140 from 180.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Sobbing and pleading for mercy, the Rev.  
Henry Lyons was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison Wednesday for 
swindling more than $4 million while president of one of the 
nation's largest and most influential black denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old minister was also ordered to repay almost $2.5  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot shake the feeling that I have let so many people  
down,'' Lyons told Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer. ``I've asked God 
every single night and day to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted Feb. 27 of bilking companies wanting to sell  
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to 
members of the National Baptist Convention USA. He was also found 
guilty of stealing money donated to rebuild burned Southern black 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, convention publicist Bernice  
Edwards, were accused of spending the money on luxury homes, cars, 
jewelry and travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered him to prison immediately, rather than  
allowing him to remain free until his sentencing in federal court 
in June on related charges of fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury has said you're a racketeer and they said you're a  
thief,'' Ms. Schaeffer said. ``It's time to pay the piper, Dr. 
Lyons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons could have gotten up to eight years in prison under state  
sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	A weeping Lyons apologized particularly for the theft of almost  
$250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money 
intended to rebuild burned churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stinks in God's nostrils and I know it stinks in the law's  
nostrils and it stinks to me,'' he said. ``I ask the court and I 
ask America and I ask black people to forgive me because I believe 
that it will haunt me the rest of my life. I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask for mercy,'' Lyons said, breaking into sobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those who spoke on Lyons' behalf was his wife, Deborah.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love my husband very much. We have been through some rough  
times together,'' she told the judge. ``If you can find it in your 
heart, look not at Dr. Lyons in the last three or four years but 
look at the good he brings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' troubles began in 1997 when his wife set fire to a  
$700,000 waterfront home he owned with Ms. Edwards. The fire led to 
closer scrutiny of Lyons' lavish spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, pastor of a St. Petersburg church, served as president of  
the National Baptist Convention from 1994 until he tearfully 
resigned that post on March 16, a few weeks after he was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he avoided a second trial by pleading guilty in  
federal court to evading taxes, engaging in fraudulent activities 
and lying to officials -- charges that also grew out of convention 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards went on trial with Lyons but was acquitted. However,  
she pleaded guilty in federal court to tax evasion and is awaiting 
sentencing Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' sentencing in federal court is set for June 18. His  
lawyers said that under sentencing guidelines, he will probably 
serve a little more than 7 years at the most.

<HEADLINE> Canada Cuts Key Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's central bank lowered its key interest  
rate by a quarter percentage point today, to 5 percent, citing low 
inflation in Canada and calmer financial markets. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Media Faces Criticism From Its Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ask journalists about their profession and  
they will tell you bad news: Reporting has gotten sloppier, facts 
too often are blurred by opinion and efforts to inform and 
entertain has led to a kind of ``infotainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Center for the People and the Press turned the tables on  
the media, surveying 552 national and local journalists and news 
executives in print, television, radio and the Internet about the 
state of American journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	In results released Tuesday, a rising number of journalists  
agree with public opinion polls that say the media lack 
credibility. They also say reporters drive controversies with their 
coverage of personal and ethical behaviors of public figures 
</P>
<P>
	``The major reason for public disaffection with journalism is  
the decline in the quality of journalism and the public's lack of 
confidence in the work that journalists do, now that it's become so 
loaded with infotainment and celebrity information,'' said Bill 
Kovach, a 30-year newspaperman who is curator of the Nieman 
Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University and chairman of the 
Committee of Concerned Journalists, which co-sponsored the Pew 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey was conducted between Nov. 20, 1998, and  
Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to cite top problems facing journalism, half the  
national news professionals mentioned such things as 
sensationalism, a lack of objectivity and inaccurate reporting. 
About 40 percent cited too much emphasis on the bottom line, 
competition and declining audience and readership. 
</P>
<P>
	The news media's loss of credibility with the public was cited  
by about one-third of the respondents. But while it ranked third -- 
behind quality and standards and business pressures -- concern about 
credibility has nearly doubled during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roughly one in three members of the national and local media  
now say that a decline in public trust, confidence and credibility 
is the most important problem facing journalism,'' the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is up from 17 percent of respondents who cited credibility  
as the most important problem facing journalism in a similar Pew 
survey of journalists in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that journalists acknowledge a problem and  
are motivated to do something about it. It's definitely time to 
move past defensiveness and rationalization,'' says Diane McFarlin, 
executive editor of the Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune and chairman 
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors' ethics and values 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's credibility project has identified key problems,  
including accuracy, bias, sensationalism and a disconnect with 
readers, and is testing ways to regain the public's trust at eight 
newspapers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight test-site newspapers are: The Philadelphia Inquirer;  
The Oregonian, Portland; the Austin American-Statesman, in Texas; 
the San Jose Mercury News, in California; the Sarasota 
Herald-Tribune, in Florida; The Gazette, Colorado Springs, Colo.; 
the Daily Press, Newport News, Va.; and Florida Today, Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew survey conducted in June 1998 showed that Americans' views  
about press credibility have declined since the mid-1980s. 
According to the survey, network news believability fell an average 
of 11 percentage points; local television news dropped 12 points; 
and daily newspapers tumbled 17 points since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other survey findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--69 percent of national news professionals said the distinction  
between reporting and commentary had seriously eroded -- up from 53 
percent in a similar Pew survey of journalists in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--40 percent said news reports are increasingly full of factual  
errors and sloppy reporting -- up from 30 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--49 percent of the national news media professionals say the  
press drives controversies with its coverage of the personal and 
ethical behaviors of public figures -- up from 41 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two-thirds of those in national, local and Internet news say  
attempts to attract readers or viewers push the industry too far in 
the direction of infotainment.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Takes Over Yugoslav Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav diplomats were escorted from their  
embassy Wednesday as the U.S. government took over the building in 
another blow to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to fulfill its obligations ... to protect diplomatic  
properties of states with which relations are broken, the U.S. 
government took formal custody of the former Yugoslav chancery and 
ambassador's residence,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour after the midnight deadline the United States had given  
Yugoslavia to vacate the premise, State Department and Secret 
Service agents arrived to clear and secure the two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Yugoslavia's U.N. representative Vladislav  
Jovanovic said State Department officials came to the door of the 
embassy and asked for the key, ``and of course the key was given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia announced March 25 it had severed diplomatic  
relations with the United States, Britain, France and Germany 
because of the NATO attack on the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Although America no longer has formal ties with Belgrade,  
Yugoslavia's pro-Western state of Montenegro retains a trade office 
in Washington. It is working to secure humanitarian assistance for 
the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees pouring into 
Montenegro from Serbia's neighboring province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States will respect and protect the properties  
without prejudice to the eventual settlement of property issues 
among all the successor states to the former Yugoslavia,'' said Lee 
McClenny, a State Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past seven years, the five nations of the former  
Yugoslav union have been locked in a dispute over how to divide the 
assets left by the federation that dissolved in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia, which dominates the current Yugoslavia, insists it is  
the sole successor state and has refused to turn over diplomatic 
missions and hundreds of millions of dollars in joint funds. 
</P>
<P>
	With Wednesday's takeover, the government of Yugoslav  
effectively lost control over the two properties in Washington, 
whose fate will be decided by a future claims settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the buildings -- both located just off Washington's  
main embassy row on Massachusetts Avenue -- unofficially has been 
estimated at between $4 million and $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovic said his government asked China to represent its  
interests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``China accepted and officially informed the State Department  
about its acceptance to represent and defend our interests in the 
United States,'' he said. ``But the host country should give its 
consent. Without that, you cannot proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden is the ``protecting power'' over the vast U.S. embassy  
complex in Belgrade. It was emptied last week when remaining U.S. 
diplomats were evacuated prior to NATO airstrikes. Serb protesters 
have thrashed the embassy's facade, but the building has not been 
taken over by the Yugoslavs.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Ready To Pitch for Phils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Curt Schilling made his last spring  
training start on Wednesday. Yes, he was still pitching for the 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprise, surprise, the reigning NL strikeout leader hasn't been  
traded yet. And despite his occasional proclamations that he'd like 
to play for a winner, the 32-year-old right-hander says he's more 
optimistic about the season than he's been in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to score more runs. I don't think there's any  
question about that,'' said Schilling, who struck out seven in six 
innings and got plenty of run support in a 10-4 victory over the 
Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be a good defensive club. I think the same  
question since '93 is going to be the same one this year: How good 
is our starting pitching going to be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every fifth day, it should be marvelous. But behind Schilling,  
the Phillies are counting on four relatively unproven starters to 
bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea, who never stayed in the majors for a full season  
before the Indians traded him, is the No. 2 starter. Carlton 
Loewer, Paul Byrd and Paul Spoljaric finish out the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, coming off consecutive seasons with 300 or more  
strikeouts, frequently is the subject of trade rumors -- especially 
involving the Indians. He refuses to set any goals for this season 
besides winning 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Come July, Schilling hopes the Phillies are one player away from  
contending for the playoffs -- not on the verge of finally caving in 
to all the trade demands for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of clubs are a trade away or an injury away from  
being good or bad,'' said Schilling, who walked one and allowed 
three runs and seven hits, including a solo homer by Greg Vaughn. 
``We'll just try to compete, win more than we lose and get better 
as the season goes. Who knows? Maybe in July, something happens and 
we go out and get a player who puts us in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who threw 108 pitches, is scheduled to start opening  
day in Atlanta against defending NL Cy Young award winner Tom 
Glavine. Manager Terry Francona said Schilling looks ready to throw 
about 120 pitches in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very, very strong,'' Phillies manager Terry  
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed four straight hits in the first inning after striking  
out leadoff batter Mike Cameron. Barry Larkin's double was followed 
by singles from Sean Casey, Vaughn and Dmitri Young. Schilling was 
ahead in the count or even on each batter. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits by Casey and Young each drove in a run, and Schilling  
got out of the inning on Brian Johnson's double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd venture to guess that on all seven of my hits I was ahead  
with one strike or ahead with two,'' Schilling said. ``... What 
irked me was, I was getting ahead in the count, I thought I was 
making good pitches and I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out the side and walked one in the fourth and  
got out of a first-and-third, one-out jam in the fifth. Vaughn 
flied to the wall in center, and Young struck out looking. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out swinging at a curveball from Brett Tomko in  
the fifth, taking exception to Tomko's pitch selection. Schilling 
glared at Tomko as the two walked back to the dugout, but didn't 
get to face him. Schilling retired the side in order in the sixth, 
blowing away Pokey Reese for his seventh strikeout with Tomko 
waiting on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I was laughing,'' Schilling said. ``Did you see the  
swing? You can hurt yourself swinging like that. Every time I think 
I'm an athlete, I change my mind when I take a swing like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK, Curt. It's usually the other way around.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Upset in Calif. State Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A teacher was poised Wednesday to become  
the first Green Party member to win state office after she shocked 
a Democratic political veteran who outspent her 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	With almost all the votes counted, Audie Elizabeth Bock -- whose  
last bid for office was a run for high school class secretary -- 
appeared to have beaten former Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris in a 
special election for the California Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock held a whisper-thin margin of about 300 votes in the runoff  
election held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a message from the voters to the Democratic Party  
machine that they aren't happy with what they've been offered,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials said the vote would not be official until as  
late as Thursday, after 600 provisional and absentee ballots are 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who was mayor for eight years and before that had served  
12 years in the Legislature, blamed his apparent loss on low 
turnout. Only about 29,000 voters cast ballots -- 15 percent of the 
registered 190,000 voters in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock, 53, teaches at a community college and runs a small  
foreign language film distribution business from her home in 
Piedmont, a small city next to Oakland. She campaigned on a promise 
of more school funding, universal health care and closing corporate 
tax loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her party is similar in philosophy to Green parties in various  
European countries, sharing goals such as feminism, decentralized 
authority, nonviolence and environmental consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to seen a lot more Greens running for  
office in the year 2000,'' said Nancy Marmol, spokeswoman for the 
Green Party of California. She said Greens have won city and county 
offices in various states, mostly in nonpartisan races, but have 
never captured state office. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Stoper, a political science professor at California State  
University, Hayward, said the election surprise had more to do with 
the low turnout -- and Bock's high-energy, grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that this indicates that the political winds are  
blowing in a different direction,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Baseball Mulls Uniform Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking a new way to increase revenue, major  
league baseball is considering selling advertisements on the 
sleeves of uniforms, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative plan, teams would sell small patches of ads  
to local corporations and then possibly share revenue over a 
specified minimum with other clubs, the New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco, alcohol and broadcast companies would not be allowed to  
buy ads, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball currently allows only the uniform maker's logo on the  
sleeves of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue being considered here goes beyond the scope of a  
uniform manufacturer's logo,'' said a team official who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Smith, the vice president of licensing for Major League  
Baseball Properties, would not comment on the proposed plan, but 
did say: ``We're talking from A to Z about our on-field programs, 
and bringing in additional sponsors in other formats than we have 
now. But we're not close to anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, teams have placed ads on outfield walls and in  
revolving signs behind home plate. Baseball would not be the first 
to have ads on apparel. NASCAR drivers' jumpsuits are plastered 
with sponsors' ads, and golfers and tennis players are also seen 
with logos on their caps and t-shirts.

<HEADLINE>  E. Carolina Hires Herrion As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- East Carolina hired Bill Herrion, coach  
at Drexel for eight seasons, as men's basketball coach on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion, 41, succeeds Joe Dooley, who had the final year of his  
contract bought out after four seasons and a 57-52 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely excited to have a coach with the credentials  
of Bill Herrion. His record at Drexel speaks for itself,'' East 
Carolina athletic director Mike Hamrick said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion had a 167-71 career record at Drexel, guiding the  
Dragons to six 20-win seasons, three regular-season America East 
Conference titles nd three NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Herrion will be remembered as an outstanding coach and  
someone who represented college basketball and Drexel University 
with dignity and class,'' Drexel athletics director Eric Zillmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion landed a two-year contract extension from Drexel in 1997  
after turning down the coaching job at Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recommended last season for the vacant job at St. John's  
by Mike Jarvis, who wound up with the Red Storm job himself. 
Herrion was Jarvis' assistant at Boston University and at George 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Unleashes New Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball, still trying to claw back  
to the average attendance levels of the strike-shortened 1994 
season, has cast well-known players writing, phoning or faxing 
diehard baseball fans in a new advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's marketers are hoping to get more of you out to the  
ballgame as well as boost viewership on TV when you can't make it 
to the park. 
</P>
<P>
	They feel the new campaign dubbed ``Fan Mail'' will remind fans  
of the underlying appeal of the game and its often quirky customs 
while forging deeper ties between fans and modern players. 
</P>
<P>
	In one commercial, a chubby fan named Rich is amused to find San  
Diego superstar Tony Gwynn has written to thank him for coming to 
all those games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gwynn notes in the letter that he and the other players  
``noticed you had a tough time remembering the words to the 
National Anthem'' and sent along a copy of the lyrics to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are designed to extend the momentum generated last  
season in one of the game's most exciting years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa each surpassed Roger Maris' home run  
record of 61 home runs in a season, David Wells pitched a perfect 
game for the eventual World Series champions, the New York Yankees, 
and Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. decided to end his record for most 
consecutive games played. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads start running on Sunday's telecast on ESPN of the season  
opener between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres from 
Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra is featured in one ad  
that has him leaving a message on the answering machine of a fan 
named Keith to thank him for putting on his rally cap -- a regular 
baseball cap turned inside out and worn backwards -- at a critical 
moment on that afternoon's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad shows Keith leading the cheers in his section of the  
stands and Garciaparra connecting at the plate to delight the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the way, can you make any away games,'' the player asks.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad agency, Vigilante of New York, a unit of Chicago-based  
Leo Burnett, has also created three more ads that individual teams 
can tailor to feature their own players in local markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, a player sends an E-mail to young Pete to thank him  
for sticking up for the player when a bigger kid was heckling him 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad shows a player sending a fax to a fan named Mike who  
is nursing a sore elbow injured when he scrambled to catch a ball 
hit into the stands. ``Sweet catch at the game today,'' the player 
wrote. ``Just make sure you take care of that elbow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third ad for local use has a player who hit a home run  
calling a fan to apologize that the ball broke the fan's rear 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign hopes to build on last year's resurgence of  
interest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance rose 10 percent to a record of more than 70 million  
people, helped by the addition of new teams in Tampa Bay and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Average attendance per game also rose 3.8 percent to 29,376, but  
that was still 7 percent below the 31,612 average in 1994 when the 
season was ended by a labor dispute in August and the World Series 
was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance tumbled to an average of 25,260 in the 1995 season  
once the labor dispute was settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional ads have been prepared by Waylon Ad Inc. of St. Louis  
featuring Ripken, Mo Vaughn of the Anaheim Angels and a rotating 
group of seven other players to promote baseball's affiliation with 
the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Francis, the top marketing executive for major league  
baseball, said the ideas for the ``Fan Mail'' ads were chosen to 
strike a chord with both serious and casual fans of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players notice more than we realize,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline Parks, baseball's director of advertising, said the  
ads also help showcase the personality of the players. ``People 
want to get to know the players more,'' she said. 
</P>

	The ads will run on the TV networks that carry baseball games --  
Fox, NBC, ESPN, Fox Sports Net, FX and TBS as well as on local 
outlets of the teams' choosing. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said the campaign will be worth $25 million, more than  
twice as large as last year's baseball ad spending.

<HEADLINE>  E. Carolina Hires Herrion As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- East Carolina hired Bill Herrion, coach  
at Drexel for eight seasons, as men's basketball coach on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion, 41, succeeds Joe Dooley, who had the final year of his  
contract bought out after four seasons and a 57-52 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely excited to have a coach with the credentials  
of Bill Herrion. His record at Drexel speaks for itself,'' East 
Carolina athletic director Mike Hamrick said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion had a 167-71 career record at Drexel, guiding the  
Dragons to six 20-win seasons, three regular-season America East 
Conference titles nd three NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Herrion will be remembered as an outstanding coach and  
someone who represented college basketball and Drexel University 
with dignity and class,'' Drexel athletics director Eric Zillmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion landed a two-year contract extension from Drexel in 1997  
after turning down the coaching job at Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recommended last season for the vacant job at St. John's  
by Mike Jarvis, who wound up with the Red Storm job himself. 
Herrion was Jarvis' assistant at Boston University and at George 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Against Michelin Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A $30 million verdict against  
Michelin Tire Co. for a truck driver who lost his legs in a crash 
has been thrown out by an appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelin should have been able to remove a woman from the jury  
pool whose daughter had been involved in a Michelin tire blowout 
similar to the one suffered by Julian Lovett, the 4th District 
Court of Appeals said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ordered a new trial.  
</P>
<P>
	Lovett was hauling 21 tons of fertilizer when his left front  
tire blew in 1989. The 18-wheel truck swerved into a ditch and the 
trailer tore the cab in half. Rescuers dragged Lovett from the 
burning wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	His legs were amputated above the knees.  
</P>
<P>
	Lovett sued Michelin, the world's largest tire maker, saying the  
tire's flawed design allowed water to creep into the rubber, eating 
it away. 
</P>
<P>
	During jury selection, prospective juror Shirley Meeks mentioned  
her daughter's Michelin tire had blown out as she drove on a 
highway because of a flaw in the tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Michelin wanted Ms. Meeks dismissed based on how  
she was affected by her daughter's close-call. But Joe Reiter, an 
attorney for Lovett, claimed Michelin wanted her removed because 
she was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Meeks went on to be one of the six jurors who awarded $30.4  
million to Lovett and found Michelin 90 percent at fault for his 
crash.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 30  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on Kosovo atrocities and refugees:  
</P>
<P>
	The State Department calls what's occurring on the ground in  
Kosovo an ``abhorrent and criminal action on a massive scale.'' 
Even that falls short of describing the savage war that Yugoslav 
troops are waging against their countrymen. Tens of thousands of 
Kosovars are fleeing along snow-covered mountain roads for the 
chance of safety across the borders of Macedonia, Albania or the 
Yugoslav province of Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90,000 have already reached sanctuary and have immediate  
needs for food, clothing and shelter. The United States, its NATO 
allies and international relief agencies ought to be acting now to 
provide for them, in part to preserve the refugees' welcome in the 
poor areas into which they are crowding. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayhem that Serbian soldiers and police units have waged  
against the Kosovars for daring to demand a return to the high 
level of autonomy they once enjoyed within the Yugoslav federation 
has mounted for months. What started as harassment, beatings and 
some political killings has turned in the past week to unbridled 
fratricide. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a Serb, bears  
responsibility for this violence and for the NATO attacks on 
Belgrade, his capital, and on his soldiers in Kosovo. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Star, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia has kicked its ghastly ethnic-cleansing operation  
into high gear in Kosovo, hoping to produce a tidal wave of 
international refugees before the Yugoslav forces have suffered the 
full impact of NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and its allies must now pull out all the stops in the  
air campaign. If there is blood to be shed in Kosovo, it should be 
the blood of Slobodan Milosevic's rampaging troops rather than the 
Albanian civilians who are their intended victims. Unfortunately 
for the Albanians, NATO air power alone may not be enough to save 
them. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is one thing to unleash high-tech air attacks against  
Yugoslavia, attacks where the NATO casualties are expected to be 
light. It would be a far different thing to send NATO ground forces 
in to protect the Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clinton administration and other NATO governments have  
previously ruled out the use of ground troops to hold back the 
Yugoslav onslaught. But those governments should have been aware 
from the start of a fundamental rule of warfare: Conventional air 
power alone cannot do everything. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears that Clinton and other NATO leaders launched their  
air campaign without a solid backup plan. If so, they need to start 
thinking fast. 

</P>
<P>
	March 26  
</P>
<P>
	Naples (Fla.) Daily News, on Yugoslavia:  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's speech to the nation on Kosovo was very much  
of a piece with the man. Rather than the cold calculations of great 
power politics, he dwelled on the humanitarian aspects of the 
mission and his comassion for ``innocent people taken from their 
homes, forced to kneel in the dirt and sprayed with bullets ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the policy that's wrong; it's making the constraints  
public. Clearly, the president was trying to reassure the public 
and especially the Republican-led Congress where there is 
substantial opposition to American troops serving in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Yugoslavia began violently fragmenting in 1991, the United  
States has been too public about its reservations and doubts in the 
Balkans. Our insincere threats and self-imposed deadlines have only 
given the warring parties incentives to step up the fighting and 
try to grab even more territory. ... 
</P>
<P>
	By saying NATO and ... U.S. troops would only enter Kosovo if  
invited and not fight once they got there, Clinton in a sense is 
ceding the initiative to Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The implication is that if he hangs on until NATO tires of the  
air strikes, he can resume his bloody suppression of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Make Milosevic sweat our intentions, not vice versa.  

</P>
<P>
	March 22  
</P>
<P>
	Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald, on the Kosovo crisis:  
</P>
<P>
	Americans have been given no convincing reason why U.S.  
warplanes are bombing the Kosovo province of Serbia, one of the 
parts of the Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton says we have to do it. That's not a persuasive  
argument. The more he says it, the more Americans have reason to 
doubt it. Remember the way he wags his finger. 
</P>
<P>
	The news from Washington and the other capitals sounds very much  
like the saber rattling and propaganda that precedes all other 
wars, the just and good ones as well as the aggresive and bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	It is frightening that at the end of the 20th Century we seem to  
have regressed to the way countries and alliances acted at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is a defensive alliance. Its mission now, without an avowed  
enemy, is very murky. But that hardly justifies launching bombing 
raids in support of diplomacy against a country that has not raised 
a finger against any member of the alliance. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 25  
</P>
<P>
	The Index-Journal, Greenwood, S.C., on American involvement in  
Kosovo: 
</P>
<P>
	It never works. Getting into somebody else's civil war is a  
bottomless pit, and that's just what this nation faces now that 
we've joined the bombing of Serb forces in Yugoslavia. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We should know better. It's not like we don't know what to  
expect. It is indeed a civil war we've jumped into, one that has 
been going on for centuries. It's unlikely that any amount of 
outside pressure, military or otherwise, will change how people 
there feel. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term stability of Europe and our national interest, we are  
told, require military action. President Clinton called the 
confrontation with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic a stand 
against ``destructive racial, ethnic, religious and cultural'' 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	If that be the case, you have to wonder why we haven't mounted  
similar campaigns in other troubled areas of the world, such as 
Rwanda, for instance, where mass murder between the Hutus and 
Tutsis has been of genocidal proportions. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 26  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Express-News, on hate crimes resolution:  
</P>
<P>
	It should be a bipartisan no- brainer, a unanimous vote in the  
House of Representatives condemning bigotry in its many guises. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet House Democrats defeated a resolution offered by Rep. J.C.  
Watts, R-Okla., reaffirming the House's opposition to ``any 
individuals or organizations which seek to divide Americans on the 
grounds of race, religion or ethnic prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As noble as Watt's resolution sounds, Democrats saw it for what  
it was: a disingenuous attempt to deflect criticism from Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Watt's bill was in response to a measure introduced by Reps.  
Robert Wexler, D-Fla., and Michael P. Forbes, R- N.Y., that 
condemned ``the racism and bigotry espoused by the Council of 
Conservative Citizens,'' a white supremacist group whom Barr and 
Lott have addressed. Both condemned the group's racism when their 
appearances became publicly known. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts contends it is wrong to single out a group for bigotry  
when racism is more widespread. He's right, except when members of 
Congress have given the organization credibility it does not 
deserve. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 25  
</P>
<P>
	Cape Cod Times, Hyannis, Mass., on northern right whale:  
</P>
<P>
	Despite government efforts to protect the species, the northern  
right whale, the world's rarest and most endangered large whale, 
may be headed for extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the word from researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic  
Institution and the University of Massachusetts at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 300 of the northern species remain. Another  
population of right whales, numbering a few thousand, lives in the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current conditions, the researchers said, the species  
could become extinct in less than 200 years. Long a symbol of the 
maritime heritage of Massachusetts, the northern right whale must 
be saved. 
</P>
<P>
	While other whales, such as humpbacks, have rebounded since  
federal protections were put in place decades ago, the right whale 
population has been declining by a few whales each year since the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The main culprit seems to be collisions with ships and fishing  
gear entanglements. In other words, the problem is us. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee, on medicinal marijuana:  
</P>
<P>
	A new report on marijuana by the Institutes of Medicine offers a  
rational approach to one of the nation's most controversial 
substances. In the most comprehensive review to date by a panel of 
distinguished medical experts, the IOM has concluded that certain 
chemicals inside marijuana known as THC and cannabinoids are, 
indeed, medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical challenge now is to isolate all of marijuana's  
helpful ingredients from the harmful ones in some new form, such as 
a pill or vapor that is inhaled. The political challenge is how to 
handle marijuana in the coming years (and they may be many) before 
a real alternative to the joint is on the market. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 23  
</P>
<P>
	Vindicator, Youngstown, Ohio, on balloon adventure:  
</P>
<P>
	Jules Verne had fantasized about it in his book ``Five Weeks in  
a Balloon.'' Adventurers Steve Fossett and Richard Branson had 
failed in their attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Brian Jones, an  
English pilot, have become the first to circumnavigate the Earth in 
a balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Their achievement is a tribute to their indomitable spirits and  
to the technological achievements that made it possible for the two 
men to remain aloft -- at times, close to an altitude of 40,000 feet 
-- for nearly 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps breaking the sought-after record was meant to be  
accomplished by men who were quieter and more introspective than 
the flamboyant Fossett and Branson, men who were less aware of 
their own fame and fortune and more aware of their having literally 
and figuratively transcended the intolerance that divided the 
people of the earth beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
	Being closer to God, it seems, was as important to Piccard as  
the glory of the record books and the million-dollar prize offered 
by Anheuser-Busch. Humankind needs more such men. 

</P>
<P>
	March 26  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on U.S.-Cuban exhibition baseball  
game: 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. hardball diplomacy with Fidel Castro's Cuba takes on a  
whole new form Sunday. It's being described by the Clinton 
administration as part of the effort to reach out to the Cuban 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The American League's Baltimore Orioles are traveling to Havana  
to play an exhibition baseball game against a Cuban all-star team. 
It will be the first major league exhibition game in Cuba since 
1959 when the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers played Cuban 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans are among the hemisphere's most avid baseball fans, and  
over the years a number of Cubans have been star major league 
players. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game might be the start of a ``baseball diplomacy''  
between the United States and Cuba similar to the ``ping pong 
diplomacy'' that helped ease tensions between the United States and 
China during the Nixon administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years of enmity must have made it clear to Cubans that the  
U.S. government is fundamentally opposed to Castro. Nine innings of 
baseball legitimizes nothing more than love of a game shared by 
Cubans and Americans. 

</P>
<P>
	March 30  
</P>
<P>
	Liberation, Paris, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Can one reasonably wait for `gestures' of good will from a man  
who, for almost ten years, has engaged in operations of ethnic 
purifying, of assassinating and of massacres, with the consequence 
of more than 200,000 dead and millions more displaced? ... 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo will be empty of its Albanian population in a few weeks.  
No Kosovars will remain in Kosovo other than petrified corpses in 
multiple chambers. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the Western coalition who decided to act last  
Tuesday underestimated the Milosevic problem. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is time to radically modify the coalition's rules of  
engagement if one does not want the `peaceful solution' proposed by 
Jacques Chirac to be none other than the peace of the cemetery. 

</P>
<P>
	March 26  
</P>
<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	... The current air strikes against Serbia differ from the  
Bosnian campaign in many important aspects. They are being 
conducted on shaky legal grounds and raise many questions of 
international law. The scale of the bombing is also questionable. 
While NATO bombing during the Bosnian conflict was directed against 
Serbian forces within Bosnia, the current bombing campaign targets 
Yugoslavia, a sovereign nation. Furthermore, NATO decided to begin 
bombing without seeking the approval of the United Nations or the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Solobodan Milosevic made his first offer to NATO last night. His  
demands ... would have been unacceptable before he put Kosovo to 
the torch. They are both offensive and inadequate now. Mr. 
Milosevic knows that; this is no surrender, but a feint designed to 
split the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	His timing is, as usual, tactically shrewd. The accounts given  
by the battered, traumatized refugees streaming out of Kosovo are 
evidence that an entire people is being persecuted with racist 
cruelty. ... NATO's weaker minds must thus be tempted to pause and 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, and Western publics, should keep the past decade of broken  
Milosevic pledges clearly in mind and keep their nerve. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The Guardian, London, on refugees from Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The same concentration of effort and the same plethora of assets  
lavished on the arial war against Serbia must now be applied to the 
task of housing and caring for the refugees reeling out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	That no preparations of this kind were made by the governments  
dealing with Milosevic or by the alliance military staffs as they 
laid their plans, is worse than a pity. It shows how feckless 
Europe and America have been in their approach to this crisis and 
should at a later time be the subject of serious inquiry. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs have stripped (the refugees) of their possessions and  
their documents and have tried to strip them of their dignity. All 
three must be restored, beginning with the last. 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	The ironies of the situation are bitter indeed. Milosevic now  
enjoys the unamimous support of his own people for the first time. 
Former critics have rallied to his side. Far from crumbling under 
Western attacks, he now feels strong enough to offer a deal if the 
air strikes are halted. And unless NATO accepts, of course, the 
Serbian campaign of terror will continue. Increasingly, the West 
seems trapped in a terrible dilemma. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 30  
</P>
<P>
	Maariv, Tel Aviv, on Yugoslavia:  
</P>
<P>
	Albeit belatedly, the conflict in Yugoslavia has received the  
attention it deserves also in Israel. The Israeli media has been 
largely provincial in recent years and focuses on ``our'' news much 
more than world issues of great importance. ... Kosovo also waited 
in line for a spot on the Israeli agenda. If we hadn't heard the 
mention of the NATO bombing in the same sentence as ``genocide,'' 
it's doubtful that we would have bothered to be interested... 

</P>
<P>
	March 29  
</P>
<P>
	Haaretz, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The events in recent months in Kosovo are more than a mere  
internal conflict between the nations of the former Yugoslavia. ... 
What is occuring there ... borders on genocide. No country or 
society may remain indifferent in the face of these horrific 
actions. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It is the responsibility of Israel's official institutions, the  
government and the Knesset, to give real expression to its support 
for the policy of NATO and the United States. ... It must do so not 
reluctantly or half-heartedly, but rather by taking a clear, 
resolute stand and by taking the necessary diplomatic steps. This 
is the responsibility of the entire people of Israel -- the children 
of a nation that has suffered so much persecution -- to another 
persecuted nation. 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic cleansing continued relentlessly in Kosovo in what should  
have been the ``day of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Are NATO spokespeople wrong when they talk about ``the great  
terror of modern times?'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, this is notcommon place, if one understands how very little  
Slobodan Milosevic conceded yesterday to Russian mediator Yevgeny 
Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of holding out his hand to NATO, he defied it. To  
Primakov, Milosevic gave a message of goodwill but little real 
commitment, knowing it would keep his internal front together, and 
allow him to continue to count on the support of the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO did not fall into the trap, but does it have a strategy,  
besides bombing? ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The Australian, Sydney, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The tide of refugees flooding out of Kosovo -- their homes  
burning behind them, their community and provincial leaders 
executed -- provides stark and heart-wrenching evidence of the 
fundamental fact of the war in the Balkans: Yugoslav leader 
Slobodan Milosevic is a barbaric dictator. ... The past week has 
shown the certainty of Milosevic's action: snatch squads rounding 
up Kosovar men and boys; concentration camps; massacres; and 
execution squads. Even the faint-hearted doubters critical of 
NATO's stand against Milosevic must see that his accelerated 
attempted genocide -- the so-called ethnic cleansing -- exposes the 
malevolence of the man, and reinforces the justification of the 
efforts to stop him. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Primakov's trip to  
Kosovo: 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO stops its bombing and pulls its troops out of Macedonia,  
then Milosevic will be ready to solve all problems in a 
constructive manner, pull back his miliatry presence in Kosovo and 
see to the return of all `peaceful refugees,' said Primakov, after 
six hours of discussions, calling this `a positive sign.' 
</P>
<P>
	To see how meaningless this `positive sign' is, it is worth  
reading a joint Yugoslav-Russian declaration from June 17 last 
year. On that day, Primakov -- then only the foreign minister -- 
forced the following concessions from Milosevic: Milosevic said he 
wanted to solve the problem in Kosovo `by political means.' Against 
the peaceful population he would take `absolutely no repressive 
measures.' 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin praised this declaration to the high  
heavens: `The whole world should see how we have come to an 
agreement, and there is no chance of going back on it.' 
</P>
<P>
	The whole world could see. Milosevic's words weren't worth the  
paper they were written on. There is no reason why we should 
believe him this time. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	Expressen, Stockholm, on Russia and Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The Russian prime minister Yegeny Primakov went to Belgrade  
yesterday morning. He reached an opening with Milosevic and got in 
the evening a quick no from NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	But he should not give up.  
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, it appears that the only way to stop the  
conflict in and around Kosovo goes via Moscow. Russia cannot be 
considered a part of the West, as can, for instance, UN envoys. 
Russians can be expected to talk with Milosevic in his language -- 
and later with the West in their language. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who are demanding capitulation from Milosevic get a firm  
no. And not only from him but from an evermore like-thinking 
Serbian people. ... The man in Belgrade must be spoken to in the 
samee way that he answers. 
</P>
<P>
	But is Yevgeny Primakov capable of doing this? Yes, probably. It  
is not esspecially likely that the Russian prime minister travelled 
to Belgrade only to talk for several hours without having the 
outline of some kind of solution. 

</P>
<P>
	March 31  
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan Times, Amman, on Kosovo and NATO:  
</P>
<P>
	Unless Moscow performs a miracle to stop the war over Kosovo  
soon, NATO will soon discover that relying on aerial bombardment 
will simply not do the job of stopping Belgrade's war machine. The 
Serbs must have calculated all along that with NATO ruling out the 
deployment of ground forces to arrest their onslaught on Kosovo and 
its people, there is no effective way left for the international 
community to stop the ethnic cleansing campaign and genocidal 
warfare being perpetrated against the ethnic Albanians. ...

	The West was counting on Belgrade raising the white flag soon  
after the first wave of allied warplanes dropped their bombs on 
Serbian targets. That did not happen, not even after six nights of 
air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	To defeat Yugoslavia, though, requires a declaration of war on  
that country in the name of NATO and the international community -- 
a route that does not seem to be in the cards.

<HEADLINE> Watts Pleads Guilty in Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOMERSET, Ky. (AP) -- Former Kentucky football player Jason Watts  
pleaded guilty Wednesday to reckless homicide in an alcohol-related 
truck crash that killed a teammate and another young man. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts entered the plea during a 10-minute hearing in Pulaski  
Circuit Court. Judge Daniel Venters granted Watts' request to go to 
prison immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Venters scheduled sentencing for April 16. Pulaski  
Commonwealth's Attorney Eddy Montgomery said he would ask that 
Watts serve consecutive terms of five years on each count for a 
total of 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, originally charged with manslaughter, declined to speak  
in court. He and his attorney, James Lowry, did not comment 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's best for everyone to try to get on with their lives,''  
Watts' father, Jim, said. ``This is a sad, sad day for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nov. 15 crash on U.S. 27 north of Somerset injured Watts and  
killed teammate Arthur Steinmetz and Eastern Kentucky student Scott 
Brock. Tests showed Watts' blood-alcohol level to be 1 1/2 times the 
legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted on the  
original charges. Under Wednesday's plea, his maximum sentence 
dropped to 10 years and the wanton endangerment charge was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was hospitalized with an arm laceration. He was kicked off  
the football team and left school briefly before returning in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy darkened Kentucky's most successful football season  
in years, climaxed by an invitation to the Outback Bowl. Watts, a 
21-year-old senior from Oviedo, Fla., started 10 games at center, 
anchoring a line that protected star quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinmetz, 19, had transferred to Kentucky from Michigan State  
and was sitting out a year while waiting to become eligible. Brock, 
21, was a close friend and high school teammate of Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the wreck, the three were headed for a deer  
hunting excursion. Watts and Brock had spent several hours the 
previous night at a Lexington bar where they celebrated the 
Wildcats' win over Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred just before 7 a.m., as Watts passed another  
driver and lost control of his truck, which flipped over. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery said Watts' lawyers indicated from the start that he  
would take responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery said Watts will be eligible for ``shock'' probation,  
which is given at the judge's discretion to first-time offenders 
who have served between one and six months of a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a motion cannot be made until at least 30 days after  
sentencing, meaning Watts would serve at least 6 1/2 weeks in prison 
before being eligible. Montgomery said he would oppose shock 
probation for Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my perspective, if he ended up serving 10 years, that's  
an appropriate sentence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only public statement since the crash, Watts addressed  
students last week at Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, 
Tenn., blaming himself for his friends' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery said Watts' public expression of remorse was not part  
of the plea agreement, but that it might be taken into account by 
Venters in sentencing Watts.

<HEADLINE> Two Sought in Four Deaths in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- Police say a woman's refusal to help  
conceal her boyfriend's criminal activity may have led the man to 
kill her and three of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for Arthur Goodman, 19, who was  
charged Tuesday with capital murder. His 20-year-old girlfriend, 
Sandy Witt, and the others were shot at close range Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's 16-year-old brother, who may have been present during  
the shootings, was also being sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Jay Hatcher said family and friends gave police two  
versions of a possible motive. In one, Ms. Witt wouldn't supply an 
alibi to police for an undisclosed crime in which Goodman is a 
suspect. In the other, Ms. Witt was planning to give police 
incriminating information about Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Witt's friends -- Naomi Martinez, 23; Erica Arispe, 21; and  
Penny Estrada, 21 -- ``just happened to be in the wrong place at the 
wrong time,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently Goodman wedged himself between the women and the  
door and, as they tried to escape, he shot them one after 
another,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Hammond, an apartment handyman who might have been trying  
to help the women, was shot in the abdomen and critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers also suspect Goodman in the Sunday night shooting of a  
16-year-old boy. Hatcher said the motive in that shooting was 
revenge for an attack on Goodman's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Estrada's mother, Juanita Valdez, joined dozens of people  
who visited Ms. Witt's duplex Tuesday to pray, leave flowers or 
poetry and light candles in memory of the four slain women. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were like sisters they were so close,'' she said. ``They  
all loved each other so much, I can't believe this happened.''

<HEADLINE> Buttafuoco Supports Fisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher has won the support of  
prosecutors in her motion to vacate her assault conviction -- and 
also the backing of the woman she shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jo Buttafuoco joined prosecutors in the motion on behalf of  
Ms. Fisher, who said she was denied effective legal advice when she 
pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher has been in jail for almost seven years for shooting  
Mrs. Buttafuoco, the wife of her lover. The case drew national 
attention and she was dubbed the ``Long Island Lolita.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Buttafuoco said in a letter that she forgave her attacker  
after meeting with her mother and corresponding with Ms. Fisher, 
now 24, for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher said she was duped by her former lawyer into  
believing that if she pleaded guilty, prosecutors would help her 
enter a work release program and earn parole within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison. District  
Attorney Denis Dillon said his office had never promised a work 
release sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling on the motion was expected on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Pat Robertson Eyes 'Cooler' Bible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was quite a holy coterie: gospel singers, tap  
dancers and Pat Robertson introducing a ``cooler'' Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	In what is being billed as ``the largest Bible-reading campaign  
in the history of America,'' the television preacher hit the stage 
Wednesday at Grand Central Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make Bible reading cool in America,'' said  
Robertson, introduced by actress Lynn Whitfield as strobe lights 
flashed across the ceiling of the station's Vanderbilt Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	TV ads for ``The Book'' -- in both a hip-hop and a  
country-western version -- feature Smokey Robinson, MC Hammer, Chaka 
Khan, Andrae and Sandra Crouch, Charlie Daniels and Naomi Judd. The 
ad campaign is costing $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Book'' is published and promoted by the Christian  
Broadcasting Network and Tindale House Publishers Inc., which hopes 
to sell 1 million copies by Christmas.

<HEADLINE> SEC Seeks To Ban 'Pay-to-Play' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The financial comptroller of a large state  
raises $1.8 million for his campaign coffers from investment 
companies, many of them from other states, seeking pension fund 
business. A treasurer of a small state raises nearly all his 
campaign donations from money managers for pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	These anecdotes are being cited by Arthur Levitt, chairman of  
the Securities and Exchange Commission, as examples of a practice 
he is seeking to stamp out: money managers making campaign 
donations to state and local officials who oversee public-employee 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake: the management of such funds, which hold more than $2  
trillion in assets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The donations by money managers seeking pension business can  
tilt the political playing field, Levitt and other critics say. 
Thousands of police, firefighters, teachers and other public 
employees may be unwittingly entrusting their retirement savings to 
financial companies with the strongest political ties rather than 
those most qualified to manage the funds, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign contributions, while legal, create an ethical  
problem when they are used to influence the selection of money 
managers in a practice known as pay-to-play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time we move to put an end to the culture of pay-to-play  
in the area of municipal money management,'' Levitt said in a 
speech Tuesday to the Council of Institutional Investors, a group 
of public, corporate and labor-union pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tremendous importance of public (pension) funds demands  
that they be managed with complete honesty and integrity and for 
the sole benefit'' of their retirees, Levitt said. He decried 
pay-to-play as a form of ``backroom deal'' that ``breeds cynicism 
(toward) government officials and contempt for the political 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stamping out this behavior is difficult and may be possibly  
disruptive. But it is absolutely necessary,'' he said. ``Old ways 
of doing business must give way when they jeopardize the trust of 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt, as the government's top securities regulator, and the  
SEC have authority over the money managers and brokerage firms that 
advise pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency will consider in April or May a new rule that  
would restrict pay-to-play payments by money managers to the 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC did that in 1994 with regard to the $1.3 trillion  
municipal bond market, restricting how much money bond underwriting 
firms can contribute to state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been effective with respect to municipals, and I'd expect  
it would be effective with respect to advisers,'' Levitt said after 
his speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the SEC's 1994 action, many bond underwriters have gotten  
around the municipal pay-to-play restrictions by making donations 
to political parties rather than particular state and local 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	And the new proposal for public pension funds is likely to face  
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the state public-employee retirement fund -- the  
nation's largest with more than $150 billion in assets -- put a rule 
in place last year barring its directors from getting campaign 
contributions from money managers seeking business. 
</P>
<P>
	But after State Controller Kathleen Connell sued the retirement  
fund, known as Calpers, claiming the restriction was hurting her 
re-election effort, a state judge threw out the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Chicago City Treasurer Miriam Santos was indicted  
for alleged attempted extortion in fundraising for her 1998 
campaign for Illinois attorney general. Ms. Santos pleaded innocent 
to the charges, which include pressuring brokerage firms for 
donations of $10,000 each and cutting off firms that wouldn't 
contribute from city business.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rice Swim Coach Sues Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A former Rice University swimming coach is suing  
14 student-athletes she blames for bad-mouthing her coaching 
ability until she lost her job. 
</P>
<P>
	Kris Wingenroth, 45, coached men's and women's swimming teams at  
Rice for 15 years until her contract was not renewed last summer. 
Her tenure included five coach of the year awards in the Southwest 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingenroth claims students were on a mission to oust her,  
complaining that she was too soft. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice was stunned by the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is not another single reported case in the world of a  
coach suing the athletes who criticized the coach,'' attorney Rusty 
Hardin, hired by the school to represent the students, told the 
Houston Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rice's position is the students have to feel free to express  
their opinions. If they can't do that, then the whole idea of a 
university as a place to freely exchange ideas will go down the 
tubes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardin said the school decided not to renew the coach's contract  
after looking into the students' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingenroth, who Hardin said is now in Ecuador studying Spanish,  
initially sued two swimmers, Cory Teague and Christian 
Selchau-Hansen, in state court in December. She added 12 more to 
the list earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coach is seeking unspecified actual and punitive  
damages for several legal claims, including defamation, conspiracy 
to interfere with her contract and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 7, her attorney filed a 75-paragraph document outlining  
what the swimmers allegedly did to get her fired. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, Wingenroth's first confrontation with  
swimmers occurred in March 1995, after she reported to university 
officials that several swimmers had used illegal drugs at a party. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials met with the students but did not punish  
them, the lawsuit says, and soon afterward swimmer Carrell 
Covington allegedly told Wingenroth she would make it her 
``mission'' to get the coach fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardin declined to comment on specific allegations in the  
lawsuit, but said it was ``replete with inaccuracies,'' designed to 
embarrass the students and to intimidate their parents into 
settling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingenroth was replaced by Doug Boyd, the NCAA Division III  
Coach of the Year in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	All but four defendants in the case still attend Rice, officials  
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Baseball Mulls Uniform Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking a new way to increase revenue, major  
league baseball is considering selling advertisements on the 
sleeves of uniforms, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative plan, teams would sell small patches of ads  
to local corporations and then possibly share revenue over a 
specified minimum with other clubs, the New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco, alcohol and broadcast companies would not be allowed to  
buy ads, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball currently allows only the uniform maker's logo on the  
sleeves of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue being considered here goes beyond the scope of a  
uniform manufacturer's logo,'' said a team official who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Smith, the vice president of licensing for Major League  
Baseball Properties, would not comment on the proposed plan, but 
did say: ``We're talking from A to Z about our on-field programs, 
and bringing in additional sponsors in other formats than we have 
now. But we're not close to anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, teams have placed ads on outfield walls and in  
revolving signs behind home plate. Baseball would not be the first 
to have ads on apparel. NASCAR drivers' jumpsuits are plastered 
with sponsors' ads, and golfers and tennis players are also seen 
with logos on their caps and t-shirts.

<HEADLINE> Swanson Revives TV Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Rejoice, couch potatoes -- the original  
TV dinner is in reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swanson TV dinner, the archetypal home meal of convenience  
born during the Eisenhower administration, is getting a marketing 
overhaul as part of the 45th anniversary for C.A. Swanson and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to unveil 10 new products this year and spend  
$10 million on advertising. It is even temporarily bringing back 
the aluminum tray, which it long ago replaced with microwaveable 
packaging, and will again use the words ``TV dinner'' on its frozen 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanson parent Vlasic Foods International is trying to regain  
some of the market share it began losing in the '70s when Nestle 
took over the No. 1 spot in the $4 billion frozen foods industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanson ranks fourth behind Nestle, which makes the Stouffer's  
and Lean Cuisine brands. Americans did buy more than 160 million 
Swanson dinners last year, but that was down from a peak of about 
175 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a neglected brand for a number of years,'' said  
Murray Kessler, president of the Swanson frozen foods division. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Swanson's menus have changed little over the decades.  
The company still features main courses like fried chicken, 
Salisbury steak and roast turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	A brownie or cobbler desert still comes in its individual  
compartment and the turkey -- complemented by potatoes, corn and 
green beans -- still has a gooey cranberry concoction at its side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of American culture,'' Kessler said at the company's  
headquarters just outside Philadelphia. ``We're proud of who we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV dinners -- the label has stuck long after company officials  
dropped the term -- have become an American icon since they were 
unveiled in 1954, perfectly in synch with the quickening pace of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanson wasn't the first company to try its hand at frozen  
meals, but earlier attempts were met with limited success. The 
dinners became a hit as more and more families began eating in 
front of their new televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Thomas was the Swanson executive who came up with the idea  
of frozen dinners to get rid of 520,000 pounds of excess turkey. He 
sketched a drawing of a three-compartment aluminum tray, presented 
it to his bosses and then came up with the name ``TV dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the classic example of necessity being the mother of  
invention,'' said Thomas, 77, now retired. 
</P>
<P>
	A company bacteriologist, Betty Cronin, developed cooking  
techniques for the meal, figuring out how to get the breading to 
stay on the meat during the freezing and then the baking. 
</P>
<P>
	The first meal -- turkey, corn bread dressing and gravy, buttered  
peas and sweet potatoes -- sold for 98 cents, the equivalent of 
about $6 today. Although Swanson initially ordered only 5,000 
dinners, the gamble paid off -- the company sold 10 million the 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
	A frozen fried chicken dinner was introduced in 1955, the same  
year Campbell Soup Co. acquired the Omaha, Neb.-based Swanson, 
which went on to become a leader in the convenience revolution and 
a $300 million business. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanson stopped calling its meals TV Dinners in 1962 because  
executives feared it would discourage consumers from eating the 
meals at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet during the anniversary celebration, ``TV Dinner'' will  
appear on special edition packaging and 45 authentic aluminum trays 
will be rolled out for a sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand prize? A big-screen TV.

<HEADLINE> Parties Work Together in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Jesse Helms to Ted Kennedy, Republicans  
and Democrats are finding that in this age of political distrust, 
they still need each other to get things done in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures on such touchy subjects as tobacco, taxes and health  
care are being offered jointly by Republicans and Democrats who 
know that without a soulmate from the other party, their bills are 
likely to go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance reform, mainly a Democratic priority, made  
headway last year and is back again this year, in part because two 
Republicans, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, joined two Democrats, Rep. Marty Meehan of 
Massachusetts and Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, in sponsoring 
the House and Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Reining in government regulations, long a goal of Republicans,  
has some chance of advancing this year because Sen. Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn., has a Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, as his 
legislative partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a long time to get the credibility to pass a bill  
like campaign finance reform,'' Meehan said. ``With Republicans in 
the majority, having Chris Shays being the lead on this bill was 
extremely important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeastern Democrat is also working with a Western  
Republican, Rep. James Hansen of Utah, on a bill requiring states 
to set aside a quarter of tobacco settlement money on smoking 
health and awareness programs. ``We don't agree on very many 
issues, but we do on tobacco,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans holding a slim 11-seat majority need  
all the Democratic help they can get. In the Senate, where the 
minority holds more sway because of filibuster rules, there's long 
been a tradition of reaching across the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a controversial bill, it is almost a necessity if  
you are going to get beyond the filibuster,'' said Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, who is teaming this year with Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla., on a bill making it easier to carry pensions from one job 
to another and with Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on a bankruptcy 
overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Donald Ritchie recalled how liberal Robert  
Wagner, a New York Democrat, joined with conservative Robert Taft, 
an Ohio Republican, to bring opposing sides together on a major 
public housing legislation after World War II. ``There's historical 
precedent for bipartisanship,'' he said. ``Perhaps they are now 
reverting to form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP-Democratic cooperation was even evident during the Senate  
impeachment trial. Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., unsuccessfully pushed a plan to limit the trial 
to one week, and Sens. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., joined later, again unsuccessfully, on a 
resolution to censure President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderates such as Feinstein are the most apt to work with the  
opposition. Last year she and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, backed one 
of the big anti-tobacco bills. This year she has proposed a crime 
victims constitutional amendment with Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a Y2K 
liability bill with Hatch, a money-laundering bill with Sen. Paul 
Coverdell, R-Ga., and a bill involving hospital stays for 
mastectomy patients with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the partnerships span wide ideological  
differences. Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Democratic 
loyalist Torricelli are jointly behind a bill to help Taiwan better 
defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic-drafted HMO consumer protection plan that nearly  
passed the House last year paired Rep. John Dingell, a pro-labor 
Democrat from Michigan, with Rep. Greg Ganske, a wealthy Republican 
surgeon from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the odder couples is Hatch and Kennedy, who have crossed  
ideological lines to co-author several bills, including an 
unsuccessful attempt in the last Congress to extend health care to 
more uninsured children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel better if I can find a Democrat,'' the  
conservative Hatch said. ``I shriek for joy and jump up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, D-Mass., a champion of liberal causes, is also regarded  
as a master of the political compromise. He has sponsored bills 
with such conservatives as Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., and in the 1980s pushed through a big 
jobs bill with then-Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Clinton White House failed in its attempt to  
revolutionize the health care system, it was Kennedy who stepped 
forward with then-Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., in 1996 to pass a 
more modest but still significant bill making it easier to carry 
health insurance from one job to another.

<HEADLINE> Ads Seek Place on Baseball Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine this: Mark McGwire walking to the plate  
with a patch on his bulging biceps advertising a burger joint. 
</P>
<P>
	Or those famed New York Yankees pinstripes -- the ones worn with  
pride by Ruth and Gehrig, DiMaggio and Mantle -- pitching an ad for 
bagels. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be coming to a ballpark near you.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball, according to the Sports Business Journal, is  
considering allowing teams to sell advertising on the sleeves of 
their uniforms. It's not unprecedented: Soccer teams around the 
world have ads on their shirts, selling everything from breweries 
to banks, often emblazoned in letters larger than those of the team 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads could be on 1- to 1 1/2-inch square patches -- perhaps too  
small to be easily seen from the upper deck, but certainly big 
enough to be picked up in TV closeups and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a traditionalist, but I know all these things we're doing  
generate more revenue, and that's what we have to do,'' Florida 
Marlins manager John Boles said. If Mr. (owner John) Henry says, 
`This is what we're doing on the uniforms,' I'd say, `Looks great 
to me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR drivers are walking, talking billboards when they wear  
their track outfits. And tennis players and golfers frequently 
appear on the court and the course wearing caps with corporate 
logos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where baseball is looking to further  
market itself and maybe that's a possibility we need to look at,'' 
Seattle catcher Dan Wilson said. ``If that's one way to do it, 
that's one way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although shoes and equipment such as bats and gloves carry brand  
names and logos, ads on uniforms apparently would be a first for 
the four major U.S. team sports. Currently, the only corporate 
marking on baseball uniforms is an ``R'' for Russell Athletic, the 
manufacturer of the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about trying to find creative ways to bring valuable  
partners into baseball,'' Tim Brosnan, baseball's senior vice 
president of domestic and international properties, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan wouldn't put a timetable on the discussions or when a  
final decision will be made, saying it depends ``on when things 
gel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several officials speaking on the condition they not be  
identified said owners would have to give the final go-ahead and 
pointed out that commissioner Bud Selig moves slowly and carefully 
toward decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are active discussions about the issues that bring  
additional partners and additional sponsors into baseball,'' 
Brosnan said. ``We're kicking around a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and chief operating officer Paul Beeston did not respond  
to telephone calls seeking comment on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball would prohibit uniform ads only from tobacco, alcohol  
and media companies. Broadcasters of games are unlikely to want to 
show closeups of players wearing ads for their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ralph Nader dislikes the idea, and sent a  
letter to Selig telling him so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad enough already when outfielders are going back for a  
long drive, that fans have to see advertisements for Coca-Cola and 
other products,'' Nader wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are trying the patience of loyal fans across the country.  
Fans yearn for baseball that is free from blatant huckstering and 
crass commercialism,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the scramble to find new revenue in the 1990s, often to cover  
players' escalating salaries, teams have dramatically increased 
ballpark advertising, plastering ads on fences and -- for the first 
time -- behind home plate, where they are visible behind the batter 
from the center field television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have even sold the naming rights to stadiums -- Banc One  
Corp. will spend $66 million on the naming rights to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks' ballpark in the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> CBS-TV's Rather Interviews Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS and Dan Rather won a major coup with  
Wednesday's 70-minute interview of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had not sat down for a television interview since he  
spoke with Black Entertainment Television's Tavis Smiley in 
November. Clinton talked to PBS's Jim Lehrer more than a year ago, 
right after news of the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had requested the interview for several months through  
letters from Rather and phone calls. Finally, Tuesday night, White 
House press secretary Joseph Lockhart called to say Clinton would 
talk to Rather the next afternoon at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS immediately set aside portions of the ``CBS Evening News''  
on Wednesday and ``60 Minutes II'' in prime-time to air the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of ``60 Minutes II'' was devoted to the interview. Clinton  
spoke about Kosovo for half of the show and other topics for the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather was subdued, nearly whispering. The name Monica Lewinsky  
was never uttered, although Rather asked Clinton what he believed 
was the moral of the impeachment episode and what children should 
be told about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran CBS anchorman made the president laugh in asking  
whether Clinton could fulfill the responsibility of a U.S. 
senator's husband. It gave Rather an opening to ask, subtly, about 
whether there were any marital problems in the First Family. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expect to do that together, as man and wife?'' he asked.  
Clinton said he did, if his wife chose to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Rather said  
he believed the president talked because he felt the American 
people needed more explanation of the NATO bombing campaign in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's evening news program could use the boost, as its ratings  
have been sinking lately.

<HEADLINE> Two Sentenced for Medical Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- An Idaho couple were sentenced to  
prison for selling ozone-generating machines they claimed could 
cure AIDS and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Thiefault, 58, and his wife, Mardel Barber, 52, of  
Kooskia, Idaho, sold the machines for about $4,800 each to 
customers across the United States, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These machines can actually harm people,'' prosecutor Rolando  
Garcia said Wednesday. A biology professor who testified at the 
couple's fraud trial said inhaling ozone in high concentrations can 
cause cancer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiefault was sentenced Monday to more than six years in prison  
and fined $100,000. His wife got nearly three years and a $60,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had recommended that the ozone be administered  
rectally, vaginally, in the ear or through the skin by using a body 
bag, according to prosecutors.

	CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- An armed gang backed a truck up to a  
warehouse Wednesday and made off with an estimated $1 million worth 
of cigarettes, about 780 years worth of pack-a-day habits. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the robbery during which four men in hoods  
entered an employee entrance shortly before 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to believe they're headed for another state or maybe  
L.A., where they'll be sold on the black market,'' said Sgt. Eddie 
Garcia, a police spokesman. The smokes, of several brands, would be 
practically impossible to trace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves bound most of the 15 employees with tape and forced  
a few others to drive forklifts, loading the cargo pallets into a 
48-foot trailer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like it was pretty well organized,'' Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even legitimate ``bargain'' cigarettes run about $3.50 per pack  
nowadays, and prices of $4.50 to $5 are common in airports, bars 
and hotels.

<HEADLINE>  U.S.: Aggression May Cost Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to raise  
the cost to Yugoslavia for its scorched-earth torching of Kosovo, 
says President Slobodan Milosevic risks losing international 
support for his claim to the Serb province. U.S. officials brushed 
off Milosevic's call for an end to NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to grind away at this,'' Vice Adm. Scott A. Fry, chief  
of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday as he 
and other U.S. officials claimed slow but steady progress on Day 7 
of a NATO air campaign against the Yugoslav army and special police 
forces that are routing Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who has said from the start of the NATO  
campaign March 24 that it would impose a heavy toll on Milosevic's 
means to wage war, went further Tuesday in remarks at the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today he faces the mounting cost of his continued  
aggression,'' Clinton said. ``For a sustained period, we will see 
that his military will be seriously diminished, key military 
infrastructure destroyed, the prospect for international support 
for Serbia's claim to Kosovo increasingly jeopardized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, said  
today he has been authorized to expand the range of targets of the 
bombing campaign. He refused to discuss specific targets but 
acknowledged that increased civilian casualties could result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been extremely careful so far and quite effective in  
preventing collateral damage and civilian casualties,'' Clark said 
on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``There are no guarantees in an 
operation like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said any discussion of civilian casualties should consider  
the atrocities already being inflicted on Kosovars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to take every action that is available within our  
means and capabilities to bring home the tragedy of his policy -- 
President Milosevic -- and his leadership and we are going at the 
same time continue to attack, degrade and disrupt actions of his 
police forces on the ground,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has opposed independence for Kosovo,  
which is a province of Serbia, while pressing for the kind of 
autonomy the province enjoyed until Milosevic forcibly abolished it 
in the late 1980s. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million people 
are ethnic Albanians. Most of the rest are Serbs. Serbia is one of 
two republics in what remains of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton's remarks did not reflect  
a change in U.S. policy on Kosovar independence. Mike Hammer, a 
spokesman for the president's National Security Council, said 
Clinton was making the point that if Milosevic does not back down 
he may find the international community no longer willing to accept 
a Serbia that includes Kosovo -- even Kosovo with autonomy. Left 
unsaid was how the world community could force Milosevic to give up 
Kosovo, given NATO's unwillingness to fight a land war. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, officials acknowledged Tuesday that NATO's  
bombardment is far from achieving its goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been a knockout punch,'' said spokesman Kenneth  
Bacon. ``It will take much longer to degrade the (Yugoslav) forces 
as much as we think we need to.'' Bacon declined to predict how 
long it might take but said, ``We are prepared to go as long as it 
takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To step up NATO's attacks, five Air Force B-1 long-range bombers  
were preparing to fly to Europe to join B-52 bombers that have been 
launching cruise missiles at Yugoslavia since last Wednesday's 
start of Operation Allied Force. The B-1s, from Ellsworth Air Force 
Base, S.D., are armed with gravity bombs and cluster munitions that 
are likely to be used against staging areas of Serb military forces 
in Kosovo, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials steadfastly refused to give a clear picture of  
the amount of damage they believe NATO bombs have inflicted on 
Yugoslavia's air defense network, which continues to pose a threat 
to allied pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, chief of intelligence for the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon briefing that Yugoslav air 
defenses have sustained ``significant damage,'' but he declined to 
be more specific. He said the communications system upon which 
Yugoslavia's air defense depends is ``still effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fry said bad weather has forced NATO to scratch many attack  
missions. He showed a color-coded chart indicating weather limited 
airstrikes each day except the first, March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said NATO had no illusions that its airstrikes could stop  
the Serbs' house-to-house pillaging of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, 
who reportedly are being killed or driven from the area by the tens 
of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to say we have prevented one act of  
brutality,'' Bacon said. ``This is being done very up-close and 
personal by the Yugoslav army and special police forces in small 
groups of armed, vicious people going out and shooting people at 
close range, frequently burning them, shelling their houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we always knew that this type of action on the ground,  
highly localized, was going to take a long time to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon reiterated that the Clinton administration is not  
considering using ground troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's hope is that more concentrated air attacks on Serb troop  
formations and armor -- hampered so far by poor weather -- will begin 
to disrupt the localized attacks against Kosovar Albanian 
civilians. Working against NATO, however, is the continued threat 
posed by Serb air defenses.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Inquiry Cost More Than $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent more  
than $6 million on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the overall 
investigation of President Clinton is becoming the most expensive 
in history, congressional auditors reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures, for the six-month period ending Sept. 30,  
1998, bring the total cost of Starr's 4 1/2-year inquiry of the 
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to nearly $40 million. Starr 
replaced Robert Fiske, who spent $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive independent counsel investigation to date was  
Lawrence Walsh's $48.5 million, six-year probe of the Reagan 
administration regarding its arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and 
its secret war against the communist-led government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports by the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing and  
investigative arm, show that the cost of investigating top 
administration officials during the Clinton era now tops $76 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The monumental effort required to conduct the investigation of  
Monica Lewinsky and others required unusual commitments of 
resources,'' said Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concerns about the exorbitant expense of the Independent  
Counsel's investigation are well known, but we'll let this latest 
report speak for itself,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's expenditures totaled $6.2 million in the six months  
through last Sept. 30, up nearly 60 percent from the $3.9 million 
in the previous six months, said the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest GAO report does not cover costs for the first 2 1/2  
months of Starr's investigation into the presidential affair and 
cover-up. Starr opened the Lewinsky investigation in mid-January 
1998. The latest GAO figures start on April 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO totals do not break out Starr's costs for other aspects  
of his investigation, such as the prosecutions of Clinton friend 
Webster Hubbell and Whitewater partner Susan McDougal. But those 
investigations pale in size and intensity to the Lewinsky case, 
which involved a massive grand jury inquiry that lasted seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr wrapped up the Lewinsky investigation on Sept. 9, 1998,  
with a report to Congress detailing 11 possible grounds for 
impeaching the president for lying and obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of Mrs. McDougal in Arkansas on contempt and  
obstruction charges is in its fourth week. Mrs. McDougal was 
investigated and indicted last May, a cost that would be included 
in the latest financial figures for Starr's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has two court cases pending against Hubbell, one for  
income tax evasion, the other for obstructing federal regulators 
looking into the failure of the savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partners. Both those cases were in the 
investigative stage in the months covered by the latest 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, the former Iran-Contra prosecutor, said that Starr's  
costs will jump suddenly by many millions of dollars when he 
concludes his investigation. The reason: legal costs for witnesses 
drawn into Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Starr that will exceed me'' in costs ``before  
he's through,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh pointed out that under the Independent Counsel Act, people  
who were subjects of Starr's investigation but who were never 
indicted are entitled to reimbursement from the government for 
legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the many people who may fit into that category are the  
president -- who was impeached, not indicted -- and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent counsels during the Clinton administration have  
investigated former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing 
Secretary Henry Cisneros, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.

<P>
	``No more than 10,'' the CBS golf color analyst said. ``Hale  
Irwin is right there in the top two, and `Flasher' (Bruce 
Fleischer) is the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Irwin sees it, McCord has the game to be counted if he  
wants to concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never had something,'' Irwin said. ``I don't know if it's  
desire, the intent. He's a multilayered guy -- maybe that's a nice 
way of saying a where-is-he-coming-from kind of guy, but his golf 
game has always been very, very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The affable McCord has a new contract with the network that  
allows him a dozen weekends a year to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is working on his third book about golf and is producing  
a movie about the life of gambling golfer Titanic Thompson, an 
outgrowth of his work as a technical consultant for the Kevin 
Costner film ``Tin Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his spare time, the Scottsdale resident operates a teaching  
center with Peter Kostis. And McCord focused on golf three weeks 
ago and won a senior event in Newport Beach, Calif. -- the first 
title at any level of a pro career that began in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	His path will be somewhat cleared by the withdrawal of two-time  
champion Gil Morgan, who pulled out Wednesday because of a sore 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan is the first senior since Jack Kiefer at the Canadian  
Senior Open last year who didn't attempt to defend a title. Morgan 
withdrew from last week's event after two rounds because of back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing to have to pull out of The Tradition  
this year, especially with the opportunity to win for a third 
straight time,'' Morgan said. ``You only get a chance like this 
maybe once in a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus also is missing, along with  
former winners Don Bies and Lee Trevino. That leaves only two 
former champions -- Tom Shaw (1993) and Raymond Floyd (1994) -- in 
the 11th Tradition, sponsored by Countrywide. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is still plenty of talent gathered on the hilly,  
arroyo-cut Cochise Course, one of five Nicklaus designed for Desert 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval is in McCord's category, a first-time winner last week  
who hopes to add a major to his resume before his son David Duval 
does. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer has won twice, finished second twice and won $532,400  
in four tournaments as a rookie on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised a little by my play,'' Fleischer said. ``I don't  
feel as intimidated as I once did, especially not out here. As you 
get older, maybe the drive isn't as great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no one can overlook Irwin, who rampaged through the Senior  
PGA for two years, winning 16 of his 20 titles, the U.S. Senior 
Open and two of his three Senior PGA Championships in that span. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin hasn't won an official event this year, though, and said  
he was due to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really attributable to the downside of what has  
been a two-year run,'' said Irwin, who has won a record $7,620,253 
in about four years on the senior tour. ``I think I lost a little 
bit of momentum over the holidays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he said, it's time to refocus and claim the title that  
eluded him in 1996 when Nicklaus made up a 1-stroke deficit in the 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to get back, I need a tournament like this,'' Irwin  
said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Gets Stay in Eligibility Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal appeals court has put on hold a  
judge's ruling that the NCAA said threatened to cause recruiting 
``chaos'' among its Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals  
decided on Tuesday to allow the NCAA more time to develop new 
freshman eligibility requirements after a lower court struck down 
the use of minimum test scores to determine eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court decision to grant the NCAA a stay of the lower  
court ruling puts the old eligibility requirements listed under 
Proposition 16 temporarily back in place while the NCAA appeals, 
but does not overrule the lower court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Prop 16 opponents hope NCAA officials don't interpret the  
stay as a permanent timeout from forming new eligibility 
guidelines. NCAA lawyers had said the ruling would cause ``chaos'' 
and ``irreperable harm'' to the 302 Division I schools affected by 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA knows this is a bad rule. One would hope they use the  
time they say they need'' to develop new rules, said Andre Dennis, 
lead lawyer for the four black plaintiffs who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter struck down Prop 16 on  
March 8, ruling that minimum test score requirements have an 
``unjustified disparate impact on African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is that (the NCAA) will become complacent and allow  
the discriminatory effect to continue,'' Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, college athletics' national governing body, said it  
needed a stay so as to have time to write replacement eligibility 
rules and file appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA lawyer David Bruton argued in court Tuesday that there was  
``considerable confusion'' among Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been no alternative proposed that would achieve the  
level of success'' that Prop 16 had achieved in setting academic 
requirements, Bruton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents called on the NCAA to adopt a nondiscriminatory  
eligibility policy rather than fight to delay or overturn the 
court's decision. The athletes involved have either long since 
reached or are close to the end of their freshman year of 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``At best, this is an administrative inconvenience,'' Dennis  
said Tuesday in chiding the NCAA's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're basically saying `3rd Circuit, save us from ourselves'  
because no one is forcing these people to be let in,'' Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter on March 17 declined to give the NCAA the extra time,  
but the appeals court granted the stay pending the NCAA's appeal. 
The judge's initial ruling did not completely rule out some use of 
the tests, which many educators have long said are racially and 
culturally discriminatory.

<HEADLINE> Report: BP Amoco To Buy Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Directors of the newly merged oil company BP  
Amoco have approved an accord to pay as much as $27 billion for 
Atlantic Richfield Co., a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with  
the negotiations, reported that the board of Los Angeles-based Arco 
still needs to approve the pact, but that it was expected a deal 
would be announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said earlier this week that they are negotiating a  
possible combination. 
</P>
<P>
	A BP spokesman declined comment on the report. Arco did not  
return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of Britain's BP Amoco and Arco would create the  
world's second largest oil company after Exxon Corp. and would 
extend the recent massive consolidation within the energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has been a leading force in that consolidation as the  
former British Petroleum PLC acquired Amoco Corp. of Chicago for 
$57.6 billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said details of the pact between BP Amoco and Arco  
weren't available late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said a combination could run into potential problems with  
Alaska statutes that limit how much exploration acreage companies 
and their subsidiaries can control in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have extensive operations in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Shamed by Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he does not  
consider his impeachment ``some great badge of shame'' and that he 
believes historians will fairly explain the political motives 
behind Congress' action toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS News, Clinton said he felt ``honored''  
that the impeachment gave him a chance to defend the Constitution. 
He said the American people clearly saw that driving the 
impeachment was an attempt by Republican congressional leaders to 
undermine the good works of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those that did not agree with what I had done and were furious  
that it had worked and that the country was doing well, and 
attempted to use what should have been a constitutional and legal 
process for political ends, did not prevail,'' Clinton said. 
``That's the way I saw it.... 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do not regard this impeachment vote as some great badge  
of shame. I do not,'' Clinton said. ``I do not believe it was 
warranted and I don't think it was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview, conducted Wednesday at the White House by CBS  
anchor Dan Rather, yielded Clinton's most detailed assessment yet 
of his impeachment on charges stemming from his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he never thought about resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would never have legitimized what I believe is horribly  
wrong with what has occurred here over the last four or five years. 
So it never crossed my mind,'' he said. ``....I just, I prayed 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he has no lingering animosities toward political  
enemies who fed the impeachment frenzy. ``I don't wake up every day 
mad at those people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment I spend full of anger and bitterness is a moment I  
am robbing from my wife or from my daughter or from my country or 
from my friends,'' he said. ``I just think that it's past us and we 
need to put it behind us, and we need to go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe that to the American people, to let it go. ... All the  
great players here, they need to let it go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the interview focused largely on the crisis in Kosovo,  
Clinton also discussed how first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
ruminations on running for a Senate seat in New York and how his 
family is faring the wake of the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given what we've been through, we're doing reasonably well,''  
he said. ``We're not a large family. We do love each other very 
much, and we work hard to support one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no idea what Mrs. Clinton would decide, but that  
it still struck him that having a first lady run for office was ``a 
highly unusual thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can imagine that many voters in New York would wonder,''  
he said. ``And that would be a burden she would have to carry in 
the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Clinton said, ``I think if she could win an election like  
that, she would be magnificient.'' He said he would be supportive -- 
although he doesn't know what the duties of a senator's husband 
are. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm willing to fulfill them,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Water Bottling Companies Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A California group is suing water-bottling  
companies, basing its complaints on a national environmental 
group's findings that some bottled water is not as pure as 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Tuesday by the Environmental Law Foundation did  
not claim that any of the eight companies' products was dangerous. 
But it said they violated California's standards, the nation's 
strictest, for chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects, 
even though the companies advertised their water as ``pure'' and 
``natural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a big public health threat but it is, in some  
cases, a consumer ripoff,'' said attorney James Wheaton, the 
foundation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Superior Court suit seeks a ban on misleading advertising,  
mandatory warning labels on water that violates state purity 
standards, and an outright ban on bottled water that violates the 
state limits for a chlorine byproduct or a type of bacterial 
contamination. It also seeks a refund of any profits made through 
illegal business practices or false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Its allegations were based on a national study of 103  
bottled-water brands released Tuesday by the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. The council found no health risks, but said 
one-third violated purity standards set by the industry or states -- 
including 22 percent that violated California standards for arsenic 
and trihalomethanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheaton said the presence of trihalomethanes indicates that  
water came from a chlorinated public water supply rather than from 
a spring, as some companies claimed in their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Californians drank more than one-third of the 3.4 billion  
gallons of bottled water consumed nationwide last year, the suit 
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan a Hornet Player-Owner? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Don't count on Michael Jordan owning a piece of the Charlotte  
Hornets and playing for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be against NBA rules, it might tarnish his place in  
history, and it would involve him bouncing a basketball again -- 
something he says he's finished doing. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the reaction Wednesday from the league, Jordan's agent  
and one of his close friends following a report that the five-time 
MVP was considering coming out of retirement to play for the 
Hornets next season if he is successful in purchasing a share of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely no truth to it,'' agent David Falk said in  
a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest player to ever play the game, and he would  
only do himself a disservice,'' Charles Barkley said. ``I just hope 
he doesn't play because he'd damage his legendary status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even if Jordan wanted to play for the Hornets, it would be  
against league rules to do so if he was a part-owner. The NBA 
prohibits owners from being players, as Magic Johnson learned three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While the prospect of Jordan returning to the court was being  
widely shot down, the possibility of him becoming an owner remained 
open. Earlier this month, Jordan held face-to-face discussions with 
Hornets owner George Shinn month about buying a 50 percent share of 
the team, and the two have agreed to meet again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports, citing unidentified sources close to Jordan,  
reported Tuesday night that Jordan's best-case scenario would 
involve him playing one full season for the Hornets while his 
ownership shares were held in a trust or otherwise deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Michael Jordan and George Shinn negotiations have never  
involved a playing role for Jordan,'' Hornets spokesman Harold 
Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, vacationing in the Bahamas, did not return a message  
seeking comment. NBA commissioner David Stern was out of his office 
Wednesday and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	A league spokesman pointed out that the NBA constitution  
prohibits players from being owners. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson ended his retirement and returned to the Los  
Angeles Lakers in 1996, the league made him sell his ownership 
shares back to principal owner Jerry Buss. Johnson later 
repurchased some of those shares after he finally retired for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, in announcing his retirement earlier this year, left the  
door open for a possible return by pronouncing himself anywhere 
from ``95'' to ``99.9 percent retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have seen Jordan recently estimate he is about 20  
pounds heavier than his playing weight, and he recently said he 
hasn't picked up a basketball since hitting the final shot of his 
career -- the game-winner in Utah at the end of Game 6 of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also recently underwent surgery on his right index  
finger, which he damaged with a cigar cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan previously gave up basketball in October, 1993, to pursue  
a career in professional baseball, then unretired in the spring of 
1995. He won championships with the Chicago Bulls in his final 
three seasons, giving him six for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario of him playing again next season, according to Fox,  
also would include Phil Jackson being brought in to coach the 
Hornets for one year and Dean Smith, Jordan's college coach at 
North Carolina, being brought aboard as team president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's agent dismissed the report, while Smith did not return  
a phone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets have been a team in turmoil all season. Shinn has  
been going through a divorce and battling numerous sexual 
harassment allegations, coach Dave Cowens publicly ripped the 
organization before quitting, Anthony Mason has missed the entire 
season with a shoulder injury and the team's best player, Glen 
Rice, was traded to the Lakers for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been playing better recently under interim coach  
Paul Silas, but it seems certain the Hornets will miss the 
postseason for the first time since 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, (Jordan) is not good enough to make that team  
win anyway,'' Barkley said. ``They need the old Michael Jordan, the 
guy from five or six years ago, to make that team a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``And like I said, as a friend of his, as a very close friend of  
his, I just hope he doesn't do anything to jeopardize what he's 
already accomplished, because it's legendary right now,'' Barkley 
said.

<HEADLINE> Love Seeks First Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- Davis Love III got his first look at the TPC  
at Sugarloaf course, and liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	His only complaint was the weather conditions during Wednesday's  
pro-am before today's start of the $2.5 million BellSouth Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a fabulous golf course,'' Love said, shivering with his  
windbreaker zipped up to his throat. ``It will be fun to play when 
it warms up 20 degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should get that chance.  
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was a chilly 50 degrees, with off-and-on rain  
Wednesday. The forecast calls for clearing today, with the 
temperature climbing into the low 80s by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Love, seeking his first victory of the year after posting six  
Top Ten finishes, is among the favorites in a strong field headed 
by David Duval, winner of last week's Players Championship and two 
other events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chance Love had of winning last week was washed away in the  
third round when he dumped two shots in the water around the 17th 
green. He took a triple bogey on the way to a 78 and eventually 
finished in a tie for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what is making Duval so successful, Love said, ``He has an  
extreme amount of confidence. He was close for a long time. Then 
when he finally did break through, we said he will probably win a 
bunch. We didn't predict 10 of 33, but we said once he gets one, he 
will play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love said he's playing fairly well and driving the ball very  
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except for bad breaks and silly mistakes and missed putts,  
David would be sitting here talking about me,'' Love said. ``I am 
very, very close, two seconds, a third and last week's disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he won't tinker with his game for this tournament and in  
preparation for next week's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to do too much different than I did last week,  
except try to keep a few balls out of the water,'' he said. ``I 
probably won't do a lot this week other than just play. It is a 
hard, long walk. Next week is a long, hard walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval also doesn't want to leave his game at Sugarloaf.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have to weigh it out and make sure I don't expend too much  
energy here and make sure I am ready for next week as well,'' he 
said. ``It will be a bit of a balancing act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a strong contingent of foreign players getting in the  
tournament mode a week before the Masters. That group includes 
Sweden's Gabriel Hjertstedt, who won at Tucson this year, former 
Masters champions Nick Faldo of England, Jose Maria Olazabal of 
Spain and Ian Woosnam of Wales and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie and 
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Tiger Woods isn't in the field.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott McCarron, who won the first event at Sugarloaf two years  
ago when the event moved from the Atlanta Country Club, is playing, 
along with John Huston, Fred Couples, Mark Calcavecchia, Phil 
Mickelson and last week's runnerup, Scott Gump.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Hires Harrick As Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick was hired today as basketball  
coach at Georgia after guiding UCLA to a national championship in 
1995 and spending the past two seasons at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the situation, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed Harrick will replace Ron Jirsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia called a 1:30 p.m. news conference to announce the  
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, has a career record of 404-190 in 19 years as a  
head coach at Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island. He accepted the 
Georgia job after agreeing not to bring his son, Jim Jr., as an 
assistant coach because of the state's strict anti-nepotism law. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the national title at UCLA, Harrick was fired on  
Nov. 6, 1996, for his involvement with a recruiting dinner 
involving more players than allowed by NCAA rules. Harrick paid the 
dinner tab and allegedly lied about how many people were at the 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick apologized and admitted to a lapse in judgment but said  
he did not deserve to be fired. He accused UCLA athletic director 
Peter Dalis of being ``out to get me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting out the 1996-97 season, Harrick returned to  
coaching at Rhode Island, leading the Rams to the NCAA tournament 
in two straight seasons. They reached the regional final in 1998 
and lost to Tennessee in the first round this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was chosen as the Bulldogs coach over Appalachian  
State's Buzz Peterson, who was endorsed by Dean Smith and Michael 
Jordan, his former coach and teammate, respectively, at North 
Carolina. The other finalist, Delaware's Mike Brey, removed himself 
from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia president Michael Adams was apparently the driving force  
behind the hiring of Harrick, who was at Pepperdine when Adams 
served as the school's vice president of development. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was the Pepperdine coach for nine seasons, a tenure that  
began in 1979 and included four NCAA tournament appearances and the 
only losing season of his college career in 1986-87. Moving to 
UCLA, his teams never won fewer than 21 games in eight years, 
highlighted by a 31-2 mark during the national title season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa was fired after failing to lead Georgia to the NCAA  
tournament during his two-year tenure. He was hired for his first 
head coaching job when Tubby Smith left for Kentucky in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa, Smith's top assistant, inherited a veteran team that had  
two straight 20-win seasons and NCAA tournament appearances under 
Smith. Despite the addition of Jumaine Jones, the Bulldogs 
struggled to a 35-30 mark with Jirsa as coach, settling for the 
National Invitation Tournament both years.

	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons sobbed and begged for  
mercy at his sentencing for racketeering and theft, and got 
absolutely nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to pay the piper, Dr. Lyons,'' Circuit Judge Susan  
Schaeffer said Wednesday before sentencing the man who once headed 
one of the nation's most influential black denominations to 5 1/2 
years in prison. The judge also ordered him to pay nearly $2.5 
million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, the former president of the National Baptist Convention  
USA, was led from the Pinellas County courtroom to immediately 
begin serving his prison term. He still faces sentencing in federal 
court in June on related charges of fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons had faced up to eight years in prison under state  
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for the maximum prison term, prosecutor Bernie McCabe  
accused the minister of apologizing in order to influence the 
judge's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words he speaks are the words he thinks will serve him  
best at the moment,'' McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted Feb. 27 of racketeering for stealing more  
than $4 million from companies seeking to market life insurance 
policies, credit cards and cemetery plots to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Lyons also apologized for the theft of almost $250,000  
from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money intended to 
rebuild burned churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stinks in God's nostrils and I know it stinks in the law's  
nostrils and it stinks to me,'' he said. ``I ask the court and I 
ask America and I ask black people to forgive me because I believe 
that it will haunt me the rest of my life. I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, convention publicist Bernice  
Edwards, were accused of spending the money on luxury homes, cars, 
jewelry and travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot shake the feeling that I have let so many people  
down,'' Lyons told the judge. ``I've asked God every single night 
and day to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask for mercy,'' Lyons said, breaking into sobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those who spoke on Lyons' behalf was his wife, Deborah.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love my husband very much. We have been through some rough  
times together,'' she said. ``If you can find it in your heart, 
look not at Dr. Lyons in the last three or four years but look at 
the good he brings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' troubles began in 1997 when his wife set fire to a  
$700,000 waterfront home he owned with Ms. Edwards. The fire led to 
closer scrutiny of Lyons' lavish spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, the pastor of a St. Petersburg church, served as  
president of the National Baptist Convention from 1994 until he 
tearfully resigned that post on March 16, a few weeks after he was 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he avoided a second trial by pleading guilty in  
federal court to evading taxes, engaging in fraudulent activities 
and lying to officials -- charges that grew out of convention 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards went on trial with Lyons but was acquitted. However,  
she pleaded guilty in federal court to tax evasion and is awaiting 
sentencing Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' sentencing in federal court is set for June 18. His  
lawyers said he will probably serve a little more than seven years.
