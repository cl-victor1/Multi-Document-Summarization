246 days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	One hundred years ago, on April 29, 1899, jazz legend Duke  
Ellington was born in Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1861, Maryland's House of Delegates voted against seceding  
from the Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1862, New Orleans fell to Union forces during the Civil War.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1916, the Easter Rising in Dublin collapsed as Irish  
nationalists surrendered to British authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, American soldiers liberated the Dachau concentration  
camp; that same day, Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun and designated 
Admiral Karl Doenitz his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, 28 former Japanese leaders were indicted as war  
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, President Nixon announced he was releasing edited

</P>
<P>
	In 1992, deadly rioting erupted in Los Angeles after a jury in  
Simi Valley, Calif., acquitted four Los Angeles police officers of 
almost all state charges in the videotaped beating of Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: In a sign that student demonstrators in Beijing  
had gained influence, China's government conducted informal talks 
with leaders of the democracy protests, and then televised the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the  
terror of ethnic massacres in Rwanda were pouring into Tanzania. 
Israel and the PLO signed an agreement in Paris granting 
Palestinians broad authority to set taxes, control trade and

<HEADLINE> Teen Pregnancy Rate Keeps Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen pregnancy plummeted 17 percent in the  
1990s to the lowest level since 1973, and teen abortion rates were 
down, too. Researchers point to a mix of reasons, including more 
reliable contraception, fear of AIDS, a new focus on abstinence and 
even the strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's fresh evidence that the peer pressure so many  
parents worry about actually does more good than harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The falling rates have some advocates worried the nation will  
become complacent about teen pregnancy, but many were celebrating 
the statistics, which were being announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made real progress -- and must do more -- to encourage  
more young people to delay parenthood,'' said Vice President Al 
Gore, who plans a roundtable discussion with teen-agers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new reports document the decline. New statistics from the  
Department of Health and Human Services show that births to 
teen-agers fell 4 percent in 1997, helping to push the national 
birth rate for all women to a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute finds teen  
pregnancy dropped 4 percent in 1996 and fell 17 percent from its 
peak in 1990. The Guttmacher statistics combine the birth data with 
statistics on abortion and estimates for miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS report, which looks at a host of birth data, also found  
a new record low for births to unmarried black women and a 
continued decline in out-of-wedlock births in 1997. The year saw a 
record high for women getting early prenatal care and a record low 
rate of women smoking during pregnancy, down to 13.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there were about 880,000 teen pregnancies in 1996 --  
or about 97 for every 1,000 female teens. Sixty-two percent of the 
pregnant teens in 1996 were 18- and 19-year-olds; the rest were 15 
to 17 years old. The report did not look at teens under 15. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the lowest level since 1973, when there were 96 pregnancies  
for every 1,000 female teens. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in three pregnancies were aborted, as the teen  
abortion rate dropped 3 percent in 1996. It fell 31 percent from 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the decline in pregnancy is due to increased use of  
birth control, said Jacqueline E. Darroch, a vice president at 
Guttmacher, a private research group. She noted that 11 percent of 
15- to 19-year-olds now use long-acting, highly effective birth 
control methods such as Depo-Provera shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Condom use also increased as fear of AIDS spread in the '90s.  
And national surveys point to decreased teen sexual activity as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Other explanations are harder to pin down, including an  
explosion of abstinence and pregnancy prevention programs and a 
strong economy that may be giving teens more hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, for the first time, research suggests positive peer  
pressure may be stronger than the negative pressures parents 
usually fear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging out with friends who do well in school and don't drink  
or smoke will help a teen avoid pregnancy, researchers found. But, 
contrary to many parents' fears, hanging out with kids who engage 
in these and other risky behaviors doesn't make much difference, 
said Brad Brown of the University of Wisconsin, who analyzed a 
federal survey of teens for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen 
Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Hayman, 18, who is finishing high school in Baltimore,  
agreed that peer pressure isn't always negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``My best friend is a virgin,'' she said. ``A lot of our friends  
have had sex and it obviously doesn't bother her that she's still a 
virgin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a new poll conducted for the campaign finds that both  
parents and teens say parents are more influential than friends 
when it comes to decisions about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents don't want to talk about sex, Ms. Hayman said.  
She's been having sex since she was 16 but has never talked to her 
mother about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there are certain things you don't feel like you can  
talk to your mother about,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Laverne Coates, agrees, saying she feels ``real  
uncomfortable'' talking about sex so she has never had a real 
conversation with her daughter about it. But she thinks she has 
made it clear that teen sex and pregnancy are unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear about it. I don't want to know about  
it,'' said Ms. Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, some  
advocates are concerned that people believe the teen pregnancy 
problem has been solved. They note that U.S. rates are still higher 
than those of other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Kreinin of the campaign worries that condom use will  
decline as fear of AIDS recedes. ``What I'm hearing from kids is 
you don't die from AIDS any more,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But HHS Secretary Donna Shalala was more optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are that naive about American  
teen-agers,'' she said. ``We need to keep the same focus and 
philosophy and send consistent messages to every generation.''

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- A major business organization asked  
the government Wednesday to bar from the country a U.S. labor 
activist who has campaigned against alleged abuses in Honduran 
clothing factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Facusse, president of the Honduran Private Enterprise  
Council, accused Charles Kernaghan of spreading falsehoods abroad 
about mistreatment of workers in assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time that Honduran businessmen have tried to  
have Kernaghan banned from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernaghan, head of the nonprofit National Labor Committee in New  
York City, has called for boycotts of companies that exploit 
workers in poor countries. He arrived Monday in Honduras to visit 
factory workers.

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who  
assumed power when his predecessor stepped down amid a political 
crisis this year, can remain in office through 2003, Paraguay's 
Supreme Court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court on Tuesday said Gonzalez Macchi will not face an  
election and will be able to serve out the term of former President 
Raul Cubas, who resigned in March after the assassination of Vice 
President Luis Argana. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also ruled that elections to seat a new vice president  
will be held Nov. 21. Gonzalez Macchi has said he would support an 
opposition candidate for the post.

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Relatives of the man known as Carlos  
the Jackal have praised a letter of solidarity sent to the 
convicted terrorist by Venezuela's president. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez has insisted that the letter, sent soon  
after his election in February, was meant to show ``human 
solidarity'' not ``political solidarity'' with Ilich Ramirez 
Sanchez. He is serving a life term in a Paris prison for the 1975 
murders of two French investigators and a Lebanese man. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Chavez addressed the Venezuelan-born Carlos as  
``Dear compatriot'' and, according to press reports, signed the 
missive ``with profound faith in the cause and the mission, now and 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos's brother, Vladimir Ramirez, told reporters Tuesday that  
the letter was ``a beautiful gesture of solidarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once one of the world's most wanted terrorists, Carlos was  
linked to the 1975 seizure of OPEC ministers in Vienna, Austria, 
and the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- French automaker Renault on Wednesday  
laid the cornerstone of a $120 million engine plant in southern 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The new factory will be built in the city of Curitiba, 217 miles  
southwest of Sao Paulo, next to an auto plant Renault inaugurated 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is expected to be concluded by early 2000 with an  
initial annual output of 57,000 engines, the automaker's press 
office said. By 2002, the factory will produce 280,000 units a 
year.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	April 22  
</P>
<P>
	The News Herald of Panama City, Fla., on Colorado school  
shootings: 
</P>
<P>
	We know who is responsible for turning the Colorado high school  
into a killing field. ... We even know ... who possibly could have 
prevented it: Mike Vendegnia, or Alisa Owen, or Greg Barnes. 
Others, too, and students all. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan Klebold, recalled fellow senior Vendegnia, ``was into guns  
and stuff like that. We'd talk and joke around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Eric Harris always ``were joking around saying, `We  
are going to shoot you,''' Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Barnes who told the Denver Rocky Mountain News that no  
one took Harris and Klebold seriously. He needed no prompting to 
add, ``That was a mistake.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's not pleasant to imagine a school resource officer or an  
administrator asking parents to come in to talk about suspicions 
other students have of their son. But that apparently is the only 
prevention that can work. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, the first defense against a situation like this is  
other students. It's politicians who cloud the issue. 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on Colorado school shootings:  
</P>
<P>
	Adolf Hitler was born 110 years ago April 20 and committed  
suicide a half-century ago, but he lives on -- resurrected to 
describe war crimes in faraway Kosovo and to inspire unspeakable 
horrors toward children so close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students became gunmen at a middle-class suburban high  
school near Denver, Colo., killing 15 people and wounding at least 
23 others in one of the worst shooting rampages in recent history. 
Classmates say the boys were part of a group that spoke admiringly 
of Hitler and wore swastikas on their clothing; the carefully 
planned spree was aimed first at minorities and athletes, then at 
any human being in their paths. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The first rash of shootings prompted disbelief that such a thing  
could happen at a school. By Springfield last May, the disbelief 
had narrowed. Once the nation unwillingly absorbed school shootings 
as a freakish reality of modern education, the disbelief was no 
longer that it could happen, but that it might happen often, or 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler is an inappropriate metaphor for nearly any current  
event, no matter how terrible. But one of the lessons of Hitler is 
the frightening ability of humans to accept the terrible as normal. 

</P>
<P>
	April 22  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Lessons from Littleton:  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Trenchcoat Mafia didn't seem any more threatening than  
other teenage cliques that adopt a certain look or attitude, even 
if that attitude was rebellious and antisocial. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's carnage at Columbine High School in Littleton,  
Colo., is a horrifying reminder to school officials everywhere that 
they need to be vigilant when it comes to violence. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton attack, after all, is not an isolated incident.  
Even as violence continues to decrease on school campuses 
nationwide, with 90 percent of schools reporting no serious violent 
crimes, incidents like those in Pearl, Miss.; Paducah, Ky.; 
Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore., seem to signal a terrifying 
and deadly trend. Loners, kids who are teased and ostracized, turn 
to acts of unspeakable violence. Littleton's distinction is that it 
was the most deadly. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's encouraging that many schools and communities aren't  
ignoring the potential for a tragedy in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
	But grants, workshops and programs can only do so much. The  
bottom line is paying attention, and everyone -- parents, volunteers 
who work with youth, teachers, administrators and even other 
students -- needs to have their antennae up. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 26  
</P>
<P>
	Daily Jefferson County Union, Fort Atkinson, Wis., on school  
shootings: 
</P>
<P>
	In the minutes and hours after the first shots were fired in  
Littleton, Colo., the media were scrambling to piece together the 
scenario inside Columbine High School. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In the days that followed, however, the big question has been:  
How can America stop tragedies such as this from happening again? 
And everyone seems to have a different answer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who would have us install metal detectors in our  
schools or require students to wear uniforms so no teen-ager feels 
or can be different and outside the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	There are others who tout stricter gun control, saying that  
curbing firearms' availability is the first step in halting 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	There are people, including some Wisconsin legislators, who  
propose banning minors' purchase of CDs and tapes bearing labels 
that warn of nasty, inciteful and questionable lyrics. ... 
</P>
<P>
	While well-meaning, these are knee-jerk responses to a much  
deeper problem troubling America's children, and turning off TVs, 
banning CDs or transforming schools into prisons will not alone 
prevent another Littleton, Jonesboro or West Paducah from taking 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	We don't claim to be psychologists, but it seems clear that many  
children are not learning two very basic concepts that previous 
generations were taught at home from early on: Respect and 
responsibility. ... 
</P>
<P>
	America has become a nation that treats the symptoms instead of  
the disease. Teaching respect and responsibility early on at home 
might not singlehandedly stave off an epidemic of school violence, 
but it is a very good place to start. 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on Colorado school shooting:  
</P>
<P>
	We here in Oregon mourn for Littleton, having ourselves  
experienced the horror of mass violence at a school not quite a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No words can help families and friends endure the unendurable,  
we know that. But a community that has lived through a traumatic 
crime can offer to another its experience as a guide to what lies 
ahead. Looking back at the rampage at Thurston High School and its 
aftermath, a few simple lessons come to mind that might be of 
benefit to the people of Littleton: 
</P>
<P>
	Pay as much attention to those who were strong and brave as to  
those who committed this awful crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Be prepared to deal with pain and trauma for a long time after  
the national spotlight has shifted elsewhere. Remember that every 
act of support, every word of reassurance, every gift, every prayer 
counts. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton is the center of the world's attention right now and  
desperately wishes it were otherwise. It is being watched 
especially closely by people here in Oregon, and the understanding 
and empathy that we can offer might be more welcome than the stares 
and speculation from other quarters. Perhaps they and we will find 
time to compare notes on how to respond to such awful crimes. If it 
can happen in Springfield, it can happen anywhere. And if it can 
happen in Littleton, it can happen again somewhere else. 

</P>
<P>
	April 25  
</P>
<P>
	The Vicksburg (Miss.) Post, on Colorado school shooting:  
</P>
<P>
	Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris have made a strong case for  
smaller schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The days since the 17-year-old and 18-year-old killed 12  
classmates, a teacher and themselves in a thoroughly planned 
assault on Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., have been 
filled with ample speculation. ``Why?'' and ``how?'' may never be 
known with certainty, and no one can offer assurance their crime 
won't be duplicated, perhaps on a larger scale. There's no one 
cause. There's no one cure. 
</P>
<P>
	Fact has also emerged. For example, the two were described in  
one evaluation as bright young men with ``a great deal of 
potential.'' Neighbors and friends say they perceived the teens 
with middle-class backgrounds as having quiet, ``utterly normal'' 
family lives. No one, it seems, really knew them. Perhaps no one 
could. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another fact: Columbine was a big school. And it  
follows that the larger the school, the easier it is to get 
``lost,'' to escape personal attention from administrators and 
faculty. What principal can know 1,800 names, much less 1,800 
personalities? 
</P>
<P>
	A decades-long trend in American education has been  
consolidation into larger schools. There have been good reasons for 
this. The larger the school, the more diverse course offerings can 
be. And, of course, the larger the schools, the larger the pool 
from which to recruit student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	But as with any change, there are drawbacks. The bigger a  
school, the more intimidated students might feel. The bigger a 
school, the more likely that strong ``identity'' cliques will be 
formed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tough choice -- bigger schools with more equipment, more  
courses, more everything or smaller schools where those things are 
limited. But Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris have shown us it's 
something we need to think about. Clearly they were lost. Clearly 
no one was close enough to pierce their veneer or to see and head 
off their deadly potential.

<P>
	Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram on tax debate:  
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans figure that taxes are like the weather: Everybody  
talks about them, but not much can be done. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's a movement afoot among people who don't buy that  
premise -- people who believe that a more equitable system can be 
devised by altering the current code. Sort of like seeding clouds 
to promote rain during a drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Flat tax, fair tax, graduated tax -- regardless of the plan,  
Americans deserve an easier, less complicated way to pay their fair 
share to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	One look at today's internal revenue tax code makes it glaringly  
obvious that it's time for an earnest debate on changing it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes were first collected to fund those government services  
that the citizens deemed necessary in a democratic republic. But 
somewhere along the line, a wrinkle in the philosophy was added: 
Use the tax system to encourage citizens and businesses to do 
things that the nation's elected leaders thought were good for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Owning a home was a good thing, so tax breaks were given for  
mortgage interest. Giving to churches and charities was a good 
thing, so tax deductions were provided to tithers and donors. ... 
</P>
<P>
	When the first exemption was written into the document, it  
tilled the soil for the weed that is the nation's current tax code. 
It looks like the head of a dandelion -- all 7.5 million words, 
9,000 individual sections and 569 filing forms. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Any revision of the internal revenue code will wither and die if  
exemptions and deductions, no matter how socially worthwhile, make 
their way back into the mix. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 23  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on Vatican and rapes in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has acquired a reputation, recently, of speaking for  
the voiceless. It pleads for the safety of children, the harboring 
of refugees, the feeding of the hungry. But even a wise preacher 
sometimes delivers a dud sermon, and the Vatican has done just that 
in speaking to the suffering of the raped women of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees fleeing that land are bringing stories of  
inconceivable sexual cruelty meted out by Serb forces. Mothers tell 
of watching as groups of young girls were rounded up by soldiers 
and systematically raped by the roadside. Grown women tell of being 
raped in front of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a way to minimize the horror -- to assure that women who  
have been raped in the name of war do not become pregnant. All that 
is necessary is access to the morning-after pill -- a medicine 
which, if taken soon after the rape, can prevent a pregnancy from 
developing. When refugee workers encounter a rape victim, they 
offer the pills as a matter of course. It's a humane gesture -- an 
attempt to avert the most heartbreaking outcome of a soldier's 
savagery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Vatican does not call this gesture humane. Its preferred  
term is murder. It notes that the morning-after pill works not by 
averting fertilization, but by preventing a fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus. In the Vatican's eyes, that makes the 
pill a form of abortion. It vehemently opposes the pill's use in 
refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps this stand is to be expected from a religious  
institution that exhorts women already overburdened with hungry 
children to steer clear of birth control. But it's nevertheless 
surprising to see the Vatican turn such a cold shoulder to the 
suffering of raped Kosovars. Whatever the Vatican may say, the 
morning-after pill isn't an abortion pill; unlike the controversial 
RU-486, it can't end a pregnancy already underway. It's a high-dose 
contraceptive that prevents a pregnancy from being established.

	Sandusky (Ohio) Register, on separatism:  
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Brooksville, Ala., recently petitioned to have  
their community declared a new town, founded on Christian 
principles and beholden only to the laws of the King James version 
of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza mogul Tom Monaghan announced last week his plans to build  
a law school where prospective lawyers would be schooled in the law 
from a Christian perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of these actions seem to be well-meaning attempts by  
God-fearing people to live their faith and bring the word out of 
the pulpit and into their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	What could possibly be wrong with these ideas?  
</P>
<P>
	Separatism for any reason, be it religious or race-based, eats  
away at the foundation of our country. America was founded by 
people who had suffered under a government which was inflexible on 
matters of faith.

</P>
<P>
	Why do such shootings take place so often in U.S. schools? U.S.  
news organizations frequently point the finger at the violent 
images and story lines in video games and computer games. Victims 
of school shootings have filed lawsuits against the manufacturers 
of violent video games and software. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans tend to blame education and violent images in the  
media instead of the easy access to guns, which forms the backdrop 
to those incidents. The problem is the refusal by the United States 
to impose strict controls on gun ownership. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how much President Bill Clinton calls for education  
reform, such tragedies will be repeated at U.S. schools as long as 
guns are easily accessible. ...

<P>
	After a month-long air strikes escalation, observers may draw

</P>
<P>
	The result is, under every respect, a disaster for (Yugoslav  
President Slobodan) Milosevic and his regime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs used all their military potential against Kosovo's  
civil population, but found no counter measures against the NATO's

</P>
<P>
	At this point Milosevic is no longer acceptable as a party at  
the negotiating table. ... 
</P>
<P>
	After a month, it makes no sense anymore to wonder whether or  
not the bombings were necessary, or effective. They have succeeded 
in further weakening the Serbian strategic armament.

in a short time they will run out of ammunitions.

	The NATO summit has ended and leaves us only with unease: the  
feeling that this push forward in the bombardament of Serbia cannot 
be the proper solution. 
</P>
<P>
	What's most important is the fate of the refugees. How can we  
stop the massacres? How can we stop the deportations? What can we 
do to enable 1.5 million Kosovo Albanians to return home in the 
future, and live in peace and freedom? 
</P>
<P>
	Even under the bombs, despite the destruction of homes, despite  
the destruction of factories, despite the blows to his television 
station, Milosevic has kept the initiative. He is free to carry his 
agenda on to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Time is on Milosevic's side, aiding his tactics to destabilize

<P>
	The arrival of 161 Kosovar refugees at Leeds airport is a  
welcome start. But it is still a very long way from the 
government's promise of taking in 10,000 refugees from the Balkan 
conflict. This airlift from Macedonia must be swiftly followed by 
others; whereas Germany has already taken nearly 10,000 refugees, 
Britain's efforts so far have been grossly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's speed in taking in refugees is not just a response to  
its misdeeds in the Second World War. The Germans recognize that 
the Kosovar people have suffered murder, rape, arson and exile, and 
that 600,000 of them are still living in appalling conditions in 
overcrowded camps. Britain and France have been slow to take in 
Kosovars, in part because of specious arguments that sheltering 
refugees furthers the desire of the Yugoslav regime to expel 
Kosovo's Albanian-speaking majority.

<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on President Clinton and Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Having committed the NATO alliance to the botched air campaign  
against Serbia, President Clinton is now behaving as if the war 
will somehow take care of itself. He has conspicuously failed to 
use the ``bully pulpit'' of his office to rally American opinion 
behind the policy, deferring to NATO's secretary-general, Javier 
Solana, or to our own prime minister. His grandiloquent rhetoric 
about a Marshall Plan for the Balkans is no substitute for a 
properly executed strategy to engage the enemy, defeat it and 
impose terms. We are beginning to glimpse the full malign 
consequences of Mr. Clinton's poll-driven, focus-group ``exquisite 
followership.'' This method may have won him two presidential 
elections, but it is a formula for failure in warfare. 

</P>
<P>
	April 27  
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurt, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	By saying that a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis must be  
measured by the swift and safe return of refugees to their 
homeland, U.S. General Secretary Kofi Annan exhausted every means 
of political decision left to him. .... First, the refugees can 
only return and feel secure in their homeland when they no longer 
fear being harassed by Serb police or massacred by paramilitary 
criminal bands. For that, an international protection force that in 
emergency situations can protect itself and the people will be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	That is only possible if Milosevic either fulfills NATO's  
conditions, which he has so far refused, or when his power is 
militarily broken. 
</P>
<P>
	That is probably why Annan cannot approve of the NATO's military  
mission in Yugoslavia; that he does not publicly disapprove of it, 
rather welcomes its goals, speaks for itself. 

</P>
<P>
	April 23  
</P>
<P>
	Expressen, Stockholm, on foreign ownership of Swedish companies:  
</P>
<P>
	The debate about foreign ownership is taking place in most every  
developed industrial nation. ... In 1990 about 200,000 Swedes were 
employed in foreign-owned companies in Sweden. Last year the number 
rose to 350,000, according to the Association of Industries' 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, foreign investment is something we should  
welcome with open arms. Sweden, as a European Union member, cannot 
try to close its borders to foreign capital. And if Sweden were not 
in the EU, every such attempt would only lead to a massive outflow 
of capital and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not to say that every deal is necessarily good for  
shareowners or Sweden in the long run. ... (But) Sweden as a nation 
has lived well on multinational companies that have travelled 
around the world and shopped for other companies. That foreign 
companies shop in Sweden can also -- as the government depends -- 
depend on our having a relatively good business climate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens Veto of Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration has threatened a veto of  
Senate legislation that would curb lawsuits arising out of Year 
2000 computer problems, contending the measure would make it easier 
for defendants to avoid their legal responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto warning further endangered a bill already rewritten  
many times. Proponents contend only federal action can stop an 
economically calamitous wave of Y2K litigation while critics 
believe the bill would undermine basic legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill on the Senate floor this week, sponsored by Sens. John  
McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would give businesses 90 
days to fix computer problems before suits could be filed, 
encourage mediation and cap punitive damage awards in some lawsuits 
at $250,000. It also discourages class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, said it ``strongly opposes''  
the bill because it would ``decrease the incentives organizations 
have to be ready and assist customers'' in assuring their computers 
are Y2K-compliant. Without changes, it said, the attorney general 
would recommend a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration objects to capping punitive damages and  
language limiting plaintiff liability to their proportional share 
of damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Proportional liability is sought by businesses who say lawyers  
go after companies with deep pockets regardless of their 
involvement in a legal problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said the administration was ``simply off base'' in its  
criticisms. He noted that the bill only would apply to Y2K issues 
and expire after three years, and that it had been modified so that 
there would be no punitive damage caps when a business or 
individual acts in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCain-Wyden bill was also under attack on at least three  
other legislative fronts to avert what many experts say could be up 
to $1 trillion in litigation resulting from breakdowns from 
computers that misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd., D-Conn., one of the Senate's leaders on  
the issue, has proposed a substitute that would limit punitive 
damage caps to individuals and small businesses, remove all 
liability caps on business directors and officers and retain state 
laws on the degree to which a defendant must prove the plaintiff 
acted willfully in injuring them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Charles Robb, D-Va., would remove  
consumers from the equation. They would make the bill apply only to 
commercial contracts, and take out all provisions capping punitive 
damage awards. The administration said it supported this version. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Wyden also had to beat back an effort by Sen. Edward  
Kennedy, D-Mass., to use the Y2K issue as a vehicle to bring the 
minimum wage debate to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem could arise when computers that use only two  
digits to read dates mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, 
resulting in computer systems putting out wrong information or 
breaking down.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Plans Flights From 5 Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Pan American Airlines Inc., once an  
industry giant but now a small charter service, plans to begin 
scheduled flights from Portsmouth and four other cities in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning June 8, Pan Am will offer one flight a day from Pease  
International Tradeport here to Orlando, Fla., continuing to San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, said Hal East, a regional manager of sales and 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am also will begin service the same day from Orlando,  
Philadelphia, San Juan and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, East said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an international airline, Pan Am filed for bankruptcy  
protection in 1991. A group of investors bought the Pan Am name and 
tried to revive the airline as a discount carrier, but were forced 
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline was bought last June by Guilford Transportation  
Industries Inc., a regional freight rail company. Pan Am's seven 
planes are based at Pease and have only flown charters to date. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am hopes to add two more scheduled flights out of Pease by  
year's end, possibly to Atlanta and Philadelphia, East said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Probe Netscape Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Microsoft have arranged to  
interview executives involved in America Online's nearly $10 
billion purchase of Netscape after a judge questioned whether the 
deal might affect the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara was scheduled to question  
Peter Currie, Netscape's chief administrative officer, today. 
Currie also is Netscape's former chief financial officer and helped 
put together the company's sale to AOL, which was finalized last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a highly unusual twist, reporters were to be allowed to  
attend at least part of Currie's interview at a hotel in downtown 
Washington because of an obscure 1913 law covering antitrust 
depositions, which are normally conducted in private. Lawyers can 
close the room when issues turn to confidential business plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be asked to leave the room a lot,'' predicted Richard  
Gray, a San Jose antitrust lawyer who is following the trial. 
Reporters ``will spend as much time in the hallway as you will in 
the deposition room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1913 law also forced the disclosure of transcripts from more  
than 90 depositions already taken in preparation for the trial. 
Most of those, including three days of interviews with Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates, were expected to be released publicly later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson previously decided  
to allow Microsoft -- in the middle of its antitrust trial -- to 
begin gathering evidence about the implications of AOL's stunning 
$9.9 billion purchase of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, with nearly 17 million subscribers, is the world's largest  
Internet provider. Netscape produces successful Web browsing 
software and owns Netcenter, one of the most popular sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the sale was announced last November, the judge  
suggested that there ``might be a very significant change in the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally wields its influence as the manufacturer of the 
dominant Windows operating system, which is used to run most of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, government lawyers contend that Microsoft forces  
consumers who buy Windows also to use its bundled Internet 
software, discouraging people from using rival Web software, such 
as Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the Justice Department's arguments in the courtroom have  
focused on AOL's decision in March 1996 to distribute Microsoft's 
browser, not Netscape's, to its millions of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	But with AOL's purchase of Netscape, Microsoft executives --  
including Gates -- expect AOL eventually to distribute Netscape's 
browser, giving it a dramatic boost. AOL is contractually obligated 
to continue distributing Microsoft's browser until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Another deposition was set for Friday in San Francisco, where  
Microsoft was expected to question Mike Popov, vice president and 
chief operating officer at Sun Microsystems Inc. It also will be 
open to the public and media. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the AOL-Netscape deal, Sun will distribute Netscape's  
business-level ``server'' software in exchange for AOL's purchase 
of Sun's powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Microsoft planned to question AOL Chairman Steve Case  
and Barry Schuler, president of AOL's interactive services 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the government and Microsoft also next week must disclose  
the names of their final, rebuttal witnesses. Daniel Wall, an 
antitrust lawyer in San Francisco who has been following the 
Microsoft trial, said he anticipates the government will call at 
least one executive connected to the AOL-Netscape purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is currently in a lengthy recess and not expected to  
resume before the middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> Archer Offers Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to revive prospects for a Social  
Security overhaul this year, a prominent Republican lawmaker is 
promoting a plan to use earnings from individual stock market 
accounts to help finance future retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are meeting the president halfway and putting our plan on  
the table,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, pledged in a statement to  
``take a close look'' at Archer's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republican leaders have told the party's rank-and-file  
that trying to move a GOP Social Security initiative through 
Congress before the 2000 presidential campaign would be too risky 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he will seek negotiations with the White House in  
pursuit of a bipartisan compromise based on his plan, rather than 
trying to push legislation through his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal Archer developed with Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and  
unveiled Wednesday would give American workers a tax credit equal 
to 2 percent of their wages up to the limit of earnings taxed by 
Social Security. That limit is $72,600 this year, so the largest 
possible credit if the plan were in effect for 1999 would be 
$1,452. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would go into individual ``Social Security Guarantee''  
accounts that workers could invest with private investment firms 
offering what would essentially be government-approved mutual funds 
comprised of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Once workers retired, their accounts would go toward buying an  
annuity plan to help pay their Social Security benefits. For people 
whose accounts run short, the government would make up the money 
needed to give them retirement benefits equal to what Social 
Security promises now. Those whose accounts earned extra could keep 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the accounts would come from Social Security payroll  
taxes now collected in excess of what's needed to pay benefits to 
current retirees. With the huge baby boom generation in middle age 
and still working, those Social Security surpluses are expected to 
accumulate for about 15 more years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Archer aides said that once baby boomers begin  
retiring, some additional money may be needed to finance the 
accounts during a transition period -- something that could clash 
with GOP desires to offer broad income tax cuts in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton told Archer in a telephone  
conversation Tuesday evening that he prefers his own approach to 
reforming the nation's retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan includes having the government handle bulk  
investment of some Social Security cash reserves in the stock 
market, as well as new government-subsidized personal retirement 
accounts for low- and middle-income workers that would be in 
addition to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton said he would examine the Archer-Shaw  
alternative and consult with congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president said was ... he appreciated that chairman  
Archer was putting forward a serious proposal ... and that if we 
had criticisms of it that they would be done in a constructive 
manner,'' said Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Democrats quickly called a news conference to  
question both Archer's intentions and the soundness of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rhetoric, and in a close look, it's a risky scheme,''  
said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.

<HEADLINE> Court Reviews Disability Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices discussed airline  
pilots' eyesight, football player Doug Flutie's height, 
large-chested women and some justices' own poor vision today in 
debating the scope of a federal ban on discrimination against the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue: Does the law protect people whose conditions can be  
corrected with medication or a device such as eyeglasses? 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the court considered whether the Americans With  
Disabilities Act's protections extend to two nearsighted women who 
unsuccessfully applied to be pilots for United Air Lines and an 
Oregon truck driver who is almost blind in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Aaron Hughes, the lawyer representing the two would-be  
pilots, argued that Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton were qualified 
to become pilots but were rejected because of United's 
``preconceived notion'' about nearsighted people. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices questioned what conditions qualify as a  
disability warranting protection against job bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have difficulty reading restaurant checks in dim light,''  
Justice David H. Souter said. Justice Antonin Scalia added, ``I 
could not read without wearing glasses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United's lawyer, Roy T. Englert Jr., raised the example of  
Flutie, who was regarded by some as too short to be a National 
Football League quarterback and played for years in Canada. Flutie 
would not be considered impaired by his height, and even if no NFL 
team would hire him, he still could be a coach, Englert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler, arguing in support  
of the two women, said United tried to have it both ways by saying 
they were not disabled because their vision could be corrected, but 
refusing to hire them because of their poor vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia expressed concern about interpreting the law broadly to  
cover everyone with poor eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Stephen G. Breyer worried that some people with  
disabilities such as those needing artificial limbs or deaf people 
with hearing aids, could be left out if their disabilities were 
viewed only in its corrected state. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked whether someone would  
be considered disabled who had an artificial leg but was able to 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employer says, you know, `I just don't want to take a  
chance with you.' Is he regarding that person as disabled?'' the 
chief justice asked. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the justices heard arguments over a Kansas man who  
was fired from his mechanic's job because of high blood pressure. 
Lower courts refused to let him sue under the disability law 
because his blood pressure was treatable with medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Rulings on all three cases are expected by July.  
</P>
<P>
	The ADA, enacted in 1990, is best known for requiring  
handicap-access ramps in public buildings. It bars employers from 
discriminating against a ``qualified individual with a disability'' 
because of that disability. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualified person is defined as one who can perform a job when  
given reasonable accommodation, and a disability is a condition 
that substantially limits a major life activity. The ADA also 
protects people who are ``regarded as'' having a disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline case was filed by Sutton and Hinton, twin sisters  
who want to be pilots for United but were turned down because of 
their extreme nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	They contend their poor vision should be considered a disability  
protected against employment bias. But lower courts ruled Sutton 
and Hinton were not protected by the ADA because their 
nearsightedness is fully correctable with glasses or contact 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The second case argued today was brought to the court by  
Albertson's supermarkets, which fired truck driver Hallie 
Kirkingburg after he failed a test to meet Transportation 
Department vision standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg performed well on a road test although he is almost  
blind in one eye. He sued Albertson's, saying it discriminated 
against him by refusing to let him go back to work after he got a 
waiver from the DOT standard. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court said Kirkingburg must be given a chance  
to prove his claim in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In his case, too, the court seemed to have little luck in  
reaching a comfortable definition of ``disabled'' or ``qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This statute wasn't meant to apply to all Americans,'' said  
Scalia, but not before Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether 
``Hooters'' restaurants could be sued for discriminating against 
some women because of physical characteristics if they hired as 
waitresses only women with a 40 bra size. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's argument, some justices expressed confusion  
over whether the ADA protects people whose health condition can be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Stephen R. McAllister asked the justices to let Kansas  
mechanic Vaughn Murphy sue United Parcel Service for firing him 
because of his high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS' attorney, William J. Kilberg, said Murphy was not protected  
by the law because ``as a result of his medication, he does not 
suffer limitations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cases being argued today were Sutton vs. United Air Lines,  
97-1943, and Albertson's vs. Kirkingburg, 98-591.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Virus Proves Destructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If only the world had learned more from Melissa.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the world's latest computer headache, a virus called  
Chernobyl, took advantage of hundreds of thousands of computers 
left vulnerable despite the lessons learned from Melissa, the 
e-mail scourge that struck last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 10,000 out of 50 million computers in the United  
States were hit Monday by the virus timed to coincide with the 13th 
anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, said Roger Thompson 
of the International Computer Security Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But overseas, especially in Asia and the Middle East, the virus  
erased hard drives and prevented scores of computers from 
operating. Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers 
damaged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the most destructive virus that's ever been  
reported,'' Thompson said Tuesday. ``And it could have been a lot 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to have originated in Taiwan and attacks  
Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers. A company unknowingly 
distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet. 
When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other 
files on their hard drive. If an infected program was sent in an 
e-mail, the virus was passed on to the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a number of variants of the Chernobyl virus, with some  
designed to trigger every month on the 26th while others trigger 
annually on April 26, according to the Software Engineering 
Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernobyl had been known to be lurking since last summer, and  
the major antivirus software programs were able to protect against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Melissa virus last month served as a ``very effective  
wake-up call'' in the United States, where many corporations 
updated their software to guard against infection, said Dan 
Schrader of Trend Micro Inc., an antivirus manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elsewhere it wasn't taken as seriously,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The countries hardest hit were those with a large amount of  
pirated software and comparatively little use of the latest 
antivirus programming, Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, at least 10,000 computer owners reported being  
infected. Businesses, banks and publishing houses in India were 
shut down and information worth millions of dollars was lost, the 
Indian Express newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that up to 10 percent of all computer users  
in the United Arab Emirates were affected; at least 10,000 
computers were struck in Bangladesh; reports in China varied from 
7,600 computers damaged to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this  
virus,'' said Ahn Byung-yop, vice minister of information and 
communications in South Korea. ``We need to strengthen our alert 
system and public education on computer viruses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, students and home computer users who  
hadn't installed antivirus software were hit the hardest. About 100 
Princeton students said their computers were wiped out just two 
weeks before term papers were due. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives  
were rendered useless,'' said Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred computers at Virginia Tech also were struck,  
destroying some hard drives, said Mike Moyer, a programmer in 
Tech's computer center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be much more vehement about pushing the  
antivirus software this fall,'' Moyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Tuesday afternoon, Bill Pollak of the Computer Emergency  
Response Team at Carnegie Mellon said 2,328 computers were reported 
damaged in the United States. Because there is no reporting 
requirement, the actual number could be higher.

<HEADLINE>  Mistrial Demanded in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Defense attorneys demanded a mistrial  
today, midway through opening arguments in the obstruction of 
justice trial of a Marine pilot whose jet killed 20 people on an 
Italian ski lift. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,  
objected to what they said was a prosecutor's suggestion that 
Ashby's silence about a videotape he is accused of destroying is 
evidence of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has set up Captain Ashby's right to remain  
silent as though it were an obstruction of justice,'' said civilian 
attorney Frank Spinner. ``This is basic ... law school teaching 
that you can't comment on an individual's basic rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, recessed the trial pending his  
ruling on the motion this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby failed to tell authorities about the videotape, which was  
shot minutes before his jet severed a ski lift cable in the Italian 
Alps, and he invoked his right to silence before an Italian 
magistrate, the prosecutor, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, said in her 
opening statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce said Ashby deliberately concealed evidence when he  
replaced the videotape with a blank tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to make his own judgment of that videotape,'' she  
said. ``He knew that after that flight the tape would be nitpicked 
by investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fellow prosecutor, Maj. Daniel Daugherty, suggested the judge  
instruct jurors to disregard Joyce's comment instead of declaring a 
mistrial, but he also apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never an intent to convict Captain Ashby because he  
exercised his constitutional right, which we are sworn to defend,'' 
Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of both obstruction of justice and conspiracy,  
Ashby could be dismissed from the Marines or sentenced to up to 10 
years in prison. Last month, he was acquitted of involuntary 
manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted he gave the videotape to his navigator, Capt.  
Joseph Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Before opening statements began today, the judge gave  
prosecutors the option of granting immunity to Schweitzer for his 
testimony in Ashby's trial. Schweitzer already has pleaded guilty 
to the same charges Ashby now faces. Keller also ruled Schweitzer 
may invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking immunity, he said he didn't want his testimony to  
result in further charges against him. There is a chance his guilty 
plea and sentence of dismissal from the Marines could be overturned 
on appeal, said his attorney, Maj. Eric Veit. The sentence isn't 
yet final. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., testified he used the video  
camera three times during the flight through the Alps but wasn't 
sure that he ever recorded images because he didn't know how to use 
it. The camera belonged to Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he threw the tape into a fire because he feared  
a frame on it of his smiling face might be used to vilify him and 
the rest of the crew in the Italian media.

<HEADLINE> Artists Sell Music on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When they heard about new technology that allows  
computer users to download music for free over the Internet, 
members of the up-and-coming punk rock band Less Than Jake posted 
every piece of music they had recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	Album cuts, rarities, some things they did just for fun -- it was  
all up for grabs. The band had a simple philosophy in its drive to 
be rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more people that hear your music, the more people are  
going to come to see you play, the bigger the band will be,'' 
explained Vinnie, their drummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Their record company, Capitol Records, didn't notice until this  
winter, two years after the music first became available. Mortified 
that Less Than Jake was giving away what the company was trying to 
sell, Capitol executives demanded that the music be taken off-line. 
</P>
<P>
	The band complied, unwilling to risk a legal battle.  
</P>
<P>
	This is a sign of things to come, though. The music industry is  
terrified by the implications of Internet distribution of music and 
how fast events are overtaking efforts to control it. The on-line 
revolution could rewrite the rules of a business that hasn't always 
been friendly to its artists, a handful of whom are testing the 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America is hurriedly  
trying to develop standards for selling music on-line through the 
MP3 format and for curbing piracy. The industry wants them in place 
by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, it may be too late.  
</P>
<P>
	MP3 is the technical abbreviation for a method of compressing  
audio files into digital formats. It allows users to download songs 
from the Internet and store them on their computer. They can be 
played over the computer or through a Walkman-like piece of 
equipment that sells for around $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Its use has rapidly moved beyond computer geeks to the  
mainstream. There are an estimated 150,000 servers where music can 
be downloaded, according to The MP3 Impact, an industry newsletter. 
As many as 20 million people worldwide have downloaded music, the 
newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a choice,'' said drummer Vinnie, who uses only his  
first name. ``You can ignore it and not survive or you can embrace 
it and succeed. You have to embrace technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy is another musician who  
has embraced it, partly because he noticed how his 10-year-old 
daughter learned about many of her musical favorites through the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall he began posting remixed versions of Public Enemy hits  
for fans to download. He saw it as a form of advertising; give the 
fans a taste of your music and they'll be more inclined to buy it. 
His record company disagreed and ordered him to take them down. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring he announced a partnership with the music company  
Atomic Pop to distribute Public Enemy's first album in five years. 
``There's a Poison Goin' On'' can be ordered through the Web for 
$10 or downloaded for a price not yet determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a technical nerd, I'm in the entertainment business,''  
Chuck D said. ``The business I'm in -- hip-hop -- is always running 
parallel to the technology. You have to be ahead of the curve 
instead of sitting on the curb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rock band L7 is conducting its own experiment, licensing two  
songs, ``Freeway'' and ``Mantra Down,'' to Atomic Pop to sell for 
99 cents apiece. L7's Donita Sparks is excited about the 
possibilities the technology offers to musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could record something in your living room and put it out  
that night,'' Sparks said. ``It's very exciting. It's a 
revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also likes L7's financial deal with Atomic Pop to split the  
proceeds 50-50. In a conventional record company deal, an artist is 
lucky to get 12 percent of the royalties, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such terms would make for a dramatic shift in the industry's  
balance of power. Musicians such as Ani DiFranco and The Artist 
Formerly Known as Prince have preached the benefits of maintaining 
control of their work and selling it outside the industry 
structure. The Internet could help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very difficult to live by the old rules,'' Chuck D  
said. ``I believe that contracts should be broken in half. I'm 
looking for more artists to have joint ventures with labels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Teller, former head of the MCA and CBS music labels and  
founder of Atomic Pop, said many artists have inquired about 
Internet distribution because they distrust the music business and 
feel that traditional record companies do little to nurture their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, Teller said, the Internet ``is very much an empowering  
mechanism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of the Internet say it will democratize music by enabling  
artists who can't get traditional record deals to find an audience. 
Musicians seeking shared CD distribution can point to MP3 activity 
as proof that people are interested in what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Most musicians now sell new albums, with about 15 songs each,  
for around $15. New discs come out every couple of years. But 
technology could soon change everything, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An artist could release songs one at a time every couple of  
weeks. An album could have five songs or 50. Some artists are even 
making dozens of songs available and encouraging fans to compile 
their own albums. 
</P>
<P>
	And the prices? How much downloaded material, if any, should be  
free? The questions and solutions are boundless. 
</P>
<P>
	The Artist was one of the first to aggressively market his music  
through the Internet. His box set, ``Crystal Ball,'' sold 250,000 
copies, mostly through orders placed via his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved getting suggestions from fans on the Internet for songs  
to put on ``Crystal Ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have direct interaction with the people who have supported  
you all this time,'' he said in an interview. ``I never knew who 
they were unless they came to the gigs. I get to meet these people, 
in a disembodied way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he's also an Internet hard-liner, having filed a lawsuit  
against Web sites that he accuses of allowing people to download 
his music through MP3 without his authorization. He said MP3 
pirates threaten his livelihood. The lawsuit is pending in the U.S. 
Federal Court for the Southern District in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3 also interferes with a musician's vision, he said. He  
doesn't want a fan putting together a homemade album. He wants to 
do that himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grateful Dead, which used to set aside a section at its  
concerts where fans could tape the shows, has threatened legal 
action against people offering downloads of the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to figure out how to stop piracy,'' said L7's  
Sparks. ``Until they do that, I don't think a lot of musicians are 
going to want to get involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might be easier to stop a flood with a two-inch rubber plug.  
MP3 has made it easy for fans to distribute music to friends and 
strangers, and it fits nicely with the all-access ethos of the Web. 
Surfing the Internet, Vinnie found seven sites where virtually all 
of Less Than Jake's music was available for free. So shutting down 
the band's site probably didn't help much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the legitimate marketplace is playing  
catch-up somewhat to the pirate marketplace,'' said Hillary Rosen, 
president of the RIAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she's convinced that the technology will be harnessed for  
a legitimate market. The next 18 months will see a lot of 
experimenting to determine how consumers prefer to get music, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts envision the same fearful industry reaction now as  
when home taping became possible, or even when radio was invented. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are asserting control, said Siddiq Bello, publisher of  
The MP3 Impact. Instead of fighting it, musicians should embrace 
it, just as they encourage radio stations to play their songs, 
Bello said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It resonates with the aspirations of an artist,'' Bello said.  
``They want to be heard. Anything that extends that ability and 
allows them to reach their fans directly, to make their music more 
real for their fans, they should enjoy it. Philosophically, it's an 
extension of what they'd be doing anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Must Inform EU of Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union asserted  
jurisdiction Wednesday over Coca-Cola Co.'s proposed $1.75 billion 
acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes PLC's beverage brands outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said failure to  
notify the 15-nation EU of its plans could result in ``heavy 
penalties'' for the Atlanta-based soft drink maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, antitrust regulators in Belgium prohibited  
Coca-Cola's proposed acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes beverage 
brands for the Belgian market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coca-Cola deal with Cadbury-Schweppes covers beverage brands  
sold in 120 countries outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has claimed it doesn't need to notify the EU executive  
commission about the deal because the acquisition falls below a 
minimum threshold set by the EU for review of such deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under EU rules, an EU antitrust probe must take place if the  
combined worldwide sales of companies involved in a merger exceed 
$5.3 billion. Van Miert said that was the case with Coca Cola if 
the sales of the bottlers are included in the calculation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coca Cola was ``trying to get round the rules by saying  
bottlers should be excluded. But we think we need to look at the 
overall situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Coke refuses, we won't hesitate to launch the procedure for  
fines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies expressed surprise, saying in a joint  
statement that they ``have cooperated fully'' with the commission 
and were preparing to respond to a recent invitation to submit 
comments on the jurisdiction issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two companies are therefore disappointed that Commissioner  
van Miert has made these statements,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Sells Sunglass Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc., maker of premium  
Ray-Ban sunglasses since the 1920s, is selling its sunglass 
business for $640 million to Italy's Luxottica Group SpA, owner of 
the LensCrafters retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb has been refocusing in recent years on eye care --  
contact lenses, ophthalmic drugs, eye surgery instruments -- and 
appears ready to shed a hearing-aid unit and other noncore 
businesses by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bausch &AMP; Lomb controls around 40 percent of the world's  
premium fashion eyewear business, notably brands like Revo, Killer 
Loop and Arnette priced above $30, the sunglass unit has struggled 
of late to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of dominance in the eyewear industry, competition  
intensified in the early 1990s and rivals like Oakley Inc. of 
Irvine, Calif., gained with contemporary styles aimed at young 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale of the sunglass unit was announced Wednesday,  
Bausch &AMP; Lomb stock initially surged by more than 4 percent, or 
$3.25 a share, before staging a retreat. It closed down $1 at $78 a 
share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, subject to various regulatory approvals, was expected  
to close by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxottica makes eyeglass frames in the medium and premium-priced  
categories with brand names like Giorgio Armani, Brooks Brothers, 
Vogue and Anne Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the sunglass unit's 2,400 employees work in  
the United States, most of them in Texas, California and New York. 
There are no plans to move the jobs to Agordo, Italy, where 
Luxottica is based, said Bausch &AMP; Lomb spokeswoman Barbara Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the sunglass sale will be used to pay down debt in  
the short term but also to make acquisitions and other investments 
in our the core eye-care business, chief executive William 
Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Bausch &AMP; Lomb's $680 buyout of Storz Instrument Co. and  
Chiron Vision Care catapulted it ahead of Texas-based Alcon 
Laboratories as the world's largest eye-care company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is now seeking to sell or spin off the Miracle Aid  
hearing-aid business it bought in 1993 and an animal-research 
subsidiary in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the company hired an investment firm to advise it on  
options for the sunglass business. Those included a sale, a 
spinoff, or forming a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ray-Ban line was first developed in the 1920s to help U.S.  
Army Air Corps pilots cope with glare. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 and 1997, more than 1,200 employees were laid off when  
Bausch &AMP; Lomb closed sunglass plants in Oakland, Md., Bloomfield, 
Colo., and Rochester, N.Y. Bausch &AMP; Lomb currently employs about 
15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Duval Returns To Play Houston Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- The rest of the field in the $2.5  
million Shell Houston Open aren't counting on David Duval being 
rusty after a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time golf's leading money-winner and No. 1 ranked  
player took some R&AMP;R, he came back and won the first two 
tournaments he entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval started defense today of his Shell Houston Open title  
after spending part of his vacation snowboarding in Idaho. It's too 
early for his other passion -- fly fishing -- so it's back to golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went snowboarding until they shut down the slopes, wore out  
a spot on my chair at home and went to a clinic at Pebble Beach. 
There is two weeks gone,'' said Duval, looking rested and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval didn't spend much time with his clubs while vacationing,  
but hopes the practice rounds he took this week have him ready to 
go for his fifth victory of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the 1999 schedule with victories in the Mercedes  
Championships and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost in the second round of the Match Play  
Championship, Duval took three weeks off and returned to win The 
Players Championship and BellSouth Classic in consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for sixth in the Masters before the succumbing to the  
urge for more snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivers are too high (for fishing) until at least July, so  
I guess I have to play golf,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	To win last year's tournament over the par-72, 7,018-yard TPC  
course, Duval had to come from five shots down with eight holes to 
play to win by one shot over Jeff Maggert. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert, who won the WGC-Andersen Championships and ranks No. 2  
on the money list behind Duval, is back for another run. Others in 
the field include Vijay Singh, Justin Leonard, Payne Stewart and 
Steve Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval doesn't quite comprehend his star appeal, even though he's  
zoomed to the top of the money list, won 11 of his last 35 
tournaments and unseated Tiger Woods as the No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being No. 1 symbolizes that I've played well, but the ranking  
doesn't help me play any better,'' Duval said. ``All it means is 
when you pick up that magazine, my name is at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly hasn't changed Duval's humble approach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, I'm just not the type to hoot about being No. 1,  
that's not me,'' he said. ``I have noticed that it changes the way 
people look at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Duval's personal life has been documented since his rise  
to stardom. His 12-year-old brother Brent died after receiving bone 
marrow from Duval, who was 9 years old at the time. Other family 
difficulties have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I don't understand the fascination with me,'' Duval  
said. ``I don't think it (personal life) is something that is 
relevant to what I do out here on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't bring it up because someone might look at me and think  
I was looking for sympathy. There might be people in this room who 
have gone through a lot more than I have. They might say they've 
really had it rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval plans to play the Compaq Classic in New Orleans next week,  
skip the GTE Byron Nelson Classic (May 13-16) and enter the 
MasterCard Colonial (May 20-23).

<HEADLINE> Clemens Hamstrung in Bid for Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens thinks there are more  
important things to worry about than breaking records. One such 
thing is his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination Wednesday determined that Clemens' hamstring is  
strained. He first hurt it while jogging on a cold morning April 
11, but it wasn't a problem until Clemens aggravated it in the 
second inning of Tuesday night's game against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who has never had a hamstring problem, said he hopes to  
make his next scheduled start Sunday at Kansas City, but he's not 
sure whether he'll be able to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was listed as day-to-day. He'll be re-evaluated daily.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's something going on,'' Clemens said as he prepared for  
ice treatments. ``I've never been this tight. ... If it feels good, 
I'll give it a shot. I'm pretty sure I didn't tear it, so that's 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said the leg didn't hurt while Texas scored five runs in  
the first inning. He said the pain came after running to first base 
while recording the second out of the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't return for the third, leaving with the Yankees down  
5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	New York rallied to win 7-6, capping the comeback with two runs  
in the ninth off closer John Wetteland. Clemens wound up with a 
no-decision, preserving his AL record-tying streak of 17 
consecutive winning decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens wore a protective sleeve on his left thigh while warming  
up in the bullpen Tuesday. He took it off before the game because 
it ended up around his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens refused to blame the injury for a rocky outing in which  
he allowed five runs on four hits and two walks with no strikeouts. 
His ERA shot to 5.47. 
</P>
<P>
	``I landed a couple of times gingerly ... but it didn't affect  
me. I could deal with it,'' Clemens said. ``Once I got to first 
base, I knew I had taken it a little further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the runs came in the first seven batters. Clemens retired  
the next five, but he went to full counts on three of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-to-last out was the menace: a grounder by Mark  
McLemore that first baseman Tino Martinez stopped and threw to 
Clemens for the out. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Yankees batted in the third, Clemens realized it was time  
to call it a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go out and continue, but I think I probably would  
have made it worse,'' said Clemens, who had bought tickets for 50 
family and friends to watch his first attempt at the streak record. 
``It was in my best interest not to return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens hung around and cheered the comeback. He said he wasn't  
even thinking about the fact the victory preserved his shot at 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying, `Way to go, guys, great win,''' said Clemens,  
who hasn't lost since last May 29. ``I really don't even worry 
about the streak. There's more things to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second time in three starts Clemens was hit hard.  
On April 15, Baltimore took a 4-0 lead and was ahead 7-6 when 
Clemens left after three innings. New York bailed him out then by 
winning 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens also had a rocky first inning last Thursday against the  
Rangers, but he ended up giving up only two runs in seven innings. 
He closed that outing by retiring the last 14 batters. 
</P>
<P>
	That victory tied the AL record for consecutive winning  
decisions set by Cleveland's Johnny Allen in 1936-37 and matched by 
Baltimore's Dave McNally in 1968-69. The major league record is 24 
by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants from 1936-37.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration opened the way  
Wednesday for the sale of food and medical items to three countries 
listed as terrorist states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- arguing that 
economic sanctions often do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales of food, medicine and other humanitarian necessities do  
not generally enhance a nation's military capacity or support 
terrorism,'' Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told 
reporters. ``On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural 
commodities and products are not available for other, less 
desirable uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose in applying sanctions is to influence the behavior  
of regimes, not to deny people their basic humanitarian needs,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring such sales usually fails to hurt targeted regimes while  
depriving American companies of export opportunities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy is part of a broader attempt at comprehensive  
sanctions reform. The goal is to resort to unilateral sanctions 
only after all other options, including diplomacy and multilateral 
sanctions, have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changed approach, humanitarian items will be exempted  
from future sanctions. Wednesday's announcement will not affect 
Iraq, North Korea and Cuba, all sanctioned countries to which sales 
of certain items are already permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the changed policy  
meant a pending Iranian request for more than $500 million worth of 
American grain and sugar will be approved. A number of farm state 
senators and House members have been seeking approval of the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., welcomed the policy shift, saying in  
a telephone interview that the administration has, in effect, been 
telling farmers, ``'You pay the cost of our foreign policy.''' He 
added: ``Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein have never missed a meal 
because of our sanctions policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that large grain stocks have led to depressed prices.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a strong advocate of sanctions reform,  
also was supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that food and medicine should be used as a  
tool of foreign policy,'' said Lugar, the Senate Agriculture 
Committee chairman. ``Doing so typically injures innocent civilians 
in the sanctioned country, imposes little hardship on recalcitrant 
leaders whose behavior we wish to change and opens the door for 
other exporting countries to replace the U.S. as a food supplier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government experts predict the policy change could increase  
wheat and corn exports by 1 million tons, said Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the new policy is not directed at any particular  
country. Among the countries subject to curbs on food and medicine, 
only Iran has been a target of a U.S. effort for improved 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has called for resumption of an official  
dialogue with Iran but thus far has been rebuffed. Iran was one of 
America's most important allies in the Middle East until the 
pro-American monarchy was toppled two decades ago and replaced by a 
regime led largely by Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Cuba, Eizenstat noted that sales of medicine and medical  
supplies are allowed with certain limitations under legislation 
approved in 1992, and the regulated sales of food, pesticides and 
related items were permitted under a policy shift announced in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Iraq is subject to unilateral U.S. sanctions as well  
as U.N.-mandated sanctions, it has been authorized to sell oil on 
the international market so long as the proceeds are earmarked for 
purchases of humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, despite unilateral sanctions against North Korea,  
the administration approved the donation of tens of thousands of 
tons of food assistance to that country in recent years through the 
U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
offered conditional support for the policy. Marc Thiessen, a Helms 
spokesman, said: ``Every dollar Iran or Sudan or Libya wants to 
spend on American grain instead of on terrorism or weapons of mass 
destruction is fine with us.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Can Process Backward Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Humans' ability to understand speech is so deeply ingrained that  
people can even decipher sentences that have been recorded, chopped 
up into brief segments and played backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers sliced digitally recorded sentences into very short  
segments, reversed each snippet while leaving it in its proper 
place in the sentence, then played the distorted speech to seven 
test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants had no problem understanding the sentences.  
Their brains were apparently able to perceive the syllables as 
sounding nearly the same whether heard backwards or forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you distort speech, it distorts certain aspects, but  
other parameters are still able to convey the message,'' said 
Kourosh Saberi, a researcher at the California Institute of 
Technology's division of biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberi and David R. Perrott of California State University in  
Los Angeles' department of psychology, reported their findings in 
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Kent, a professor of communicative disorders at the  
University of Wisconsin in Madison, said the research demonstrates 
that many areas of the brain are used to handle complicated 
auditory signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are both hemispheres of the brain involved in speech  
processing, but eyesight plays a significant role by allowing 
people to unconsciously lip read to fill in missing data, Kent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has gone to a party held in a crowded room filled  
with music and chattering people has tapped those skills to 
understand what others are saying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this tells us is that speech is quite robust. We can  
perceive it even when a number of things have been done to distort 
or muddy the signal,'' Kent said. ``Somehow the information is 
preserved or at least recoverable to us even when it's played 
backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Greenberg, a researcher at the International Computer  
Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said the findings could 
someday lead to improved speech-recognition programs that allow 
computers to respond to spoken commands. 
</P>
<P>
	It also adds to a growing body of evidence disputing the notion  
that individual vowels and consonants are crucial to understanding 
the spoken word, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kodak Betting on Premium Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eastman Kodak stands ready to wage any war on  
price with Fuji, but the photography giant is betting on premium 
products with premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still basking in the afterglow of a strong profit report earlier  
this month, Kodak officials said Tuesday they hope to extend that 
financial rebound with innovations such as a new paper that makes 
photographs five times more durable. 
</P>
<P>
	A roll of film developed on the new paper, called DuraLife, will  
cost $2 more than pictures printed on existing Kodak paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to preserving memories, many consumers are  
willing to pay more, officials said, noting that nearly half of 
last year's volume of film sales came from premium-priced Max film 
and Advantix digital film. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Kodak plans to pursue the digital end of the market  
aggressively, hopefully driving new demand with enhanced services 
such as photo CDs and Internet-delivery of pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strategy has been to create more value for our consumers,  
to push products that truly differentiate Kodak,'' said chief 
executive George Fisher, standing by forecasts for annual growth of 
10 percent or better in earnings-per-share. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a better-than 25 percent rebound in Kodak's share price  
since the start of April, when the stock nearly fell below $60, 
Fisher complained that Wall Street still undervalues the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Kodak shares are still a great bargain,'' Fisher  
said, noting the company's aggressive strategy for repurchasing 
shares in the market. ``The grid extends beyond $100 per share, 
where we are still buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak has been trading recently in the $77 range, roughly 13  
percent below the peak of $88.93 3/4 set nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Looming behind the renewed optimism, however, is the  
ever-present threat of continued price wars with Japanese rival 
Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people in the industry understand that we're serious  
about not losing market share,'' said Kodak president Dan Carp. 
``Our last resort will be to deal with competition through pricing, 
but we will deal with pricing if we have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carp also emphasized that in addition focusing on innovation,  
the company ``can't take the eye off the cost ball,'' even 
two-thirds of the way through a work force reduction that's slated 
to eliminate about 20,000 jobs by year-end.

<HEADLINE> Execs Convicted of Trade Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A federal jury on Wednesday convicted  
two Taiwanese executives of paying a researcher at Avery Dennison 
Corp. to hand over adhesives industry trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the first to reach trial under the 1996 Economic  
Espionage Act, which banned the theft of trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Yen Yang, 72, president of Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd.,  
and his daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, 40, were each found 
guilty of two counts of economic espionage. The jury also found 
Four Pillars guilty of the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs and their company were acquitted on a mail fraud  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the Yangs received secrets about adhesives used  
in products such as self-stick postage stamps, name labels, diaper 
tape and battery labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys immediately filed for a mistrial, arguing that  
federal prosecutors did not prove their case. U.S. District Court 
Judge Peter Economus did not immediately rule on the motion and did 
not say when he would make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. No  
sentencing date was set. The company will be fined according to how 
much Economus determines Avery Dennison lost because of the spying. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yangs were arrested in 1997, the FBI estimated the  
company lost as much as $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Neal, Avery Dennison's president and chief executive,  
released a statement saying he was ``extremely pleased'' with the 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Four Pillars had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan-based Four Pillars is an adhesives maker that competes  
with Avery Dennison, based in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Yang and his daughter paid about $160,000 over  
eight years to Avery Dennison researcher Ten Hong ``Victor'' Lee, 
who worked at a laboratory east of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwanese native, testified he struck a deal to pass  
information to the Yangs while on a trip to his homeland in 1989. 
Lee said he worked with the Yangs until 1997, when he was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded guilty to wire fraud and began cooperating with the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors' case hinged on a secretly record FBI videotape  
showing a September 1997 meeting between the Yangs and Lee, in 
which Sally Yang cuts the ``confidential'' stamp off an Avery 
Dennison report. Pin Yen Yang then instructs Lee to dispose of the 
clipping. 
</P>
<P>
	But in closing arguments, defense attorneys said Avery Dennison  
indiscriminately marked documents as confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs originally were charged with 21 counts each but  
Economus dismissed 18 of them before the jury began deliberating. 
The jury worked for three days before delivering a verdict.

<HEADLINE> Missing Mother Found in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A mother who disappeared after her two  
young children were found dead in a creek last week was picked up 
by police in a Corpus Christi apartment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Marie Cornelius, 22, was taken in for questioning, although  
she has not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were investigating a claim by a man who said Ms.  
Cornelius told him a day before the bodies were found that their 
father had taken the children and that they had died by falling off 
a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is alive and well,'' said Texas Department of Public  
Safety Officer Mike Cox. ``She has no apparent injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Ms. Cornelius' children, 3-year-old Amanda Lee  
Miller and 2-year-old Dominick Logan Cornelius, were found April 19 
in six inches of water in Brushy Creek near Hutto, about 20 miles 
north of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda died of suffocation and her brother died from a cracked  
skull. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had since searched for the mother, saying they  
feared she might have met with foul play. Police said then that the 
mother was not considered a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were last seen April 14 when Ms. Cornelius -- who  
worked as a topless dancer -- picked them up from day care, 
according to police. They were found five days later, but police do 
not believe they had been there long.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Head Leaves Internet Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials claimed victory Wednesday  
in round one of their battle with business over future Internet 
taxes when a corporate executive stepped down from a panel created 
by Congress to examine the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Netscape Communications chief James Barksdale to  
resign from the panel allowed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., to appoint another local official and restore the 
private-public balance originally envisioned by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a solid victory for counties and local government,''  
said Betty Lou Ward, president of the National Association of 
Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lott's move, the National Association of Counties and U.S.  
Conference of Mayors agreed to drop a federal lawsuit that has 
prevented the 19-member panel from meeting. It was supposed to 
begin work in December and now will tentatively hold its first 
meeting June 22 in Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce was created last  
year when Congress passed a three-year moratorium on new Internet 
taxes. The panel's purpose is to recommend by next year the 
international, federal, state and local tax policy for fast-growing 
online commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contended the original appointments by congressional  
leaders violated the law by naming too few people from state and 
local governments -- and one too many from business. That imbalance, 
state and local officials said, could have skewed the panel's 
recommendations in favor of business and hurt legitimate tax 
interests of their governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott replaced Barksdale with Delna Jones, a county commissioner  
in Washington County, Ore., who is also a former Oregon state 
legislator. She spent 30 years with U.S. West Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Barksdale agreed to step aside, Lott said in a statement,  
because ``the issues surrounding the Internet are too important to 
let the commission's business be delayed any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor was Netscape's recent acquisition by America  
Online, and AOL President Robert Pittman is already on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia's Republican Gov. James Gilmore is expected to become  
chairman of the commission, which also includes top executives from 
AT&AMP;T, MCI and Gateway, as well as Washington's Democratic Gov. Gary 
Locke, Dallas' Democratic Mayor Ron Kirk and Utah's Republican Gov. 
Mike Leavitt.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-five years have passed, so Andy Partridge  
finally feels comfortable confessing. 
</P>
<P>
	During his teen-age days in England, the singer for the rock  
band XTC used to scatter David Bowie and Iggy Pop records around 
his room when his friends came over to visit. He had an image to 
protect, and Bowie and Iggy made him look cool. 
</P>
<P>
	What his buddies never realized was that before they came over,  
Partridge would be listening to his dad's old albums of Herb Alpert 
and the Tijuana Brass. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the story can be told.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get older and more comfortable with yourself and you say,  
'Sure, I like a lot of the music that my parents liked,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a telling admission since Partridge and his partner, Colin  
Moulding, have emerged from a seven-year exile with an album his 
dad could probably appreciate. ``Apple Venus, Volume I'' leaves the 
traditional instruments of rock 'n' roll behind for a sound 
Partridge describes as ``orchustic'' -- orchestral and acoustic. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination is heralded by the plucked violin strings and  
dissonant horns that form an extended intro to the album. It's not 
easy listening music, however. Dedicated followers will see the 
parallels with XTC's artsy, tuneful rock that's made songs like 
``Dear God'' and ``Senses Working Overtime'' cult favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some XTC fans will think of this stuff as possibly a  
jump too far,'' Partridge said. ``If they fall off, I'd rather like 
that if they can't handle it, if they're not tough enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person who has already abandoned ship is Dave Gregory, XTC's  
guitarist for 20 years. His departure, partly because he didn't 
want to play this kind of music, just added to XTC's catalogue of 
woes during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven years, XTC refused to record until they were released  
from their record contract. Partridge also suffered through a 
divorce during the time on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	XTC believed it was on the wrong side of a one-sided deal with  
its record label, hardly unusual in the music business. Partridge 
and Moulding sought either a better contract or a release from 
Virgin Records, and got neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the individuals that we are, we just refused to address  
the situation because we're just not money-minded,'' Moulding said. 
``...I think we tried to resist putting that side of it right for 
so long and in the end we just confronted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They effectively went on strike, since any music they made as  
XTC would be owned by Virgin. It was a depressing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't feel sat upon after all those years and the  
future looking so bleak?'' Moulding said. ``But you just sort of 
hang on. You write some songs and you nurse them, thinking, `One 
day I'll get to record these.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Partridge, who writes about three-quarters of XTC's songs, was  
more manic. Wondering if his music would ever be heard again just 
drove him to write more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose your car keys and you look for them, you can't  
find them,'' he said. ``If you don't look for them, you'll find 
them. I was sort of backed into not looking for any songs because 
we couldn't record them or release them, and suddenly loads of them 
came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing was also cathartic for Partridge as his marriage  
crumbled. He resisted releasing these songs, fearing they'd sound 
pathetic. But two made it onto the new album: the profanely bitter 
``Your Dictionary'' and ``I Can't Own Her,'' which reflects on the 
fragile state of relationships after he met someone new. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually a settlement with Virgin allowed XTC to sign with two  
independent labels, including TVT Records in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of silence, suddenly there's a flood of XTC  
material. The band says it's a way of thanking fans for their 
patience. ``Apple Venus, Volume 2,'' an electric rock 'n' roll 
record, will come out later this year. ``Transistor Blast'' is a 
box set consisting of live recordings from XTC's early days. XTC 
has not performed public concerts since the early 1980s because of 
Partridge's stage fright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our early stuff is kind of naive and funny,'' Partridge said.  
``When we heard all the tapes I laughed my socks off. I thought it 
was so saucy, this young band, trying to pull this stuff off. It's 
like someone who can't paint trying to do a painting. The 
perspectives are all wrong, the colors are all wrong, the blurry 
stuff is in the foreground, but you can enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	XTC wanted to release its stockpile of new material roughly in  
the order in which it was written. That meant finishing the 
orchestral material first, and dealing with a disgruntled Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory didn't want to hire an orchestra, believing it was too  
expensive, and resented not being able to play electric guitar. 
Partridge and Moulding tried to persuade him to hang on, since XTC 
wasn't abandoning rock, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was willing himself out of the band,'' Partridge said. ``I  
think he never felt part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the problems, Partridge said he and Moulding never  
considered pulling the plug on XTC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``The more we couldn't work, the more  
we wanted to do it. It's sort of the backwards principle of if you 
deny something to someone, they'll want it even more.''

<HEADLINE> Sega To Post Losses, Cut Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Computer game maker Sega expects to post a loss of  
45 billion yen, or $378 million, for the fiscal year that ended 
March 31 and plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or about a quarter of 
its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also makes arcade games, said Wednesday it  
will slash fixed costs by 30 percent, and close 101 amusement 
facilities in Japan as part of a restructuring aimed at shoring up 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega, which had previously forecast a net profit of 1.6 billion  
yen, cited difficulties in its United States, United Kingdom and 
Australian operations as reasons for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its sales would be about 266 billion yen, or  
$2.23 billion, down 19.8 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Sega's loss projection, U.S. credit rating agency  
Moody's Investors Services said it had placed Sega's long-term debt 
rating under review for a possible downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, the company  
lost 35.6 billion yen on sales of 331.6 billion yen.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin D Said Important for Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Many post-menopausal women are still unaware of  
the importance of vitamin D in preventing bone fractures, 
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin D helps the body use calcium to maintain strong bones,  
but public health messages promoting calcium may have obscured 
vitamin D's importance, said Dr. Meryl LeBoff, lead author and 
director of the skeletal health and osteoporosis program at Brigham 
and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Loading up on calcium without adequate vitamin D could still  
leave bones at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers compared 30 women with hip fractures admitted to  
the hospital between 1995 and 1998 with 68 similar women who did 
not have fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin D levels were significantly lower, on average, in the  
women with broken hips than in the other women, the researchers 
found. Half of the broken-hip group had vitamin D deficiencies, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Common sources of vitamin D include eggs and fortified milk and  
cereal. The body also produces it as a result of exposure to 
sunlight.

<HEADLINE> Nissan To Reduce Size of Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. will slash the number of its board  
members to 10 from 37 as part of efforts to overhaul its management 
structure and speed up decision-making, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 board members will include three executives from France's  
Renault SA, which is taking a 37 percent capital stake in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshifumi Tsuji will step down step as Nissan chairman and  
become an adviser. The changes are expected to be approved at a 
shareholders meeting in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa announced earlier this month  
that the board would probably be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	And Nissan's truck-making subsidiary, Nissan Diesel Motor Co.,  
said it will slash the number of its board members to 7 from 14 as 
part of an overhaul of its management structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Dassas, currently corporate finance director at Renault  
SA, will become a part-time director at Nissan Diesel, the 
truck-maker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dassas' appointment follows Renault's decision in March to take  
a 22.5 percent stake in Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to be approved at Nissan Diesel's  
shareholders meeting in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Renault agreed to pay $5.4 billion for a 36.8  
percent stake in Nissan. Nissan hopes to use the cash infusion to 
help pay off its massive debt load.

<HEADLINE> Mark Leiter Denies Punching Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Mark Leiter of the Seattle Mariners denies  
accusations by a woman who contends he punched her and put out a 
cigarette on her arm during their affair that ended nearly two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know this woman,'' Leiter said before Tuesday night's  
game against Detroit. ``It's unfortunate she filed this lawsuit. 
There's no truth to the allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila O'Connell of Arizona is seeking $6 million for physical  
and emotional pain, according to the suit filed in U.S. District 
Court in Chicago, where O'Connell used to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, now divorced, referred questions to his agent, Alan  
Nero. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old right-hander is the brother of New York Mets  
pitcher Al Leiter. Mark Leiter was acquired by the Mariners in an 
offseason trade with Philadelphia but was sidelined by injuries 
until Tuesday, when he was taken off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	He had shoulder tendinitis during spring training and then hurt  
himself throwing on a bunt play while in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter has a 63-72 career record with a 4.60 ERA. He's also  
played for the New York Yankees, Detroit, California, San 
Francisco, Montreal and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Leiter and his then-wife established the Ryan  
Leiter Fund in honor of their infant son who died in 1994 of a rare 
disease called spinal muscular atrophy, or Werdnig-Hoffmann 
disease. It is similar to Lou Gehrig's disease, but afflicts 
infants instead of adults.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada in Beef Hormone Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- As the deadline to halt another transatlantic  
trade dispute grows ever nearer, the United States, Canada and the 
European Union set out their positions on hormone-treated beef 
Wednesday. Meanwhile, European officials threatened to ban U.S. 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade representatives fear the dispute will escalate like the  
battle over banana imports, which resulted in the United States 
imposing 100 percent tariffs on selected EU imports after the two 
trading giants failed to reach agreement at the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed to see that once again the EU is failing  
to meet its WTO obligations,'' U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes 
said at Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has ruled that the European Union is acting illegally in  
banning imports of beef treated with certain hormones from 
countries including the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU claims the hormones could cause cancer, a claim denied by  
the other countries. The WTO gave the Europeans until May 13 to 
comply with its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the complaining nations say the EU should now lift the  
ban, the Europeans have embarked on more scientific study in an 
attempt to show that they are justified in banning the beef. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent widening of the divide, the European Commission  
on Wednesday received the go-ahead to ban all imports of American 
beef as of June 15. The group cited inspections between May and 
November 1998 that showed residue of hormones in U.S. beef that had 
been shipped to Western Europe as supposedly hormone-free beef. 
</P>
<P>
	EU trade ambassador Roderick Abbott said at the meeting that a  
risk analysis undertaken by the Europeans might not be complete by 
the May deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said that wasn't good enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the United States and Canada have produced provisional  
lists of items on which they intend to slap 100 percent tariffs if 
the EU fails to meet the deadline and the two sides are unable to 
agree on temporary compensation.

<HEADLINE> K.C. Wizards Hire Former U.S. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bob Gansler, coach of the 1990 U.S.  
World Cup team, was hired today as coach of the winless Kansas City 
Wizards of Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler succeeds interim coach Ken Fogarty, who took over when  
Ron Newman resigned April 14. Kansas City was 0-4 under Newman and 
0-2 under Fogarty, who will coach today's game while Gansler 
observes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler takes over a team that won the MLS Western Conference in  
1997 but fell to last in 1998. The Wizards had scored only two 
goals this season heading into today's home game against the 
Columbus Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler, a 57-year-old native Hungarian, grew up in Milwaukee.  
He made 25 appearances for the Olympic and U.S. national team in 
1968-69 and was captain of the U.S. Olympic teams in 1964 and 1968. 
He led the U.S. team to a 14-16-6 record from 1989 to 1991 and also 
coached the national team for one game, a win, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team went 0-3 in Rome at the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, he coached the Milwaukee Rampage of the A-League,  
a second-division professional league. The Rampage won the 1997 
title, but Gansler was dismissed after the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also has coached the U.S. under-20 national team, the  
World University team, the U.S. under-19 national team and the 
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Meola, the Wizards' injured goalkeeper, started all three  
World Cup games for Gansler in 1990. Kansas City midfielder Chris 
Henderson was on the roster but did not play.

<HEADLINE> Site Helps With Travel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dissatisfied airline passengers have a Web site  
that lets them complain directly to airlines and the U.S. 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, http://www.passengerrights.com, forwards the complaints to  
airline e-mail addresses not available to the general public and 
follows up on the complaints with faxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints can also be sent to cruise ship companies, car rental  
agencies, hotels, resorts and tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
	The site includes details on travelers' rights, information  
about proposed legislation to protect travelers and a section for 
airline employees to anonymously report wrongdoing in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Warren, who set up the site, said it received about 100  
complaints the first day it was active. It debuted last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 6,000 airline service complaints were made last year  
to the DOT. But Warren told USA Today that that number is not 
representative of travelers' dissatisfaction ``because so few 
people know how to go about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, US Airways spokesman Rick Weintraub told the newspaper  
that the airline's consumer affairs number is listed in the 
in-flight magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren's site suggests electronic complaints may be simpler. It  
promises to forward e-mail to ``the people who make the decisions, 
have the authority to make changes and most importantly, to solve 
your problem.''

<HEADLINE> Sony Reports Drop in Net Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Buffeted by recession at home and abroad, Sony  
Corp. said today that its net income plunged nearly 20 percent in 
the last fiscal year and forecast an even steeper drop this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese electronics giant said consolidated net income for  
the year ending March 31 was $1.5 billion, down 19.4 percent from 
$1.9 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company painted an even grimmer picture for the current  
year, forecasting that consolidated net income will plunge 39 
percent to $922.8 million by March 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year just ended, sales and operating revenue gained 0.6  
percent, from $56.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in 1998 to 
$57 billion in the year just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement, Sony blamed its slumping income on the  
sluggish economies of Asia, Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in income came mostly in the second half of the year,  
when the yen rapidly appreciated against the U.S. dollar, Sony 
said. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent volatility of the yen exchange rate has made it more  
difficult to manage global procurement of materials, manufacturing 
and sales activities as planned,'' Sony said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter was particularly bad for Sony, with cuts in  
sales in the company's electronics, music and video game 
businesses. Profit margins suffered from slashed production. 
</P>
<P>
	By segment, electronics sales slipped 0.5 percent; games sales  
were up 8.5 percent; music sales soared 9.4 percent; and sales in 
the motion pictures and television shows section plummeted 16 
percent. The strengthening yen, however, increased production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	For this year, Sony said economic problems will make recovery in  
sales in Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe unlikely. The 
game business is also expected to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also forecast a 4 percent drop in consolidated sales  
and operating revenue to $54.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sour announcement follows a report from Sony Music  
Entertainment Inc. on Tuesday that it posted its first parent 
operating loss since 1969 in the fiscal year ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a subsidiary of Sony Corp. set up in 1968, blamed  
the $2.9 million loss on a decline in revenues, higher costs of 
sales and a large increase in promotion expenses.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Park-Ranger Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TILLAMOOK, Ore. (AP) -- A man accused of robbing two unarmed park  
rangers, marching them into the forest and shooting them, killing 
one, has been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers Danny Blumenthal and John Kerwin were inspecting a  
bathroom Tuesday at Oswald West State Park, about 65 miles west of 
Portland, when they encountered Larry G. Cole inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, 52, told the rangers he was tired of sleeping on the  
ground and wanted their truck, according to Candace Nelson, a 
neighbor of Kerwin's who talked to the ranger about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	He demanded their keys and wallets, which they gave him, then  
forced the rangers to walk across the highway and up a steep, 
wooded path about a quarter mile. He tried to tie them to a tree, 
but apparently frustrated in his efforts, pointed a pistol at their 
heads and opened fire, police charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal, 50, was killed. Kerwin, 51, lay motionless on the  
ground, feigning death, despite the gunshots to his jaw. When the 
gunman left, he made his way to the highway and flagged down help. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Cole fled the oceanside park in the ranger truck. He  
was arrested about an hour later.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Drug Treatments Can Be Trimmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Patients with HIV whose immune systems respond  
well to combination treatments can stop taking pills to ward off a 
form of pneumonia that was once a major killer of people with AIDS, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The antibiotic protects against Pneumocystis carinii and some  
other infections that are especially common among people with 
AIDS-weakened immune systems. Ten years ago, the Public Health 
Service recommended that those with low blood counts resulting from 
HIV take the pills for life. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, however, a triple combination of protease  
inhibitors and other AIDS drugs has subdued the disease for many, 
and doctors have wondered whether these patients can safely stop 
taking the pneumocystis protection. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in today's New England Journal of Medicine found that  
many AIDS patients can do this. Dr. Hansjakob Furrer and others 
from Bern Hospital in Switzerland followed 262 patients who stopped 
taking the medicine, which is called Bactrim and is known 
generically as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 
</P>
<P>
	On triple therapy, these patients' CD4 white blood cells, a  
primary target of HIV, had rebounded to at least 200 copies per 
cubic millimeter for three months or longer. After stopping 
Bactrim, none got pneumocystis pneumonia during 11 months of 
follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Henry Masur of the National  
Institutes of Health and Jonathan Kaplan of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention noted that Bactrim treatment is simple and 
cheap. It requires just one 21-cent pill a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, they said stopping treatment can be  
psychologically important for patients because it shows that their 
immune systems are improving.

<HEADLINE> IRS Finds File Snooping Despite Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inspectors identified 15 instances of  
unauthorized file snooping by Internal Revenue Service employees in 
the first year after Congress made such actions criminal, according 
to a General Accounting Office report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all 15 instances, the employees involved either resigned or  
were fired, said the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. One 
case is the subject of an prosecution under the law that makes IRS 
employees liable for $100,000 fines and a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress enacted the anti-snooping law in 1997 after the GAO  
reported that only 23 IRS workers had been fired in fiscal years 
1994 and 1995 even though 1,515 cases of unauthorized tax file 
browsing had been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., the law's sponsor, said the latest  
GAO study shows the law is having an effect. But he said Congress 
needs to pass additional legislation to require quicker 
notification by the IRS to taxpayers whose files have been accessed 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 15 cases cited by the GAO, the taxpayers involved were  
notified only in the one instance in which the U.S. attorney agreed 
to prosecute, as required under the new law. Coverdell said 
taxpayers should be notified as soon as a case is referred for 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said IRS inspectors using electronic auditing tools  
identified 5,468 instances of potential file snooping by employees 
between Oct. 1, 1997 and Nov. 30, 1998. Preliminary investigations 
of 4,392 of those cases turned up 338 that merited further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the more than 4,000 cases where no further investigation was  
merited, the IRS determined there was no unauthorized access. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said it looked at 36 completed cases among the 338 that  
were targeted for additional investigation. In 15 of them, the IRS 
found that employees had intentionally looked at taxpayer files 
without authorization. In the other 21, the IRS found that the 
access either was authorized or accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	In five of the six cases where taxpayer files were accessed  
accidentally, the GAO said the employees involved notified their 
superiors when the incident happened. In the other instance, the 
superior was not notified and the employee was reprimanded.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin D Said Important for Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Many post-menopausal women are still unaware of  
the importance of vitamin D in preventing bone fractures, 
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin D helps the body use calcium to maintain strong bones,  
but public health messages promoting calcium may have obscured 
vitamin D's importance, said Dr. Meryl LeBoff, lead author and 
director of the skeletal health and osteoporosis program at Brigham 
and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Loading up on calcium without adequate vitamin D could still  
leave bones at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers compared 30 women with hip fractures admitted to  
the hospital between 1995 and 1998 with 68 similar women who did 
not have fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin D levels were significantly lower, on average, in the  
women with broken hips than in the other women, the researchers 
found. Half of the broken-hip group had vitamin D deficiencies, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Common sources of vitamin D include eggs and fortified milk and  
cereal. The body also produces it as a result of exposure to 
sunlight.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Drops Puck in Edmonton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton's favorite adopted son -- Wayne  
Gretzky -- returned to the scene of his greatest triumphs Tuesday 
and was greeted by more than 17,000 screaming, towel-waving Oilers 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cups with the Oilers in the 1980s,  
dropped the ceremonial first puck prior to the start of the 
Dallas-Edmonton playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first return to Skyreach Centre since he tearfully  
retired from the NHL earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like home for me,'' Gretzky said in a television  
interview during the game. ``I had a lot of great years here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance was kept a secret until he walked to center ice  
to a thunderous standing ovation. Players from both teams pounded 
their sticks on the ice in tribute to No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and gold tie, Gretzky  
dropped the puck between Oilers captain Kelly Buchberger and the 
Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	He waved to the crowd as they chanted ``Gretzky, Gretzky!''  
Dallas stars Mike Modano and Brett Hull came over to shake his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then with a final wave, Gretzky walked off. He was on ice for  
all of two minutes. The standing ovation followed him back through 
the tunnel but the man who has always said he doesn't want to be 
bigger than the game didn't return for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of great memories with some great teams and some  
nice championships but, more importantly, I have a lot of friends 
here and it's nice to come back to Edmonton,'' Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was invited to the game by Oilers general manager Glen  
Sather, whom Gretzky cited as one of the key influences on his life 
when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glen came all the way to New York for my last game and he  
said: `You know, you've got to come to Edmonton for a game.' ...I 
promised I'd come up for a game and I'm happy to be here.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Police Chase Ends in Gunfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Police chased carjackers along busy streets and  
then opened fire, killing two suspects. A third suspect was 
wounded, as was a police officer and a carjacking victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The chase started Tuesday when officers homed in on a signal  
from an antitheft device in a stolen car, said Miami-Dade County 
police spokesman Ed Munn. 
</P>
<P>
	That car crashed and the three people inside grabbed a second  
car, abducting two passengers, Munn said. After that vehicle went 
out of control and struck a fence, the driver plowed into a police 
car and tried to run over officers, Munn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several officers opened fire, killing two suspects and wounding  
a third in one arm. The suspects never fired a shot because they 
had left their guns in the first car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded suspect, Sabrina Hoffman, 26, was charged with two  
counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded carjacking victim was in critical condition  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Booksellers Meet To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the eve of its annual national convention, the bookselling  
business has never seemed more like a business. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 12 months, the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG  
completed its purchase of Random House, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. 
announced it would buy the world's largest wholesaler, the Ingram 
Book Group, and Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble announced a joint 
investment in the on-line seller barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as big business gets bigger, smaller business simply  
disappears. Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the 
American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less 
than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a few parties, and some California sun, will make it all  
go away. Booksellers, publishers, agents and authors are gathering 
at the Los Angeles Convention Center for this year's BookExpo 
America. The three-day exhibition and trade show, which starts 
Friday, ends May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The book business has never been more difficult nor more  
uncertain than it is now,'' said Richard Howorth, ABA president and 
owner of Square Books in Oxford, Miss. ``While it's still a 
wonderful occupation, it's awfully scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at  
Barnes &AMP; Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were 
made at independent stores. In 1991, independents received 32.5 
percent of sales and chains 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all  
transactions by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	BEA won't turn that around, but for a few days it gives  
independent sellers a chance to meet, commiserate and plan. One 
proposed change is to reduce the ABA's board of directors, from 20 
to nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to make the board more responsive, more nimble  
and able to react quickly,'' said Howorth, ``because everything is 
changing so fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods,  
independents are fighting back any way they can. The ABA is suing 
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders for antitrust violations and is among 
those opposing the proposed Ingram sale, which the Federal Trade 
Commission is reviewing. The booksellers association is also 
creating its own on-line selling site, BookSense.com, scheduled to 
be ready by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all being done out of necessity. You can't just sit  
around and be a guy in the shop and think life is going to go on 
the way it's been,'' Howorth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers face a problem directly related to the convention:  
introducing their fall books, their main reason for coming to 
BookExpo. Because of scheduling conflicts at the Convention Center, 
this year's meeting will take place a month earlier than usual. Not 
everyone is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, we haven't seen enough of our manuscripts to really  
feel comfortable,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing 
for Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. ``We're cataloguing books we're not 
even sure are going to be ready on schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But once in Los Angeles, there will be plenty of time for  
promotions, parties and seminars. And, at least around meal times, 
the industry will pause and let the writers talk. Featured speakers 
include Nobelist Elie Wiesel, Pulitzer Prize winners Frank McCourt 
and Jorie Graham, as well as Robert Stone, Ward Just, David 
Guterson and Nikki Giovanni. Salman Rushdie, on his first 
full-fledged book tour since being sentenced to death 10 years ago 
by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is expected to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rushdie is likely the only writer who will draw as big a  
crowd as the weekend's most quotable ``author,'' Bill Murray, the 
undoubtedly proud papa of ``A Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those looking forward to seeing the merry Murray bear-hugging  
the sad-eyed Wiesel will be disappointed. Murray will not share the 
dais with Wiesel or any Pulitzer winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his fellow breakfast speakers will include Frances  
Mayes, a California-based poet who writes about Italy, and a 
celebrity whom Dan Aykroyd, Murray's ``Saturday Night Live'' 
co-star, once parodied so well, Julia Child. 
</P>
<P>
	Bon appetit.

<HEADLINE> Reported Mir Deal Not Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's main space agency is skeptical about an  
alleged deal in which a British businessman has reportedly agreed 
to pay $100 million to fly on the Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's space industry has been desperately trying to find  
private funding for the 13-year-old orbiting space station, or else 
the station will probably have to be abandoned around August. 
</P>
<P>
	The RKK Energia corporation, which runs the Mir, claimed Tuesday  
that businessman Peter Llewelyn had agreed to invest at least $100 
million to finance the Mir's operations. In return, he would get to 
fly to the Mir for one week in August, according to Energia 
spokesman Sergei Gromov. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tel Aviv, Llewelyn said Tuesday he was not paying to go on  
Mir. He claimed his trip would be part of a fund-raising effort for 
a 2,000-bed children's hospital he plans to build in Karalauf, 25 
miles outside of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report is totally incorrect,'' he told The Associated  
Press. ``The shuttle is going up to pick up astronauts and I'm just 
hitching a ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to sponsor me so much money per mile in  
space,'' he said. ``The money raised will be used for the hospital 
and nothing else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Llewelyn said two years ago his son was born with a heart  
problem. ``A surgeon saved my son's life. I made a promise that I 
would build a hospital,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Gorbunov, a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, said  
the Energia announcement was premature because the deal was far 
from final. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us will be very happy if they find an enthusiast eager  
to finance the Mir, but I think it's too early yet to celebrate,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gromov noted that several previous negotiations with other  
would-be financiers had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if Llewelyn even had the money. Two years ago,  
Llewelyn faced five counts of theft for allegedly swindling $38,000 
from a business partner in Pittsburgh, Pa. He paid the money back 
and the case was dropped.

<HEADLINE>  House Heads for Showdown on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Congress is ready to double  
President Clinton's request for $6 billion to help pay for the 
conflict with Yugoslavia, but a showdown looms on the House floor 
over his authority to widen the military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to meet at the White House today with lawmakers  
from committees that deal with defense and military spending to 
discuss costs of the escalating battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a measure backed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and other Republican leaders to require Clinton to receive 
congressional approval before deploying ground forces in Yugoslavia 
awaits a floor vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the only thing that is likely to pass,'' said House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other proposals, one demanding withdrawal of U.S. troops  
from the region, the other for a declaration of war against 
Yugoslavia, were expected to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration opposes the Republican advance-approval  
measure as an unnecessary restriction, even though it has said it 
does not plan to dispatch ground troops. The ground option is being 
reviewed by NATO's military commanders, however, and the United 
States is sending more troops and equipment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans readied legislation Tuesday that  
would double Clinton's $6.05 billion request to pay for the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee planned a vote Thursday on a  
$12.9 billion package for the fighting, refugees and worldwide 
Pentagon needs, including a 4.4 percent pay raise for troops. 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was 
drafting a similar measure totaling nearly $12 billion that his 
panel might vote on next week.

<HEADLINE>  House Heads for Showdown on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Congress is ready to double  
President Clinton's request for $6 billion to help pay for the 
conflict with Yugoslavia, but a showdown looms on the House floor 
over his authority to widen the military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to meet at the White House today with lawmakers  
from committees that deal with defense and military spending to 
discuss costs of the escalating battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a measure backed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and other Republican leaders to require Clinton to receive 
congressional approval before deploying ground forces in Yugoslavia 
awaits a floor vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the only thing that is likely to pass,'' said House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other proposals, one demanding withdrawal of U.S. troops  
from the region, the other for a declaration of war against 
Yugoslavia, were expected to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration opposes the Republican advance-approval  
measure as an unnecessary restriction, even though it has said it 
does not plan to dispatch ground troops. The ground option is being 
reviewed by NATO's military commanders, however, and the United 
States is sending more troops and equipment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans readied legislation Tuesday that  
would double Clinton's $6.05 billion request to pay for the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee planned a vote Thursday on a  
$12.9 billion package for the fighting, refugees and worldwide 
Pentagon needs, including a 4.4 percent pay raise for troops. 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was 
drafting a similar measure totaling nearly $12 billion that his 
panel might vote on next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday it will call 33,102 reservists to  
active military duty, beginning immediately with 2,116 members of 
the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard to help in aerial

<HEADLINE> School Security Business Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Garrett Metal Detectors is awash in new orders  
as principals and teachers across the country try to shake feelings 
of vulnerability in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to schools have grown from almost nothing four years ago  
into the largest share of the company's business -- surpassing 
orders for airports, prisons and courts, said Jim Dobrei, vice 
president of marketing for Garrett, the nation's largest maker of 
metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools now account for up to one-quarter of the Garland,  
Texas-based company's sales, Dobrei said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept expecting it to slow down,'' he said. ``Now I'm  
convinced it's not going to slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metal detectors -- which range from about $150 for a hand-held  
detector to $2,500 for the walk-through variety -- are only one of 
many safety devices schools are buying to try to protect staff and 
students. In interview after interview, experts said the school 
safety industry, which scarcely existed a few years ago, has become 
a major part of the $38 billion U.S. security business. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the attack on Columbine High, demand was growing, as  
weapons and gangs spread to suburban and rural schools, and down to 
junior high and elementary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been doing school safety training for 15 years, and  
Littleton, Colo., has elevated school safety and concern to an 
entirely new level,'' said Ronald Stephens, executive director of 
the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident not only involved, in essence, a conspiracy  
among assailants, not only high-powered weapons and semiautomatic 
weapons, it also introduced a new factor: explosive devices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the explosions are echoing through school halls nationwide.  
The Bibb County School District, which includes Macon, Ga., is 
applying for grant money to buy two bomb-sniffing dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, the Clark County schools are considering  
installing night-vision cameras for campus parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan schools are sampling software similar to that used by  
the Department of Defense to find weak spots in security. RiskWatch 
Inc. in Annapolis, Md., developed a version for schools that asks 
350 questions, weighs security priorities and evaluates the most 
cost-effective solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, school fatalities have been declining since 1992. Even  
with the 15 deaths last week in Colorado, this school year's total 
of 24 homicides and suicides is well below last year's 43 -- when 
the shootings at Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, 
Ore., pushed the numbers higher. 
</P>
<P>
	What is on the rise are the numbers of spectacular,  
multiple-victim attacks that seize the headlines. And safety 
experts say no preparations could have totally deterred determined 
killers like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the massacre, Columbine High held a staff crisis  
training session as part of the school district's effort to update 
its security. The updated report was due at the end of the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to spend previous dollars on safety devices is a  
tough one for school districts that need new textbooks, more 
teachers and better computers. And superintendents strive to 
provide protection without imposing a rigid, confining environment 
that interferes with learning. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dorn, chief of the Bibb County Board of Education Campus  
Police, says the investments in security are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	With an annual police budget of about $2.5 million, roughly 2  
percent of the district's budget, he runs one of the nation's most 
extensive safety programs. Bibb County's five high schools, five 
middle schools and 30 elementary schools are secured by 27 armed 
police, five community officers, one crime analyst, metal 
detectors, surveillance cameras and a gun-sniffing dog. 
</P>
<P>
	At 7 a.m., when buses pull up to the schools, officers board  
buses randomly for weapons checks. Surprise inspections are also 
carried out in classrooms and lockers. The officers additionally 
watch school grounds from unmarked cars and occasionally search 
campus perimeters for buried weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The results: with less than two months to run in this school  
year, the district has recorded two weapons violations, compared to 
18 a decade ago when it began strengthening security. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Dorn says, ``We know, no matter what we do, weapons will  
still come on campus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of urban and suburban schools last May by Security  
Magazine, almost three-quarters of respondents said they had 
security officers and one-third of them are armed. About 55 percent 
have closed-circuit televisions trained on corridors, exterior 
doors and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ogg, marketing director for Sentry Technology Corp., has  
recently been fielding about 50 calls a week from schools looking 
for closed-circuit TVs, up from about 10 calls a week this time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentry, based in Hauppauge, N.Y., started marketing to schools a  
year ago. Today, schools account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the 
company's $30 million in annual sales, and Ogg expects the school 
business to double this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed-circuit cameras, which cost about $1,600 for a simple  
black-and-white model and up to $20,000 for a top-of the line, 
16-camera rig, have been a very effective crime-stopper, school 
administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a decline in vandalism at many of our schools, a  
decline in negative behavior and visitors,'' said Sydney Franklin, 
assistant superintendent for the Clark County School District in 
Las Vegas and school police supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County has 28 high schools, 34 middle schools and 148  
elementary schools. The district is no stranger to violence. In 
1982, a teacher was killed. In 1992, a student was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The district now spends $6 million a year on security, just over  
1 percent of the budget. That covers a 105-member police force, 
gang abatement specialists, and a hot line for tips and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	After Columbine, Franklin said, ``I am going to look at probably  
better camera equipment so we can deal with night situations much 
better,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Stall As NBA Playoffs Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- This is a confused and frustrated team. The  
Indiana Pacers, a team with championship aspirations, are proving 
to be a club that loses close games when it can least afford to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers practiced together daily for months during the NBA  
lockout, anticipating a payoff once the season began. Home-court 
advantage throughout the playoffs was one goal, but that's now 
mathematically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs  
is a long shot. The Pacers enter their final four games of the 
regular season struggling to hold first place in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's lead over second-place Atlanta was cut to a half game  
with Tuesday's 88-87 loss to Orlando, and then the Hawks tied the 
Pacers on Wednesday by beating the New York Knicks 76-73. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Indiana's final four games are at home, but that  
apparent edge seems minimal since the Pacers have lost three of 
their last six home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when we needed to win at home, we won,'' Antonio  
Davis said. ``This year we can't put together a bucket, a stop, a 
win, when we really need it. It's scary because we just can't get 
it done and we don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana is 1-6 in games decided by one point and four of the  
losses have been at Market Square Arena. Failure to protect leads 
late in the game and inability to make game-saving stops have 
become common. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very tough loss with the same story on a different  
day and the same ending,'' Jalen Rose said after the loss to 
Orlando, which cost the Pacers home court advantage with Orlando if 
the teams finish the regular season in a tie. ``We must stop this. 
I think we're thinking about it too much and just haven't gotten 
into the rhythm to pull out these games when we need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Bird has stressed the importance of home-court  
advantage in the playoffs since the lockout ended. But the team is 
now in danger of not having home advantage past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, the Atlantic Division leader, holds a 2 1/2-game lead over  
Indiana and would likely win the tiebreaker if the two teams 
finished the season with identical records. The teams split their 
four games this season, and the second tiebreaker would be 
conference record. Miami has a three-game lead over Indiana in 
conference games. 
</P>
<P>
	The first tiebreaker in determining home-court advantage is  
head-to-head games and Pacers have lost the season series to 
Orlando and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as winning the East, catching Miami, is probably out of  
reach,'' Dale Davis said. ``You have to put it behind us ... and 
keep pecking away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana is 6-8 in games decided by three or fewer points and is  
only 12-14 against teams with winning records. 
</P>
<P>
	``A majority of these games, we shouldn't have been in this  
position ... where it's so tight,'' Dale Davis said. ``As a team, 
we have to step it up and put teams away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time to do that starts Thursday when Charlotte comes to  
town. Indiana makes its last road stop of the regular season on 
Friday at Atlanta and finishes at home with New York on Sunday and 
Cleveland on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being in that position is a little bit discouraging for a  
team like us,'' Davis said. ``It's still not over. We still have 
time to correct some things, and make this a championship squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't watch out, we won't have any home court,'' Bird  
said. ``Losing like this is tough on everybody and it's tough to 
bounce back, but somehow we have to find a way.''

<HEADLINE> Income Growth Outpaces Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The healthy U.S. economy lifted incomes faster  
than inflation in every state last year, increasing Americans' 
buying power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The length and breadth of this current economic cycle is  
reaching really every corner of the nation,'' said Steve Cochrane, 
an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, average income for America's 270.3 million people  
last year was $26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, the Commerce 
Department said Tuesday. The figures include not only wages and 
salaries but also other sources of income, such as investment 
earnings and government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Per capita income growth last year was actually a bit slower  
than the 4.7 percent increase in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inflation rate, as measured by the government's price  
index for personal consumption expenditures, declined from 2 
percent in 1997 to 0.8 percent last year. Factoring that in, 
Americans' buying power -- per capita income growth after inflation 
-- jumped 3.6 percent in 1998 compared to 2.7 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen really strong consumer spending over the last year  
..., and these figures tell us why: There's money out there to 
spend,'' Cochrane said. 
</P>
<P>
	By state, per capita incomes in 1998 ranged from $37,598 in  
Connecticut to $18,958 in Mississippi. Growth rates in per capita 
income ranged from 7.8 percent in North Dakota, where farmers hurt 
by falling international commodity prices got relief payments from 
the government, to 2.1 percent in Hawaii, where tourism has fallen 
off largely because of economic troubles in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	After North Dakota, the states with the fastest per capita  
income growth rates were Colorado, 6.1 percent; Washington, 5.7 
percent; Texas, 5.3 percent; and Vermont and Massachusetts, 5.0 
percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Hawaii, other states with relatively slow per capita  
income growth last year included Wyoming, 2.5 percent; Nevada and 
Montana, 2.6 percent each; and Alaska, 2.8 percent. Nevada has 
experienced strong economic growth in recent years, but the effects 
on its per capita income have been diluted by simultaneous rapid 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased earnings from service-sector jobs, especially in  
finance and real estate, were the driving force behind high per 
capita income growth in many states. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, for example, ``is really the capital of the  
mutual fund industry, and with the stock market going gangbusters, 
income generated from that industry is really very strong,'' said 
Cochrane. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Colorado is increasingly a service center where  
financial, real estate and insurance companies are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states like Texas and Washington have seen growth in  
relatively high-paying technical jobs, such as in the computer and 
telecommunications industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, unemployment is near a 29-year low, and brisk  
spending by Americans has been largely responsible for keeping the 
U.S. economy growing while other countries have been hurt by a 
global economic downturn that started two years ago in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	States heavily dependent on farming, such as North Dakota, have  
been among those feeling the worst effects of the international 
crisis that has pulled down U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farming states' per capita income growth was  
pushed to among the best in the nation by billions of dollars in 
relief payments Congress and President Clinton approved late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	No such relief came for Hawaii, where tourism from Asia has  
declined dramatically, also pulling down retail sales in the island 
state.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Antebellum Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Henry Wiencek was writing about old family  
homes when he first happened upon Cooleemee, an antebellum 
plantation home on North Carolina's Yadkin River. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Peter Hairston, Cooleemee's owner, introduced Wiencek to  
Squire Hairston, whose grandfather was the slave of Peter's 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked when those two men shook hands,'' Wiencek said  
in a telephone interview. ``Here are two men with the closest 
possible connection to slavery. ... It hinted that a private 
reconciliation had occurred in this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That moment launched Wiencek on an eight-year exploration of  
slavery in America as seen through the prism of one family. The 
upshot is ``The Hairstons,'' a well-plotted, crisply written hybrid 
of biography and good detective yarn published by St. Martin's 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``What fascinated me was when you look at the history of  
slavery, the question in my mind is what happened next? How did 
those families deal with what they had done?'' said Wiencek. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiencek traces the rise and the fall of the two houses of  
Hairston -- the rise of the white plantation-owning Hairstons and 
their decline with Reconstruction, and the slow, painful rise of 
the family's black branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the destiny of the white Hairstons to enact the  
downfall of the Old South,'' Wiencek wrote. ``And, for their part, 
it was the destiny of the black Hairstons to enact the exodus 
embedded in our national story -- the miraculous, astounding rise of 
the African-Americans from the dust of slavery. Slavery could not 
crush them, nor anything thereafter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiencek, 46, a Boston native and Yale University graduate now  
living in Charlottesville, Va., has published two books on Southern 
architecture and several books for Time-Life. He is also the author 
of ``Old Houses,'' essays on the histories of 18 American homes and 
the families that built them. His research for that book brought 
him to Cooleemee and introduced him to the Hairstons. 
</P>
<P>
	He interviewed scores of Hairstons and studied plantation  
archives, slave rosters, public records, accounts by slave traders 
and Quakers who helped runaway slaves. All the while, he hunted for 
a common ancestor of both the black and white Hairstons. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that at times he ``felt all the moral confusion of a  
spy. I was a Northerner adrift in the heart of the old Confederacy, 
an honored visitor in stately homes whose legacy I found deeply 
troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facts emerge: a white Hairston slave owner who on his deathbed  
signed over his holdings to his common-law wife, a slave; 
lynchings, murders; extraordinary kindnesses; destitute Hairston 
women after the Civil War taking seeds out of dolls and planting 
them; black Hairstons becoming teachers, lawyers, farmers, 
ministers and entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Hairston, ``Peter the Immigrant,'' was a Scot who  
settled along the Dan River of Virginia in the 1700s. Through 
careful intermarriage, his descendants built an empire of 45 
tobacco and cotton plantations worked by 10,000 slaves in Virginia, 
North Carolina and Mississippi. Cooleemee, located south of 
Winston-Salem, is one of the last remnants. 
</P>
<P>
	Slavery enriched the white Hairstons and others in Southern  
aristocracy, but eventually, as in a morality tale, it would bring 
down their empires. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed that the moral blindness of these slaveholders was  
total,'' Wiencek wrote. They clung to the irrational belief that 
blacks were inferior, ``even as they grew more and more dependent 
on the skills of the black people, saw the growth of the 
generations in their black family, and felt the stirrings of 
emotion when one of them died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He relates the story of Robert Hairston, who freed several of  
his slaves in 1832. Alienated from his Virginia family, he migrated 
to Mississippi and took a slave as his common-law wife. On his 
deathbed, he willed her all of his possessions and set her free. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had turned the world upside down -- a slave girl was now one  
of the richest women in the United States,'' Wiencek wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But relatives tied up the will in court, and she never got the  
inheritance or her freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Wiencek said slave owners pushed the Southern  
states to pass restrictive laws that prevented owners like Robert 
Hairston from setting their slaves free. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Southern states had not passed such restrictive laws  
about freed slaves, we probably would have seen a gradual 
emancipation of the slaves coming from within the South itself,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the war, 83 white Hairstons served in the Confederate  
Army. Their cousins included Confederate Gens. Jeb Stuart and Jubal 
Early. Of the black Hairstons, Thomas served as a bugler in the 3rd 
U.S. Colored Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, life was different for both Hairston clans. For  
many white Hairstons, Reconstruction brought economic ruin. For 
their black counterparts, there were lynchings and kangaroo courts 
and raw poverty. Then came the institutional injustices and horrors 
of the Jim Crow era that continued into World War II, when black 
volunteers were badly treated in the armed forces, and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights era brought a ``patchwork of reconciliation''  
among the Hairstons, Wiencek said. ``They made a start. I hope the 
next generation will do even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Peter Hairston invited the black Hairstons to Cooleemee  
to celebrate its new National Historic Landmark status. He 
delivered a speech in which he called Cooleemee a sacred place, 
``the altar that represents the result of the struggle of your race 
and mine.''

<HEADLINE> Seattle Hurler Denies Abusing Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A woman is suing Seattle Mariners pitcher Mark  
Leiter for $6 million, accusing him of punching her in the mouth, 
kicking her and putting out a cigarette on her arm during their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila O'Connell filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District  
Court in Chicago, where she maintains she and Leiter had a 
relationship from 1996 through September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter denied the claims.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do know this woman. It's unfortunate she filed this lawsuit.  
There's no truth to the allegations,'' he said before Tuesday night 
game in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that during their relationship, Leiter  
became jealous of O'Connell's contact with other men and began 
physically and verbally abusing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter ``knew that his conduct of throwing Sheila about,  
punching her in the mouth and face, shaking her head, knocking her 
down to the ground and kicking her, carried the risk of serious 
bodily harm,'' O'Connell's lawyers said in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also said Leiter extinguished a cigarette on her arm  
during the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, who was married at the time, referred questions to his  
agent, Alan Nero. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally unfortunate that in today's litigious society,  
people can resort to lawsuits to solve their personal problems,'' 
Nero said. ``In most cases, it's all about money. If this was Joe 
businessman -- not a celebrity -- no one would care.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Workers for Sale on Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Available via auction: 16 cybergeeks who  
work together well and know how to assemble an Internet server. 
Asking price: $3.14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a novel listing posted on eBay, a team of managers and  
engineers for an Internet service provider has gone straight to the 
online auction house that usually sells Beanie Babies and 
autographed baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	They're selling themselves -- and their experience assembling  
high-tech computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're shipped via UPS,'' quips one Internet response  
to the auction posting. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's no joke. When the auctioning period closes May 8, the  
highest bidder will be bound to buy the team, eBay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think it's a joke, but I'm totally serious  
with this,'' a spokesman for the group calling itself ``ispteam'' 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 workers -- including a director, two managers, three  
engineers and five administrators -- claim they currently work, 
unhappily, for a Silicon Valley company. They're keeping their 
employer secret for fear of getting fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just sitting around talking, watching our company  
disintegrate and watching all these great people leaving,'' he 
said. They had been working together for years, and hated the idea 
of splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling a spoof in which a seller tried to auction off a  
16-year-old girl -- eBay yanked the listing -- and real bids for 
dinner with venture capitalist Steve Jurveston (the $10,000 winning 
bid went to charity), someone in the group jokingly suggested 
auctioning themselves off as a team on eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like, 'Wait a minute. That's not a bad idea. That'll  
work!''' said the spokesman, a 23-year-old software engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered to take the initiative -- and posted the listing  
Tuesday night in the computers category. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team of 16 employees from major ISP willing to leave as a  
group,'' the item reads. ``Group formed major ISP presence in 
Silicon Valley/US and is now looking for other challenges and 
requires an opportunity with a major player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The selling price reflects salaries, including $200,000 for the  
director and $190,000 for each engineer. ``That would give us all 
raises,'' the spokesman said. ``That's one of the benefits of 
putting this on the auction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've also got some requirements: a $320,000 signing bonus,  
401(k), stock options. And the company must be based in Silicon 
Valley or San Francisco. eBay would get a commission of $39,260. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere else in the world could this happen,'' said Jean  
Bagileo, vice president at the Silicon Valley headhunting firm 
David Powell, Inc. ``It's provocative, it's humorous, you kind of 
think it can't be true, but go figure. Evidently they're trying to 
avoid us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday evening, they had two bids that had met the $3.14  
million asking price. And some ``big, cool companies'' -- major 
names in the e-commerce world -- have already e-mailed asking for 
resumes, the ispteam spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	eBay has its share of odd auction items. But this is the first  
selling people, said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for San 
Jose-based eBay, which has almost 2 million items for sale today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly one of the more interesting items we've  
had,'' he said. ``It could be the start of something really big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It beats dealing with headhunters, the ispteam spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the very minimum it stirred up a lot of frustration and  
could scare the company I'm working for,'' he said. ``And I think 
it's a cool idea.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Conglomerates Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung is threatening  
new action against South Korea's five largest conglomerates, saying 
they are not instituting reforms quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim met with the heads of the business giants over dinner  
Tuesday night and threatened to put their firms under court 
receivership unless they sharply reduced their size and debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring the nation's family-run conglomerates is the  
centerpiece of reforms being pushed by Kim to revive the crisis-hit 
South Korean economy. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time Kim has threatened the conglomerates,  
known here as chaebol, but it came only days after two of the five 
groups announced new and extensive restructuring plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still is an atmosphere of half-belief, half-doubt among  
the public about promises of reform by chaebol,'' Kim told the 
heads of Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week, Daewoo and Hyundai said they planned to shed  
dozens of affiliates through sales and mergers by the end of the 
year and concentrate on a handful of core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That is exactly what the president has been demanding for more  
than a year, but the restructuring announcements by Daewoo and 
Hyundai didn't deter him from threatening them again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people -- I believe even the president -- think that  
chaebol are extremely slow in reforming,'' said Lee Jae-shik of the 
Financial Supervisory Commission, the nation's corporate watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
	The president told the five chaebol leaders that unless they  
comply with his demands, their firms could wind up under control of 
the banks holding their debt or in court receivership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government will provide support for those who make  
self-rescue and self-reform efforts,'' Kim said. ``But we cannot 
but take strong actions against those which do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top five conglomerates promised last year to halve the  
number of companies they control and raise a total of $5.8 billion 
to improve their financial positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said most of those commitments lag behind  
schedule and that some conglomerates have even gotten bigger and 
further in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``What chaebol have been doing is mostly announcing plans that  
are unlikely to work. I seriously doubt that they can find buyers 
for their assets so soon,'' said Lee Ji-soon, an economics 
professor at Seoul National University. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, South Korean conglomerates thrived on cozy  
relations with military governments. A single chaebol controls 40 
to 60 subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips to cars 
and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	One unofficial survey estimates that the five biggest chaebol  
control roughly 30 percent of all financial resources in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen smaller chaebol collapsed in 1997, forcing South  
Korea to turn to the International Monetary Fund to bail out its 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Boy Bids $1 Million on Internet Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Ont. (AP) -- A 13-year-old New Jersey boy probably  
won't soon forget who Sir John A. Macdonald is after bidding 
$900,000 on the Internet for Canada's first prime minister's bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's parents have also discovered their son placed several  
bids totalling more than $1 million over the last month using the 
facilities of eBay, a giant U.S.-based Internet auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not supposed to talk about it,'' the boy told the  
Kingston Whig-Standard on Saturday afternoon. ``I'm off the 
Internet now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his eBay shopping spree, the boy -- identified by The  
Star-Ledger of Newark in Wednesday's editions as Andrew Tyler of 
Haddonfield, N.J. -- placed several other bids including $15,000 for 
a 1955 Ford convertible and $125,000 for a Superman comic. He also 
placed bids on a physician's office clinic in Florida, two mobile 
kitchens for movie shoots and a Van Gogh painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Auction House says the boy sent his bid on the 1860s  
era bedroom suite, purported to have once been owned by Canada's 
father of confederation, last Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The suite went up for auction April 15 and had gained bids of up  
to $12,000 before the boy's bid arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of eBay's bidding system, the boy -- who has become what  
is known at eBay as a `deadbeat' bidder -- would have been billed 
only $400,000 because his bid hit the reserve bid price demanded by 
the suite's owners and no other bidder offered more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction House owner Aubrey Garrett spoke to the boy's mother  
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said he bought a $400,000 bedroom suite and she said, `I'm  
hyperventilating','' Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at this as a funny story,'' the boy's father  
said Saturday, asking that reporters stop calling his home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, eBay spokeswoman Jennifer Chou said minors are not  
allowed to place bids. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she admitted the company operates on an honour system, and  
anyone with a computer online can sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet Auction House is considering legal action against  
eBay for failing to head off the prank. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay officials said Monday they had suspended the boy's  
account.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mostly Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid reports the Clinton administration 
plans to ease some sanctions against foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rose after President Clinton moved to exempt food and  
medicine from future sanctions, a decision that could significantly 
boost export demand for beleaguered American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, commercial licenses to sell agricultural  
and medicinal products under existing U.S. sanctions -- against 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Sudan -- will be reviewed 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also rose amid continued uncertainty about  
weather conditions in Midwest growing regions. The National Weather 
Service is calling for normal temperatures and above-normal 
rainfall over the next week, while some private forecasters say 
showers will only be scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer will determine whether farmers will be able to  
proceed with fieldwork already delayed by heavy recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.63 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.19 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.20 
a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.89 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed, while pork bellies advanced on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .10 cent to 63.57 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 71.65 cents a pound; June lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Oil Companies Face Human Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Human rights activists in the United States  
and abroad increasingly are calling upon the world's major oil 
companies to leave oil-rich regions where tales of torture and 
disappearances flow as freely as crude itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent activism includes a campaign by women's groups to stop  
the construction of a pipeline in Afghanistan, a lawsuit against a 
California oil company's practices in Myanmar and protests over the 
deaths of three activists, including Terence Freitas of Los 
Angeles, in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	This week in Los Angeles, a Colombian Indian tribe and its  
supporters will ask Occidental Petroleum Corp. shareholders to 
consider an ultimatum: drop drilling plans on their tribal land or 
they will commit mass suicide by walking off a 1,400-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's meeting in Santa Monica, shareholders will face the  
protesters' demands and vote on a resolution -- written in part by 
Freitas before he was killed by Colombian guerrillas in February -- 
that calls for a study on how opposition by the 5,000-member tribe 
could affect profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based Occidental opposes the resolution, saying it  
has acted as ``a model corporate citizen in Colombia for 30 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to stockholders is just one of a growing number of  
strategies used by activists to influence the behavior of oil 
companies, said Arvind Ganesan, an analyst with Human Rights Watch 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an industry under pressure on human rights now,'' Ganesan  
said. ``Shareholder meetings are a good forum to air these kinds of 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most oil giants refuse to pull out of troubled regions,  
some are responding with new corporate human rights policies, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are realizing that, because of the reputation hit  
they can take in an environment of low oil prices, it's not in the 
company's best interest to have a human rights problem,'' Ganesan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freitas was a longtime U'wa supporter who worked to keep  
Occidental from drilling on tribal land. His organization, the U'wa 
Defense Working Group, contends that oil brings violence: 
Guerrillas target pipelines and surrounding villages and 
governments respond by militarizing the regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil always brings an ugly transformation of the culture and  
almost always brings violence,'' said Robert Benson, a Loyola 
University law professor, who heads a group seeking to bring state 
pressure on companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition filed last week with state Attorney General Bill  
Lockyer, Benson's group asked the state to revoke the corporate 
charter of El Segundo-based Union Oil Company of California, or 
Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson claims that in Myanmar, Unocal has forced villagers to  
relocate and used forced labor to build the company's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal denies the allegations. Mike Thacher, a Unocal spokesman,  
says the company is a solid corporate citizen. Just this year, it 
formalized a corporate position on human rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, we respect human rights in all of our  
projects,'' Thacher said. ``This includes our investment in Myanmar 
and it would have included any investment in Afghanistan, had we 
had one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Unocal withdrew from a plan to build an $8 billion  
pipeline through Afghanistan. Feminist groups had criticized the 
company over the project, which required working with the Taliban, 
an Islamic militia whose interpretation of religious law has forced 
women to wear an all-enveloping veil and banned women from work and 
girls from school. 
</P>
<P>
	Thatcher said the company withdrew over concern that there ``was  
not a stable government in place that was recognized by the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal was the only major U.S. company still in Myanmar after  
Atlantic Richfield Co. ended its natural gas exploration there last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco, based in Los Angeles, also contended its retreat from  
Myanmar, ruled by a military government accused of human rights 
abuses, was a business decision that had nothing to do with human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But human rights may be playing a bigger role in company  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron faced a shareholder proposal in 1997 asking the board to  
develop guidelines for working in countries with ongoing human 
rights violations. Shareholders have, also without success, made 
similar demands of Royal Dutch-Shell over its drilling operations 
in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposals have failed, Shell has altered its  
approach to human rights issues, said spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor, 
in a phone interview from the company's office in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Shell has consulted with human rights  
groups and adopted a human rights policy, Ms. Tavinor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do withdraw if violence occurs and we have canceled  
contracts if we're not happy with the other participating groups' 
behavior,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Tavinor acknowledged that the Nigerian government  
makes its own decisions about ``protecting strategic 
installations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't control any government anywhere,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Stock Soars on Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s stock jumped more than 12  
percent Wednesday after posting a better-than expected 15 percent 
jump in first quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance giant cited its success curbing rising  
medical costs and increasing premiums as a big reason for its 
financial success. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's operating earnings in the first quarter were $168.2  
million, or $1.08 a share, compared to $146.6 million or 90 cents a 
share in the same period a year ago. Results beat Wall Street 
forecasts by 7 cents, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for Aetna U.S. Healthcare rose 33 percent, excluding  
Year 2000 costs, to $133.5 million compared to the prior-year 
period. The company said it has done particularly well at lowering 
prescription drug costs to below current industry trends. HMO drug 
costs have been rising at about 13 percent in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, shares of Aetna rose $10.12 1/2 to $92 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising medical costs have hurt profits for most managed care  
firms in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Aetna pays of each premium dollar in medical costs, a  
key indicator of financial health, fell to 82 percent, compared to 
82.7 percent a year ago. In the Medicare market, the proportion 
fell to 90.1 percent from 92.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the nation's largest health insurer grew 23  
percent increase, from $5.7 billion to $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total HMO membership increased by nearly 1.9 million members  
over the prior-year period, reflecting the addition of NYLCare, as 
well as business growth. Commercial HMO membership rose 5 percent 
from year end, as enrollment grew in every region of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The company added 62,000 Medicare HMO members since year end,  
resulting in a net increase of 11,000 Medicare members after 
exiting selected markets. The company announced last fall it was 
exiting the Medicare HMOs in six states. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna Retirement Services, which markets a wide array of  
retirement and investment products to nonprofit organizations, 
government entities, small businesses and individuals, reported a 
30 percent increase in operating earnings of $53 million, compared 
$40.8 million in the same period last year.

	Outspoken Yugoslav Official Is Ousted  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav deputy premier who  
urged his government to compromise with NATO was fired today, state 
media said. The ouster came just three days after Vuk Draskovic 
said the Serb leadership should recognize that ``we cannot defeat 
NATO'' and must respect the ``reality'' of facing a world united 
against it. A report by the Tanjug news agency said Draskovic was 
sacked because of his ``public statements which were contrary to 
the government stands.'' Draskovic was once the main opposition 
leader before joining Slobodan Milosevic's government three months 
ago.

	Kosovars Flee to Albania  
</P>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- More than 2,000 ethnic Albanian refugees  
fled into Albania today, telling of a new Serb campaign to clear 
villages in southwest Kosovo. In neighboring Macedonia, the U.N. 
refugee agency warned that camps packed beyond capacity were ``on 
the verge of rioting'' because of tensions. The refugees said Serb 
police had ordered them out of their villages. Albania has taken in 
more than 360,000 Kosovo refugees, and a further 142,000 are in 
Macedonia. Hundreds of thousands more are said to be displaced 
within Kosovo.

	Envoys Head to Moscow To Talk Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Diplomatic efforts to resolve the Kosovo conflict  
intensified today, with Russia's envoy announcing plans to go to 
Yugoslavia and Germany for talks tomorrow. Russia has been a vocal 
opponent of NATO airstrikes on Serb targets. Germany has also been 
in the forefront of Kosovo diplomacy, partly because anti-war 
sentiment is growing. Russia's talks with Yugoslavia reportedly are 
centering on what kind of international force could eventually move 
into Kosovo. NATO insists that any such force be a military one, 
which Belgrade rejects.

	3 Teens Eyed in Colo. Shootings  
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Police say they want to interview for a  
second time three teen-agers who said they were acquainted with the 
young men who carried out the deadly shooting at a Colorado high 
school. The Jefferson county sheriff says the three teens, who were 
detained and questioned last week during the attack, knew the names 
of the gunmen before that information had been announced. The three 
youths were wearing combat gear and clothing similar to what the 
shooters wore. Officials said the three were associated with the 
``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' as were gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

	Casino, Lottery Moratorium Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sharply divided panel studying gambling in  
America today recommended a nationwide moratorium on the spread of 
casinos, lotteries and slot machines. The commission's report will 
contain a call for ``a pause'' in the spread of legalized gambling 
and encourage state and local governments to form their own 
gambling study commissions. The nine-member panel split over the 
language, particularly the use of the word ``moratorium.'' Five 
commissioners approved the wording, while four voted no.

	Many Films Show Substance Abuses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. drug officials released results today of  
a study that says people were depicted doing drugs, drinking or 
smoking in 98 percent of the top movie rentals and 27 percent of 
the most popular songs in 1996 and 1997. The study was commissioned 
by the Department of Health and Human Service, which wants to know 
if the depictions encourage America's youth to use and abuse 
alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. Drugs were associated with wealth or 
luxury in 20 percent of the songs. A spokesman for the Motion 
Picture Association of America declined comment.

	Site Helps With Travel Complaints  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dissatisfied airline passengers have a Web site  
that lets them complain directly to airlines and the U.S. 
Department of Transportation. The site, www.passengerrights.com, 
forwards the complaints to airline e-mail addresses not available 
to the general public and follows up on the complaints with faxes. 
Complaints can also be sent to cruise ship companies, car rental 
agencies, hotels, resorts and tour operators. Fewer than 6,000 
airline service complaints were made last year to the DOT, but the 
web site operator said the number is not representative because so 
few people know how to register a complaint.

the quarterback and his accuser had consensual sex.

<HEADLINE> Baffert Adds Filly to Derby Brigade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert knows he made the right  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier in the day, with a 10 a.m. deadline closing in for  
entering horses in Saturday's Kentucky Derby, he paced at his barn, 
cell phone in hand, owners waiting in the wings to see if Baffert 
would enter his filly, Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after a week of suspense, Baffert figured three chances  
are better than two in his bid for an unprecedented third 
consecutive Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entered General Challenge, with Gary Stevens; we entered  
Prime Timber with David Flores; and Excellent Meeting is in the 
Derby with Kent Desormeaux,'' Baffert said Wednesday at Barn 33, 
where his two Derby winners, Silver Charm and Real Quiet, were 
walking the shedrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The filly is doing great, I feel she earned her way into the  
race and I think she's good enough to win the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday evening's draw for post position, Baffert found out  
where his horses stood -- and only Excellent Meeting ended up in a 
prime spot, No. 6 in a full field of 20 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber will leave from the No. 14 post, and General  
Challenge from the No. 15 slot. Because the regular starting gate 
holds only 14 horses, an auxiliary gate will be added for the other 
six entries. 
</P>
<P>
	John and Betty Mabee own both General Challenge and Excellent  
Meeting, and the entry was made the 3-1 early-morning favorite by 
Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, owned by Aaron Jones, was the second choice at  
7-2, while Menifee, trained by Elliot Walden, was the third choice 
at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge and Prime Timber finished 1-2 in the Santa  
Anita Derby, while Excellent Meeting has an impressive four-race 
winning streak and seven victories in 11 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, being the favorite is nothing these days for Baffert.  
And he doesn't really care that it's been 20 years since the 
favorite won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the favorite last year with Indian Charlie,'' Baffert  
said. ``But we knew Real Quiet was doing the best of the two. You 
can talk about the jinxes and all that, but who would have thought 
that a horse that got beat in New Mexico was going to come win the 
Derby last year? So I think you can throw all that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting also is entered in Friday's Kentucky Oaks,  
meaning Baffert has until an hour or so before the Oaks' 5:47 p.m. 
post time to make a final decision on the filly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I think she will run in the Derby,'' Baffert said,  
``but I've been known to change my mind. A few times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, also trained by Baffert and owned by Mike  
Pegram, is the odds-on favorite in the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Excellent Meeting goes in the Derby, it would be the first  
time since 1984 that two fillies ran for the roses. Three Ring, who 
won her last two races by 6 1/4 lengths and 14 lengths, respectively, 
is the other. In '84, trainer D. Wayne Lukas sent out Althea and 
Life's Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	If all 20 start, it would be the first full field since 1984,  
and just the 13th time there's been a field of 20 or more horses. 
After 23 started in the 100th derby in 1974, Churchill Downs 
limited the field to 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular post position for Derby winners has been the  
No. 1 slot, but the last winner from that spot was Ferdinand in 
1986. Adonis, the Wood Memorial winner trained by Nick Zito, leaves 
from the No. 1 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington Stakes winner Charismatic and Blue Grass winner  
Menifee leave from post positions which have never produced a Derby 
winner -- Charismatic from No. 17 and Menifee from No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The other coupled entry in the Derby is Worldly Manner and  
Aljabr, owned by the Godolphin Stable of sheiks Maktoum al Maktoum 
and Mohammed al Maktoum. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, winner of three of four starts last year in the  
United States, beat Aljabr in a private trial race in Dubai in 
March. Aljabr, unbeaten in three starts in Europe in 1998, also won 
a trial in which Worldly Manner did not compete. Aljabr leaves from 
the No. 5 post; Worldly Manner No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy with my post positions, no complaints,''  
trainer Saeed bin Suroor said. ``I think Aljabr will show some 
speed from the inside. The other horse will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer, along with Sheikh Mohammed, arrived at Churchill  
Downs on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a five-horse mutuel field, which includes  
controversial Arkansas Derby winner Valhol. The others are Ecton 
Park, K One King, Kimberlite Pipe and Lemon Drop Kid. The field is 
listed at 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The last field horse to win the Derby was Canonero II in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol got into the Derby only after a judge in Arkansas ruled  
that the track must pay the $300,000 first-place purse to owner 
James Jackson. The Arkansas Racing Commission had held up the purse 
while investigating whether jockey Billy Patin carried an 
electrical device to spur Valhol to the win. Valhol will be ridden 
by Willie Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out: Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); Three  
Ring (John Velazquez, 20-1); Ecton Park (Robbie Davis, 12-1); 
Stephen Got Even (Chris McCarron, 12-1); Aljabr (Daragh O'Donahue, 
12-1); Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux, 3-1); Desert Hero (Corey 
Nakatani, 15-1); Answer Lively (Craig Perret, 50-1); Valhol (Willie 
Martinez, 12-1); K One King (Alex Solis, 12-1); Cat Thief (Mike 
Smith, 8-1); Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey, 12-1); Kimberlite Pipe 
(Robby Albarado, 12-1); Prime Timber (David Flores, 7-2); General 
Challenge (Gary Stevens, 3-1), First American (Eddie Delahoussaye, 
50-1); Charismatic (Chris Antley, 20-1); Vicar (Shane Sellers, 
6-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 5-1); and Lemon Drop Kid (Jose Santos, 
12-1).

<HEADLINE> Baffert Picks Derby Post Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert's three-pronged assault on an  
unprecedented third straight Kentucky Derby victory will be 
launched from farther out than his first two. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who got to pick sixth, 12th and 13th, chose the sixth  
post for the filly Excellent Meeting, No. 14 for Prime Timber and 
No. 15 for General Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's first Derby winner, Silver Charm, started from the No.  
5 post in 1997, while Real Quiet started from the No. 3 post. In 
1995 and 1996, however, trainer D. Wayne Lukas' winners, Thunder 
Gulch and Grindstone, started from Nos. 15 and 16, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be worse. I could be home in California watching it  
on TV,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The John and Betty Mabee entry of General Challenge and  
Excellent Meeting was made the 3-1 early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, a gelding, beat Prime Timber in the Santa  
Anita Derby on April 3 while wearing blinkers for the first time. 
Excellent Meeting will be making her debut against colts and will 
be racing farther than 1 1-16 miles for the first time. She's won 
three filly stakes in three races this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting also is entered in Friday's Kentucky Oaks, but  
Baffert said he is thinking of running her in the Derby ``or we 
wouldn't go through all this hassle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, she will run in the Derby -- but I've been known to  
change my mind. A few times,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram's sensational Silverbulletday, trained by Baffert,  
is odds on to win the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, owned by Aaron and Marie Jones, and the winner of  
the San Felipe, was the second early choice at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, the Blue Grass Stakes winner, was listed at 5-1 after  
drawing the No. 19 post. Ecton Park, fourth in the Arkansas Derby 
and also trained by Elliott Walden drew No. 3 and was put in the 
mutuel field at 12-1. The two colts will not run as entry because 
of different owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Next in the early is Florida Derby winner Vicar, at 6-1. He will  
start from the No. 18 position. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Nick Zito and Lukas also will have two starters that won't  
be coupled in the betting. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito's starters will be Stephen Got Even (No. 4, 12-1), winner  
of the Gallery Furniture.com, and Adonis (No. 1, 30-1), winner of 
the Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas will saddle Cat Thief (No. 11, 8-1), which was third in  
the Florida Derby and second in the Blue Grass, and Charismatic 
(No. 17, 20-10), winner of the Lexington 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, the other filly in the race, drew the No. 2 post for  
her debut against colts, her first start since March 16 and her 
first at farther than 1 1-16 miles. In her last two starts, she was 
an easy winner in filly stakes. She was at 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Three horses who have added some spice to the race are the  
controversial Valhol and the ``mysterious'' Worldly Manner and 
Aljabr, who were shipped in from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and 
will be making their first official starts of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol, who drew the No. 9 post, almost didn't get into the  
Derby. After he won the Arkansas Derby on April 11 at Oaklawn Park, 
distribution of the purse was held up pending an investigation into 
whether jockey Billy Patin possessed an electrical device called a 
battery. A hearing into that matter is not scheduled to be held 
until May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a judge ordered the purse to be distributed,  
awarding first money of $300,000 to the gelding, who had failed to 
win his first two starts, both this year. Without that money, he 
would not have made the field, limited to 20 starters based on 
money earned in graded stakes competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vindication is yet to come,'' said James D. Jackson, Valhol's  
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner (No. 12) and Aljabr (No. 5) are owned by the  
Godolphin Racing Stable of Sheiks Maktoum al Maktoum and Mohammed 
al Maktoum. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, winner of three of four starts last year in the  
United States, beat Aljabr in a trial race in Dubai in March. 
Aljabr, unbeaten in three starts in Europe in 1998, also won a 
trial in which Worldly Manner did not compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Derby starter who did not race as a 2-year-old is Desert  
Hero, who won his first two starts before finishing third in the 
Santa Anita Derby. Trainer Richard Mandella drew No. 1 in the 
selection order and picked the No. 7 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered were Answer Lively, the 2-year-old champion winless  
in four starts this year; First American, winner of the Flamingo; 
Kimberlite Pipe, Louisiana Derby winner; Lemon Drop Kid, winner of 
one of only two starts this year; and K One King, second in Gallery 
Furniture.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner and Aljabr will race as entry. Joining Ecton Park  
in the mutuel field will be Kimberlite Pipe, K One King, Lemon Drop 
Kid and Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	The fillies each will carry 121 pounds, the others 126 apiece.  
</P>
<P>
	If all 20 horses start, the total purse of the Derby will be  
$1,201,200, with the winner's share $901,200.

<HEADLINE> Derby a Big Time for Valhol Trainer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Outside Barn 42, Dallas Keen was handed a  
small box wrapped in silver paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the box was a silver julep cup -- a memento for each of  
the Kentucky Derby trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Keen officially became a Derby trainer Tuesday when a judge in  
Little Rock, Ark., ruled Valhol was entitled to the $300,000 
winner's share of the Arkansas Derby purse. 
</P>
<P>
	The julep cups were handed out at a trainer's dinner Tuesday  
night and Keen was on his way back to Louisville at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Racing Commission ordered Oaklawn Park to hold up  
the purse after track officials said they had evidence jockey Billy 
Patin might have carried an electrical device when he won the April 
10 race aboard Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse did nothing wrong,'' Keen said Wednesday.  
``Regardless of whether he used an electrical device or not, it's 
not going to make a horse run faster than what he is capable of 
doing. If anything, I think it's going to hurt one more than help 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading to the Arkansas Derby, Valhol was second in a maiden  
race on Feb. 12 and fourth, beaten 2 1/2 lengths after traffic 
problems, in the Louisiana Derby on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute had kept Keen from enjoying his first Derby horse.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been fun,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But now he can relax, somewhat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of relief for Valhol and my owner,'' he said.  
``It's been a tough go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Jackson, who paid $30,000 for Valhol as a 2-year-old, was  
exuberant moments after the Arkansas Derby, knowing the Kentucky 
Derby awaited. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's breathtaking,'' he said. ``It's the dream of every  
horsemen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Jackson was ecstatic about the verdict, but  
``vindication is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shadow cast by the investigation affected his family  
and Jackson's. Now they can concentrate on the race itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the horse will embarrass us,'' Keen said. ``I  
think he's a champion. He's had a very short racing career but 
everything he's done has been so professional. He's the kind of 
horse you dream about being able to train. He doesn't make any 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If more than 20 horses are entered in the Kentucky Derby, the  
field is limited to the top 20 in money earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn general manager Eric Jackson emphasized the court ruling  
had nothing to do with the status of Patin. A hearing in the case 
is May 5. Keen said he has not talked with Patin since the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Martinez, who was aboard Valhol for a half-mile workout  
Tuesday, will ride on Saturday. Churchill Downs probably would have 
tried to stop Patin from riding Valhol as long as the investigation 
was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Keen said Martinez told him he had watched films of the  
gelding's races and was excited about getting the mount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Derby check gives Valhol $338,400, good enough for  
11th on the list after the filly Excellent Meeting was entered in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, after Saturday, it will have all been worth it,''  
Keen said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-five years have passed, so Andy Partridge  
finally feels comfortable confessing. 
</P>
<P>
	During his teen-age days in England, the singer for the rock  
band XTC used to scatter David Bowie and Iggy Pop records around 
his room when his friends came over to visit. He had an image to 
protect, and Bowie and Iggy made him look cool. 
</P>
<P>
	What his buddies never realized was that before they came over,  
Partridge would be listening to his dad's old albums of Herb Alpert 
and the Tijuana Brass. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the story can be told.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get older and more comfortable with yourself and you say,  
'Sure, I like a lot of the music that my parents liked,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a telling admission since Partridge and his partner, Colin  
Moulding, have emerged from a seven-year exile with an album his 
dad could probably appreciate. ``Apple Venus, Volume I'' leaves the 
traditional instruments of rock 'n' roll behind for a sound 
Partridge describes as ``orchustic'' -- orchestral and acoustic. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination is heralded by the plucked violin strings and  
dissonant horns that form an extended intro to the album. It's not 
easy listening music, however. Dedicated followers will see the 
parallels with XTC's artsy, tuneful rock that's made songs like 
``Dear God'' and ``Senses Working Overtime'' cult favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some XTC fans will think of this stuff as possibly a  
jump too far,'' Partridge said. ``If they fall off, I'd rather like 
that if they can't handle it, if they're not tough enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person who has already abandoned ship is Dave Gregory, XTC's  
guitarist for 20 years. His departure, partly because he didn't 
want to play this kind of music, just added to XTC's catalogue of 
woes during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven years, XTC refused to record until they were released  
from their record contract. Partridge also suffered through a 
divorce during the time on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	XTC believed it was on the wrong side of a one-sided deal with  
its record label, hardly unusual in the music business. Partridge 
and Moulding sought either a better contract or a release from 
Virgin Records, and got neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the individuals that we are, we just refused to address  
the situation because we're just not money-minded,'' Moulding said. 
``...I think we tried to resist putting that side of it right for 
so long and in the end we just confronted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They effectively went on strike, since any music they made as  
XTC would be owned by Virgin. It was a depressing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't feel sat upon after all those years and the  
future looking so bleak?'' Moulding said. ``But you just sort of 
hang on. You write some songs and you nurse them, thinking, `One 
day I'll get to record these.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Partridge, who writes about three-quarters of XTC's songs, was  
more manic. Wondering if his music would ever be heard again just 
drove him to write more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose your car keys and you look for them, you can't  
find them,'' he said. ``If you don't look for them, you'll find 
them. I was sort of backed into not looking for any songs because 
we couldn't record them or release them, and suddenly loads of them 
came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing was also cathartic for Partridge as his marriage  
crumbled. He resisted releasing these songs, fearing they'd sound 
pathetic. But two made it onto the new album: the profanely bitter 
``Your Dictionary'' and ``I Can't Own Her,'' which reflects on the 
fragile state of relationships after he met someone new. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually a settlement with Virgin allowed XTC to sign with two  
independent labels, including TVT Records in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of silence, suddenly there's a flood of XTC  
material. The band says it's a way of thanking fans for their 
patience. ``Apple Venus, Volume 2,'' an electric rock 'n' roll 
record, will come out later this year. ``Transistor Blast'' is a 
box set consisting of live recordings from XTC's early days. XTC 
has not performed public concerts since the early 1980s because of 
Partridge's stage fright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our early stuff is kind of naive and funny,'' Partridge said.  
``When we heard all the tapes I laughed my socks off. I thought it 
was so saucy, this young band, trying to pull this stuff off. It's 
like someone who can't paint trying to do a painting. The 
perspectives are all wrong, the colors are all wrong, the blurry 
stuff is in the foreground, but you can enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	XTC wanted to release its stockpile of new material roughly in  
the order in which it was written. That meant finishing the 
orchestral material first, and dealing with a disgruntled Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory didn't want to hire an orchestra, believing it was too  
expensive, and resented not being able to play electric guitar. 
Partridge and Moulding tried to persuade him to hang on, since XTC 
wasn't abandoning rock, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was willing himself out of the band,'' Partridge said. ``I  
think he never felt part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the problems, Partridge said he and Moulding never  
considered pulling the plug on XTC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``The more we couldn't work, the more  
we wanted to do it. It's sort of the backwards principle of if you 
deny something to someone, they'll want it even more.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Won't Block Hinckley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John W. Hinckley may take supervised day trips  
from the mental hospital where he has been confined since his 1981 
attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court refused Tuesday to reconsider an earlier  
decision allowing the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Over opposition from federal prosecutors, Hinckley won court  
permission in January for supervised trips away from St. Elizabeths 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosecutor, who said Hinckley remains disturbed and  
unpredictable, blocked him from taking the outings by appealing the 
three-judge panel's decision to the full U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's decision did not rule directly on the merits of  
Hinckley's request to leave the hospital but had the effect of 
allowing such trips. Hospital officials have said that as part of 
his treatment, he should be allowed visits off hospital grounds, 
supervised by hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, said he  
was unsure whether Tuesday's decision would be appealed. He said 
that in a week, when the appeal court's decision takes effect, the 
hospital will have discretion to decide when and where Hinckley can 
take supervised day trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at St. Elizabeths were not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, said he would work with  
hospital officials to arrange a supervised day trip for Hinckley. 
Levine said Hinckley probably would visit with his family and his 
girlfriend for dinner at a private home in the Washington area. 
Levine said he expects that trip to be ``a precursor to enlarged 
liberties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the Secret Service will know wherever he's going,  
and the public is not at any risk at all,'' Levine said. ``Mental 
health professionals who know him are of the view that John 
Hinckley is not a danger to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Hinckley ``left the hospital for a meal during  
Christmastime with his family,'' Levine said. After that, 
prosecutors sought a court order that they be notified before such 
excursions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley, 43, has been confined to St. Elizabeths since 1982,  
when he was acquitted by reason of insanity in the 1981 handgun 
attack on Reagan outside a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, his press secretary James Brady and two  
law enforcement officers were wounded in a shooting that Hinckley 
later said was an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Wilma A. Lewis said Tuesday she was disappointed  
with the ruling, which applies not just to Hinckley but to all 
Washington defendants acquitted by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our disappointment, the public should understand that  
today's court decision does not allow Mr. Hinckley or any other 
insanity acquittee to come and go when they please,'' she said, 
adding the courts would be consulted before any unsupervised visits 
are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge originally turned down Hinckley's request for a  
Christmastime visit with his parents and girlfriend in 1997. 
Hinckley appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, whose three-judge panel cleared the way for the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, prosecutors asked the full, 11-judge appeals court  
to reconsider the case. But the appeals court on Tuesday let stand 
the first panel's 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson disagreed with the  
majority decision, saying it was dangerous to allow hospital 
officials to decide on the supervised release of defendants 
acquitted because of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It leaves to hospital administrators, rather than to judges as  
the Congress intended, final say in whether to release among the 
public members of what this court has justifiably called an 
'exceptionally dangerous class,''' she wrote in her dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals panel in January did not rule directly on merits of  
Hinckley's request to leave the St. Elizabeths campus. Instead, the 
two judges agreed with Hinckley's argument that decisions about 
such visits should be made by doctors, not courts.

<HEADLINE> Many Films Show Substance Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Musicians sing about guzzling liquor and movie  
stars puff cigarettes and take drugs on the big screen. But federal 
officials ask: Where is the unglamorous side of substance use -- 
like hangovers, slurred speech or getting in trouble with the law? 
</P>
<P>
	A government study released Wednesday says that people were  
depicted doing drugs, drinking or smoking in 98 percent of the top 
movie rentals and 27 percent of the most popular songs in 1996 and 
1997. Fewer than half these movie scenes and song lyrics mentioned 
any downside to these activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The $400,000 study of 200 movies -- rated from ``G'' for all ages  
to ``NC-17,'' no one under 17 admitted -- and 1,000 songs was 
commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The study stopped short of saying that music and films cause  
young people to use drugs, alcohol and tobacco. But researchers 
said that determining the frequency and nature of substance use in 
entertainment media is the first step toward understanding how much 
influence films and music have on young people's decisions to 
smoke, drink and take illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not suggest that we want to dictate the message. Drugs,  
alcohol and tobacco are a reality of American life. They should be 
part of the art form of the entertainment world,'' said Barry 
McCaffrey, drug control policy director for the Clinton 
administration. ``But we are suggesting they need to be tied to the 
consequences that are realistic, given our experiences in American 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Motion Picture Association of America spokesman declined to  
comment, saying there hadn't been enough time to review the 
two-year study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America issued a  
one-paragraph statement, saying efforts already were under way in 
the music industry to help control teen substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, for example, the music industry has put labels on  
recordings that contain strong language or descriptions of 
violence, sex or substance abuse. In an average record store with 
110,000 titles, about 500 recordings would have the ``parental 
advisory'' sticker, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelba Chavez, administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental  
Health Services Administration, said the entertainment media are a 
powerful influence on young people, but parents have more of an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of room for improvement in the entertainment  
world,'' she said, ``but there's just as much room for improvement 
in homes and communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, Ms. Chavez said only 3 percent of the song  
lyrics mentioned tobacco. And 15 percent of the movies that 
portrayed illicit drug use also contained an ``anti-use'' message, 
such as limiting how much and how often substances are used. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five of the movies, however, were substance-free. And in at  
least two of the five, there was a scene about using substances, 
according to Don Roberts, a Stanford University communications 
professor who helped research the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one scene, a set of characters sit around a tea table,  
drink out of little toy tea cups and go through an entire drunk 
shtick,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the study's other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Of the movies, 93 percent showed alcohol use, 89 percent  
tobacco use and 22 percent drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the songs, 17 percent included lyrics about people drinking  
alcohol, 18 percent using drugs and 3 percent smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than half the movies and more than 80 percent of the songs  
that mentioned drugs and alcohol indicated no consequence to users. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 669 major adult characters in the movies, 5 percent used  
illicit drugs, 25 smoked and 65 percent drank alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting concern about media violence, four members of  
Congress asked President Clinton to convene an emergency summit 
meeting at the White House with the leaders of the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Clinton, Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and  
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Reps. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Dan Burton, 
R-Ind., said school violence is a complicated issue, but ``we 
believe that media violence is contributing to this problem and we 
need the help of the entertainment community to solve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four also asked Surgeon General David Satcher to conduct a  
new study into the impact of mass media on the increase in violent 
behavior by children and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, two House Republicans, Reps. John Peterson, R-Pa., and  
James Rogan, R-Calif., introduced separate bills Wednesday that 
would establish federally funded drug testing programs in schools.

<HEADLINE> 3 Oil Cos. Sign Exploration Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Three U.S. oil companies have signed an agreement  
to explore for oil in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
	Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev said Tuesday at a signing  
ceremony in Washington that the three projects -- headed by Exxon 
Corp., Mobil Corp. and Moncrief Oil International -- could mean $10 
billion in investment over the next 30 years for the Caspian Sea 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Exxon affiliate Exxon Exploration signed a deal  
with Production Caspian Sea Ltd. to explore a 250-square-mile block 
in a deepwater portion of the Caspian Sea about 75 miles from Baku, 
the Azerbaijani capital. 
</P>
<P>
	K.T. ``Terry'' Koonce, president of the Exxon affiliate, told  
the Houston Chronicle his company plans to start operations in the 
Caspian Sea soon. The company plans drilling tests to confirm the 
presence of hydrocarbons in the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon will hold a 30 percent stake in the project. Azerbaijan's  
state-owned oil company, Socar, will hold a 50 percent interest and 
a yet-to-be-named third oil company will hold the remaining 20 
percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil will explore a 316-square-mile,  
deepwater block about 130 miles south of Baku. The newspaper 
reported Mobil already has committed to conduct seismic work on the 
project and drill at least two wells over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth-based Moncrief will explore an onshore block in the  
Kura River Valley, about 60 miles southwest of Baku. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Exxon and Mobil already are involved in the Caspian region.  
</P>
<P>
	Exxon is one of 11 partners in the Azerbaijan International  
Operating Co., which is developing an estimated 5 billion barrels 
of crude oil trapped in the huge Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli 
offshore fields. Mobil has conducted seismic work for the Oguz 
offshore block and is expected to drill its first well in the area 
in two years.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Head Leaves Internet Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials claimed victory Wednesday  
in round one of their battle with business over future Internet 
taxes when a corporate executive stepped down from a panel created 
by Congress to examine the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Netscape Communications chief James Barksdale to  
resign from the panel allowed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., to appoint another local official and restore the 
private-public balance originally envisioned by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a solid victory for counties and local government,''  
said Betty Lou Ward, president of the National Association of 
Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lott's move, the National Association of Counties and U.S.  
Conference of Mayors agreed to drop a federal lawsuit that has 
prevented the 19-member panel from meeting. It was supposed to 
begin work in December and now will tentatively hold its first 
meeting June 22 in Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce was created last  
year when Congress passed a three-year moratorium on new Internet 
taxes. The panel's purpose is to recommend by next year the 
international, federal, state and local tax policy for fast-growing 
online commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contended the original appointments by congressional  
leaders violated the law by naming too few people from state and 
local governments -- and one too many from business. That imbalance, 
state and local officials said, could have skewed the panel's 
recommendations in favor of business and hurt legitimate tax 
interests of their governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott replaced Barksdale with Delna Jones, a county commissioner  
in Washington County, Ore., who is also a former Oregon state 
legislator. She spent 30 years with U.S. West Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Barksdale agreed to step aside, Lott said in a statement,  
because ``the issues surrounding the Internet are too important to 
let the commission's business be delayed any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor was Netscape's recent acquisition by America  
Online, and AOL President Robert Pittman is already on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia's Republican Gov. James Gilmore is expected to become  
chairman of the commission, which also includes top executives from 
AT&AMP;T, MCI and Gateway, as well as Washington's Democratic Gov. Gary 
Locke, Dallas' Democratic Mayor Ron Kirk and Utah's Republican Gov. 
Mike Leavitt.

<HEADLINE> Rebecca Pidgeon Builds U.S. Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Skim through Rebecca Pidgeon's press clippings  
and you'll find husband David Mamet's name in almost every story. 
That's understandable. For almost a decade, she has been cast in 
supporting roles in his plays and films. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading various interviews, it becomes clear that Pidgeon wants  
to establish herself in the United States as an actress, singer and 
songwriter -- not as Mrs. Mamet. The stories indicate a certain 
resistance -- even bristling -- at the mention of his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it is only mildly surprising when Pidgeon refers to ``my  
husband'' when talking about her role in Mamet's new film, ``The 
Winslow Boy.'' After all, Pidgeon's name and face are more familiar 
to American audiences since her starring role in Mamet's 1998 film, 
``The Spanish Prisoner,'' opposite Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Pidgeon left a successful career in London after her marriage to  
Mamet in 1991. She disbanded her British band Ruby Blue for a solo 
career in America and began auditioning for acting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if it was ``very intense'' to work with her husband  
on ``The Winslow Boy,'' Pidgeon shook her head and smiled: ``Not 
really. Actually, it's fun and comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mamet wasn't the only relative on the set. Pidgeon's brother  
Matthew plays one of her brothers in the film. ``Working with my 
brother was great,'' she said. ``It was his first film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did working with his accomplished sister intimidate him?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh gawd, no, no, no,'' replied Pidgeon. ``We had a laugh.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The Winslow Boy,'' set in 1910, was adapted by Mamet from  
Terence Rattigan's play. The film is based on the real-life story 
of a young naval cadet (Guy Edwards), who is accused of stealing a 
five-shilling postal order. Together with their father (Nigel 
Hawthorne), Pidgeon tries to persuade England's leading lawyer to 
take the case in her brother's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	With little hope for success, the family's comfort is sacrificed  
in pursuit of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pidgeon plays a suffragette, ``I did not do factual  
research because I wanted it to be sort of alive and in the moment, 
our own interpretation, and I think everybody came to it with that, 
nobody came to it with an academic perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She described the film as a ``movie about personal interactions  
more than a historical document, and actually, you know, it came 
very easily to me. I had brilliant actors to work with. And it was 
a joy, it was just a joy. And we sat around and gabbed. I went to 
the same drama school as Gemma Jones, so we had a lot to talk about 
with that, and we became like a little family unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Hawthorne (``The Madness of King George,'' ``Amistad'')  
and Jones (``Sense and Sensibility''), the film stars Jeremy 
Northam (``Emma,'' ``Amistad'') as the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart was beating slightly faster when I first met Nigel  
and Gemma because they are both rather heroes of mine,'' Pidgeon 
said. ``Nigel is one of the first members of the theater in 
Britain. He's a very, very respected actor, he's like royalty, in 
fact, he just got knighted, I think. And also Gemma, she's so 
beautiful and she's so great. So when you meet these idols, you 
tend to get a little bit weak-kneed at first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pidgeon, 33, was born in Cambridge, Mass., where her British  
father was employed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
When she was 5, her family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland. She was 
trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Mamet live in Cambridge and Vermont. On a brisk, spring  
day in New York, while on a media tour to promote ``The Winslow 
Boy,'' Pidgeon looked remarkably rested and composed for a woman 
who has a newborn son and a young daughter at home. 
</P>
<P>
	What would she like audiences to take away from the film?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to enjoy it. It's such a compelling story. And  
kind of a universal theme, I think, because it's about fighting for 
principles, and at what point do we decide that fighting for 
principles has become arrogant and do we just get on with our 
lives? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also about a happy family with this outside, unforeseen,  
out-of-the-blue event that comes along, just like financial 
reversal or death. These things do crop up in our lives, our lives 
are not in our control, and so how does the family respond and what 
happens to them? It's such food for thought. It's complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her theater work includes Mamet's ``Oleanna'' with William H.  
Macy in New York. Earlier in her career, she appeared in Mamet's 
``Speed-the-Plow'' in London. 
</P>
<P>
	She also had supporting roles in Mamet's ``The Water Engine,'' a  
1992 television movie, and ``Homicide,'' a 1991 action thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	Does Pidgeon have a preference for stage or film?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not really, I find them so vastly different. The discipline is  
so different with each.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pidgeon will star in Mamet's new play, ``Boston Marriage,''  
scheduled to premiere at the American Repertory Theatre in 
Cambridge June 4-27. 
</P>
<P>
	``... Hopefully we'll take that to London,'' she said. ``I want  
to get back to my old stomping ground and get back into the theater 
there. It would be thrilling for me to do that, and it's such a 
wonderful play. I miss the theater, with that kind of culture 
there, which we don't have in America.'' 
</P>

	Would she ever consider moving to Hollywood?

would become addicted in a way that could detract from the things 
that I find are really important to me. Hollywood life is 
all-consuming. It's breakfast, lunch, dinner and the party you go 
to that night. So I prefer to dip in and out of it. I find it 
exciting in bits and pieces.''

	How does her music work into the equation?

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks Compromise on Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is searching for a formula for  
legislation that would prevent an avalanche of lawsuits arising 
from Year 2000 computer breakdowns without eroding basic legal 
rights to redress wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of Senate leaders and key players Tuesday failed to  
resolve several remaining issues, including how to cap punitive 
damage awards so as to discourage frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding issues ``are tough. They are very difficult,''  
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the ``Y2K'' 
litigation bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``I'm not sure we will 
be able to resolve them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow companies 90 days to fix faulty computers  
before lawsuits can go forward, and encourage mediation. It would 
also put a $250,000 cap on most punitive damage awards and make it 
harder to file class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Strongly backed by the high tech industry and business groups,  
the measure is aimed at blunting what some experts warn could be 
the largest crush of lawsuits in U.S. history, a $1 trillion mass 
of litigation that could cripple the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	One potentially dangerous result of computer breakdowns -- and a  
possible source of big lawsuits -- was the subject of a House 
hearing Tuesday, where health experts acknowledged that they can't 
guarantee that hospitals and doctors will have their biomedical 
equipment -- MRI machines, pacemakers and dialysis machines -- ready 
for Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear is that some computers will mistake the year 2000 for  
1900, causing errors and breakdowns. Almost all hospitals say they 
will have their computers fixed by yearend, but Joel Willemssen of 
Congress' General Accounting Office said hospitals surveyed in 
February found that only 6 percent of medical devices and 13 
percent of information systems were Y2K-compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of McCain's bill, led by Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.,  
argue that hospitals and other businesses will, out of 
self-interest, address the problem so as to avoid losing customers 
and attracting lawsuits. Hollings said the real purpose is to 
change tort law to favor defendants trying to avoid huge penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wyden argued that there is a ``real centrist coalition''  
growing behind a bill that both protects consumers and ensures ``we 
don't have bedlam in our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said major pro-consumer changes had been made in McCain's  
original bill, such as limiting the bill to three years to make 
clear it is not changing basic tort law and eliminating punitive 
damage caps when fraud or willful negligence is involved. Language 
in the original bill that exempted company directors and officers 
from personal liability also was modified. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats are still pushing for removal of all caps on  
punitive damages and want stronger language on officer liability. 
Also at issue is language that a person is liable for damages only 
if it is determined he acted with specific intent to injure the 
plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would order  
a vote Thursday to cut off debate and move to a final vote if 
differences aren't settled before then. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those differences has nothing to do with the computer  
problem, but concerns Democratic demands they be given a chance 
soon to take up some of their priorities, including gun control 
legislation. Democrats have threatened to attach gun control 
amendments to the Y2K bill if Lott doesn't agree to their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S.96.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Takes On Afghan Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The predicament of women living under tight  
restrictions imposed by Afghanistan's Taliban government must not 
be forgotten, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go into the 21st century without doing everything  
within our power to try to stand against such human rights 
violations and against the perils of indifference,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said at a Capitol Hill luncheon honoring Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, who seized control of the government in 1996,  
follow a strict and disputed interpretation of Islamic law that 
requires women to wear the burqa, a garment covering them from head 
to toe, while out in public or risk being beaten. Women must stay 
indoors unless accompanied by a close male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``When women are savagely beaten by so-called religious police  
for not being fully covered by the burqa or for making noises while 
they walk, we know that it is not just the physical beating that is 
the objective. It is the destruction of the spirit of those women 
as well,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has banned girls from going to school. Male  
doctors are prohibited from treating sick women in Afghanistan, and 
women are not allowed to work, let alone practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of Afghanistan, while other women are moving  
forward, are being pushed brutally backward in time,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group Physicians for Human Rights honored Feinstein for her  
work on the issue a day after it released a report critical of 
diminishing health care and human rights for women in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we honor especially what (Feinstein) has done to bring  
to public attention and work toward the end of the widespread 
violations of women's rights in Afghanistan,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein has spearheaded efforts to pass a Senate resolution  
calling for an end to the abuse of woman and girls in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told the story of an Afghan teacher who was shot to  
death this month in front of her students after refusing to close 
down a home school for girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives living in refugee camps in Pakistan told human rights  
observers the woman was shot in the head and stomach in front of 
about 40 students and her family after Taliban militia burst into 
her home demanding that the school be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can honor her memory ... by not forgetting her story and  
her willingness to stand against the forces of violence and 
oppression,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of Afghan women and girls has worsened in the past  
year with the addition of new restrictions, the report said. 
Foreign humanitarian groups have been expelled from the country and 
the government has closed the few health care facilities that were 
open to women.

<HEADLINE> 49er Arraigned on Rape Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers backup  
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was booked today on a charge that he 
raped a student at Virginia Tech during a return to his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, the Hokies' quarterback at the height of their  
football success, was released on a $10,000 bond after an 
arraignment in Montgomery County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ray Grubbs scheduled a jury trial for July 19. He told  
Druckenmiller he understood he planned to plead innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that your understanding?'' Grubbs asked the defendant.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, your honor,'' Druckenmiller replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 240-pound quarterback had no comment as he and his  
attorney entered the courtroom, but when he left the county jail 
after being processed, he said, ``I am innocent and that's all I've 
got to say right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is accused of raping the student on March 4  
between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at a house during a visit to Blacksburg. 
The woman testified before a grand jury on April 13 and the 
indictment was unsealed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller has said he is certain he will be vindicated and  
confident he will be available to play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Druckenmiller, David Neufeld, said last week  
that Druckenmiller had been aggressively pursued by his accuser. 
Neufeld said Druckenmiller and the woman had consensual sex and 
that Druckenmiller later took and passed a lie-detector test about 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a strong-armed passer, was the 49ers' top pick  
and the 26th selection overall in the 1997 draft. Coach Steve 
Mariucci proclaimed him the team's quarterback of the future, but 
he has played little. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, Druckenmiller played in four games, one as a  
starter, and completed 21 of 52 passes for 239 yards and one 
touchdown. But he also threw three interceptions, two inside the 
opponent's 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he lost the No. 1 backup quarterback job to Ty  
Detmer.

<HEADLINE> Inspectors Find Bacteria at Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite admonitions last fall to intensely  
monitor the problem, safety inspectors again found ``a potentially 
hazardous'' level of Legionnaires' bacteria in the congressional 
facility that supplies heating and cooling to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal citation demanded tests at least monthly.  
</P>
<P>
	The facility, called the Capitol Power Plant, was cited by  
Congress' own independent inspectors -- who told the Architect of 
the Capitol seven months ago to monitor the situation after high 
concentrations of the bacteria were found in a separate part of the 
plant, which also services congressional office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The new concentrations were found in a cooling tower that was  
found by inspectors last fall to be ``in very poor condition'' and 
``should be replaced as soon as possible.'' In the meantime, 
``intensive maintenance is needed,'' an inspection report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The citation, issued last week, was obtained Tuesday by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also obtained a separate citation to the architect's  
office last week, issued for failure to provide railings on steep 
ramps on the Capitol roof. The citation said the condition 
presented a serious danger for police officers who raise and lower 
the flag every day and maintenance workers who use rooftop 
mechanical shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,000-employee Architect's office was told to install the  
safety railings in 60 days. A previous citation also was issued for 
this problem. 
</P>
<P>
	AP could not immediately reach an architect official for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors said the system used in the heating-cooling  
facility would not send the deadly bacteria through the vents to 
congressional offices. However, the concentrations were at ``a 
potentially hazardous'' level for workers at the plant, the 
citation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of the Capitol has been a growing concern. AP has  
reported previously that the Office of Compliance found health and 
safety conditions so bad in Congress that a ``potential 
catastrophe'' loomed. A month later, the House inspector general 
said the Capitol complex was a firetrap. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors found that Architect workers risked  
blood-transmitted diseases by digging through contaminated trash 
without protective clothing and recalcitrant officials had to be 
issued citations to move flammable liquids stored in dangerous 
places. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, inspectors found 14 additional health and safety  
violations at the power plant unrelated to the Legionnaires' 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview, Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman  
dismissed the ``firetrap'' description as ``journalistic 
hyperbole'' and said major work is underway to test the fire system 
and replace faulty equipment. And Architect officials have said 
they are making ``great strides'' in trying to change a culture of 
neglect on health and safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the AP stories ran, the American Federation of State,  
County and Municipal Employees, which represents many of the 
Architect's employees, sent a letter to Congress demanding hearings 
on Congress' workplace safety problems. The letter was sent to Rep. 
William Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Committee on House 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's international president, Gerald McEntee, said  
hearings should explore instances in which workers were forced ``to 
crawl through garbage'' without protective gear, use vacuum 
cleaners ``with faulty, exposed wires,'' and the absence of safety 
instruction signs, ``resulting in employee exposure to blood or 
other potential infectious materials.''

<HEADLINE> Elderly Bank Robber Nabbed in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 78-year-old man who escaped from San  
Quentin Prison in a makeshift kayak 20 years ago was captured in 
Florida on bank robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrest Silva Tucker, whose criminal record stretches back to  
the 1930s, was arrested last week in a school parking lot near 
Pompano Beach. He was jailed without bail in connection with a 
local bank holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Tucker and two other inmates at San Quentin built a  
crude boat and set out from the beach. The flimsy vessel, assembled 
from plastic sheets, wood, duct tape and Formica, held together 
long enough for them to paddle several hundred yards to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker had been serving time at San Quentin for a string of bank  
robberies in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested in Boston a few years after his escape, but  
somehow authorities didn't realize that he still had time to serve 
in California, and he was freed. Over the next few years, 
Massachusetts officials said, Tucker joined the Over-the-Hill Gang, 
a group of elderly thieves who robbed supermarkets in the Boston 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was visiting a girlfriend in Florida last week when  
authorities caught up with him. He tried to get away but crashed 
his vehicle into a palm tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the car, investigators found burglary tools, weapons,  
police scanners and a large amount of cash.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Hit Three Straight Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen, Rico Brogna and Ron Gant hit  
consecutive home runs off Cincinnati's Brett Tomko in the first 
inning of the Philadelphia Phillies' game against the Reds on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia had not hit three straight homers since July 26,  
1987, when Milt Thompson, Von Hayes and Mike Schmidt connected 
against Atlanta's Doyle Alexander in the eighth inning at Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With two outs and none one, Rolen hit a liner to left-center  
field for his seventh homer of the season. Brogna followed with a 
drive to right for his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, in an 0-for-10 slide and hitting just .121, followed with  
an inside-the-park homer. The ball went off the wall in 
right-center, bounced off the foot of centerfielder Mike Cameron 
and rolled into the right field corner as Gant sped around the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gant's second homer of the season and the third  
inside-the-parker of his career. Gant became the first Phillies 
player to hit one since Juan Bell did it against Chicago on Sept. 
24, 1992.

<HEADLINE> Vine Uses Petals To Lure Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Central American vine that relies on bats for pollination  
attracts them by using its flower petals like tiny satellite dishes 
to bounce the animals' sonar signals back at them, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mucuna vine is believed to be the first plant species found  
to use such a mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	Bats navigate by bouncing signals off of objects. The signal is  
so high-pitched it is not audible to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that each blossom of the Mucuna vine contains  
a special petal with a concave acoustical ``mirror.'' The petal 
directs signals back toward any nectar-feeding bat that chirps in 
its direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery was made by Dagmar and Otto von Helversen, a  
husband-and-wife team from the University of Erlangen in Germany. 
They reported their findings in today's issue of the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very elegant, very interesting, very beautiful  
story, and if other researchers verify this, it will appear in all 
biology textbooks as a classic example of adaptive evolution,'' 
said Karl Niklas, a professor of plant biology at Cornell 
University and editor in chief of the American Journal of Botany. 
</P>
<P>
	The von Helversens tested their theory by removing the acoustic  
guide petals from some blossoms and stuffing others with cotton 
pads. They found that 20 percent or less of those blossoms were 
visited by bats, compared with about 75 percent of the untouched 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The vine grows along creeks and in rain forests. Its short-lived  
2-inch-long, whitish-green flowers are timed to open every half 
hour to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The acoustic device rises into its reflective position only when  
the night-blooming flowers are ripe for pollinating, thereby 
discouraging bats from visiting a flower that isn't ready to give 
up its pollen.

<HEADLINE> Can Bradley Give Gore a Race? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- In his uphill campaign against Al Gore for  
the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley is picking up 
a bit of what politicians call ``traction.'' He's getting more 
attention than seemed likely a short time ago and even Gore 
advisers say he has made the race competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the guy everywhere,'' says Iowa Democratic Chairman Rob  
Tully. ``He's able to fly under the radar screen better than the 
vice president can. I think he's going to make it a spirited 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore loyalists dismiss the phenomenon as nothing more than ``the  
Bradley boomlet,'' a label applied by one of them, Chicago 
political consultant David Axelrod. They see it as a brief and 
media-driven frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Axelrod conceded that Bradley ``is going to be  
competitive. I've always felt that Bradley had the potential to 
make some noise in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator is getting a new look from  
liberals and those who worry that Gore is too cautious; last week, 
liberal Paul Wellstone of Minnesota became the first senator to 
endorse Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Tully said he's been traveling the state and keeps crossing  
paths with Bradley, who is quietly building a network, making 
low-key, grassroots appearances in the important early states. 
While he can't match Gore's blue-chip roster of backers, he can 
spend hours rubbing shoulders in places like Iowa and New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly aware of that, Gore has picked up the pace of his  
campaign, beefing up his schedule and refocusing his style. He's 
paying attention to rubbing shoulders with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday, Gore waved off the prospect of a  
Bradley threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fully aware of how campaigns evolve over time,'' said  
Gore. ``Some who haven't been through these things before sometimes 
misinterpret the snapshots of the moment and don't see the moving 
picture of the entire campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very comfortable with where things are,'' he added.  
``I'll let others analyze the opposition. I don't have any unkind 
words for the opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some say it was inevitable that the race would turn competitive,  
even though Gore has the backing of virtually all of the Democratic 
establishment and access to the White House political network. 
</P>
<P>
	History is on his side, too. A sitting vice president hasn't  
been denied the nomination since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think there's an inevitability of the Democratic  
nominating process, which is people like competition and they like 
having a real race,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant in 
California who advises Gore. ``And they're more inclined to be for 
outsiders and insurgents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have picked up on that. They are keeping a closer  
eye on Bradley and have begun including questions about him in 
their polling. Gore aides dismiss that as a GOP effort to hurt Gore 
by building up his rival. 
</P>
<P>
	But some recent polls show Bradley as close as 20 points to  
Gore, half the gap of earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential  
nominating season, Bradley aides say his crowds have been big. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a natural advantage in this process,'' said Iowa's  
Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack. ``He can spend more time and the time 
he spends is more personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack describes himself as ``friendly'' to Bradley's effort,  
hastening to add: ``I like both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has faced challenges. A bombing campaign in  
Yugoslavia and President Clinton's affair with a White House intern 
and brush with impeachment have made it tough for Gore to break out 
on his own. There have been complaints that Gore relies too heavily 
on a tight inner circle, few of whom have presidential campaign 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all that, Gore has huge assets.  
</P>
<P>
	Axelrod said Gore has two national campaigns under his belt and  
the weight of the party's establishment behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``At these early stages, Bradley is going to wear well, but  
later on it's going to be tough,'' Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana Strother, a nonaligned Democratic strategist, dismissed  
Bradley's early fund-raising success, arguing that raising about $5 
million amounts to tapping a few friends. That's pocket change 
compared with the other $25 million Bradley must raise to be 
competitive, Strother said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley says he has big ideas,'' said Strother. ``But let  
me tell you, big money will beat big ideas.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A black man who said he suffered brain damage  
after police officers mistook him for a knife-wielding suspect and 
beat him will receive a $2.75 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Dusenbury, 42, of Willingboro, N.J., settled his lawsuit  
against the city Tuesday, a day before it was to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Wednesday, he called the settlement ``a  
small victory'' and added, ``I still have to live with this memory. 
... I still have nightmares about this ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dusenbury said he was walking to work at a Greenwich Village  
construction site on July 25, 1996, when police drove their squad 
car onto a curb and pinned him against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer jumped on him and knocked his head into a gate. At  
least four other officers joined in, beating and kicking him in the 
head, the lawsuit charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Dusenbury said the officers used racial slurs and accused him of  
being a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the beating left him with permanent physical injuries,  
including brain damage, that make it impossible for him to work. 
Police said he was initially stopped because officers thought he 
fit the description of a man who brandished a knife in nearby 
Washington Square Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office concluded that the officers had  
made a regrettable mistake but had not committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the city will use $1 million of the  
award to purchase an annuity that will yield an additional $2.5 
million. That will bring the eventual value of the settlement to 
about $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	City lawyers denied that the settlement had anything to do with  
the politically charged climate sparked by the February shooting of 
Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man killed when he was hit by 19 of 
41 bullets fired at him by police. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dusenbury's attorney, Jonathan Moore, said the Diallo case  
helped drive the settlement. ``They didn't want to go to trial with 
this case in this atmosphere,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Headlines $14M GOP Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last Republican president is helping the  
GOP raise $14 million to try to win back the White House, and the 
beneficiary may be his son, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush was the big draw at the Republican  
National Committee's annual black-tie gala Wednesday night, which 
party officials said would set a fund-raising record. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush is the front-runner for the GOP presidential  
nomination, and a financially flush Republican Party would be a 
boon to whomever is the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is essential that we put a Republican in the  
White House,'' the former president told the crowd. ``We have good 
people who are running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An energized party is going to help Republicans all across the  
country,'' said Governor Bush's campaign spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor did not attend the gathering because he was in  
Austin for the Texas legislative session. But Republican 
presidential hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire and Sen. John McCain of Arizona all 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among the 1,200 guests who dined on crab cakes and  
herb-crusted tenderloin of beef and heard Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., say, ``I'm counting on you to win the 
victories that we need to win for our country in the next four 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate tickets to the event were $2,000. Individuals and  
political action committees paid $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's gala brought in $11 million. Republican National  
Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson attributed this year's expected 
larger payday to the GOP's hopes of recapturing the White House in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a growing zeal to win back the White House,''  
Nicholson said in an interview. ``This party is really coming 
together with an ardent desire to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said some of the money the party is raising now may be  
used during the presidential campaign next year to air issue 
advertisements touting the Republican message. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the nominee becomes apparent, which will be in  
mid-March, we can assist our nominee in getting the message out to 
the American people,'' Nicholson said. ``Whoever is the nominee 
will be broke. I don't want our party broke. We can then start 
advertising the Republican message to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Republicans and Democrats aired millions of dollars in  
issue ads during the 1996 campaign on behalf of their presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Election Commission auditors recommended last December  
that President Clinton repay $7 million and Republican nominee Bob 
Dole pay back $17.7 million in federal funds that went to their 
1996 presidential bids, saying both illegally benefited from the 
ads. But the commission threw out the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's fund-raiser did not sit well with a watchdog  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of the trend of the trend of these mega  
fund-raisers,'' said Donald Simon of Common Cause, a group that 
favors changing the campaign finance laws. ``In one night, a party 
will raise millions of dollars, much of it in money that is 
supposed to be illegal under federal law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was referring to ``soft money,'' the unregulated donations  
from corporations, unions and individuals that do not fall under 
federal rules and aren't supposed to be spent directly on federal 
campaigns. The event also raises ``hard money'' contributions that 
fall within giving limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The income from the fund-raiser is in addition to $19.7 million  
the RNC raised through March 31, including $7.4 million in soft 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction company executive Alexander G. Spanos gave the  
party $250,000 last month, while real estate developer Lawrence 
Kadish gave $150,000 and MCI WorldCom contributed $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also received a  
$250,000 donation last month, from the Communication Workers of 
America, according to its FEC report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee is not scheduled to report its  
fund-raising figures until July.

<HEADLINE> Walker Hits 3 Homers, Drives in 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies hit his  
first three home runs of the season and drove in eight runs 
Wednesday night against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker hit three-run homers in his first two at-bats against  
Jose Jimenez. After singling in the fifth, he hit a two-run homer 
off Scott Radinsky in the seventh for a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to tie the major league mark for home runs in a  
game, Walker grounded out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied a team record for RBIs in a game set by Andres  
Galarraga on June 27, 1996, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has 
one other three-homer game, on April 5, 1997, at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker missed the first seven games of the season with a  
strained rib-cage muscle. He had his first multi-RBI game Tuesday 
with an RBI double and a sacrifice fly and entered the game with no 
homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first visiting player to hit three homers at Busch  
Stadium since Larry Parrish of Montreal on May 29, 1977.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Bills Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would make it harder for  
people to erase their debts in bankruptcy court advanced in the 
Senate though a key issue over providing credit card users 
information remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee voted, 14-4, on Tuesday to  
approve a bill to rewrite the bankruptcy laws and send it to the 
full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, meanwhile, a parallel bipartisan bill  
cleared the House Judiciary Committee today on a 22-13 vote. It 
could be voted on by the House next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, being pushed by banks, credit card companies  
and retail businesses, is opposed by consumer groups, unions, civil 
rights groups and some Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate panel's vote, four Democrats opposed the bill:  
Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee's senior Democrat, and 
Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin 
and Charles Schumer of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Schumer said he planned to bring up on the Senate  
floor his proposed amendment that would require credit card 
companies to clearly disclose the expiration dates of introductory 
``teaser rates'' and the higher interest rates replacing them. The 
companies also would have to prominently list on consumers' monthly 
statements the fee charged for late payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The same disclosures would have to be clearly made in  
solicitations for credit card accounts made over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 7.8 million people opened credit card accounts in the last  
five years in response to Internet promotions, Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his proposal is designed to prevent consumers from  
getting over their heads in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton likely would veto a bill that did not include  
such consumer provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a preying on poor people in this country'' by credit  
card companies, said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a co-sponsor 
of the bill with Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Joseph Biden, 
D-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are concerned about the rising tide of bankruptcy.  
Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing personal 
bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up more than 
300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Big credit card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard, and  
retail-business groups say their losses from forgiven debts in 
bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for consumers 
who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation  
favors corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer's proposal falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate  
Banking Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has 
expressed opposition to such provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues also must be worked out, such as provisions related  
to reaffirmation, a practice in which consumers who file for 
bankruptcy agree to continue paying off their debt in exchange for 
keeping a credit card or merchandise bought on credit. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. pleaded guilty  
to criminal fraud and was sentenced to pay a $60 million fine for 
illegally failing to file reaffirmation agreements signed by its 
credit card customers who sought bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at Tuesday's drafting session, the Judiciary Committee:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Narrowly rejected a Schumer amendment that would have required  
bankrupt people found to have violated laws protecting abortion 
clinics to pay their penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer had cited the case of Operation Rescue founder Randall  
Terry, who filed for bankruptcy court protection in November, 
blaming heavy debts owed to women's groups and abortion clinics 
that have sued him. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Adopted, 11-5, a Grassley proposal designed to close a  
loophole that has allowed some high-profile defendants in 
securities fraud cases to shelter income from creditors by filing 
bankruptcy under the same terms as corporations.

<HEADLINE> Indians Put Shuey on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Right-handed reliever Paul Shuey was put  
on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday by the Cleveland Indians 
because of a strained left hamstring and was replaced by 
right-hander Paul Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuey, who is 2-1 with a 2.13 ERA in a team-high 11 appearances  
this season, hurt his leg throwing a pitch in the eighth inning of 
the Indians' game at Boston on Sunday. He was placed on the DL 
retroactive to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuey, who has held hitters to a .188 average this season, is on  
the disabled list for the seventh time in five seasons in the 
majors. He twice before has been sidelined with hamstring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner's contract was purchased from Buffalo of the Triple-A  
International League. He was 1-0 with a 1.04 ERA in three starts 
for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the 40-man roster for Wagner, the Indians  
transferred left-handed pitcher Tom Martin, who is recovering from 
shoulder surgery, from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day 
disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Archer Offers Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unfazed by lack of support from his own  
party's leaders, a Republican House committee chairman unveiled an 
alternative to President Clinton's Social Security rescue plan 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there are plenty of politicians on both sides  
of the aisle who don't want to touch Social Security,'' said Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. ``Our challenge is to put politics aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer has worked for weeks with Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. to  
develop a GOP Social Security plan that would use stock market 
earnings from new individual retirement accounts to finance some 
future Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the accounts would come from Social Security payroll  
taxes that are now collected in excess of what's needed to pay 
benefits to current retirees. With the huge baby boom generation in 
middle age and still working, those Social Security surpluses are 
expected to accumulate for about 15 more years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Archer aides said that once baby boomers begin  
retiring, some additional money may be needed to finance the 
accounts during a transition period -- something that could clash 
with GOP desires to offer broad income tax cuts in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, pledged in a statement to  
``take a close look'' at the Archer-Shaw proposal. But he added: 
``Make no mistake. Any efforts to enact a Social Security reform 
plan must be done in a bipartisan manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have told the party's rank-and-file that  
trying to move a GOP Social Security initiative through Congress 
before the 2000 presidential campaign would be too risky 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he will seek negotiations with the White House in  
pursuit of a bipartisan compromise based on his plan, rather than 
trying to push legislation through his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the president told Archer in a  
telephone conversation Tuesday evening that he prefers his own 
approach to reforming the nation's retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan includes having the government handle bulk  
investment of some Social Security cash reserves in the stock 
market, as well as new government-subsidized personal retirement 
accounts for low- and middle-income workers that would be in 
addition to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the president said he would examine the Archer-Shaw  
alternative and consult with congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president said was ... he appreciated that chairman  
Archer was putting forward a serious proposal ... and that if we 
had criticisms of it that they would be done in a constructive 
manner,'' said Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Democrats quickly called a news conference to  
question both Archer's intentions and the soundness of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rhetoric and in a close look it's a risky scheme,'' said  
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Archer-Shaw plan, American workers would get a tax  
credit, equal to 2 percent of their wages up to the limit of 
earnings taxed by Social Security. That limit is $72,600 this year, 
so the largest possible credit if the plan were in effect for 1999 
would be $1,452. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would go into individual ``Social Security Guarantee''  
accounts that workers could choose to invest with private 
investment firms offering what would essentially be 
government-approved mutual funds comprised of 60 percent stocks and 
40 percent bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Once workers retired, their accounts would go toward buying an  
annuity plan to help pay their Social Security benefits. For people 
whose accounts run short, the government would make up the money 
needed to give them retirement benefits equal to what Social 
Security promises now. Those whose accounts earned extra could keep 
it.

<HEADLINE> New Raisin Drying Method Succeeds / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADERA, Calif. (AP) -- Whether it's winter pruning or the fall  
harvest, the Simpson Vineyards acreage is strangely quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the busiest times of the year, raisin grower Lee S.  
Simpson III needs fewer than 10 people working on his 160-acre 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, this is not a typical raisin farm.  
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, a former civil engineer from the San Francisco Bay  
area, is on the cutting edge in raisin-growing technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Simpson, 56, admits he's far from perfecting the  
method, his dried-on-the-vine raisins are reaping record yields per 
acre while cutting down costs, most notably on labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get about 30 percent return on capital investment. Most  
people are lucky to get 5 percent,'' Simpson said. ``I'm getting 
the kind of returns Microsoft and Intel get. You just don't find 
that in the raisin industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DOV raisins are nothing new. Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley  
have been experimenting for years to find ways to dry the fruit 
before harvesting it. However, in most vineyards, farmers still 
need to hire scores of workers during harvest to hand-pick the 
fruit and lay it on paper trays. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few days, laborers are needed again to turn over the  
grapes to help them shrivel up into raisins, which takes about 
three weeks. But a slight rain can damage the crop with mold, and 
dirt can be trapped inside the folds and wrinkles of each raisin. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson has solved most of these problems with his DOV method.  
</P>
<P>
	His Fiesta grape vines stand more than 6 1/2 feet tall. Alongside  
the vines are metal stands, which anchor a system of wire trellises 
covering the entire field. 
</P>
<P>
	The canes from each vine are grown on top of the wire, creating  
a canopy of leaves and grapes that hang down. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fruit is ready for drying, workers simply cut the canes  
and leave the fruit hanging on the wires. It takes twice as long 
for DOV raisins to dry, but growers don't have to worry about rain 
since water will simply drip to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	When the raisins are ready, Simpson uses a small crew with a  
pair of modified tractors that knock the raisins into bins. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson estimates he has reduced his harvest cost from $220 per  
ton to about $28 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his methods have impressed growers all over the San  
Joaquin Valley, where most of the nation's raisins are grown, 
switching is not an option for most, some say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average age of a raisin grower is in his early 60s. He's  
not going to tear out vineyards to put in an elaborate system,'' 
said Don Nielson, 62, third-generation raisin farmer in south 
Fresno County. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun-Maid, the largest raisin cooperative in the United States,  
has patented its own version of DOV called south-side drying. This 
method places poles along existing vines with two metal rods that 
point toward the sky on either side of the pole at a 45-degree 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
	Metal wires run connect the rods and the canes hang on top of  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The south-side raisins also dry on the vine after the canes are  
cut, and the fruit is harvested by a machine.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Thai Bank Taken Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's troubled, family-owned  
Nakornthon Bank announced Wednesday that Standard Chartered Bank 
PLC will take control of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain-based Standard Chartered beat out offers by Singapore's  
United Overseas Bank in negotiations for Nakornthon, the third Thai 
bank taken over by a foreign institution since the onset of Asia's 
economic crisis in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms announced by Nakornthon said that Standard Chartered  
will inject $172 million to take an initial 68.4 percent stake, 
after a write-down of existing equity from the current 27 cents to 
0.0027 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai authorities will then inject $368 million in a swap of  
government bonds for preferred shares to cover negative equity. 
Funds from Standard Chartered will raise the initial 
recapitalization to a total of $194 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is the second Standard Chartered has made of an  
Asian bank in the past week. Earlier it agreed to take a 20 percent 
stake in Bank Bali and assume management control of the Indonesian 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of Nakornthon Bank's loans were delinquent, a problem  
shared in much of the Thai financial system since the Asian crisis 
sent the economy into recession two years ago. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Lightly Raced Colts Make a Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- History is against Desert Hero or Valhol  
winning the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Each goes into the grueling 1 1/4-mile race Saturday with just  
three career starts, all this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Derby winner not to have raced as a 2-year-old was  
Apollo in 1882. Valhol also would become only the eighth gelding 
and the first since Clyde Van Dusen in 1927 to win a Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do have the feeling that this horse is good enough to  
overcome the obstacles,'' said Richard Mandella, trainer of Desert 
Hero, winner of a maiden race and the San Rafael and third in the 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about Desert Hero's inexperience, the demanding  
distance of the race and a full field of 20 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol, who faces the same obstacles, also had to overcome a  
legal barrier just to get into the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby on April 11 at Oaklawn Park for  
his first win. However, the purse distribution had been held up 
pending an investigation into whether winning jockey Billy Patin 
had an electrical device during the race. A hearing is scheduled 
for May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, an Arkansas judge ruled the first-place money of  
$300,000 from the Arkansas Derby should be awarded to owner James 
Jackson. Without the money the gelding would not have been able to 
get into the Derby, limited to 20 starters based on money earned in 
graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Martinez will ride Valhol in the 125th edition of the  
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vindication is yet to come,'' Jackson said after the hearing.  
``The horse did no wrong, and we were being penalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the horse will embarrass us,'' trainer Dallas  
Keen said Wednesday from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol, who was gelded before he ever raced, didn't start as  
2-year-old because of shin problems. Desert Hero was supposed to 
make his debut last fall, but he couldn't because of a minor foot 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of 1993 Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero won his first  
start Feb. 7 and followed with a neck victory over Prime Timber in 
the mile San Rafael on Feb. 28 at Santa Anita. Prime Timber is one 
of two colts with whom trainer Bob Baffert will try to win a third 
straight Derby. The other is Santa Anita Derby winner General 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also entered the filly Excellent Meeting, but it was  
possible she could start Friday in the Kentucky Oaks for which she 
also was entered. Should she be scratched from the Derby, there 
would be only 19 starters because there is no also-eligible list. 
</P>
<P>
	After Desert Hero won the San Rafael, his owner, Prince Ahmed  
Salman of Saudi Arabia, took him from trainer Wally Dollase and 
gave him to Mandella. Philosophical differences were cited for the 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero finished seven lengths behind General Challenge and  
3 3/4 lengths behind Prime Timber in the 1 1-8-mile Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was mediocre race by all standards,'' Mandella said. ``He  
didn't get much out of it. But it was only his third race, so he 
had a right to get mixed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella said he would have liked to get another start for  
Desert Hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had had the horse long and had been more confident of  
running him and not hurting him,'' said Mandella, who will be 
trying to win his first Derby in his fourth try. ``I didn't want to 
take the chance of using the horse too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Desert Hero is inexperienced, Mandella is encouraged.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is a good horse,'' he said. ``Good horses have a way of  
making things happen.''

<HEADLINE> Publishers Urged To Move Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Newspapers need to invest much more in research  
and new ventures if they are to succeed in the world of the 
Internet, three Wall Street analysts told publishers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newspapers need to move faster,'' Lauren Rich Fine, a first  
vice president and managing director at Merrill Lynch in New York, 
told publishers at the newspaper Association of America annual 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gruneich, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns in  
New York, told publishers to stop moving ``so cautiously'' and to 
aggressively reinvest their capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industries and markets are moving while interest rates are  
low and capital is plentiful, but newspapers have been oddly quiet, 
said Gruneich said. ``It seems like this is the year of the pin 
drop in the newspaper industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers should reinvest much more than the 2 percent of  
excess capital they historically put into research and development, 
Gruneich said. They also should invest in newspaper-Internet 
cross-promotions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine recommended big pushes for circulation, and to get readers  
to value and pay more for local content. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers' assets include penetration of their local markets,  
unique content, editing talent and local databases of subscribers, 
the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penetration is going to be the most important thing you have  
to sell off of,'' as media becomes more fragmented, said William 
Drewry, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Wall Street hasn't rewarded newspapers with higher  
valuation for investing in Internet ventures, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drewry and Fine suggested newspapers with strong online brands,  
such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, spin off 
and sell stakes in their Internet businesses to capture some of the 
``funny money'' investors are betting on Internet ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street is willing to underwrite those efforts,'' Fine  
said. ``You should go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The analysts' other observations included:  
</P>
<P>
	--If Congress lifts restrictions on cross-ownership of newspaper  
and broadcast media, Wall Street will become a ``raging bull'' 
toward newspaper stocks. TV and newspapers would consolidate to own 
local markets and save costs by pooling 24-hour reporting 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	--New media threaten to hire away newspaper editorial talent, one  
of the industry's major assets, said Fine, who also advocated 
consolidating with TV stations in order to gain their talent pool. 
``One of the greatest values you all have today is your 
journalists, and I would hang onto them,'' Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Newspapers differ from Intel and other volatile, high-tech  
companies because newspapers have proprietary content that is 
expensive to produce. ``Work hard to protect that,'' Drewry said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Newsprint prices are likely to stay flat for some time, the  
analysts said, because the lag in Asia's recovery has depressed 
demand there, and conversions to narrower, 50-inch webs on printing 
presses will reduce demand in the United States. But publishers 
shouldn't hope for prices to stay too low, too long, because that 
would prompt producers to cut capacity and costs would rise over 
the long run, Drewry said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Analysts expect to see continued mergers among newspaper  
companies as long as the market continues to favor stocks of larger 
companies.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Posts Big Rise in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.'s earnings  
nearly doubled in the first quarter led by a sales surge at Pizza 
Hut restaurants where a New York-style pizza was being introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-food restaurant company earned $106 million, or 66  
cents a share, in the three months ended March 20 compared to $54 
million, or 35 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 6 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion a year  
earlier, due mainly to store closings and the sale of company-owned 
stores to franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	But systemwide sales including sales at restaurants owned by the  
company and by franchisees rose 5 percent to $4.81 billion from 
$4.56 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Pizza Hut restaurants open at least a year rose 14  
percent as the chain introduced The Big New Yorker pizza. Sales at 
Taco Bell and KFC restaurants open at least a year rose 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrall Pearson, Tricon's chairman and chief executive, said new  
pizza was ``the most successful new product launch'' in Pizza Hut's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest earnings included 12 cents a share from the sale of  
restaurants to franchisees. Excluding that, operating earnings per 
share was 54 cents, a penny higher than the 53 cents a share 
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Barish, restaurant analyst for BancBoston Robertson  
Stephens, said all three restaurant brands ``are showing 
improvements and it's looking like that will continue into the 
second quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a combination of good operations, good promotions and  
new product offerings. When you get all three of those aligned, it 
tends to have good results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	KFC's higher same-store sales were driven in part by demand for  
Honey Bar-B-Que Wings, Extra Crispy chicken and the promotion of 
Popcorn Chicken during the NCAA basketball tournament, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taco Bell's sales growth stemmed in part from the promotion of  
its popular talking Chihuahua plush toy and expansion of its 
Gorditas line. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon's also reported robust sales abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	Pearson predicted continued strong performance in the second  
quarter as the company unveils promotions tied to the new Star Wars 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Tricon shares closed down $3.12 1/2 at $66 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Howard, restaurant analyst at Hilliard Lyons, said the drop  
in Tricon's stock was due in part to a perception that the 
company's net earnings may not be as robust in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard to duplicate 100 percent growth,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mich. To Begin Welfare Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Welfare applicants in three areas of  
Michigan will soon be required to take drug tests before receiving 
benefits under a law signed Wednesday by Gov. John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot program to begin Oct. 1 is believed to be the first in  
the nation to require drug tests of all applicants at specified 
welfare offices, said Bill Kordenbrock, an official with the state 
Family Independence Agency, which administers welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing is needed to make sure drug use doesn't provide a  
stumbling block to moving off welfare, Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some ... substance abuse remains a barrier to  
independence,'' he said. ``This program will help us identify these 
individuals and provide them with the incentive to change their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not determined which areas of the state will take  
part in the program, said Doug Howard, the agency's director. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Michigan will use Medicaid funds to provide  
treatment for those who screen positive for drugs. Anyone refusing 
treatment will face at least a partial loss of welfare benefits, 
and applicants who refuse to take the test will have their benefits 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups and welfare advocates have said  
across-the-board drug testing of anyone who applies for welfare 
unfairly discriminates against the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Governor Engler was truly concerned about making sure  
welfare applicants could get jobs, he would also be looking at 
factors such as alcohol abuse, and literacy and homelessness,'' 
said Wendy Wagenheim of the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Michigan. ``This is just one, and it's strictly punitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Engler said the testing will help identify drug users and  
``provide them with the incentive to change their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new law requires drug tests to be given to welfare  
applicants statewide beginning April 1, 2003. But the pilot program 
could show statewide drug testing is not needed, Howard said.

<HEADLINE>  Dubai Duo Takes Aim on Ky. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- So far, the trainer hasn't been around,  
nor have the owners. And the assistant trainer made only a brief 
stop at Barn 45, where Godolphin Stables' Worldly Manner and Aljabr 
are stabled at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this any way to get ready for the Kentucky Derby?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' said Eric Coatrieux, an assistant to  
Tom Albertrani, who is the assistant to trainer Saeed bin Suroor -- 
who probably won't show up at the Derby because he's saddling 
horses in Saturday's 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheikhs who run Godolphin Stable, the Dubai arm of Sheikh  
Maktoum al Maktoum's and Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's racing 
empire, have decided they want to win the Derby. And they want to 
win it their way, by privately training horses at their track in 
the desert and keeping them out of traditional Derby prep races. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that also means leaving their first Derby horses in the  
care of the third-string handler, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Worldly Manner, purchased for $5 million from John and  
Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm last fall, nor Aljabr, bred on the 
sheikhs' Shadwell Farm near Lexington, Ky., has raced as a 
3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they ran March 21 in a private trial race in Dubai.  
Worldly Manner, trained by Bob Baffert before the sale, was first 
and Aljabr second in a field of 10. If either wins Saturday, it 
would mark the first time since Regret in 1915 that a horse has won 
the Derby without racing as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is an interesting twist, isn't it?'' said trainer Bill  
Mott, who has been to the desert and won the Dubai World Cup twice 
with Cigar. ``They know what they're doing, they have all the tools 
to get it done, but we'll just have to see if it's enough. It'll 
make the race a little more intriguing, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godolphin is one of the strongest stables worldwide, but it's  
just starting to dabble in Derby fever. This might be the 125th 
Kentucky Derby, but it's Derby No. 1 for the sheikhs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to come back to Kentucky and win the  
Derby,'' Sheikh Mohammed said last month at a news conference in 
Dubai. ``Since we formed Godolphin, we didn't think we had the 
horse. Now we do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby is the most difficult race to win and this  
is the main challenge for us. We know how important it is, but if 
we don't try it, we can't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't win, it won't be on account of a money shortage.  
They secured Jerry Bailey to ride Worldly Manner, and the jockey 
reportedly is guaranteed an upfront payment of $70,000, the winning 
jockey's take from the $1 million Derby purse. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas, who sends out Cat Thief and Charismatic in  
search of his fourth Derby win, says it's tough to buy the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dubai group, by my arithmetic alone, have spent some $20  
million to get horses to the Derby, and that doesn't guarantee 
anything,'' said Lukas. ``It's not money geniuses or computers 
trying to make marriages in heaven, either. There are so many 
intangibles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why it's tough to figure what might happen when the  
gate springs open and an expected full field of 20 3-year-olds go 
1 1/4 miles for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the way they're taking it as a challenge,'' said Nick  
Zito, who trains Derby horses Adonis and Stephen Got Even. ``They 
have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but they are putting a new 
spin on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if one wins?  
</P>
<P>
	``If they win, you must take your hat off to them,'' said Zito.  
</P>
<P>
	If workouts count, there's been no indication that Worldly  
Manner, clearly the better of the Godolphin colts, is capable of 
winning the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Worldly Manner and Aljabr were far from impressive.  
Worldly Manner, who won three of four starts in California as a 
2-year-old, went 7 furlongs in a plodding 1:29 4-5. Aljabr, 3-for-3 
in races in England and France, worked 5 furlongs in 1:04. On 
Tuesday, both galloped 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, a two-time Derby winner, saw the good side of Worldly  
Manner's Sunday workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He finished unbelievable,'' said Bailey. ``He was very  
willing, handled the track well and was very relaxed the entire 
time. I always felt like there was something there if I asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Desormeaux, who was aboard Derby and Preakness winner Real  
Quiet in 1998, gets the ride aboard Aljabr should Baffert's filly 
Excellent Meeting not be entered today in the Derby. Desormeaux was 
aboard Worldly Manner in the colt's last race in the United States 
-- a win in the Del Mar Futurity in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a rangy colt, and definitely has what it takes to win a  
Kentucky Derby,'' Desormeaux said of Worldly Manner. ``He's got 
long, fluid strides, and he's powerful. The only question, like 
with the others, is the stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Derby question was answered Tuesday, when a judge in  
Little Rock, Ark., cleared the way for Arkansas Derby winner Valhol 
to run. The judge ordered the $300,000 first-prize money awarded to 
owner James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's share was withheld pending a stewards investigation  
into whether jockey Billy Patin used an electrical device to make 
Valhol run faster. Patin, who still faces a May 5 stewards' 
hearing, lost the mount, and Willie Martinez is expected to replace 
him.

-- a win in the Del Mar Futurity in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a rangy colt, and definitely has what it takes to win a  
Kentucky Derby,'' Desormeaux said of Worldly Manner. ``He's got 
long, fluid strides, and he's powerful. The only question, like 
with the others, is the stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Derby question was answered Tuesday, when a judge in  
Little Rock, Ark., cleared the way for Arkansas Derby winner Valhol 
to run. The judge ordered the $300,000 first-prize money awarded to 
owner James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's share was withheld pending a stewards investigation  
into whether jockey Billy Patin used an electrical device to make 
Valhol run faster. Patin, who still faces a May 5 stewards' 
hearing, lost the mount, and Willie Martinez is expected to replace 
him.

<HEADLINE> Drug Promising for Ovary Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An experimental drug that normalizes the body's  
use of insulin shows promise in the treatment of polycystic ovary 
syndrome, a common cause of infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment usually restores women's ovulatory cycles while  
reversing hormonal imbalances and other effects of the condition, 
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 5 percent and 10 percent of women of reproductive age  
have polycystic ovary syndrome. Their ovaries are filled with small 
cysts, and they are often unable to menstruate. Other signs of the 
condition can include high insulin levels, obesity, high blood 
pressure and excessive facial hair resulting from unusually high 
testosterone levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that drugs that treat insulin  
resistance -- the body's failure to respond properly to insulin -- 
can relieve the condition. However, these drugs can have a variety 
of unwanted side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, doctors found that a compound called  
D-chiro-iunositol, which occurs naturally in fruits and vegetables, 
appears effective without causing side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John E. Nestler and colleagues from Virginia Commonwealth  
University tested 44 women. Half got the drug, and half got dummy 
pills. After six to eight weeks of treatment, 86 percent on those 
on the drug ovulated, compared with 27 percent of those in the 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	Those getting the drug also had improvements in their levels of  
insulin, blood sugar, blood pressure and testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is  
funding a larger study of the drug's safety and effectiveness. It 
is made by Insmed Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Richmond, Va.

<HEADLINE> India Premier Assails Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's acting prime minister began his  
campaign for re-election Wednesday by assailing opposition groups 
for toppling his government and harming the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hindu nationalist-led government lost a confidence vote in  
parliament April 17, setting off nine days of political turbulence 
before President K.R. Narayanan called elections -- the third in as 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is serving as a caretaker prime  
minister until a new government is formed, went on nationwide 
television Wednesday to accuse his opposition of plunging the 
nation into a major economic crisis. A stock market drop during the 
political turmoil cost investors $11.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's criticism came a day after the main opposition  
Congress Party said its leader, the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, will 
run for parliament, her first bid for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi has not said whether she will seek the seat once  
held by her assassinated husband, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	After the confidence vote, the Congress -- the second largest  
group in Parliament -- failed to win enough support from smaller 
parties to replace Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Vajpayee pledged to continue the economic reforms  
that were ``rudely halted'' when his Bharatiya Janata Party lost 
the confidence vote by one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst victim of this power game has been the economy and  
India's image abroad,'' he told businessmen at the Confederation of 
Indian Industry. ``The loss suffered by the country is both 
measurable and intangible. Perhaps the costliest loss is the loss 
of time, since time is the most precious of all resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elections must be held by October, but the date has not been  
set. Vajpayee was pushing for a vote as early as June, while 
Congress wants to delay the vote until September, giving itself 
more time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi's decision to run for parliament has already shifted  
the campaign focus to her ancestry. The BJP has noted that Mrs. 
Gandhi retained her Italian citizenship for 16 years after she was 
married. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the requirement in most countries that the head of  
state be a natural-born citizen, the BJP has asked voters if any 
Indian could become prime minister of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The BJP has said that if Mrs. Gandhi becomes prime minister,  
India will be under ``Rome Raj,'' a term used to refer to the rule 
by British colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is likely to counter the BJP's attack by emphasizing  
her ties to the family that provided three generations of prime 
ministers -- Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her 
son Rajiv. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress said it will focus its campaign on the instability  
of the coalition governments that followed the decline of the 
once-monolithic Congress party that governed India for 45 of its 52 
years as an independent nation.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jason Farrell's goal in the 88th minute  
Wednesday gave the Columbus Crew a 1-0 victory over the winless 
Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City (0-7), playing its final game under interim coach  
Ken Fogerty, suffered its fifth shutout loss of the season and the 
eighth in a 10-game losing streak dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, former U.S. national team coach Bob Gansler was  
named Kansas City's new head coach. He takes over on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (4-2) managed just six shots in the game. But the Crew  
avoided a shootout when Farrell slipped past the Kansas City 
defense to take a long pass from Andy Williams, then took one step 
and fired a shot past goalkeeper Chris Snitko from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kmosko was credited with an assist on the play.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Coaches' Trip Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- A questionable ``business'' trip to Las Vegas by  
Minnesota men's basketball coaches in 1997 was more than a one-time 
visit, a school auditor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip ``takes place every year'' and was ``taken with the  
knowledge and approval of senior management,'' said Gail L. Klatt, 
associate vice-president in the university's department of audits. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9,100 trip to Las Vegas by coach Clem Haskins and three  
other coaches, as well as a trainer and all of the men's wives, was 
little more than a golf outing, auditors said in documents released 
Tuesday to the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and Star Tribune of 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	A booster group paid for the 1997 trip, and coaches stood to  
avoid income taxes on the gift by declaring the travel 
business-related, Klatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Johnson, current president of the Golden Dunkers booster  
group, said his group paid for the annual trips to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the group's federal income tax form that covered  
the 1997 trip in question, the Golden Dunkers spent $9,144 for 
``coaches' meetings.'' In each of the previous two years, the group 
reported spending similar amounts on the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the trips have traditionally been approved by  
McKinley Boston, vice president for student development and 
athletics, and then-university President Nils Hasselmo, according 
to the audit review. 
</P>
<P>
	When internal auditors raised questions regarding the 1997 trip,  
the coaches instructed university bookkeepers to change payroll 
records to add the value of the trip to their incomes, Klatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 trip included $1,732 for airfare, $562 to play golf,  
$296 for golf clothing and an unspecified amount for meals, Klatt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches could be taxed for the benefit, or the university  
could seek reimbursement because such expenditures for travel by 
wives aren't allowed under university policy, the review says. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was triggered by allegations from former  
office manager Jan Gangelhoff that she wrote or helped write more 
than 400 papers for men's basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings from recent audits made public Tuesday reveal  
that auditors found that men's athletic department officials kept 
no record of checks written on a bank account and didn't balance 
the bank statement for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Audits also showed that basketball and hockey coaches and  
players routinely received $10 more than the $34 maximum daily meal 
allowance for all university travel and that, despite rules 
forbidding the practice, coaches mentioned their university 
affiliation on at least four occasions in promotional brochures 
touting private camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 trip to Las Vegas was ostensibly for a coaches'  
seminar, but a university auditor found no evidence that any such 
event took place, according to memos written earlier this year to 
top university officials, including President Mark Yudof. 
</P>
<P>
	Klatt said the coaches later told an auditor the trip was a  
postseason ``debriefing'' but presented no documentation to support 
the claim. Auditors concluded it wasn't a legitimate business 
expense under university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The four coaches are not identified in Klatt's memo, but she  
identified one as Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' lawyer, Ron Zamanksy, had no comment on the trip or the  
audit findings. Yudof's office referred all questions to his chief 
of staff, Tonya Moten Brown, who said the university president is 
aware of the problem and plans to address it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	University policy forbids expenditures for trips that don't have  
a direct university business purpose. Even though the money was 
donated by boosters, those who received the gifts should have 
followed general university guidelines regarding nonbusiness 
travel, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Sony Reports Drop in Net Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Buffeted by recession at home and abroad, Sony  
Corp. said today that its net income plunged nearly 20 percent in 
the last fiscal year and forecast an even steeper drop this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese electronics giant said consolidated net income for  
the year ending March 31 was $1.5 billion, down 19.4 percent from 
$1.9 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company painted an even grimmer picture for the current  
year, forecasting that consolidated net income will plunge 39 
percent to $922.8 million by March 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year just ended, sales and operating revenue gained 0.6  
percent, from $56.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in 1998 to 
$57 billion in the year just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement, Sony blamed its slumping income on the  
sluggish economies of Asia, Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in income came mostly in the second half of the year,  
when the yen rapidly appreciated against the U.S. dollar, Sony 
said. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent volatility of the yen exchange rate has made it more  
difficult to manage global procurement of materials, manufacturing 
and sales activities as planned,'' Sony said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter was particularly bad for Sony, with cuts in  
sales in the company's electronics, music and video game 
businesses. Profit margins suffered from slashed production. 
</P>
<P>
	By segment, electronics sales slipped 0.5 percent; games sales  
were up 8.5 percent; music sales soared 9.4 percent; and sales in 
the motion pictures and television shows section plummeted 16 
percent. The strengthening yen, however, increased production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	For this year, Sony said economic problems will make recovery in  
sales in Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe unlikely. The 
game business is also expected to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also forecast a 4 percent drop in consolidated sales  
and operating revenue to $54.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sour announcement follows a report from Sony Music  
Entertainment Inc. on Tuesday that it posted its first parent 
operating loss since 1969 in the fiscal year ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a subsidiary of Sony Corp. set up in 1968, blamed  
the $2.9 million loss on a decline in revenues, higher costs of 
sales and a large increase in promotion expenses.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslav Deputy Leader Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav prime minister today  
dismissed a deputy premier who urged his government to compromise 
with NATO, state media said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ouster came just three days after Deputy Premier Vuk  
Draskovic said the Serb leadership should recognize that ``we 
cannot defeat NATO'' and must respect the ``reality'' of facing a 
world united against it. 
</P>
<P>
	A terse report by the Tanjug news agency said Prime Minister  
Momir Bulatovic sacked Draskovic because of his ``public statements 
which were contrary to the government stands and jeopardizing the 
respect of the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firing also was reported on Serbian television.  
</P>
<P>
	A 52-year-old maverick politician, Draskovic has had a long  
history of openly clashing with Yugoslavia's ruling powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with other leading pro-democracy activists, Draskovic  
founded a coalition called ``Zajedno,'' meaning ``Together,'' which 
won local elections in many cities in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to more than three months of pro-democracy street  
protests that posed the most serious alternative to Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's authoritarian rule since he came to 
power a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the breakup of Zajedno, Draskovic gradually moved closer  
to Milosevic, supporting the Yugoslav president during the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Milosevic's government as a deputy premier in January.  
His comments Sunday and Monday were his first public criticism of 
official policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic had threatened to launch street protests if Studio B,  
the radio and television controlled by his Serbian Renewal 
Movement, was taken over by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments had prompted Western leaders to talk openly of  
serious cracks in the Milosevic regime.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Satellite TV Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite TV customers nationwide would be  
able, for the first time, to watch their favorite local broadcast 
TV shows via their satellite systems under a bill the House passed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved on 422-1 vote, is meant to resolve a dispute  
between satellite companies and broadcasters over conditions under 
which viewers who get their television from satellite can watch 
broadcast TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would let DirecTV, EchoStar and other companies beam  
local broadcast signals to customers who use either pizza-sized 
dishes or big ``backyard'' dishes no matter where they live. Under 
existing law, companies can't do this. 
</P>
<P>
	With the change, satellite TV customers wouldn't be forced to  
use rooftop antennas or subscribe to cable TV to receive local 
broadcast signals. They would be able to get them directly from a 
satellite company, probably for a small monthly fee. Eventually, 
the companies would have to carry all local broadcast stations in a 
given market. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one satellite TV company, EchoStar, currently provides,  
under what it says are very limited conditions, some local 
broadcast stations in a few markets for a small fee. The company 
believes it can do this under existing law, but broadcasters 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill aims to make satellite companies stronger competitors  
to cable TV providers, which carry local TV signals. That should 
serve as a check on cable rates, which were recently deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of local broadcasting programming is the No. 1 reason  
why consumers aren't willing to subscribe to satellite service and 
therefore are limited to a single competitor: the cable operator,'' 
said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who wrote the bill along with Rep. 
Howard Coble, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill still must go through several steps to become law. The  
Senate has not yet voted on its version. Assuming the Senate bill 
passes, the two bills would have to be reconciled, and the 
resulting bill would need to be approved by both chambers and 
signed into law by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill also would direct the Federal Communications  
Commission to come up with a better way of determining which 
satellite TV customers are eligible to receive broadcast network 
programs from ``distant'' network affiliates, Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing law lets satellite companies provide customers with  
``distant'' network signals, those from other broadcast areas, only 
if those customers cannot receive local stations using rooftop 
antennas. The current law doesn't take into account quality of 
local reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret the arcane legal test that determines 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal and thus is 
eligible to receive network programs by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill tries not to disturb major parts of an agreement  
between DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite TV company, some 
small backyard dish providers and the four major broadcast 
networks, Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that agreement, satellite customers who aren't eligible to  
receive distant network signals and who live closest to their local 
TV stations would be cut off from ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC programs on 
June 30. But the bill does require DirecTV and others to provide 
ineligible customers who have been cut off with free antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under the deal, ineligible customers who live on the  
fringes of their local stations' coverage areas would be cut off 
from network signals on Dec. 31. Under the bill, those customers 
would continue to receive network signals until the FCC develops a 
new way of determining eligibility, taking into account local 
reception quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Two major satellite players, EchoStar and PrimeTime 24, are not  
part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The only dissenter from the passing vote was Rep. Robert Brady,  
D-Pa. He voted against the bill at the request of a labor union, 
said Brady's chief of staff, Stanley White. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1554.

<HEADLINE>  Derby a Big Time for Valhol Trainer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Outside Barn 42, Dallas Keen was handed a  
small box wrapped in silver paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the box was a silver julep cup -- a memento for each of  
the Kentucky Derby trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Keen officially became a Derby trainer Tuesday when a judge in  
Little Rock, Ark., ruled Valhol was entitled to the $300,000 
winner's share of the Arkansas Derby purse. 
</P>
<P>
	The julep cups were handed out at a trainer's dinner Tuesday  
night and Keen was on his way back to Louisville at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Racing Commission ordered Oaklawn Park to hold up  
the purse after track officials said they had evidence jockey Billy 
Patin might have carried an electrical device when he won the April 
10 race aboard Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse did nothing wrong,'' Keen said Wednesday.  
``Regardless of whether he used an electrical device or not, it's 
not going to make a horse run faster than what he is capable of 
doing. If anything, I think it's going to hurt one more than help 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading to the Arkansas Derby, Valhol was second in a maiden  
race on Feb. 12 and fourth, beaten 2 1/2 lengths after traffic 
problems, in the Louisiana Derby on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute had kept Keen from enjoying his first Derby horse.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been fun,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But now he can relax, somewhat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of relief for Valhol and my owner,'' he said.  
``It's been a tough go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Jackson, who paid $30,000 for Valhol as a 2-year-old, was  
exuberant moments after the Arkansas Derby, knowing the Kentucky 
Derby awaited. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's breathtaking,'' he said. ``It's the dream of every  
horsemen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Jackson was ecstatic about the verdict, but  
``vindication is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shadow cast by the investigation affected his family  
and Jackson's. Now they can concentrate on the race itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the horse will embarrass us,'' Keen said. ``I  
think he's a champion. He's had a very short racing career but 
everything he's done has been so professional. He's the kind of 
horse you dream about being able to train. He doesn't make any 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If more than 20 horses are entered in the Kentucky Derby, the  
field is limited to the top 20 in money earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn general manager Eric Jackson emphasized the court ruling  
had nothing to do with the status of Patin. A hearing in the case 
is May 5. Keen said he has not talked with Patin since the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Martinez, who was aboard Valhol for a half-mile workout  
Tuesday, will ride on Saturday. Churchill Downs probably would have 
tried to stop Patin from riding Valhol as long as the investigation 
was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Keen said Martinez told him he had watched films of the  
gelding's races and was excited about getting the mount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Derby check gives Valhol $338,400, good enough for  
11th on the list after the filly Excellent Meeting was entered in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, after Saturday, it will have all been worth it,''  
Keen said.

<HEADLINE> 'Vitamin O' Seller Must Stop Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Companies selling a ``Vitamin O'' dietary  
supplement have been ordered to stop making unproven claims about 
purported health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Edward Shea granted the Federal Trade  
Commission's request for a preliminary injunction that restricts 
ways two northeast Washington companies can advertise the product. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC filed a complaint March 11 after Rose Creek Health  
Products Inc. and The Staff of Life Inc. ran full- and half-page 
Vitamin O ads in USA Today and other newspapers. Both companies are 
based in Kettle Falls, about 75 miles north of here. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, entered Monday, will stay in effect until the matter  
is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very likely this case will never go to trial,'' said  
Eleanor Durham, an FTC staff attorney in Seattle. ``But I don't 
expect a final settlement before the end of the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement likely won't occur until completion of studies the  
two companies hope will back up some of the health claims, Durham 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls were not immediately returned by Donald L. Smyth, who owns  
both businesses, or the operations' Spokane attorney, Lucinda 
Schilling Whaley. The companies, which market several dietary 
supplements, also do business as R-Garden Internationale. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involving Vitamin O -- the ``O'' stands for oxygen -- is  
one of several pending FTC complaints against producers of dietary 
supplements that claim to cure various ailments. Such products are 
frequently advertised in alternative-medicine publications and can 
be sold without approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Creek and The Staff of Life are among nearly a dozen  
companies nationwide that promote ``stabilized oxygen'' products 
purported to have health benefits. The FTC plans to scrutinize 
those companies as well, Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC ultimately seeks a permanent order requiring Rose Creek  
and The Staff of Life to pay court costs and refund consumers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's temporary order requires the two companies to stop  
making unsubstantiated claims that ingesting the liquid or spraying 
it on the skin can cure or prevent ailments, Durham said. In 
addition, personal testimonials must include disclaimers.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pregnancy Rate Keeps Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talking about sex isn't easy for Laverne  
Coates, and she would rather assume that her daughter isn't having 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear about it,'' she said. ``I don't want to  
know about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's made it clear, though, that pregnancy is not acceptable,  
and somehow, her daughter Tamara got the message. Tamara has been 
having sex for two years, she says, but she always uses 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, having a child in high school is not fun,'' Tamara  
Hayman, 18, of Baltimore said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidently, a lot of teens are getting the message: Teen  
pregnancy plummeted 17 percent in the 1990s to the lowest level 
since 1973, according to statistics being released today. Teen 
abortion rates were down, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made real progress -- and must do more -- to encourage  
more young people to delay parenthood,'' said Vice President Al 
Gore, who plans a roundtable discussion with teen-agers at the 
White House today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers point to a mix of reasons, including more reliable  
contraception, fear of AIDS, a new focus on abstinence and even the 
strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's fresh evidence that the peer pressure so many  
parents worry about actually does more good than harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new reports document the decline. New statistics from the  
Department of Health and Human Services show that births to 
teen-agers fell 4 percent in 1997, helping to push the national 
birth rate for all women to a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute finds teen  
pregnancy dropped 4 percent in 1996 and fell 17 percent from its 
peak in 1990. The Guttmacher statistics combine the birth data with 
statistics on abortion and estimates for miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS report, which looks at a host of birth data, also found  
a new record low for births to unmarried black women and a 
continued decline in out-of-wedlock births in 1997. The year saw a 
record high for women getting early prenatal care and a record low 
rate of women smoking during pregnancy, down to 13.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there were about 880,000 teen pregnancies in 1996 --  
just under one for every 10 teen women. Sixty-two percent of them 
were 18- and 19-year-olds; the rest were 15 to 17 years old. The 
report did not look at teens under 15. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in three pregnancies were aborted, as the teen  
abortion rate dropped 3 percent in 1996. It fell 31 percent from 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the decline in pregnancy is due to increased use of  
birth control, said Jacqueline E. Darroch, a vice president at 
Guttmacher, a private research group. She noted that 11 percent of 
15- to 19-year-olds now use long-acting, highly effective birth 
control methods such as Depo-Provera shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Condom use also increased as fear of AIDS spread in the '90s.  
And national surveys point to decreased teen sexual activity as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Other explanations are harder to pin down, including an  
explosion of abstinence and pregnancy prevention programs and a 
strong economy that may be giving teens more hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, for the first time, research suggests positive peer  
pressure may be stronger than the negative pressures parents 
usually fear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging out with friends who do well in school and don't drink  
or smoke will help a teen avoid pregnancy, researchers found. But, 
contrary to many parents' fears, hanging out with kids who engage 
in these and other risky behaviors doesn't make much difference, 
said Brad Brown of the University of Wisconsin, who analyzed a 
federal survey of teens for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen 
Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some at the campaign are concerned that people believe  
the teen pregnancy problem has been solved. They note that U.S. 
rates are still higher than those of other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Kreinin, who travels the country for the campaign,  
worries that condom use will decline as fear of AIDS recedes. 
``What I'm hearing from kids is you don't die from AIDS any more,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But HHS Secretary Donna Shalala was more optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are that naive about American  
teen-agers,'' she said. ``We need to keep the same focus and 
philosophy and send consistent messages to every generation.''

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Falls Short of Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Border Patrol acknowledged  
Tuesday his agency will fall well short of its goal of adding 1,000 
agents this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before the Senate Judiciary immigration subcommittee,  
Border Patrol Chief Gus de la Vina said his agency will hire only 
200 to 400 of the 1,000 agents that Congress mandated this year. 
The bulk of them will be dispatched to current hot spots for 
illegal crossings: Arizona's Tucson sector and Texas' McAllen 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming the Border Patrol's recruiting difficulties on a tight  
labor market, de la Vina voiced support for a plan to raise the 
entry-level pay scale for Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pay increase ``would help us tremendously'' in  
recruiting and retaining agents. The Border Patrol has slightly 
more than 8,000 agents and loses 10 percent of its workforce 
annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, will introduce a bill this week to increase agents' pay by 
about $8,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents with a year's experience are paid roughly $33,000 in  
salary and earn on average 10 to 15 percent more in hazardous duty 
and overtime pay, according to Border Patrol statistics. The Kyl 
measure would increase that base pay to $41,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl criticized the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the  
Border Patrol's parent agency, for not working with him on helping 
write the pay raise bill. ``We've been trying to help and we get 
stiffed by the INS,'' he complained. 
</P>
<P>
	An INS task force is studying pay issues, hoping to present a  
broader proposal later this year that would address compensation 
issues among its entire workforce of 29,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	An INS enforcement strategy aimed at push illegal border  
crossers away from population centers such as San Diego and El Paso 
and toward more rugged terrain has prompted a huge surge in 
crossings and apprehensions in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol's Tucson sector, which covers most of the  
Arizona-Mexico border, recorded 60,000 apprehensions last month, 
Kyl said. He hypothesized that that two or three times that number 
were not apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated Arizonans living along the border have begun taking  
matters into their own hands. One rancher found 27 immigrants on 
his property on Easter Sunday, turning them over to the 
overburdened local Border Patrol office. Some are urging the 
governor to dispatch the Arizona National Guard to the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona state Rep. Gail Griffin, whose district reaches to the  
border, blamed the illegal aliens for a wave of break-ins, vehicle 
thefts, vandalism and destruction of livestock along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Vina defended the enforcement strategy and noted the huge  
manpower increases within the Border Patrol in recent years. The 
Tucson sector has grown from fewer than 300 agents in 1994 to 1,050 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what we need to do in Douglas, Arizona. We're getting  
there as fast as we can,'' he said, referring to Arizona's current 
hot spot. ``Unfortunately, it does take some time.''

<HEADLINE>  Peruvians Strike Against Fujimori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's president ordered armored troop  
carriers and 20,000 police into the streets Wednesday to control 
protesters denouncing his failure to create jobs and reduce poverty 
in this Andean nation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Alberto Fujimori labeled the strike organizers as  
``communists.'' Labor Minister Pedro Flores declared the strike 
illegal and warned workers that their pay would be docked if they 
failed to show up for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike leaders said the threat had not succeeded in neutralizing  
the protest against Fujimori's free-market economic policies and 
his apparent plans to seek a third consecutive term next year 
despite a constitutional ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike has been respected by 70 percent of the workers at  
the national level,'' said Jose Risco, leader of Peru's largest 
labor organization, the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was organized by leftist-led labor federations but  
was supported by a wide range of groups, including most opposition 
parties and even business organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	At least half of the businesses closed in downtown Lima, where  
protesters burned tires in the streets. Strikers stoned buses on 
major avenues on the outskirts of Lima. The strike was even 
stronger in major provincial cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strike is about poverty and unemployment,'' said Luis  
Carpio, a retired textile worker who has to make do with a 
$90-a-month pension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunger is the key issue. I've never seen people worse off in  
my 73 years,'' Carpio said as he watched protesters unfurl red 
banners in the Dos de Mayo Plaza that read ``No to the 
Dictatorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of protesters from different parts of the city  
converged on the Plaza Mayor in front of the National Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers with automatic weapons guarded public buildings and  
police fired tear gas at protesters burning tires in downtown Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Street cleaner Zenobia Solorzano, a 45-year-old widow with three  
small children, showed up to work because she could not afford to 
lose a day's pay of $4.50 -- or her job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work for a private company, and I came to work because if I  
didn't, they would have kicked me out,'' she said as she swept up 
trash in downtown Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru's unions, weakened by anti-labor legislation under  
Fujimori, have gained renewed vigor as his free-market reforms have 
done little to generate jobs or reduce poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms halted hyperinflation that had soared above 7,000  
percent in 1990, the year Fujimori took office, and Peru's economy 
grew by a sizzling 32 percent between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent years, economic growth has stagnated and even the  
privileged classes now complain about Fujimori's policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of all Peruvians live in poverty. Ragged street beggars are  
visible everywhere. Privatizations of state enterprises have left 
tens of thousands without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today there is agreement between bosses and workers that the  
economy is not functioning for either of them,'' said political 
analyst Nicolas Lynch.

</P>
<P>
	At least half of the businesses closed in downtown Lima, where  
protesters burned tires in the streets. Strikers stoned buses on 
major avenues on the outskirts of Lima. The strike was even 
stronger in major provincial cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strike is about poverty and unemployment,'' said Luis  
Carpio, a retired textile worker who has to make do with a 
$90-a-month pension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunger is the key issue. I've never seen people worse off in  
my 73 years,'' Carpio said as he watched protesters unfurl red 
banners in the Dos de Mayo Plaza that read ``No to the 
Dictatorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of protesters from different parts of the city  
converged on the Plaza Mayor in front of the National Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers with automatic weapons guarded public buildings and  
police fired tear gas at protesters burning tires in downtown Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Street cleaner Zenobia Solorzano, a 45-year-old widow with three  
small children, showed up to work because she could not afford to 
lose a day's pay of $4.50 -- or her job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work for a private company, and I came to work because if I  
didn't, they would have kicked me out,'' she said as she swept up 
trash in downtown Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru's unions, weakened by anti-labor legislation under  
Fujimori, have gained renewed vigor as his free-market reforms have 
done little to generate jobs or reduce poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms halted hyperinflation that had soared above 7,000  
percent in 1990, the year Fujimori took office, and Peru's economy 
grew by a sizzling 32 percent between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent years, economic growth has stagnated and even the  
privileged classes now complain about Fujimori's policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of all Peruvians live in poverty. Ragged street beggars are  
visible everywhere. Privatizations of state enterprises have left 
tens of thousands without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today there is agreement between bosses and workers that the  
economy is not functioning for either of them,'' said political 
analyst Nicolas Lynch.

<HEADLINE> Trumpet Extraordinaire Hirt Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With a combination of power and virtuosity,  
Al Hirt could ruffle curtains at the back of an auditorium or ease 
out a honey-toned melody with his trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old musician, whose lilting version of ``Java'' won  
a Grammy in 1964, died Tuesday at home of liver failure. He had 
been in failing health since leaving a hospital a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt's dazzling skill, amplified by awesome power, resulted in  
21 Grammy nominations during his 50-year career. ``Java'' won for 
best non-jazz instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented a certain particular style of New Orleans music  
-- not just Dixieland or traditional jazz,'' said George Wein, 
producer of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a side of New Orleans entertainment best personified by  
Louis Prima -- the waving handkerchief, the dancing, the whole 
showbiz aspect, all the time playing good music. It was unique to 
New Orleans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Hirt recorded more than 50 albums -- four gold and one  
platinum. ``Honey in the Horn'' reached No. 3 on Billboard's 
Popular Music Album Chart in 1963; ``Sugar Lips'' won Billboard's 
favorite instrumentalist of 1965. In 1962, he was named `best 
trumpeter' in the Playboy jazz poll, a prize he won for 15 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
	At his peak, he played for John Kennedy's inauguration, starred  
at Carnegie Hall, and headlined numerous television variety shows, 
including his own ``Fanfare'' program on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best trumpet players all around the world,''  
said clarinetist Pete Fountain, a longtime friend. ``He had 
everything -- technique, stamina, education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt and Fountain started out together, working as exterminators  
by day and playing music at night. They remained friends for more 
than 50 years and in recent years toured together with their two 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Alois Maxwell Hirt in New Orleans in 1922, Hirt got his  
first trumpet when he was 6 and was hailed as a prodigy when he was 
13. He was classically trained at the Cincinnati Conservatory of 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
	His first big break came in 1950, when he won second place in  
Horace Heidt's National Youth Opportunity Contest and was named 
solo trumpet in Heidt's band. 
</P>
<P>
	Real national fame came in 1960 when Hirt's Dixieland Six caught  
the attention of Dinah Shore and he became an overnight success on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt didn't call it jazz.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a pop commercial musician, and I've got a successful  
format,'' he once said. ``If you have the ability to perform your 
musical idea, you become a good jazz player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt tried to arrange his career so he could stay with his wife  
and eight kids in New Orleans, where he was one of the original 
group to bring professional football to the city. His club on 
Bourbon Street became his musical headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Hirt found himself in the spotlight for an unusual  
reason: a busted lip suffered while riding a Mardi Gras float. He 
told officers he was hit in the face with a brick. The injury 
required 12 stitches and hampered his playing for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, he provoked controversy when he said he had had enough  
of the crime and filth of the French Quarter and closed the club he 
had operated since 1960. He later apologized, but did not reopen 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
	After that he mostly toured and performed on television, with  
only occasional local appearances at ``Jellyroll's'' in the French 
Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered one of his most important performances the 1987  
solo of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope John Paul II during the 
pontiff's visit to New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Lawyers Defend Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A ``Jenny Jones Show'' guest who claimed  
he was so humiliated when a gay man professed his love for him that 
he was driven to kill had sex with the victim before the shooting, 
a jury was told Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, Scott Amedure, told two people that he slept with  
Jonathan Schmitz after the taping, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family is suing the show and its distributor, Warner  
Bros., for $50 million, contending a mentally ill Schmitz was lured 
onto the show believing he would meet a woman, and became enraged 
when his ``secret admirer'' turned out to be Amedure. Three days 
after the taping, Schmitz -- who has said he is heterosexual -- 
killed Amedure with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the show say that Schmitz was told his secret  
admirer could be a man or woman, and that the show is not to blame 
for Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney James Feeney showed jurors part of a videotaped  
deposition of Patricia Graves, Amedure's mother. Ms. Graves had 
told reporters after the shooting that her son had said he and 
Schmitz had ``an affair'' after the show. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her deposition, Ms. Graves said she had not taken  
Amedure's statement seriously. ``You had to know Scott to know when 
he was being up front with you or kidding around,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also played a tape of the deposition of Ronnie  
Perez, a guest on the same episode. Perez said he and Amedure spoke 
by phone after the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he said was, `I'll tell you something. Can you keep a  
secret?''' Perez said. ``I said `Yeah.' He said, `I slept with 
Jon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Gutheil, a psychiatrist at Harvard University also  
testified Wednesday, saying there was no evidence Schmitz was 
mentally impaired when he made the decision to go on the show.

<HEADLINE> Gun Laws Include Many Loopholes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Columbine High massacre has demonstrated just  
how complicated and full of loopholes the nation's overlapping gun 
laws are. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law makes it illegal for a licensed gun dealer to sell a  
handgun to anyone under 21 or to sell a rifle to anyone under 18. 
Colorado law makes it illegal in most cases to give a handgun to a 
minor, and makes it illegal for a minor to possess a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities say Dylan Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend may  
have done nothing illegal -- even though they say she bought two 
shotguns and a rifle and gave them to two minors who later used the 
weapons in an attack in which they killed 12 students, a teacher 
and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 30,000 gun laws at the federal, state and local level,  
and many are peppered with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fragmented set of laws,'' said David Akerson, a Denver  
criminal lawyer. ``The loopholes are giant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, to prosecute on the charge of giving a handgun to  
a minor under Colorado law, prosecutors must show that the giver 
``knowingly or recklessly'' gave the gun with the knowledge that 
the minor planned to break the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, who had previously said Robyn Anderson bought a  
TEC DC-9 semiautomatic handgun and a Hi Point carbine rifle, on 
Wednesday said she bought two sawed-off shotguns and the carbine 
but they have no information linking her to the handgun, the fourth 
weapon used in the attack. Klebold and Eric Harris were both under 
18 when they received the rifle and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	A key unanswered question is who bought the TEC DC-9. If Ms.  
Anderson did, prosecutors would have to determine what she knew and 
when she knew it. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law that bars handgun sales to anyone under 21  
doesn't apply to so-called private sales, so an unlicensed dealer 
can sell a handgun like the TEC DC-9 used in Littleton to an 
18-year-old. Investigators say at least one of the guns was bought 
at a gun show, where private sellers vie for buyers along with 
licensed dealers who must follow stricter rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Private sellers don't have to perform a background check or  
comply with the waiting period created in the 1994 Brady bill. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has called for a crackdown on gun show sales,  
requiring all sellers to comply with the laws made for dealers. On 
Tuesday, the president said he had been to gun shows and wasn't 
impressed with the legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``People go around with their trunks open. ... People pay  
cash,'' he said. ``I'll tell you something: If we don't do 
something about gun shows, we're going to continue to have serious, 
serious problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the Colorado law that bars anyone under 18 from  
possessing a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	That law has a laundry list of exemptions. For instance, a minor  
can use a handgun for hunting, in organized sporting events, or on 
property owned by the minor's parent or grandparent with their 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	And even that law doesn't necessarily apply statewide. Denver,  
for instance, passed a stricter law, requiring anyone buying even a 
rifle from a Denver dealer to be 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The TEC DC-9 used by Klebold and Harris is considered a handgun  
because of its short barrel, 12.5 inches. The three other guns used 
-- the Hi Point carbine and the two sawed-off shotguns -- are 
considered rifles. It's illegal to saw the barrel off a shotgun, 
but an 18-year-old can own a rifle.

<HEADLINE> TRW Reorganizes Into Two Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Corp., which agreed to acquire British auto  
parts maker LucasVarity PLC in a $7 billion deal, will reorganize 
into automotive and non-automotive sectors as it works to integrate 
the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Gorman, TRW chairman and chief executive, said TRW  
veteran Ronald Sugar has been appointed president and chief 
operating officer of TRW Aerospace and Information Systems. A 
search has begun for a president of TRW Automotive. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW Automotive will includes automotive operations of TRW and  
LucasVarity and will have 100,000 employees. TRW Aerospace and 
Information Systems includes TRW's space, defense and information 
systems business and Lucas Aerospace and will have nearly 35,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman said he would lead a committee on integrating LucasVarity  
into TRW. 
</P>
<P>
	The company confirmed previous reports that Victor Rice, chief  
executive of LucasVarity, will not join TRW. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW makes automobile airbags, seat belts and other car parts,  
defense and aerospace equipment and is involved in information 
technology. The company made its bid for LucasVarity in January, 
beating out a rival automotive supplier, Federal-Mogul Corp.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Drop / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Wednesday as the market  
absorbed a supply of new Treasury debt securities and traders 
awaited a key measure of inflationary forces due on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32  
point, or $5.94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose from late Tuesday's 5.54 
percent to 5.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices sagged as the U.S. Treasury auctioned another $15.0  
billion in debt securities, this time in two-year notes. On 
Tuesday, the Treasury sold $10.0 billion in 52-week notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were also concerned that Thursday's report on  
first-quarter employment costs -- which typically account for 
two-thirds of a product's price -- might reveal inflationary 
pressures. Rising prices make fixed-income investments less 
enticing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
finished unchanged to down 3/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities fell 7/32 to 13/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.50 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.39 
percent. Six-month yields held steady at 4.58 percent, while the 
discount was unchanged at 4.41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields rose to 4.73 percent as the discount rose 0.4  
percentage point to 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.81 percent from late Tuesday's 4.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/8 point to 123 13/16. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.26 from 5.25 percent late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Past Is Prologue for Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a city trying hard to focus on the  
future, the two leading candidates for mayor can't seem to shake 
their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	John Street, the buttoned-down former City Council president  
seeking to become Philadelphia's second black mayor, is trying to 
live down his reputation from the 1980s as a hothead and a 
rabble-rouser. His opponent is running a commercial with footage 
from 18 years ago of Street -- then a community activist with a big 
Afro -- angrily shoving a reporter to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Street's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, lawyer Marty  
Weinberg, finds himself defending his political relationship with 
the late Mayor Frank Rizzo, one of the most polarizing figures in 
Philadelphia history. Rizzo left office 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the nature of Philadelphia politics to let these  
things go,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a Millersville University 
political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Weinberg lead a field of five Democrats trying to  
succeed Mayor Edward G. Rendell, who in two terms brought the city 
back from the brink of financial disaster. Philadelphia is now 
undergoing a downtown building boom, and its bright future includes 
the Republican National Convention in 2000. Rendell is prohibited 
from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the May 18 primary will face wealthy GOP  
businessman Sam Katz in the fall. Rendell himself describes Katz as 
a formidable opponent with a chance to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The race has drawn national big-league political talent for a  
race that experts say could be one of the most expensive mayoral 
contests in U.S. history, running up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, a political power broker making his first bid for  
office, has raised more than $3 million. Airing TV spots months 
before his rivals helped. In January, polls had him dead last. This 
month, a new poll showed him tied with Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a law professor at Drexel University when Rizzo  
named him city solicitor in 1972. The two forged a close political 
relationship that lasted until Rizzo's death in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzo's administration was blamed for police brutality and  
financial mismanagement, and on the campaign trail, Weinberg always 
gets questioned about his ties to Rizzo. In a recent television 
debate, Street said he ``would hate to go back'' to the Rizzo 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg stands by his political mentor.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Rizzo did a lot of very good things for the city of  
Philadelphia. He was not perfect. He made mistakes. But nobody can 
ever deny the fact he loved this city and devoted his life to it,'' 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia politics, the question of race is never far  
below the surface. But political observers said so far, it has not 
become a dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the candidates are really striving hard to avoid these  
deep racial divisions,'' Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who is white, expects to do well in the blue-collar  
rowhouse neighborhoods of this city of 1.5 million people, more 40 
percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a formidable foe in Street, who forged a close  
alliance with Rendell early this decade. Together, they took on the 
city's municipal unions and helped turn a $250 million budget 
deficit into a surplus before Street stepped down from the City 
Council to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who leaves office with a glittering future and has  
discussed running for governor, has endorsed Street's candidacy and 
appeared in one of his campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was a vociferous community activist in his early days,  
protesting everything from vending regulations to housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a temper. Besides shoving the TV reporter (who sued  
and settled for $1,000), Street is notorious for a 1981 fistfight 
on the floor of City Council spurred by the possibility of a school 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	After that episode, Street began exerting more control over  
himself. His political views changed, too. Once a liberal, he had 
become by 1989 a fiscal conservative and a budget hawk. Street was 
elected City Council president in 1992, the year Rendell took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's changed,'' said Randall Miller, a St. Joseph's University  
professor who follows Philadelphia politics. ``He's changed because 
he has exercised extraordinary self-discipline, as he insisted the 
city should do.''

	House Votes To Restrict Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided House voted today to require  
President Clinton to get congressional approval before injecting 
``ground elements'' into the conflict in Yugoslavia. The 249 to 180 
vote to limit his ability to widen the war came despite Clinton's 
appeal to Congress that the United States must speak ``with a 
single voice'' on the crisis, as he said NATO had done. The 
restrictions are so vaguely worded that they could even make it 
hard to use the Apache attack helicopters that have been recently 
sent to Albania, Democratic opponents suggested. Democrats 
suggested a veto was likely if the measure is also enacted by the 
Senate.

	Outspoken Yugoslav Official Fired  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic, a  
former Yugoslav opposition leader who in recent days denounced 
Slobodan Milosevic's government, was dismissed today, state media 
reported. The Tanjug state news agency said Prime Minister Momir 
Bulatovic sacked the 52-year-old Draskovic because of ``public 
statements which were contrary to the government stands.'' 
Draskovic had said the Yugoslav leadership should stop lying to its 
people about the situation in the country after weeks of bombings 
and recognize ``we cannot defeat NATO.'' NATO also said it was 
seeing signs of growing discontent inside Yugoslavia. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has approved a major  
revision of U.S. sanctions policy that will permit sales of food 
and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan. Undersecretary of State 
Stuart Eizenstat said that denying countries food and medicines as 
well as medical equipment hurts innocent people in targeted 
countries, does not weaken the respective regimes, damages the U.S. 
image abroad and deprives U.S. companies of export opportunities. 
The policy will not affect congressionally mandated sanctions 
against Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.

High School during last week's massacre have been cleared as 
suspects in the investigation, a sheriff's spokesman said today. 
Investigators also said that the 18-year-old girlfriend of one of 
the student gunmen bought three of the weapons used in the attack 
that left 15 dead. Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the woman 
bought two shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle.

	Casino, Lottery Moratorium Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharply divided, a panel studying gambling in  
America voted to recommend a moratorium on the spread of casinos, 
lotteries and slot machines around the nation. The National 
Gambling Impact Study Commission cannot impose a moratorium, but 
its report will call for ``a pause'' in the growth of legalized 
gambling and encourage state and local governments to form their 
own gambling study commissions. The commission, which has until 
June 18 to submit its report to Congress, the White House, 
governors and Indian reservations.

	Justices Ponder Disabled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, trying to define the scope  
of a federal ban on discrimination, struggled today with a basic 
question: Who is disabled? As the court heard arguments about two 
nearsighted women who want to be United Air Lines pilots and a 
truck driver blind in one eye, some justices questioned whether 
poor eyesight is a disability protected under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act. By July, the justices are expected to use these 
cases to clarify who can sue under the ADA.

	Study of Brain Comprehension Done  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new study shows that humans' ability to  
understand speech is so deeply ingrained that people can even 
decipher sentences that have been recorded, chopped up into brief 
segments and played backwards. Researchers said the study shows

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fernando Vina of the Milwaukee Brewers has been  
suspended for two games for putting a finger in the face of umpire

<HEADLINE>  House Heads for Showdown on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Congress is ready to double  
President Clinton's request for $6 billion to help pay for the 
conflict with Yugoslavia, but a showdown looms on the House floor 
over his authority to widen the military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to meet at the White House today with lawmakers  
from committees that deal with defense and military spending to 
discuss costs of the escalating battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a measure backed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and other Republican leaders to require Clinton to receive 
congressional approval before deploying ground forces in Yugoslavia 
awaits a floor vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the only thing that is likely to pass,'' said House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other proposals, one demanding withdrawal of U.S. troops  
from the region, the other for a declaration of war against 
Yugoslavia, were expected to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration opposes the Republican advance-approval  
measure as an unnecessary restriction, even though it has said it 
does not plan to dispatch ground troops. The ground option is being 
reviewed by NATO's military commanders, however, and the United 
States is sending more troops and equipment to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans readied legislation Tuesday that  
would double Clinton's $6.05 billion request to pay for the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee planned a vote Thursday on a  
$12.9 billion package for the fighting, refugees and worldwide 
Pentagon needs, including a 4.4 percent pay raise for troops. 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was 
drafting a similar measure totaling nearly $12 billion that his 
panel might vote on next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday it will call 33,102 reservists to  
active military duty, beginning immediately with 2,116 members of 
the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard to help in aerial 
refueling of NATO warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ended talks  
in Moscow on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, the Russian mediator for the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians did not indicate any major changes in their  
position,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must  
withdraw his Serb-led forces from Kosovo, permit the return of 
ethnic Albanians to the province and accept an armed international 
force of peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly objects to NATO's bombing campaign and to the  
idea of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary William Cohen  
indicated little interest in putting a peacekeeping force, in the 
event one is formed, under the command of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be an international peacekeeping force that is  
NATO-led and, at the core, NATO must be involved in its 
management,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials were encouraged that representatives of  
the International Committee of the Red Cross had a second, longer 
visit with three U.S. soldiers being held in Belgrade as prisoners 
of war. The three were examined by a doctor, but the results were 
not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the administration's advice, a delegation of U.S.  
religious leaders led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson planned to leave 
today for Yugoslavia to meet with the three Americans and try to 
secure their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends it needs no congressional approval  
to prosecute the military campaign against Yugoslavia, which began 
March 24. Many lawmakers contend the conflict violates the War 
Powers Act of 1973, which requires the president to obtain 
congressional approval if he keeps troops in combat for more than 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at war,'' Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said, ``and  
Congress has not declared that. And that is unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House International Relations Committee voted 30-19 on  
Tuesday against a resolution by Campbell requiring Clinton to bring 
troops engaged in the military campaign home in a move that set up 
a showdown on the House floor today. Campbell invoked a provision 
of the War Powers Act that requires a vote by the full House.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks slipped today as investors sold  
issues to lock in profits before a series of national holidays. The 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.03 points,  
or 0.09 percent, ending the day at 16,942.24, erasing a 124.32 
point morning gain. On Tuesday, the average closed up 38.76 points, 
or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.08 yen at late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 
120.40 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 118.25 yen to 120.28 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell in the afternoon on profit  
taking, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, prices advanced following the overnight strength  
in New York stocks. Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial 
average rose 113.12 points to 10,831.71, topping its previous 
record finish of 10,727.18, set Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand was quite strong in the morning after shares in New  
York rose overnight, but sell orders began to pour in after the 
Nikkei average surpassed the 17,000 mark,'' said Yoshio Watanabe, a 
manager at the futures section of Toyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.72 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,359.14. The 
TOPIX closed up 6.58 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 677.47 million  
shares, up from 633.38 million shares Tuesday. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 695 to 483, with 137 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on speculation that the  
government might put together a supplementary budget to prevent a 
deterioration of the economy later this year when funds for current 
stimulus measures run out. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar later rose back above 119 yen after Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi said he has no plans for an extra budget. The 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy panel chief, Yukihiko 
Ikeda, also denied the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile stocks were among shares that lost ground as the yen  
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 127.22 yen, up from  
127.02 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players remained on the sidelines ahead of Japan's ``Golden  
Week'' holidays. Japanese financial markets will be closed 
Thursday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.460 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, 
driving its price down to 102.99 yen from 103.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> Utah Company Sues Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. executives sought to block  
competitor Novell Inc. from pursuing accounts with the Mormon 
church and Brigham Young University, according to evidence filed in 
federal court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera Inc., an offshoot of Novell, is suing Microsoft Corp.,  
for as much as $1.6 billion, claiming the software giant set out to 
destroy public demand for DR-DOS, an operating system that competed 
against Microsoft's MS-DOS. Both enable personal computers to 
perform basic functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, however, claims DR-DOS was a flawed product and  
Novell provided its users with shoddy technical support. 
</P>
<P>
	Orem-based Caldera was formed by former Novell chairman Ray  
Noorda, who acquired DR-DOS before leaving the company and filing a 
lawsuit against Microsoft in July 1996. The company included in its 
court filings correspondence it says provides evidence of 
Microsoft's quest to ``lock up'' accounts of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan acknowledged Wednesday that the  
religious group is a ``large customer of great interest to any 
company trying to sell enterprise software. It is of great 
significance in Salt Lake and the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cullinan claimed Caldera's filings use out-of-context  
snippets to unfairly portray Microsoft's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed this week are aimed at defining the scope of claims  
that will be allowed at a January 2000 trial. Microsoft has asked 
for summary dismissal on a number of Caldera's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Dee Benson is considering media requests to release about  
60 sealed documents in the case and to make public further 
documents filed in the case unless they contain trade secrets.

<HEADLINE> Envoys in Moscow To Discuss Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Top diplomats and envoys converged on Moscow today  
in stepped-up efforts to settle the Kosovo conflict, with two 
European ministers and the U.N. chief arriving for talks with 
Russian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings came a day after a U.S. envoy discussed Yugoslavia  
with Russia's top policy-makers but left the Russian capital 
without any breakthroughs. Russia staunchly opposes NATO's 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, and both sides remained divided over 
what type of international force should eventually move into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former prime  
minister, met today with German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. 
Afterward, Scharping announced that Chernomyrdin would go to Bonn, 
Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Scharping, whose country has played a key role in NATO 's air  
campaign, said afterwards there was ``hope for a political 
settlement to the crisis,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said his talks in Moscow ``should not be  
overestimated'' because any decisions regarding NATO must be 
approved by all alliance members. 
</P>
<P>
	Scharping also met with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev  
and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is extremely difficult, but there are still  
possibilities for a political way out of the present predicament,'' 
Ivanov said going into the meeting, according to Russian news 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Foreign Minister Georgios Papandreou, who has urged a  
political solution to the crisis, also arrived in Moscow today for 
talks with Chernomyrdin and Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece is a NATO member but has no direct involvement in the  
bombing campaign. It faces growing public anger over the attacks 
against Serbia, a traditional ally. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was to arrive in Moscow later  
today for talks on Kosovo, and Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd 
Axworthy was due in town Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, Axworthy, Papandreou and Ivanov were to meet Thursday to  
discuss Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	While the West hopes Russia can play a key role in negotiating a  
peace deal, Moscow appears to have limited influence with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. Several Russian diplomatic missions 
to Belgrade have failed to make any progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin discussed Yugoslavia today  
with visiting Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has 
also fiercely opposed NATO's actions. The two presidents called for 
close coordination of their actions regarding Kosovo, Yeltsin aide 
Sergei Prikhodko said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott came  
to Moscow seeking to determine whether Russia had been able to 
persuade the Yugoslav government to compromise on any of the NATO 
demands over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said Washington and Moscow ``share certain points  
in their approaches to a peace settlement.'' But he reiterated 
Moscow's position that NATO must halt airstrikes on Yugoslavia to 
clear the way for talks, a condition repeatedly rejected by the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Russia's opposition to the NATO airstrikes, it has said  
it will not be dragged into the war.

<HEADLINE> Drug Promising for Ovary Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An experimental drug that normalizes the body's  
use of insulin appears to be a promising treatment for polycystic 
ovary syndrome, a common cause of infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	A study found that the treatment usually restores women's  
ovulatory cycles while reversing hormonal imbalances and other 
effects of the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 5 percent and 10 percent of women of reproductive age  
have polycystic ovary syndrome. Their ovaries are filled with small 
cysts, and they are often unable to menstruate. Other signs of the 
condition can include high insulin levels, obesity, high blood 
pressure and excessive facial hair resulting from unusually high 
testosterone levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that drugs that treat insulin  
resistance -- the body's failure to respond properly to insulin -- 
can relieve the condition. However, these drugs can have a variety 
of unwanted side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, doctors found that a compound called  
D-chiro-iunositol, which occurs naturally in fruits and vegetables, 
appears effective without causing side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was conducted by Dr. John E. Nestler and colleagues  
from Virginia Commonwealth University. It was published in 
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	They tested 44 women. Half got the drug, and half got dummy  
pills. After six to eight weeks of treatment, 86 percent on those 
on the drug ovulated, compared with 27 percent of those in the 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	Those getting the drug also had improvements in their levels of  
insulin, blood sugar, blood pressure and testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is  
funding a larger study of the drug's safety and effectiveness. It 
is made by Insmed Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Richmond, Va.

<HEADLINE> Stephen Got Even Hopes To Win Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The baby tooth in the pendant is  
encircled by gold and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the glare, it's not hard to notice the tooth in the  
bauble that hangs from an gold chain around Tomisue Hilbert's neck. 
The tooth belonged to a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my good luck charm,'' said the wife of Steve Hilbert, the  
owner Stephen Got Even, who will go into Saturday's Kentucky Derby 
off an impressive victory in the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tooth fell out while the colt was in the paddock before the  
Gallery Furniture on March 27 at Turfway Park, and Tomisue saw it 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It so happened the Hilberts had their sons, Christopher, 9, and  
Thomas, 4, and, she said, ``We made a wish to the tooth fairy to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even not only won the 1 1/8-mile race, his 2 1/2-length  
victory in only his fourth start kept him unbeaten in three races 
this year and made him a leading contender for the 1 1/4-mile Derby at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll go right to the Broadway show (the Derby) right  
from here,'' trainer Nick Zito said after the race. And that's what 
Zito has done with the colt who will give him a double-barreled 
shot at his third Derby victory. Zito, who also will saddle Wood 
Memorial winner Adonis for the 125th Derby, won the race with 
Strike the Gold in 1991 and with Go for Gin in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt put in his final serious workout for the Derby last  
Saturday when he went five-eighths of a mile in 1:02 2-5 in company 
with another horse. Chris McCarron, who will ride Stephen Got Even 
for the first time in the Derby, flew in from California for the 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to be associated with Nick again,'' said  
McCarron, who won with Go for Gin. ``He knows how to get a horse up 
for the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hilbert, president and CEO of Conseco, Inc., the  
largest publicly traded insurance company in the nation, Zito had 
the Derby in mind for colt after his only race as a 2-year-old -- a 
second-place finish Nov. 28 at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hilbert, who paid $325,000 for Stephen Got Even  
at the 1997 Keeneland July Select Yearling Sale, recalled asking 
Zito what his plans were for the colt. Hilbert said he was 
referring to the next race, but Zito's response was his plan was 
for the colt to be at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even got his first victory in a 1 1-16-mile race  
maiden race Jan. 30 at Gulfstream Park and followed that up by 
winning a 1 1-16-mile allowance Race Feb. 27, also at Gulfstream. 
Then came the big win in the Gallery Furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later the other half of Zito's Derby Duo, Adonis,  
owned by Ernie Paragallo, turned in an impressive victory in the 
Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third Derby for Paragallo (Unbridled's Song,  
fifth, 1996, and Artax, 13th, 1998), but the first for the 
Hilberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher and Thomas Hilbert will be at Churchill Downs on  
Derby Day. So, of course, will the good luck charm.

	That combination left Etbauer No. 21 on the graded stakes  
earning list of Derby hopefuls. Only the top 20 are entered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crummy feeling,'' Etbauer trainer Steve Wren said  
Wednesday. He and owner Hays Biggs hung around Churchill Downs 
during the morning, waiting for Baffert to make a decision about 
Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly and General Challenge are owned by the Golden Eagle  
Farm of John and Betty Mabee and Mabee said entering Excellent 
Meeting was an insurance policy of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer has $75,000 in graded earnings, but Valhol had only  
$38,400 prior to the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Racing Commission ordered Oaklawn Park to put the  
first-place check on hold during an investigation that began after 
Oaklawn officials said they had evidence that Valhol jockey Billy 
Patin might have carried an illegal electrical device. Patin says 
he is innocent and a hearing in the case is May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said Wednesday he considered challenging the judge's  
ruling, but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby, to me, is the epitome of horse racing,''  
he said. ``I was just not going to tarnish it. Horse racing has 
been tarnished enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to sound like a guy bellyaching about spilled  
beans but that should have never happened,'' Biggs said. ``I feel 
bad that my horse and my trainer are penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week, when they have the hearing and all this is going to  
come out, it will not be easy to swallow,'' Biggs said. ``I've been 
in athletics all my life. The coach says always play by the rules. 
I've always raised my family that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people in this game don't play that way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer ran second in his two races last year and started 1999  
with a 6 1/2-length victory in a maiden race. He won an allowance race 
at Oaklawn Park by a length and then captured the Grade III Rebel 
by almost a length on March 20. He finished sixth in the Arkansas 
Derby and jockey Calvin Borel said the son of Silver Deputy didn't 
like the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer will probably make his next start in the May 8 Illinois  
Derby 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said he was surprised that Baffert entered Excellent  
Meeting, but realized it was the trainer's prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs drove to Louisville because he planned to bring in his six  
children for the race and knew he would need extra vehicles to 
transport everybody. He plans to head home Thursday and said he 
would not watch the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got very close to getting in,'' he said. ``It would be very  
difficult for me.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Cancels Plans for Brazil Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has canceled plans to  
build a new auto plant in Rio Grande do Sul, a southern Brazilian 
state, citing a government decision to pull a $257 million 
financial incentive package from the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incentive package originally offered was a major factor in  
the company's decision to locate the plant in Guaiba,'' said a 
statement Wednesday from Marin Inglis, president of Ford South 
American Operations, and Ivan Fonseca e Silva, president of 
Ford-Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without such support, Ford Motor Co. simply cannot be  
competitive,'' it read. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio Grande do Sul state government said the $257 million  
incentive package extended to the Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford 
and General Motors Corp. was needed for infrastructure projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was expected to begin making 120,000 cars a year as of  
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will look at other sites for a Brazilian  
plant and continue its presence in Rio Grande do Sul through its 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors is still in negotiation with the Rio Grande do  
Sul government, said John Mueller, GM's director of international 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not really commenting on anything pending the outcome of  
those negotiations,'' Mueller said. ``We're still hoping to begin 
operations there next year.''

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Al Hirt, whose power and technique made him  
``The King of the Trumpet'' in the 1960s when he won a Grammy for 
his hit ``Java,'' died Tuesday of liver failure. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 21 Grammy nominations in a career spanning more than 50

<P>
	In all, he recorded more than 50 albums -- four gold and one  
platinum. ``Honey in the Horn'' reached No. 3 on Billboard's 
Popular Music Album Chart in 1963; ``Sugar Lips'' won Billboard's

	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Christian Howard, a leader in the movement  
that led the Church of England to ordain women as priests, died 
Thursday. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the General Synod, the church's governing body,  
she wrote a report, ``The Ordination of Women,'' in 1972. The 
report, which examined attitudes on women in church history as well 
as the Hebrew and Greek classical traditions, was updated in 1978 
and again in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a key document in a debate that ended in 1992 when the  
synod voted in favor of ordaining women. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a member of the faith and order committee of the World  
Council of Churches from 1961-75.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir William McCrea, an astrophysicist who made a  
vital contribution to the understanding of the sun's composition 
and went on to develop important theories about the evolution of 
galaxies and planets, died Sunday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young research student in 1929, McCrea conclusively  
confirmed a hypothesis that hydrogen was by far the most common 
element in the outer layers of the sun's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	His calculations -- and the subsequent realization that every  
star was mainly composed of hydrogen -- revolutionized the science 
of cosmology and led to the big-bang theory of the origin of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrea's publications included ``Relativity Physics'' (1935),  
``Physics of the Sun and Stars'' (1950), and ``History of the Royal 
Astronomical Society 1920 to 1980'' (1987).

	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Rose Payne, whose more than three  
decades of research advanced the field of organ transplants, died 
April 18. She was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, an expert in tissue-typing, was credited with helping to  
identify proteins that play a key role in how the body accepts a 
tissue graft or blood transfusion. Before her work, doctors had to 
try and guess the likelihood of a transplant's success solely on 
matching the blood type of the donor and recipient.

	In 1984, the American Society for Histocompatibility and  
Immunogenetics named an award in her honor.

International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers during the years of 
its greatest membership, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillard was the IBEW's president from 1968 to 1986. During that  
period the union successfully challenged President Nixon's federal 
wage controls as penalizing the working poor and won a case forcing 
Westinghouse to disclose information about its treatment of female 
and minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillard started his union career as an electrician in Buffalo,  
During his tenure as IBEW president, the union reached a peak

movie credits included ``Pork Chop Hill'' and the current ``Forces 
of Nature,'' died Thursday of heart failure. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he was finished in show business in 1964 when an  
84-foot crane toppled on the television set of ``No Time for 
Sergeants'' and broke his back. He then decided to become a casting 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Remsen was casting the part of a psychotic cop in the film  
``Brewster McCloud'' in 1970 when director Robert Altman suddenly 
looked at him and said, ``You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later worked in other Altman films, including ``McCabe &AMP; Mrs.  
Miller,'' ``California Split,'' ``Nashville'' and ``Thieves Like 
Us,'' and he soon abandoned the casting business. 
</P>
<P>
	Other credits included ``A Wedding,'' ``Fast Break,'' ``The

Tracy,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``The Bodyguard,'' ``The Player'' and 
``Maverick.''

Honor cross for service during World War I, died Thursday. He was 
112.

<P>
	Young received France's highest award for military service in  
February. He was named a knight in the National Order of the Legion 
of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the 807 Pioneer Infantry, Young served as a  
corporal in the bloody Meuse-Argonne offensive, which claimed the 
lives of thousands of American soldiers and was considered a 
turning point in the war. 
</P>
<P>
	His unit was one of many all-black outfits that fought on the  
front lines under the French flag because of U.S. Army segregation 
policies.

<HEADLINE> Coach in His Element As Wings Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- He hardly caused a ripple during the regular  
season. Those games are just warmups for the main event in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	It is in the playoffs when Detroit coach Scotty Bowman finds his  
element. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Red Wings' four-game sweep of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in  
the first round, they got outstanding scoring from Steve Yzerman 
and clutch goaltending by Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team also got the best of Bowman. That may prove most  
important of all as the Red Wings attempt to win the Stanley Cup 
for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scotty kind of comes to life this time of the year,'' Yzerman  
said. ``But he doesn't have to say very much to this group of 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, 65, has a 1,100-516-284 regular season mark and a  
198-112 playoff record, winning five Stanley Cups with Montreal, 
two with Detroit and one with Pittsburgh. The only other coach to 
win eight Stanley Cups is his mentor, Toe Blake. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five times in NHL history have teams won three or more  
championships in succession, and no team has done it since Al 
Arbour guided the New York Islanders to four straight Cup titles 
between 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman began laying the groundwork for his latest run before the  
playoffs began. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the trading deadline -- during which the Red Wings  
added some much-needed muscle in Chris Chelios, Wendel Clark, Ulf 
Samuelsson and goalie Bill Ranford -- Bowman began resting many of 
his veterans. The fresh legs were a factor against Anaheim as 
Yzerman scored five goals in the four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, a master at the mind games that add spice to the  
playoffs, went to work early against the Mighty Ducks. An example 
that stands out was the way he split up his defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the season, Nicklas Lidstrom, the Red Wings' best  
defender, had been paired with Larry Murphy. Against the Mighty 
Ducks, Bowman had Lidstrom skating with Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
	It proved to be a master stroke.  
</P>
<P>
	Lidstrom and Chelios skated every shift against the high-powered  
Anaheim line of Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, holding them to 
three goals. Kariya broke his left foot stopping a shot and was 
unable to play in Game 4. But it probably wouldn't have mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern had been set by Bowman. The damage was already too  
great. Detroit won the fourth game 3-0 and awaits the outcome of 
Colorado's first-round series with the San Jose Sharks. If the 
Avalanche advance, as expected, Detroit and Denver would resume 
their grudge match in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who missed the first two weeks of the season while  
recovering from heart surgery and a knee operation, also 
demonstrated his skill behind the bench during the sweep of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third game, the Mighty Ducks were giving the Red  
Wings fits. The game was tied at 2 early in the second period when 
Stu Grimson cross-checked Kris Draper. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimson's five-minute major, coupled with another penalty, left  
Detroit with a two-man advantage for two minutes, and a power play 
for a full three minutes after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of just going with the flow, however, Bowman called  
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Most coaches like to save their timeouts for late in the game.  
Bowman felt this was the time to seize control. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman had been carrying the puck on the left side, with  
Brendan Shanahan and Clark crashing the crease. It wasn't working, 
but Bowman told the team to stay with it. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked. Yzerman's power-play goal gave Detroit a 3-2 lead.  
The Red Wings skated away with a 4-2 victory and a 3-0 edge in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what Scotty's going to have up his sleeve,''  
forward Darren McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially during the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Mourning Out 2 More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning will miss at  
least two more games after being diagnosed Wednesday with a slight 
fracture of his right eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery won't be necessary, but Miami's leading scorer and  
rebounder will have to wear a protective device in the playoffs for 
the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a face mask or goggles, we won't know until after  
he tries some things on,'' team spokesman Tim Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning missed two games last season and played with a  
protective mask for 10 more after breaking his left cheekbone in a 
late-season collision against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, who missed Tuesday night's win at New Jersey, will sit  
out games Thursday against Boston and Saturday against Chicago but 
could be back Sunday at home against Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning is having perhaps his best season, averaging 20.3  
points and 11.0 rebounds and leading the league in blocked shots 
with a 4.0 average. He was considered a strong candidate for league 
MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest injury came in the first quarter of Monday night's  
90-65 win at Cleveland, when the Cavaliers' Cedric Henderson hit 
him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning continued playing, finishing with 23 points, 12  
rebounds and four blocks. But he complained of discomfort afterward 
and was sent home Tuesday for further examination, missing that 
night's win at New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	A second facial injury to Mourning caused coach Pat Riley to say  
that officials need to pay closer attention to what defenders are 
doing to his star center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy gets pounded and hit in the head more than any player  
I have ever coached in my life -- over the head, in the face,'' 
Riley said. ``He's just fortunate he doesn't get hurt more.''

	Clinton Presses for Kosovo Funds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed Congress today to  
approve swiftly $6 billion to pay for the conflict with Yugoslavia, 
urging lawmakers to resist Republican-led efforts to double his 
request. A White House spokesman said that Clinton fears that ``any 
additional funding creates the potential for political fights and 
dangerous delay.'' Clinton accused Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic of waging a ``meticulously planned'' campaign to drive 
1.8 million ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.

	Outspoken Yugoslav Official Is Ousted  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's moderate deputy prime  
minister was fired today after urging Serb leaders to realize that 
``we cannot defeat NATO.'' Vuk Draskovic has been critical of 
President Slobodan Milosevic and urged compromise with NATO. 
Draskovic was once the main opposition leader before joining the 
government three months ago. A NATO spokesman has pointed to 
Draskovic's recent remarks as a sign of serious cracks in the 
Yugoslav regime.

	Casino, Lottery Moratorium Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel studying gambling in America  
recommended today a nationwide moratorium on the spread of casinos, 
lotteries and slot machines. The commission's report will contain a 
call for ``a pause'' in the spread of legalized gambling and 
encourage state and local governments to form their own gambling 
study commissions. The group's chairwoman says there's no way to 
justify adding more gambling without further research. But one 
American Indian on the panel says that's not a good enough reason 
to call for a moratorium. The panel has no power to impose a 
moratorium.

	U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is changing U.S. foreign  
policy to exempt food and medicine from future economic sanctions, 
a White House official said today. Commercial licenses to sell 
agricultural and medicinal products under existing U.S. sanctions -- 
against Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Sudan -- will be 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the official said. The United 
States would include items considered ``human necessities'' in 
future sanctions and embargoes only in cases, for example, where 
the foreign regime is in armed conflict with the United States.

Agency called Saddam's life a ``success march.'' Government offices 
and schools were decorated with colorful posters and banners. 
Officials vied to express their support for Saddam, flooding 
television and radio stations as well as newspapers with

	Ex-Intel Worker Loses E-Mail Fight

	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- A judge ordered a disgruntled former employee  
who bombarded Intel workers with company-bashing electronic mail 
from sending any more of the messages. Ken Hamidi, an engineer with 
Intel, was fired in 1995 over unresolved claims of job-related 
injuries. Hamidi started a group called Former and Current 
Employees-Intel, known as Face-Intel, devoted to proving that Intel 
mistreats its workers. The microprocessor giant says the stories 
posted on Face-Intel's Web site -- such as blaming Intel for one 
worker's suicide and accusing the company of running a sweatshop in 
Malaysia -- are untrue.

	Obesity Risks Decline With Age  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as  
it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The 
findings are similar to those in a study reported last year that 
indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, 
but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are 
extremely obese. In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 
obese men and women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them 
for an average of 14.8 years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow industrials were  
up 39.23 to 10,870.94. Gainers on the New York Stock Exchange led 
losers 1,677-1,175. The Nasdaq was down 20.63 to 2,581.78.

	WNBA, Union Close to a Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA is close to resolving some labor  
difficulties and could get back to basketball issues shortly. A 
source said charity appearances by players is the last issue 
separating the WNBA and the union from a labor agreement. The WNBA, 
entering its third year, is supposed to begin a 10-week season June 
10. The labor dispute forced the postponement of this week's draft. 
The agreement calls for 5 percent increases a year for draft picks.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Closes Up 13.74 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mixed on Wednesday as  
investors again collected profits from technology shares and 
continued buying big manufacturing stocks, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average to a second straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 13.74 to 10,845.45 after being up as much as 103  
points earlier in the session. It closed Tuesday at a record 
10,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 11.89 to 1,350.91, and the Nasdaq  
composite index, which is heavily weighted in technology stocks, 
fell 52.04 to 2,550.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to a trading pattern that began last week, investors  
were buying previously ignored stocks of cyclical companies whose 
fortunes are closely tied to the economy. Analysts said growing 
signs that the global economy is recovering were making these 
stocks more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical stocks have raced ahead and more of the growth names  
have backed off a bit,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at 
Avatar Associates, referring to the drop in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The active buying of cyclical names pushed up industrial  
stalwarts like Dow component Alcoa, which rose 6 5/8 to 62; Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing, up 3 11/16 at 84 1/2; and Allied Signal, up 
3 1/16 at 59 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were higher as crude prices rose on an unexpected  
decline in domestic supplies. Dow component Exxon was up 3 1/4 at 81 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiasm for industrial stocks was bolstered by a report  
from the Commerce Department that orders to factories for 
big-ticket durable goods rose 2 percent in March after an 
end-of-winter slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are increasingly optimistic about corporate profits  
for the second half of the year. The current crop of earnings 
reports has generally been very positive, including some pleasant 
surprises like IBM's first-quarter results, and analysts said that 
bodes well for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which has surged higher over the past week, was hit by  
profit-taking along Wednesday with other technology shares and slid 
7 points to 205. Other technology stocks fell as traders took 
profits, and analysts said lingering anxiety about Internet stocks 
that have soared in recent months was also weighing on high-tech 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost 1 7/8 to 82 1/8 and was the most actively traded Nasdaq  
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some caution ahead of an earnings report from  
Amazon.com, scheduled to be released after the close of trading, 
and Amazon's shares were down 12 3/8 at 193 1/2. The online retailer 
reported a loss per share of 23 cents, outperforming analysts' 
expected loss of 29 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, shares of America Online, which surpassed analysts'  
expectations in an earnings report late Tuesday, shed 10 to 143. 
Lycos, which runs an Internet search engine, was down 4 1/8 at 96 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug and consumer stocks fell as investors shunned them in favor  
of industrial names. The exit from drug stocks was also prompted by 
McKesson HBOC Inc., a pharmaceutical supply-management company, 
which restated fourth-quarter results after discovering improperly 
recorded sales. McKesson's shares plunged 31 1/4 to 34 1/2. Coca-Cola 
slid 1 1/2 to 67 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	White said ``new money'' was coming into the marketplace, a sign  
that investors are more confident about stocks than they were a few 
months ago. Earlier in the year, investors parked tremendous sums 
of money in short-term money market funds, and White said this 
money now appears to be coming into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim 9-to-8 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 
1.17 billion shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.95 to 640.32, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.62 to 777.69. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.63 to 433.53. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 0.09  
percent. In Europe, the FT-SE 100 in London set its second straight 
closing high, rising 0.1 percent to 6,598.8. The DAX index in 
Frankfurt inched up 0.02 percent, while the CAC index in Paris 
eased 0.4 after hitting a record on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> AOL Stock Down Despite Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings for America Online  
Inc. tripled as revenue soared 66 percent, helped by the addition 
of 1.8 million new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $117 million, or 11 cents per share,  
excluding charges, in the three months ended March 31. In the same 
quarter a year ago, AOL earned $39 million, or 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
9 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to nearly $1.3 billion -- the first $1 billion  
quarter in the company's 14-year history. Advertising, commerce and 
other revenues accounted for $275 million of the increase, up 94 
percent over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong performance, AOL stock retreated today,  
extending losses from Tuesday before the earnings report was 
released. Analysts attributed the selling to profit-taking from 
AOL's earlier 49 percent one-week surge. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL was down $2.87 1/2 at $150.12 1/2 a share in early trading today  
after tumbling $9 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including its purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. and  
other one-time events, AOL posted net income of $420 million, or 33 
cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $78 million, 
or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL completed its nearly $10 billion acquisition of Netscape on  
March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pivotal quarter for America Online,'' AOL chairman  
and CEO Steve Case said Tuesday. ``Through key acquisitions and 
partnerships, we substantially broadened and deepened our 
capabilities, and advanced our leadership in interactive 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said third-quarter results ``demonstrate that we can deliver  
strong, consistent growth in profits while taking advantage of 
opportunities to improve our competitive position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lise Buyer, an analyst with CS First Boston, said the company's  
performance was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly compelling that they have 19 million  
customers,'' she said. ``That's an immense number and gives them 
tremendous clout with advertisers. ... It looks like it was a 
tremendously solid quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has nearly 17 million members, plus another 2 million  
subscribers through its CompuServe subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president, said in an interview that the  
third-quarter results illustrate that ``we've transformed ourselves 
into a multiple-brand, multiple-revenue company, and it's all 
coming together nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time events, net income for the first nine months  
of the fiscal year was $249 million on revenue of $3.4 billion, 
compared with earnings of $1 million on revenues of $2.1 billion in 
the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Losing Trifecta in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to sports, the nation's capital  
is a loser. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1980-81, Washington's three biggest  
sports teams have been shut out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins and Capitals were buried long ago. The Wizards  
completed the triple frown with a loss at Boston on Sunday night 
that eliminated them from the postseason chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they should fire Norv Turner, fire Charley Casserly,  
and I think Abe Pollin should lower his prices and try to bring 
back the fans,'' said fan Paul Grimshaw, 41, taking swipes in one 
swoop at the Redskins coach and general manager and the 
Wizards-Capitals owner. 
</P>
<P>
	This is no mere malaise. The teams surrounding the U.S. halls of  
power have fallen mightily in staggering, unique and embarrassing 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner thought the Redskins were playoff-bound last fall after  
the team spent more than $100 million on new signings. Instead, the 
Skins came of the gate 0-7 -- the franchise's worst start in 37 
years. They finished 6-10, missing the playoffs for the sixth 
straight year, their longest rut since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's as poor a performance as I can say I've ever been  
involved with,'' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals' fall from grace was historic. They became the  
first team in nearly a half century to sandwich a Stanley Cup 
finals appearance between two nonplayoff seasons. They are believed 
to be the first team in NHL history to accumulate more than 500 
man-games (511) lost because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals expected to make a return trip to the finals. They  
forgot they had to score goals and play defense and finished with a 
31-45-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we just thought it would come too easy,'' left wing  
Brian Bellows said. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the Wizards (18-29) might have been the easiest  
to predict. In the offseason, they rid themselves of Chris Webber 
with a trade that made them older and smaller. As a result, they've 
played like a team that is, well, older and smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought anything like this would happen to this  
team,'' guard Mitch Richmond said after Sunday's 113-84 humiliation 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall guy was coach Bernie Bickerstaff, fired after 32 games  
and replaced by assistant Jim Brovelli. It didn't help. The Wizards 
are mired in a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital's sports crash hit other teams as well. John  
Thompson resigned as Georgetown's basketball coach in the midst of 
the team's first losing season in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The George Washington men lost in the first round of the NCAA  
tournament -- again. The GW women, usually a national force, didn't 
even get an invitation to the NCAAs. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's adopted baseball team, the Baltimore Orioles, has the  
worst record in the majors. Even two-time Major League Soccer 
champion D.C. United has lost two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a new team came to town and promptly set a record for  
ineptitude: The WNBA's Mystics went 3-27, thought to be the worst 
pro basketball season record ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 18 years ago, the 1980-81 seasons, when the Redskins,  
Capitals and Wizards (then the Bullets) were last shut out from the 
playoffs together. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bullets snapped a 12-year string of postseason appearances.  
The Capitals, only 7 years old, weren't any good yet. The Redskins 
had yet to hire Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosperity followed for much of a decade. Then the Bullets got  
bad, followed by the Redskins. The Capitals kept the string alive 
single-handedly for much of the 1990s until a 14-year playoff run 
ended in 1996-97, but that coincided the Wizards ending an 
eight-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such renaissance this year. Everyone lost, and it  
could happen again next year. The Redskins and Capitals are 
rebuilding; the Wizards need a new coach and more size. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be rough on a fan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I find myself watching half of the games,'' said Mick Barham,  
32, eating with his two friends at Brion's Grille. ``I'm just not 
as interested anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to factories for big-ticket durable  
goods from refrigerators to tanks recovered somewhat in March from 
an end-of-winter slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders rose 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $197.7 billion,  
with improvement showing in most sectors, the Commerce Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase followed a decline in demand for durable goods in  
February, although revised figures released today pegged that drop 
at 3.9 percent, not as bad as the 5.0 percent decline first 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had predicted a modest rebound in March. However,  
many analysts remain concerned about signs of weakness in U.S. 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In financial markets, Treasury bond prices already were losing  
ground before the durable-goods figures came out and slipped 
further after the report was released. Yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds, a gauge of long-term borrowing costs, rose to 5.57 percent 
in early trading from 5.54 percent late Tuesday. Bond yields move 
in the opposite direction of prices. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been hurt by world economic troubles  
that began in Asia nearly two years ago. Export sales have 
plummeted, and low-priced imports have increased competition for 
consumers' attention here. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, U.S. factories have cut hundreds of thousands of  
jobs over the past year. But many businesses would have been much 
harder hit if not for the fact that Americans, still enjoying 
plenty of jobs and high stock prices, continue to spend briskly. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft spot in March durable-goods orders was primary metals,  
where demand fell 1.4 percent after a wild upward swing of 7.3 
percent in February. The steel industry, which falls into this 
sector, has been among the hardest hit by economic hard times 
abroad and is seeking government protection from low-priced 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for military goods jumped 36.2 percent in March.  
Excluding defense items, orders for all other goods rose 1 percent 
for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation orders rose 3.6 percent in March after a large,  
12.8 percent drop in February that was somewhat skewed by a 
downward swing in demand for aircraft. Planes are so expensive a 
few orders more or less can distort other trends. 
</P>
<P>
	March orders for electronic and other electrical equipment rose  
3.1 percent, and for industrial machinery and equipment, rose 2.9 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Duval Returns To Play Houston Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Too late for snowboarding and too  
early for fly fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, the world's top-ranked golfer, has decided it's  
time to play some golf after a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be bad news for the rest of the PGA touring pros  
teeing off with Duval in the first round Thursday of the $2.5 
million Shell Houston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Duval took a break, he returned to win the first  
two events he entered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went snowboarding until they shut down the slopes, wore out  
a spot on my chair at home and went to a clinic at Pebble Beach and 
there is two weeks gone,'' said Duval, looking rested and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval already has won four times this season. He started off  
with victories in the Mercedes Championships and the Bob Hope 
Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost in the second round of the Match Play  
Championship, Duval took three weeks off and returned to win The 
Players Championship and BellSouth Classic in consecutive weeks. He 
tied for sixth in the Masters the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got the urge for more snowboarding, one of his favorite  
pastimes when he's not fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivers are too high (for fishing) until at least July, so  
I guess I have to play golf,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval came from five shots down with eight holes to play to win  
last year's Shell Houston Open by one shot over Jeff Maggert. 
Maggert, a winner at the WGC-Andersen Championships, is back for 
another run at the par-72, 7,018-yard TPC Course. Maggert is the 
No. 2 money-winner this season behind Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the field include Vijay Singh, Justin Leonard, Payne  
Stewart and Steve Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval doesn't quite comprehend his star appeal, even though he's  
zoomed to the top of the money list, won 11 of his last 35 
tournaments and unseated Tiger Woods as the No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being No. 1 symbolizes that I've played well, but the ranking  
doesn't help me play any better,'' Duval said. ``All it means is 
when you pick up that magazine my name is at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly hasn't changed Duval's humble approach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, I'm just not the type to hoot about being No. 1,  
that's not me,'' he said. ``I have noticed that it changes the way 
people look at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Duval's personal life has been documented since his rise  
to stardom. His 12-year-old brother Brent died after receiving bone 
marrow from Duval, who was 9 years old at the time. Other family 
difficulties have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I don't understand the fascination with me,'' Duval  
said. ``I don't think it (personal life) is something that is 
relevant to what I do out here on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't bring it up because someone might look at me and think  
I was looking for sympathy. There might be people in this room who 
have gone through a lot more than I have. They might say they've 
really had it rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval plans to play the Compaq Classic in New Orleans next week,  
skip the GTE Byron Nelson Classic (May 13-16) and enter the 
MasterCard Colonial (May 20-23).

<HEADLINE> Origin of Food on Labels Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Every day millions of Americans buy meat and  
produce in their grocery stores that may well have been imported 
from countries as far away as Chile and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a group of lawmakers is pushing for mandatory country of  
origin labels on those products, saying consumers have a right to 
know what they're purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of ironic that in the marketplace we label products  
from T-shirts to computers but we don't label food,'' Rep. Earl 
Pomeroy, D-N.D., who is a co-sponsor of legislation to require 
country of origin labeling for meat, said at a House hearing 
Wednesday. ``If it's good for T-shirts, it's good for T-bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added the bill's sponsor, Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, ``With  
free and open trade comes the responsibility to protect American 
consumers from inferior foreign product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imported meat products entering the United States are even  
allowed to carry the ``USDA'' label, which could mislead consumers, 
said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont. It's also unfair to American producers 
who contribute millions each year to promote their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't ask Coke to lend it's brand name to a competitor,''  
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion piece of legislation covering fruits and vegetables  
is sponsored by Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The country of origin debate has been waged in Congress for some  
time but with the agricultural economy sluggish partly from lagging 
exports, lawmakers are hoping to make headway on the issue this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the General Accounting Office, Congress'  
investigative and auditing arm, found that the United States 
imported 16 billion pounds of fresh produce in 1997, mostly from 
Mexico, Canada and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meat sector, the Agriculture Department estimates that 1  
percent of domestic beef consumption is from imported beef muscle 
cuts and that 24 percent of lamb consumption is imported. No 
figures were available on pork. Both the beef and sheep industries 
support labeling, but the National Pork Producers Association 
opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Patrick Boyle, president of the American Meat Institute,  
which represents meatpackers, warned lawmakers that mandatory 
labeling is ``not helpful but actually harmful to the U.S. 
livestock, meat and retail industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle said the legislation would cause a financial burden for  
producers, who would be required to keep good records to guarantee 
labeling accuracy, as well as packers who would have to spend 
millions to segregate domestic and foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Anderson, president of the American Frozen Food Institute,  
complained that labels would be particularly burdensome for frozen 
food products, which often contain numerous ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country of origin marking at the ingredient level would  
complicate significantly the manufacture of a frozen meat lasagna 
or other frozen food product,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Many Films Show Substance Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Musicians sing about guzzling liquor and movie  
stars puff cigarettes and take drugs on the big screen. But federal 
officials ask: Where is the unglamorous side of substance use -- 
like hangovers, slurred speech or getting in trouble with the law? 
</P>
<P>
	A government study released Wednesday says that people were  
depicted doing drugs, drinking or smoking in 98 percent of the top 
movie rentals and 27 percent of the most popular songs in 1996 and 
1997. Fewer than half these movie scenes and song lyrics mentioned 
any downside to these activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The $400,000 study of 200 movies -- rated from ``G'' for all ages  
to ``NC-17,'' no one under 17 admitted -- and 1,000 songs was 
commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The study stopped short of saying that music and films cause  
young people to use drugs, alcohol and tobacco. But researchers 
said that determining the frequency and nature of substance use in 
entertainment media is the first step toward understanding how much 
influence films and music have on young people's decisions to 
smoke, drink and take illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not suggest that we want to dictate the message. Drugs,  
alcohol and tobacco are a reality of American life. They should be 
part of the art form of the entertainment world,'' said Barry 
McCaffrey, drug control policy director for the Clinton 
administration. ``But we are suggesting they need to be tied to the 
consequences that are realistic, given our experiences in American 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Motion Picture Association of America spokesman declined to  
comment, saying there hadn't been enough time to review the 
two-year study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America issued a  
one-paragraph statement, saying efforts already were under way in 
the music industry to help control teen substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, for example, the music industry has put labels on  
recordings that contain strong language or descriptions of 
violence, sex or substance abuse. In an average record store with 
110,000 titles, about 500 recordings would have the ``parental 
advisory'' sticker, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelba Chavez, administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental  
Health Services Administration, said the entertainment media are a 
powerful influence on young people, but parents have more of an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of room for improvement in the entertainment  
world,'' she said, ``but there's just as much room for improvement 
in homes and communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, Ms. Chavez said only 3 percent of the song  
lyrics mentioned tobacco. And 15 percent of the movies that 
portrayed illicit drug use also contained an ``anti-use'' message, 
such as limiting how much and how often substances are used. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five of the movies, however, were substance-free. And in at  
least two of the five, there was a scene about using substances, 
according to Don Roberts, a Stanford University communications 
professor who helped research the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one scene, a set of characters sit around a tea table,  
drink out of little toy tea cups and go through an entire drunk 
shtick,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the study's other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Of the movies, 93 percent showed alcohol use, 89 percent  
tobacco use and 22 percent drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the songs, 17 percent included lyrics about people drinking  
alcohol, 18 percent using drugs and 3 percent smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than half the movies and more than 80 percent of the songs  
that mentioned drugs and alcohol indicated no consequence to users. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 669 major adult characters in the movies, 5 percent used  
illicit drugs, 25 smoked and 65 percent drank alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Past Is Prologue for Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a city trying hard to focus on the  
future, the two leading candidates for mayor can't seem to shake 
their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	John Street, the buttoned-down former City Council president  
seeking to become Philadelphia's second black mayor, is trying to 
live down his reputation from the 1980s as a hothead and a 
rabble-rouser. His opponent is running a commercial with footage 
from 18 years ago of Street -- then a community activist with a big 
Afro -- angrily shoving a reporter to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Street's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, lawyer Marty  
Weinberg, finds himself defending his political relationship with 
the late Mayor Frank Rizzo, one of the most polarizing figures in 
Philadelphia history. Rizzo left office 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the nature of Philadelphia politics to let these  
things go,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a Millersville University 
political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Weinberg lead a field of five Democrats trying to  
succeed Mayor Edward G. Rendell, who in two terms brought the city 
back from the brink of financial disaster. Philadelphia is now 
undergoing a downtown building boom, and its bright future includes 
the Republican National Convention in 2000. Rendell is prohibited 
from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the May 18 primary will face wealthy GOP  
businessman Sam Katz in the fall. Rendell himself describes Katz as 
a formidable opponent with a chance to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The race has drawn national big-league political talent for a  
race that experts say could be one of the most expensive mayoral 
contests in U.S. history, running up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, a political power broker making his first bid for  
office, has raised more than $3 million. Airing TV spots months 
before his rivals helped. In January, polls had him dead last. This 
month, a new poll showed him tied with Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a law professor at Drexel University when Rizzo  
named him city solicitor in 1972. The two forged a close political 
relationship that lasted until Rizzo's death in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzo's administration was blamed for police brutality and  
financial mismanagement, and on the campaign trail, Weinberg always 
gets questioned about his ties to Rizzo. In a recent television 
debate, Street said he ``would hate to go back'' to the Rizzo 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg stands by his political mentor.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Rizzo did a lot of very good things for the city of  
Philadelphia. He was not perfect. He made mistakes. But nobody can 
ever deny the fact he loved this city and devoted his life to it,'' 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia politics, the question of race is never far  
below the surface. But political observers said so far, it has not 
become a dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the candidates are really striving hard to avoid these  
deep racial divisions,'' Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who is white, expects to do well in the blue-collar  
rowhouse neighborhoods of this city of 1.5 million people, more 40 
percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a formidable foe in Street, who forged a close  
alliance with Rendell early this decade. Together, they took on the 
city's municipal unions and helped turn a $250 million budget 
deficit into a surplus before Street stepped down from the City 
Council to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who leaves office with a glittering future and has  
discussed running for governor, has endorsed Street's candidacy and 
appeared in one of his campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was a vociferous community activist in his early days,  
protesting everything from vending regulations to housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a temper. Besides shoving the TV reporter (who sued  
and settled for $1,000), Street is notorious for a 1981 fistfight 
on the floor of City Council spurred by the possibility of a school 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	After that episode, Street began exerting more control over  
himself. His political views changed, too. Once a liberal, he had 
become by 1989 a fiscal conservative and a budget hawk. Street was 
elected City Council president in 1992, the year Rendell took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's changed,'' said Randall Miller, a St. Joseph's University  
professor who follows Philadelphia politics. ``He's changed because 
he has exercised extraordinary self-discipline, as he insisted the 
city should do.''

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Celebrity Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Randy Travis  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Randy Bruce Traywick was born on May 4, 1959,  
in Marshville, N.C. He began singing country music and playing 
guitar at 8. He moved to Charlotte, N.C., at 16 and performed in 
nightclubs for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, he stacked up arrests and spent numerous weekends  
in a county jail in Monroe, N.C. But after winning a talent contest 
at Country City USA in Charlotte in 1977 -- and pairing with manager 
Lib Hatcher, now his wife, -- he managed to break into big-time 
country music as Randy Travis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd come from a house where some crazy things went on. My  
father was a little bit wild and still is. I didn't know anything 
else. It was just the way we lived,'' he has said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Making music:* In the 1980s, his hits like ``On the Other  
Hand'' and ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' steered country music back to 
its traditional roots, and arguably to the sales boom of the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Storms of Life'' appeared in mid-1986. It went platinum in  
less than a year. His next two albums, ``Always and Forever'' and 
``8 X 10,'' won Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Is Me'' and ``Before You Kill Us All'' kept him in the  
top 10 in 1994. ``Whisper My Name'' became his 19th No. 1 hit that 
same year. In 1995 he hit the top 10 with ``The Box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Making films:* Travis has appeared in several films including  
``Young Guns,'' ``Frank and Jesse,'' ``Fire Down Below,'' ``The 
Rainmaker'' and ``Baby Geniuses.'' His upcoming films include 
``White River Kid'' with Antonio Banderas and Ellen Barkin. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``I still want to compete! I want to be out there and  
getting the airplay and selling tickets and playing shows. I don't 
want to quit. I love this. That's what it boils down to, I love to 
sing. You have to want to do it and continue putting out quality 
material.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 17.18 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were narrowly mixed on Wall Street on  
Wednesday as investors kept on buying big industrial stocks and 
took more profits from technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
17.18 at 10,848.89 after rising 113.12 Tuesday to a new closing 
high of 10,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 3.76 at 1,359.04, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
which is heavily weighted in technology stocks, was down 23.06 at 
2,579.35. 
</P>
<P>
	The market returned to the divergent trading pattern it began  
last week, with industrial stocks rising on growing signs that the 
global economy is recovering. That has increased trader appetites 
for economically-sensitive industrial companies like Dow component 
Alcoa, which was up 3 5/16 at 58 11/16 today. Another Dow stock, 
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, was up 1 11/16 at 55 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was optimistic about corporate profits for the second  
half of this year. The current crop of earnings reports has 
generally been very positive, including some pleasant surprises 
like IBM's first-quarter results, and analysts said that bodes well 
for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which has surged higher over the past week, was down 4 at  
208 today amid profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology stocks were falling as traders collected  
profits, and analysts reported lingering anxiety about Internet 
stocks that have soared in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities,  
said there was some caution in the market today as traders awaited 
an earnings report from Amazon.com, scheduled to be released after 
the close of trading. Amazon's results were being watched closely 
as a possible harbinger of what's to come for other online 
companies. The company's stock was down 8 1/4 at 197 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, which surpassed analyst expectations in an  
earnings report issued late Tuesday, was down 3 1/2 to 149 1/2. Lycos, 
which runs an internet search engine, was down 4 7/8 at 96 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 426.1 million shares, 
down slightly from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Marfan Patients Urged On Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Surgery to correct a life-threatening heart defect  
in people with Marfan's syndrome is far safer if done before 
symptoms develop, researchers reported today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200,000 people in the United States have Marfan's  
syndrome, an inherited disorder of the connective tissue. Those who 
inherit it are often unusually tall and are likely to have weakened 
aortas that can rupture disastrously, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, the average life expectancy of people with  
the disorder was about 45. But it is now in the 70s, in part 
because of the use of open-heart surgery to repair weakened aortas. 
</P>
<P>
	New research concludes that this repair should be performed as  
soon as the defect is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Vincent L. Gott and others from Johns Hopkins University  
compared the results of routine aorta repair with waiting until the 
condition causes symptoms, when the surgery often must be done as 
an emergency operation. They reviewed the records of 675 patients 
who underwent aorta repair between 1968 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who got elective surgery, about 2 percent died  
during the month following the operation. However, when the 
operation was considered an emergency, 12 percent died.

<HEADLINE> DEA Opens Its Own Training Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration is opening  
a $29 million training academy for its agents beside the FBI 
Academy at Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new academy is a dream come true for us at DEA,'' said  
Administrator Thomas Constantine, whose agency previously shared 
space in the FBI Academy. ``We will no longer have to work around 
the classroom space shortages we faced in recent years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which opens Wednesday, can house 250 trainees, two  
to a room, and will provide the basic 16-week training course that 
all new DEA agents receive. There are eight classrooms, each 
seating about 50. Two are equipped for computer training and one 
has simultaneous translation facilities for international classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers, audiovisual equipment, telephone and security  
arrangements cost $5 million in addition to the $29 million 
construction cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Support facilities include a health office, cafeteria, post  
office, bank and dry cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjacent to the new training center will be a special structure  
to train agents in the investigation of clandestine drug 
laboratories. This is often a life-threatening assignment because 
these labs typically contain explosive, flammable or toxic 
materials and may emit odorless, colorless poisonous gases. 
</P>
<P>
	As of this year, DEA has given the clandestine lab course to  
more than 4,600 federal, state and local agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, DEA trained 3,000 of its international counterparts.  
That program will continue in the new facility, as will the DEA's 
training of state and local police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA trainees will continue to share a driver training course,  
firing range, gymnasium and auditorium with the FBI.

<HEADLINE> Brain Can Process Backward Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The ability to understand speech is so deeply ingrained that  
people can decipher recorded sentences that have been chopped into 
brief segments and played backwards, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Digitally recorded sentences were sliced into very short  
segments in the study, then reversed. The distorted speech was 
played to seven test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants had no problem understanding the sentences.  
Their brains were apparently able to perceive the syllables as 
sounding nearly the same whether heard backwards or forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you distort speech, it distorts certain aspects, but  
other parameters are still able to convey the message,'' said 
Kourosh Saberi, a researcher at the California Institute of 
Technology's division of biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberi and David R. Perrott of California State University in  
Los Angeles' department of psychology reported their findings in 
today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Kent, a professor of communicative disorders at the  
University of Wisconsin in Madison, said the research demonstrates 
that many areas of the brain are used to handle complicated 
auditory signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are both hemispheres of the brain involved in speech  
processing, but eyesight plays a significant role by allowing 
people to unconsciously lip read to fill in missing data, Kent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has gone to a party held in a crowded room filled  
with music and chattering people has tapped those skills to 
understand what others are saying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this tells us is that speech is quite robust. We can  
perceive it even when a number of things have been done to distort 
or muddy the signal,'' Kent said. ``Somehow the information is 
preserved or at least recoverable to us even when it's played 
backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Greenberg, a researcher at the International Computer  
Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said the findings could 
someday lead to improved speech-recognition programs that allow 
computers to respond to spoken commands. 
</P>
<P>
	It also adds to a growing body of evidence disputing the notion  
that individual vowels and consonants are crucial to understanding 
the spoken word, he said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Trumpet Extraordinaire Hirt Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With a combination of power and virtuosity,  
Al Hirt could ruffle curtains at the back of an auditorium or ease 
out a honey-toned melody with his trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old musician, whose lilting version of ``Java'' won  
a Grammy in 1964, died Tuesday at home of liver failure. He had 
been in failing health since leaving a hospital a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt's dazzling skill, amplified by awesome power, resulted in  
21 Grammy nominations during his 50-year career. ``Java'' won for 
best non-jazz instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented a certain particular style of New Orleans music  
-- not just Dixieland or traditional jazz,'' said George Wein, 
producer of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a side of New Orleans entertainment best personified by  
Louis Prima -- the waving handkerchief, the dancing, the whole 
showbiz aspect, all the time playing good music. It was unique to 
New Orleans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Hirt recorded more than 50 albums -- four gold and one  
platinum. ``Honey in the Horn'' reached No. 3 on Billboard's 
Popular Music Album Chart in 1963; ``Sugar Lips'' won Billboard's 
favorite instrumentalist of 1965. In 1962, he was named `best 
trumpeter' in the Playboy jazz poll, a prize he won for 15 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
	At his peak, he played for John Kennedy's inauguration, starred  
at Carnegie Hall, and headlined numerous television variety shows, 
including his own ``Fanfare'' program on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best trumpet players all around the world,''  
said clarinetist Pete Fountain, a longtime friend. ``He had 
everything -- technique, stamina, education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt and Fountain started out together, working as exterminators  
by day and playing music at night. They remained friends for more 
than 50 years and in recent years toured together with their two 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Alois Maxwell Hirt in New Orleans in 1922, Hirt got his  
first trumpet when he was 6 and was hailed as a prodigy when he was 
13. He was classically trained at the Cincinnati Conservatory of 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
	His first big break came in 1950, when he won second place in  
Horace Heidt's National Youth Opportunity Contest and was named 
solo trumpet in Heidt's band. 
</P>
<P>
	Real national fame came in 1960 when Hirt's Dixieland Six caught  
the attention of Dinah Shore and he became an overnight success on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt didn't call it jazz.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a pop commercial musician, and I've got a successful  
format,'' he once said. ``If you have the ability to perform your 
musical idea, you become a good jazz player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirt tried to arrange his career so he could stay with his wife  
and eight kids in New Orleans, where he was one of the original 
group to bring professional football to the city. His club on 
Bourbon Street became his musical headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Hirt found himself in the spotlight for an unusual  
reason: a busted lip suffered while riding a Mardi Gras float. He 
told officers he was hit in the face with a brick. The injury 
required 12 stitches and hampered his playing for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, he provoked controversy when he said he had had enough  
of the crime and filth of the French Quarter and closed the club he 
had operated since 1960. He later apologized, but did not reopen 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
	After that he mostly toured and performed on television, with  
only occasional local appearances at ``Jellyroll's'' in the French 
Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered one of his most important performances the 1987  
solo of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope John Paul II during the 
pontiff's visit to New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> McTeddy Craze Hits Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Move over, Teenie Beanies. McTeddy  
Bears are the latest craze, causing a frenzy in McDonald's 
restaurants in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors mobbed Malaysia's 122 McDonald's outlets Tuesday,  
pushing and shoving, even ripping a glass door from its hinges at 
one branch, to lay hands on a pair of promotional ``Wedding 
Bears,'' the last in a series of 14 miniatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Overwhelmed by the mania, McDonald's said Wednesday it would  
order more of the toys to meet customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-inch bears, which were sold only in Asian McDonald's  
outlets, sold out within hours after people camped out overnight to 
avoid lines. Adults fought and yelled, and police were called to 
certain stores to control the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started the McTeddy promotion, we didn't expect  
front-page news,'' Loi Liang Tok, marketing director for McDonald's 
Malaysia, said Wednesday. ``We just wish we'd ordered more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the heavy demand, McDonald's has set up a special  
mail-order option, with a relaxed May 15 deadline, so collectors 
can buy their bears from a Hong-Kong supplier, Loi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The McTeddy Bears went on sale in Malaysia on April 1. The  
frenzy this week may have been exacerbated by collectors' desire to 
own a complete set, including bathing bears, beach bears, boating 
bears and Scottish bears. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's is accustomed to wildly popular promotions. In 1997,  
the company offered the popular Teenie Beanies with its Happy Meals 
in the United States, prompting some parents to buy caseloads of 
the meals. The Teenie Beanies will again go on sale in June in U.S. 
restaurants, spokesman Brad Trask said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said customers were equally excited about a line of 28 Snoopy  
collectibles sold last year in Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is yet another example of promotions in Asia that have  
really illicited a phenomenal reaction,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Foreman Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Never one for bobbing and weaving in the  
ring, former heavyweight champion George Foreman had little problem 
ducking a question: What did he tell a federal grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman testified Wednesday before a grand jury reportedly  
investigating whether the International Boxing Federation sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the grand jury room in the old federal courthouse here  
for less than an hour. On the advice of his lawyer, he would not 
discuss his testimony. But asked if he had ever paid a kickback, he 
said, ``No,'' and said that this was his first appearance before 
any grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Lawrence H. Wechsler, would not comment Wednesday,  
but has said federal prosecutors are examining whether Foreman was 
extorted by sanctioning groups, and that he did not know if Foreman 
ever paid to better his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	In past weeks, the grand jury has heard from officials of the  
East Orange-based IBF, one of the world's three major sanctioning 
organizations. It does not appear that its president, Robert W. Lee 
Sr., has testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, of Houston, was happy to talk about the need to reform  
boxing and the sanctioning groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that boxing should be given some time to clean up its  
act. If not, someone should do it for them,'' Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although inactive in the ring for several years, Foreman -- who  
recently turned 50 -- also said he wants to fight the man he 
considers the heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to keep coming back until I'm a grandfather and  
boxing is a sport as clean as ping pong,'' said Foreman, who later 
playfully sparred with news photographers outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	At 45, Foreman captured the IBF and World Boxing Association  
championships to become the oldest champion in any weight class, 
and now boasts a record of 76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury earlier this month heard from the boxing judge  
criticized for her scoring in last month's Evander Holyfield-Lennox 
Lewis heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, told the grand  
jury that no one attempted to sway her decision, her lawyer has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation here preceded a controversial draw in the  
Holyfield-Lewis fight, which prompted New York law enforcement 
agencies to start their own probes of the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three judges, only the IBF-picked judge -- Williams -- had  
Holyfield, the IBF and WBA champ, winning the fight many believed 
Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Foreman: ``I think Lewis won the fight hands  
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it was not the first robbery the sport has seen, and  
claimed his defeat in 1974 by Muhammad Ali in Africa should be a 
prime example. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the Holyfield-Lewis fight created an  
opportunity for improvements, including having the sanctioning 
groups adopt guidelines on how they set rankings, Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, its attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the WBA and World  
Boxing Council -- by their rules and rankings, play a large role in 
determining whom a boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups risk 
losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large purses.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas State Senator Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Four current or former Arkansas  
lawmakers, including the most powerful member of the Arkansas 
Senate, are accused of taking kickbacks and arranging government 
contracts for personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal racketeering indictment named state Sen. Nick Wilson  
and nine other people on charges of mail fraud, obstruction of 
justice and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Paula Casey said Tuesday the scheme involved the  
``corruption of the Arkansas General Assembly with Wilson as the 
leader and primary decision-maker and planner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Wilson netted $1.3 million through  
fraudulent contracts and kickbacks, benefiting from a $3 million 
grant program he helped set up in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants pay for legal work performed on behalf of children  
caught in the middle of custody cases and for attempts to enforce 
payment of child support money. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Wilson submitted bills under that program for  
work he never performed, and directed attorneys to pay him 
kickbacks for work they performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was halted soon after it began, when news reports  
raised questions about its propriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were state Sen. Mike Bearden, former state Sens.  
Mike Todd and Steve Bell -- all Democrats like Wilson -- two former 
directors of the state Education Department, three lawyers, and a 
Little Rock businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is considered one of the state Senate's most powerful  
members because of his 28 years in office and his skills as a power 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he did nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that I had anything to do with made money for the  
state. That's the crazy part,'' Wilson said. ``I was paid to help 
run those operations, and I did. I didn't take kickbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walmsley, an attorney for Wilson, said he expected the  
senator to plead innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time that you have a citizen Legislature such as Arkansas  
has, where those legislators basically make their living with work 
outside of their legislative duties, there always are fine lines,'' 
Walmsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, Bearden and Todd all denied wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Bearden added that he had cooperated with investigators ``and  
told them everything I knew without the benefit of a lawyer. I gave 
them all the paperwork I had, and they never indicated there was a 
problem.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Stock Down Despite Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings for America Online  
Inc. tripled as revenue soared 66 percent, helped by the addition 
of 1.8 million new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $117 million, or 11 cents per share,  
excluding charges, in the three months ended March 31. In the same 
quarter a year ago, AOL earned $39 million, or 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
9 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to nearly $1.3 billion -- the first $1 billion  
quarter in the company's 14-year history. Advertising, commerce and 
other revenues accounted for $275 million of the increase, up 94 
percent over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong performance, AOL stock retreated today,  
extending losses from Tuesday before the earnings report was 
released. Analysts attributed the selling to profit-taking from 
AOL's earlier 49 percent one-week surge. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL was down $4 at $149 a share early this afternoon after  
tumbling $9 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including its purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. and  
other one-time events, AOL posted net income of $420 million, or 33 
cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $78 million, 
or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL completed its nearly $10 billion acquisition of Netscape on  
March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pivotal quarter for America Online,'' AOL chairman  
and CEO Steve Case said Tuesday. ``Through key acquisitions and 
partnerships, we substantially broadened and deepened our 
capabilities, and advanced our leadership in interactive 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said third-quarter results ``demonstrate that we can deliver  
strong, consistent growth in profits while taking advantage of 
opportunities to improve our competitive position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lise Buyer, an analyst with CS First Boston, said the company's  
performance was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly compelling that they have 19 million  
customers,'' she said. ``That's an immense number and gives them 
tremendous clout with advertisers. ... It looks like it was a 
tremendously solid quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has nearly 17 million members, plus another 2 million  
subscribers through its CompuServe subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pittman, AOL president, said in an interview that the  
third-quarter results illustrate that ``we've transformed ourselves 
into a multiple-brand, multiple-revenue company, and it's all 
coming together nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time events, net income for the first nine months  
of the fiscal year was $249 million on revenue of $3.4 billion, 
compared with earnings of $1 million on revenues of $2.1 billion in 
the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Past Is Prologue for Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a city trying hard to focus on the  
future, the two leading candidates for mayor can't seem to shake 
their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	John Street, the buttoned-down former City Council president  
trying to become Philadelphia's second black mayor, is trying to 
live down his reputation from the 1980s as a hothead and a 
rabble-rouser. His opponent is running a commercial with footage 
from 18 years ago of Street -- then a community activist with a big 
Afro -- angrily shoving a reporter to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Street's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, lawyer Marty  
Weinberg, finds himself defending his political relationship with 
the late Mayor Frank Rizzo, one of the most polarizing figures in 
Philadelphia political history. Rizzo left office 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the nature of Philadelphia politics to let these  
things go,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a Millersville University 
political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Weinberg lead a field of five Democrats trying to  
succeed Mayor Edward G. Rendell, who in two terms brought the city 
back from the brink of financial disaster. Philadelphia is now 
undergoing a downtown building boom, and its bright future includes 
the Republican National Convention in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the May 18 primary will face wealthy GOP  
businessman Sam Katz in the fall. Rendell himself describes Katz as 
a formidable opponent with a chance to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The race has drawn national big-league political talent for a  
race that experts say could be one of the most expensive mayoral 
contests in U.S. history, running up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, a political power broker making his first bid for  
office, has raised more than $3 million. Airing TV spots months 
before his rivals helped. In January, polls had him dead last. This 
month, a new poll showed him tied with Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a law professor at Drexel University when Rizzo  
named him city solicitor in 1972. The two forged a close political 
relationship that lasted until Rizzo's death in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzo's administration was blamed for police brutality and  
financial mismanagement, and on the campaign trail, Weinberg always 
gets questioned about their ties. In a recent television debate, 
Street said he ``would hate to go back'' to the Rizzo years. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg stands by his political mentor.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Rizzo did a lot of very good things for the city of  
Philadelphia. He was not perfect. He made mistakes. But nobody can 
ever deny the fact he loved this city and devoted his life to it,'' 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia politics, the question of race is never far  
below the surface. But political observers said so far, it has not 
become a dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the candidates are really striving hard to avoid these  
deep racial divisions,'' Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg expects to do well in the blue-collar rowhouse  
neighborhoods of this city of 1.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a formidable foe in Street, who forged a close  
alliance with Rendell early this decade. Together, they took on the 
city's municipal unions and helped turn a $250 million budget 
deficit into a surplus before Street stepped down from the City 
Council to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who leaves office with a glittering future and has  
discussed running for governor, has endorsed Street's candidacy and 
appeared in one of his campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was a vociferous community activist in his early days,  
protesting everything from vending regulations to housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a temper. Besides shoving the TV reporter (who sued  
and settled for $1,000), Street is notorious for a 1981 fistfight 
on the floor of City Council spurred by the possibility of a school 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	After that episode, Street began exerting more control over  
himself. His political views changed, too. Once a liberal, he had 
become by 1989 a fiscal conservative and a budget hawk. Street was 
elected City Council president in 1992, the year Rendell took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's changed,'' said Randall Miller, a St. Joseph's University  
professor who follows Philadelphia politics. ``He's changed because 
he has exercised extraordinary self-discipline, as he insisted the 
city should do.''

<HEADLINE> Denver TV Station Pre-empting Stern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Days after Howard Stern made wisecracks about the Columbine High  
School massacre, a Denver TV station is pre-empting the shock 
jock's Saturday night show for a special on the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disciplinary in any sense,'' said Marv Rockford,  
KCNC-TV's vice president and general manager. ``I don't discipline 
Howard Stern. My responsibility here in terms of serving the 
community is to do what I think is appropriate at the moment to 
address the needs and concerns and questions in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Senate, meanwhile, passed a resolution Wednesday  
condemning Stern for his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the shootings, Stern reportedly wondered aloud on  
his nationally syndicated radio show whether the gunmen tried ``to 
have sex with any of the good-looking girls'' who fled the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio show was heard in Denver on KXPK-FM.  
</P>
<P>
	KXPK spokesman Joe Jaffoni said Wednesday the station has not  
dropped the show but did run apologies for Stern's remarks. He also 
said the station told Stern's producers his comments ``were 
inappropriate and insensitive to the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday's radio show, Stern said he had talked with his  
parents about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `You know ... I'm so weary of all this  
hypocrisy,''' Stern said. ``And they said, `You know what? So what 
happens? They take you off the air. Who cares? Who cares? Really, 
life's too short.''' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, whose syndication arm Eyemark distributes Stern's weekly  
television show, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Senate censure, adopted 34-1, called on KXPX to  
drop Stern's show. The same resolution passed the House Tuesday by 
57-4. Opponents objected on First Amendment grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Russ Johnson of KCMO in Kansas City, Mo., said he was  
fired for a remark made while discussing a threat at a local high 
school in the wake of Littleton. Johnson said he was saying what he 
would do as a parent deciding whether to send a child to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say, `You're going to school.' I'd say, `Here's a  
.357. If you have any problems, use this,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the firing, Johnson said: ``The station pays me to be the  
cock that crows in the morning, but in the end I guess I'm the hen 
that laid an egg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Zuroweste, general manager of Entercom Stations, which  
includes KCMO, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Graham of WBT radio in Charlotte, N.C., was fired for a

	``They were targeting minorities and athletes -- which, the  
athletes part, (is) one minor benefit to this otherwise horrible

	The next day, Graham called it ``a stupid, insensitive and  
indefensible remark. I'm a parent. My son is in public school, and 
as the full measure of Tuesday's tragedy unfolded, my feelings of 
remorse and regret over my own stupidity grew with it.''

<HEADLINE> MediaOne Posts First-Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MediaOne Group lost $111 million in the first  
quarter, but reported growing demand for its high-speed Internet 
access, a promising business that's made the cable television 
company the focus of a takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly loss by MediaOne amounted to 21 cents per share,  
which was less than most Wall Street analysts had expected, 
according to a survey by the research firm First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's report came about a week after AT&AMP;T made a surprise  
bid of $58 billion for the nation's fourth largest cable company, 
hoping to undo MediaOne's agreement to be acquired for $49 billion 
by No. 3 Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1998, MediaOne earned $212 million,  
although that profit reflected contributions from a wireless 
communications business that was sold off last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding that business, MediaOne would have posted a net loss  
of $222 million in last year's first quarter, or twice as much as 
it lost in the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, MediaOne's first-quarter revenues of $665 million were  
down nearly 50 percent from year-ago levels, but actually represent 
an 11 percent improvement when compared with only those operations 
that remain part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most noteworthy in the quarterly report was the net  
increase of 30,000 customers for high-speed Internet access, a 36 
percent jump to 114,000 since the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp increase helps explain the urgency with which new  
alliances and takeovers are reshaping an industry whose wires, 
capable of carrying more traffic than phone lines, are being viewed 
as a perfect way to bring consumers a unified package of video, 
telephone and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, AT&AMP;T has acquired Tele-Communications Inc.,  
the nation's second largest cable company, and formed an alliance 
with No. 1 Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Operationally, we had an excellent quarter,'' said Chuck  
Lillis, MediaOne's chief executive. ``Obviously, the big news in 
the quarter was our agreement to merge with Comcast. Since then, of 
course, AT&AMP;T has presented us with a proposal, and we have signed a 
confidentiality agreement so we can negotiate with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If successful in its bid for MediaOne, AT&AMP;T would become the  
largest cable company in the nation with the ability to reach more 
than 40 percent of the nation's cable households. The deal would 
also face regulatory scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's cash and stock bid values MediaOne at $87.375 per share.  
In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MediaOne 
fell $1.75 per share to $80.06 1/4. The first-quarter report was 
released after the close of trading.

<HEADLINE> China: Surplus Pushing Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Rising surpluses in agricultural goods and  
industrial products threaten to push prices lower this year as 
Chinese consumers limit their spending, Chinese economic officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government found nearly all of 606 types of commodities it  
surveyed -- most of them industrial goods -- were in oversupply, Ding 
Junfa, deputy director of the State Administration of Internal 
Trade, told reporters at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although industrial production and retail sales grew at a brisk  
pace in the first quarter of this year, retail and consumer prices 
have continued to fall, reflecting the overhang in inventories, 
Ding said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's retail sales rose 7.4 percent and value-added industrial  
output increased 10.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with 
the same quarter last year. But China's retail price index dropped 
2.9 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period 
following monthly declines for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowing growth in both urban and rural incomes has contributed  
to sluggish consumption rates, Ding said. In addition, consumers 
are saving more money to deal with rising educational and medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, consumers have been holding off on buying products,  
expecting prices to fall even more, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings in China's banks surged 18.8 percent in the first  
quarter to $698.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the government's food storage system, aimed at stabilizing  
prices of key agricultural products such as grain and meat, has had 
limited success in halting the fall in prices because of 
mismanagement and graft at local levels, Ding said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that prices will pick up a bit because of the  
government's fiscal spending measures and new consumer loans being 
offered by banks.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earnings Up 16 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at  
DaimlerChrysler AG jumped 16 percent, helped by strong U.S. sales 
at its Chrysler division. 
</P>
<P>
	After adjustment for one-time items, earnings totaled $2.73  
billion, or $1.77 a share, compared with $2.35 billion, or $1.55 a 
share, for the company formed by the merger of Chrysler Corp. and 
Daimler-Benz AG a year ago. It was the first full quarter earnings 
report for the company since the merger in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first-quarter figures support our confidence for 1999,''  
chairman Juergen Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were up 10 percent to $37.82 billion from $34.44  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said DaimlerChrysler had a  
particularly strong quarter in the United States, but that problems 
persisted in Asia and Latin America. He also said the recent 
slowdown in Western Europe was expected to continue into the second 
half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is ahead of schedule in integrating the operations  
of the two automakers, Eaton said. Savings from combining such 
operations as purchasing and engineering should provide ``a 
tremendous opportunity for overall growth in the full year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, DaimlerChrysler plans to increase  
production this year to meet higher demand, he said. The former 
Chrysler operations were responsible for more than half of the 
first quarter earnings, but Eaton said he expected that percentage 
to decline as the rest of the company grows at a faster rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said sales of the French-built Smart car has been a  
disappointment in Europe and was a drag on Mercedes-Benz profits, 
but that the company was taking steps to boost demand, including 
lowering prices, increasing standard equipment and spending more on 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly going to try to turn that around,'' he said.  
``But it's possible we'll conclude it's a good idea but simply one 
who's time hasn't come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, where DaimlerChrysler is starting up production of  
the small Mercedes-Benz A-class car, the market remains down 
sharply. But Eaton said he was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it has hit the bottom. We're looking for a turn-up  
early next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was less optimistic about Asia, particularly Japan. ``It's  
our judgment (Japan's) not going to turn around and be positive for 
two or three years, potentially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said management will recommend at the new company's first  
annual meeting next month an annual dividend of about $2.50 a 
share, which is in line with what Chrysler paid but substantially 
above the former Daimler-Benz dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it adjusted its first-quarter results for  
one-time items from the public offering of its telecommunications 
unit Debitel and Germany's tax reform. 1998 results were adjusted 
for the sale of the group's semiconductor business and gains from 
the sale of two buildings in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of DaimlerChrysler workers worldwide increased 8  
percent during the quarter to 456,440, taking into account the 
acquisition of Adtranz, the company's rail systems unit. 
</P>
<P>
	American depositary receipts for DaimlerChryster fell $2.18 3/8 to  
$99.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Act on Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling it the ``wrong thing'' to do, House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey conceded Tuesday that Congress may act 
this year to raise the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	As the House held its first hearing on the issue since the  
Republican takeover of Capitol Hill four years ago, Armey, R-Texas, 
acknowledged that a minimum wage increase has support among members 
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will find a way to deal with it, if it becomes necessary to  
do the wrong thing in the least hurtful manner possible,'' said 
Armey, a former economics professor who vehemently opposes a 
federally mandated floor on hourly wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep.  
David Bonior of Michigan, are pushing to phase in a $1 increase to 
$6.15 an hour over two years. The last wage hike, 90 cents an hour 
was implemented in two stages, in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called for a minimum wage increase in his  
State of the Union message and Democrats are aiming to make the 
issue a political one going into the 2000 election season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, my friends, this is not an academic debate,'' Labor  
Secretary Alexis Herman said during a Capitol news conference. 
``This is really about paying the rent. It's about buying clothes 
for the kids and putting food on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP-called witnesses Tuesday at House Education and  
Workforce Committee hearing suggested another another increase 
would either trigger unemployment or push families into higher tax 
brackets, plunging some into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our estimates suggest the net effect of minimum wages is to  
increase the proportion of families that are poor,'' said Michigan 
State University economics professor David Neumark. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of phased-out welfare benefits and marginal tax rates, a  
single mother of two children might be worse off earning $25,000 
annually than $10,000 each year, said New York University law 
professor Daniel Shaviro. 
</P>
<P>
	Even under his best-case scenario -- the mother lives in a state  
that has low welfare cash-assistance payments and is not receiving 
a government housing subsidy -- such a worker would gain only about 
$26 per week, Shaviro said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Missouri Rep. William L. Clay, the panel's senior Democrat,  
said that with a booming economy, unemployment at a 30-year low and 
the Dow soaring above 10,000, there is no excuse for opposing an 
increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not raise the minimum wage during this Congress, its  
buying power will lag 19 percent below what it was in 1979,'' said 
Bonior.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Times To Refuse Cigarette Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A decision by The New York Times to rid its  
pages of all tobacco advertising was criticized Wednesday by a 
cigarette company spokesman as a ``pathetic'' policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it ironic that a publication that trumpets freedom of  
the press would trample on the freedom of commercial expression?'' 
asked Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
the third-biggest U.S. tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. said that the First  
Amendment ``gives the press the right to publish what it chooses 
to. It doesn't force the press to publish something, whether that's 
a news story or an advertisement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times decided on the ban, the first by a national newspaper,  
because of concerns about the harmful effects of smoking, New York 
Times Co. spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said. The decision to refuse 
advertising for cigars, cigarettes and other tobacco products was 
disclosed in Wednesday's edition and takes effect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to expose our readers to advertising that may be  
dangerous to their health,'' Ms. Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen other U.S. newspapers refuse to publish  
tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times refuses ads for tobacco, handguns and  
pornographic movies, while The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, N.C., 
refuses ads for bingo, fortune tellers and 900 telephone numbers, 
according to the industry's Editor &AMP; Publisher International 
Yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco advertising accounted for less than 1 percent of the $1  
billion in ad revenues last year at the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times likely has already run its last cigarette ad. A  
full-page color ad for Carlton cigarettes ran Monday, and no others 
were scheduled before the ban takes effect. The Times, which also 
shuns ads for handguns and tear gas, will continue to accept 
tobacco company ads that don't promote smoking, such as those for 
industry-sponsored festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the tobacco industry reached a $206 billion deal with  
46 states that had sued to recover health costs associated with 
smoking. The deal bans outdoor cigarette ads and forbids ads 
targeting children.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Teams Up for New Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., criticized for misjudging the  
importance of the Internet in its earliest days, is joining a 
research effort to build the formative stages of the next 
generation of the worldwide computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft becomes the latest corporate partner of the  
Washington-based University Corporation for Advanced Internet 
Development, which is coordinating the research among more than 150 
universities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's involvement, along with a minimum pledge of $1  
million, was expected to be announced Wednesday. Other partners 
already include IBM Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called Internet2, is aimed at creating an  
ultra-fast, experimental computer network with speeds 45,000 times 
faster than the best telephone modems people now use to surf the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to see is the high-bandwidth applications become  
heavily used,'' said Rick Rashid, vice president of Microsoft 
Research. ``The goal here is to create a spawning ground for new 
ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fast network is used solely by academics and other  
professional researchers, with no way to let home users dial in. 
But its benefits are expected to trickle down to consumers in just 
a few years, as experts discover ways to use unprecedented data 
transmission speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's relatively early investment in the project stands in  
contrast to the company's failure to predict the significance of 
the commercial Internet until late in 1995, when Chairman Bill 
Gates announced in an industry speech: ``We're hard-core about the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. had already  
established a foothold with its popular Web browser, foreshadowing 
the ``browser wars'' between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's research offices, at its campus outside Seattle,  
will be physically hooked up to the network through the nearby 
University of Washington, which is already connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Van Houweling, president of the group organizing  
Internet2, noted Microsoft's expertise designing software 
applications and operating systems, which allow computers to 
communicate over data networks. The company's Windows software runs 
most of the world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is a major presence,'' Van Houweling said. ``We very  
much want to work together with Microsoft to make sure that every 
place it makes sense, their directions and our directions fit 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry rivals and the government have accused Microsoft  
of exerting too much influence over the commercial Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft and Internet2 officials, including some other  
corporate partners, said there was no risk that the software giant 
will unduly influence the next Internet in ways that benefit only 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to share research, share ideas before  
they become battlegrounds for products,'' Rashid said. ``It gives 
everybody the opportunity to learn together, to move the state of 
the art together faster than if we were working independently. ... 
It's our intention to work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's program director for Internet technology, Michael Nelson,  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet2 is a research program,'' he said. ``This is a very  
different activity than a product development effort. I don't think 
there's any concern here, and we're very excited that Microsoft is 
coming to the table.''

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern's Earnings Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp.'s first-quarter net  
income fell 15 percent, compared with operating profits a year ago, 
as preparations to take over part of Conrail pushed profits lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad said Wednesday it earned $112 million, or 30 cents  
per share, down from $132 million, or 35 cents per share, in the 
first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern said its 1998 first-quarter net earnings were  
boosted by $97 million from discontinued operations, mostly on a 
gain from the sale of Norfolk Southern's North American Van Lines 
subsidiary. When that gain is included, the company's net earnings 
in the just-ended quarter fell 51.1 percent from net income of $229 
million, or 61 cents per share, from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter earnings in 1999 continued to reflect the  
investments Norfolk Southern is making to integrate Conrail into 
its system, said David R. Goode, chairman, president and chief 
executive officer. Those investments affect the bottom line in the 
short term but will pay off in the long term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern expects to take over 58 percent of  
Philadelphia-based Conrail on June 1. Richmond-based CSX Corp. will 
control the rest in a $10.3 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings came on railway operating revenues of $1.03  
billion, down 3 percent from $1.07 billion the same quarter a year 
ago because of a depressed export coal market. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway operating expenses were $793 million for the quarter,  
down 3 percent from $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring of Conrail will introduce competition to  
several Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when 
Conrail began operating as a monopoly that Congress created out of 
six bankrupt railroads.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a challenge to President Clinton over  
Kosovo, a divided House voted to limit his authority to use ground 
forces. The Republican-sponsored measure would require Clinton to 
obtain congressional approval before sending ``ground elements'' to 
Yugoslavia. However, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman

NATO demands for ending the crippling air campaign. Vuk Draskovic 
was dismissed because of ``public statements which were contrary to 
the government stands,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency said. The 
firing came the same day that NATO said it was seeing signs of 
serious discontent inside Yugoslavia. Draskovic had said the 
Yugoslav leadership should stop lying to its people about the 
situation in the country after weeks of bombings and recognize ``we

18-year-old student to the Columbine High School gunmen, saying she 
bought three of the four guns used in the massacre. Investigators 
had said gunman Dylan Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, bought 
two shotguns and a rifle last fall. A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 
handgun used in the attack has not yet been traced. Authorities 
have repeatedly said Anderson is considered a witness and not a

U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. concluded Starr's office had 
not shown ``good cause'' for the court to make an exception to a 
policy of ``not invading the province of the jury.'' The jury 
acquitted McDougal on an obstruction of justice charge but 
deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt for refusing to 
testify in the Whitewater probe. Prosecutors had said the jury 
interviews would influence their decision on a retrial.

the IMF from resuming a lending program cut off in August when 
Russia defaulted on billions of dollars in foreign debt. After a 
few ``technical elements'' are resolved, Camdessus said he would

endorsement for $4.5 billion in new IMF loans.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert's three-pronged assault on an  
unprecedented third straight Kentucky Derby victory will be 
launched from farther out than his first two. Baffert chose the 
sixth post for the filly Excellent Meeting, No. 14 for Prime Timber 
and No. 15 for General Challenge. Baffert's first Derby winner, 
Silver Charm, started from the No. 5 post in 1997, while Real Quiet 
started from the No. 3 post in 1998.

<HEADLINE> School Safety Technology Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instant drug detectors, hair-sample testing  
kits, and electronic scanners identifying students by handprint 
could be put in more of the nation's schools under a $10 million 
Senate proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., renewed  
their call for the money on Wednesday with a demonstration of the 
latest in school technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of this is being presented as something that would have  
prevented the tragedy in Colorado,'' said Bingaman, referring to 
last week's fatal shooting of 14 students and a teacher at a high 
school in a Denver suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying there are constructive things that can be done  
with the use of technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bingaman helped demonstrate a drug-testing chemical by sticking  
his hand in a bag of marijuana. After Bingaman was fingerprinted, a 
chemical spray turned them red, revealing the presence of the 
illegal drug. The test costs about $1 per use. 
</P>
<P>
	Other products included hidden security cameras, costing up to  
$1,200 apiece, for classrooms and a $2,200 ``hand-geometry'' 
scanner, which would be attached to doors to allow entry only for 
authorized students, teachers, or even custodial parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some technology could be too expensive for schools, said Gordon  
Smith of the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories in 
Albuquerque, N.M., which demonstrated the products. 
</P>
<P>
	One example is a device, now under development and expected to  
cost as much as $150,000, that detects traces of bomb-making 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandia, a nuclear facility also working on security equipment  
for schools, would get $2 million a year under the Senate proposal 
to create a school security center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools have to carefully consider what they purchase and  
whether it meets their needs,'' said Sandia's Mary Green, who 
helped write an upcoming school-security manual for the National 
Institute for Justice, which helps with Justice Department 
research. ``There are definitely products out there that leave 
something to be desired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bingaman said an Albuquerque, N.M., high school using some of  
the Sandia technology has had dramatic declines in violent, 
property and other crimes since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The school security plan, dropped from a Senate spending bill  
last year, should have more support this year, Hutchinson said. 
``We hope to get it on the Senate agenda,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's education committee plans to discuss school safety  
legislation next week, spokesman Joe Karpinski.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Wednesday, despite an  
overnight rise on Wall Street, with sentiment turning negative on 
the region's top exchanges, Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo prices fell slightly as some investors sold shares before  
a series of national holidays, while the U.S. dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.03 points,  
or 0.09 percent, ending the day at 16,942.24. On Tuesday, the 
Nikkei had risen 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.08 yen at late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 
120.40 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 118.25 yen to 120.28 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares rose early in the session, following Wall Street's  
latest gains, but slipped in later dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand was quite strong in the morning after shares in New  
York rose overnight, but sell orders began after the Nikkei average 
surpassed the 17,000 mark,'' said Yoshio Watanabe of Toyo 
Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, blue chips fell 1.7 percent as investor sentiment  
turned negative. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index dropped 231.40 points to close at 13,133.39.  
On Tuesday, the index gained 237.77 points, adding to powerful 
recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the index spilled downward, some investors joined the  
sell-off bandwagon, triggering a greater level of loss,'' said 
George Chan of Celestial Asia Securities Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications shares, which had fueled the market's recent

issues down 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Marine Navigator Gets Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A judge granted immunity today to a  
Marine navigator for his testimony at the obstruction of justice 
trial of his crewmate, the pilot of a jet that clipped an Italian 
ski lift cable and killed 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, admitted during his manslaughter  
trial in March that he helped hide a videotape shot during the 
flight before his EA-6B Prowler struck the cable on Feb. 3, 1998. 
Ashby was acquitted of the manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, pleaded guilty to the  
charges Ashby now faces, said in his request for immunity that he 
didn't want his testimony to result in further charges against him. 
Schweitzer was ordered dismissed from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Alvin Keller, the military judge, granted Schweitzer's  
request before opening statements were to begin for Ashby's trial 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he threw the tape into a bonfire because he  
feared a frame on it of his smiling face might be used to vilify 
him and the rest of the crew in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer's lawyer, Maj. Eric Veit, said his client needed  
immunity because there is a chance his guilty plea could be 
overturned on appeal. The defense is concerned that a reversal 
might lead prosecutors to charge Schweitzer with impeding an 
administrative proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this thing to end and I don't want to revisit it,''  
Schweitzer said. ``The issue here is what will happen two to three 
years from now. All I want is closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he will testify to the same facts as he did at  
his own sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., testified he used the camera  
three times during the flight through the Alps but wasn't sure that 
he ever recorded images because he didn't know how to use it. The 
camera belonged to Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had argued that Schweitzer's plea agreement didn't  
include a grant of immunity and required him to testify truthfully, 
both at his sentencing last month and at Ashby's trial.

<HEADLINE> Six Leading Dancers Shine at Ballet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For an evening to be gala, American Ballet  
Theater presented the right mix for springtime cum opening night: a 
lavish, three-act ballet ``Don Quixote'' with a pair of principals 
for each act. 
</P>
<P>
	All six leading dancers -- Paloma Herrera with Angel Corella,  
Susan Jaffe with Jose Manuel Carreno and Nina Ananiashvili with 
Julio Bocca -- were more than splendid on Monday night at the 
Metropolitan Opera. There was plenty of bravura for all and, 
dancing in only one act, no one held back. All the men, dazzling, 
high-jumping virtuosos, also were considerate partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Though titled ``Don Quixote,'' the ballet features the don  
(danced by Victor Barbee) as only a minor character, along with 
Sancho Panza (Gil Boggs), Kitri's rich old suitor (Guillaume 
Graffin) and her father (Ethan Brown). 
</P>
<P>
	The leading characters are Kitri and Basil, the poor barber in  
love with her. In Act 1, in the village square, Herrera and Corella 
were fleet, fast and flirty. The audience warmed to their youth and 
-- when they stopped trying to make each other jealous by flirting 
with others -- their ardor. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 2 has three scenes. The central one follows some lively  
dances at a gypsy camp and features Don Quixote's dream of 
beautiful ballerinas, with Kitri dancing solo. Jaffe, who has 
incredible balance for solo steps requiring a stop and staying 
motionless on one toe, was chosen for Act 2, along with the 
exciting Carreno. 
</P>
<P>
	Ananiashvili and Bocco, who have already achieved the stardom  
that the other principals are approaching, danced the final act, 
``The Wedding.'' Choreography by Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky 
builds the ballet's most dramatic pas de deux with variations of 
increasing excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don Quixote'' includes a matador, traditionally part of the  
colorful background along with the gypsies, villagers, flower 
girls. But Maxim Belotserkovsky, partnering Irina Dvorovenko, made 
it much more. That couple, in the opening night gala, must be 
elevated for praise alongside the three principal couples. Though 
some of the matador's gestures might look effete, Belotserkovsky 
made them look macho. 
</P>
<P>
	The Imperial Russian Ballet performed the premiere of ``Don  
Quixote'' in 1869. ABT placed it in its repertoire in 1978. This, 
its third production, was staged in 1995 by artistic director Kevin 
McKenzie and ballet master Susan Jones. Ermanno Florio conducted 
the melodic Ludwig Minkus music. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the dancing began, Caroline Kennedy, cochairman of the  
gala with Blaine Trump, recalled a dress rehearsal by Ballet 
Theater in 1962 at the White House. Now, like her mother taking her 
to performances in New York, she takes her daughter. ``Love of the 
arts,'' she said, speaking from the stage, ``is one of the most 
special gifts we can give our children.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Reds Manager Ray Knight Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Ray Knight, the former manager of the  
Cincinnati Reds, was charged with disorderly conduct after striking 
a spectator during an argument after a youth softball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and Jimmy C. Smith, the spectator, were both charged, but  
not arrested, after an altercation Tuesday night at Ken Gardens 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Knight, who is married to LPGA golfer Nancy Lopez, and  
Smith had daughters participating in the game, which featured 11- 
and 12-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told The Albany Herald that Knight, a baseball analyst for  
ESPN, told one of his players who had been walked to run before the 
umpire signaled ball four. Smith yelled from the stands for Knight 
to let the umpire do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Knight, who was coaching a team, approached him after  
the game and the two argued about the comment, which came with 
Knight's team trailing 10-2 in the bottom of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-minute argument ensued, which included profane language and  
name-calling by both men. Smith said he told Knight: ``You couldn't 
play with the big boys and couldn't coach up there, so you have to 
come here and coach a girls' softball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comment prompted Knight to reach over an assistant coach and  
strike Smith in the ear with his fist, opening a small cut, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he thought Knight's ring caused the cut.  
</P>
<P>
	The two were separated before police arrived. Each of the two  
faces a fine of $88 at a municipal court hearing Monday.

<HEADLINE> Two Rangers Shot at Oregon St. Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANZANITA, Ore. (AP) -- Two park rangers were confronted by a  
gunman who marched the men into dense forest before shooting them 
in the head, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranger Danny Blumenthal, 50, died in the attack Tuesday at  
Oswald West State Park. John ``Jack'' Kerwin, 51, suffered two 
shots to the jaw, but survived in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour after the shooting, Oregon state police took Larry  
C. Cole, 52, into custody for questioning. Cole, who was not 
charged, was arrested after leading police on a high-speed chase in 
Blumenthal's truck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rangers were doing routine maintenance early Tuesday when  
one of them went to inspect a bathroom at the oceanside park about 
65 miles west of Portland, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He emerged with the assailant holding him at gunpoint. Both  
rangers were then marched about 400 yards along a trail into the 
dense forest, where the gunman tried to tie them up. Apparently 
frustrated by his efforts, he shot both in the head, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal died on the trail, while Kerwin lay motionless on the  
ground, playing dead, despite the shots that splintered his 
jawbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were looking for a second man and another  
vehicle that may have been in the park at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Meinen, the state's parks director, said rangers are  
responsible for law enforcement but do not carry guns. ``Generally 
we haven't felt that we need them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Officiating Colo. Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With his third funeral just behind him  
and his fourth just ahead, the Rev. Billy Epperhart was feeling 
overwhelmed like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, in a soft southern accent and a crisp black suit, he  
has been a pillar of public strength, ministering to hundreds of 
mourners in the aftermath of last week's Columbine High School 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	In private, he wipes away tears and cannot finish sentences.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you go through this many funerals and meetings with  
families, it makes it all real,'' the 43-year-old pastor said 
Tuesday. ``You know, death is all so real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Epperhart's warehouse-like evangelical church, Trinity  
Christian Center, is a place where members occasionally speak in 
tongues and perform a ``laying on of hands'' to cure physical and 
emotional ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But during the past week it has become a place where families of  
all denominations, or no denomination at all, celebrate the life of 
loved ones they lost. And at the podium is Epperhart, trying to 
make sense of it. 
</P>
<P>
	By night, he writes funeral speeches with other pastors' help.  
By day, he consoles parents and listens to stories of lost 
children, sweet smiles and funny moments, stories of innocence and 
potential. He puts the memories into speeches that he delivers as 
caskets are lowered into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Death means something to everyone, he says -- everyone except  
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the two teen-agers who killed 12 
students, a teacher and themselves in a hail of gunfire and 
explosives April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to these kids was not a real thing. It couldn't have  
been,'' the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral typically has one director and one, maybe two  
assistants. Since the shootings, Trinity Christian has been using 
five full-time pastors and 40 ushers, many wearing walkie-talkie 
headsets to coordinate parking, media access and crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
	Epperhart, a pastor for 21 years who heard ``the call of the  
ministry'' in Texas at age 10, is taking pains to avoid turning the 
Columbine funerals into pulpits condemning school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he tries to shape them into intensely personal  
experiences that bring grieving families together both physically 
and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be in a crowd of people and still be lonely,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Epperhart has seen tragedy in his church before. More than a  
decade ago, a mentally unstable man burned down his church in 
Alexander, La., forcing him to deliver sermons under a tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, compares to last week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen grief and shock like this in my life,''  
Epperhart said. ``It's cliche, really, but it's kind of true: You 
have to really come together. And in times like this, barriers 
really drop.''

<HEADLINE> K.C. Wizards Hire Former U.S. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bob Gansler, coach of the 1990 U.S.  
World Cup team, was hired today as coach of the winless Kansas City 
Wizards of Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler succeeds interim coach Ken Fogarty, who took over when  
Ron Newman resigned April 14. Kansas City was 0-4 under Newman and 
0-2 under Fogarty, who will coach today's game while Gansler 
observes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler takes over a team that won the MLS Western Conference in  
1997 but fell to last in 1998. The Wizards had scored only two 
goals this season heading into today's home game against the 
Columbus Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler, a 57-year-old native Hungarian, grew up in Milwaukee.  
He made 25 appearances for the Olympic and U.S. national team in 
1968-69 and was captain of the U.S. Olympic teams in 1964 and 1968. 
He led the U.S. team to a 14-16-6 record from 1989 to 1991 and also 
coached the national team for one game, a win, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team went 0-3 in Rome at the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, he coached the Milwaukee Rampage of the A-League,  
a second-division professional league. The Rampage won the 1997 
title, but Gansler was dismissed after the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler also has coached the U.S. under-20 national team, the  
World University team, the U.S. under-19 national team and the 
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Meola, the Wizards' injured goalkeeper, started all three  
World Cup games for Gansler in 1990. Kansas City midfielder Chris 
Henderson was on the roster but did not play.

<P>
	GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Twenty bodies will be exhumed as part of  
an investigation of a respiratory therapist who last year claimed 
to have killed dozens of terminally ill patients at a suburban 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will begin examining bodies this week, police  
Chief Russell Siverling said Wednesday. Permission from the 
families wasn't needed, and Siverling wouldn't say whether any 
families objected. 
</P>
<P>
	Efren Saldivar, 28, told police he killed up to 50 Glendale  
Adventist Medical Center patients he believed were terminally ill. 
Saldivar, who called himself an ``angel of death,'' later recanted, 
saying he was suicidal and wanted to be sentenced to death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Saldivar and four hospital colleagues were fired, but no  
criminal charges have been filed.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Sheriff To Disband Posse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) -- A Pennsylvania sheriff who says he can't  
keep his posse of mounted volunteers corralled is disbanding the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to operate on their own without letting me know what  
they're doing,'' Sheriff James Wright said of the Bedford County 
Sheriff's Posse, a brigade of 23 volunteers who help with searches, 
rescues and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright has told posse members to turn in their badges, but they  
don't understand the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never done anything to harm anyone,'' said posse  
member Bill King. ``We've just done a lot for the county and the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The posse was formed 12 years ago in this south-central  
Pennsylvania region to provide free help on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Yokum, vice president of the group, said Wright's pique at  
the posse's endeavors has turned into a ``grudge match,'' a charge 
Wright denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no personality conflict whatsoever,'' Wright said.  
``The conflict is doing this work on their own without me knowing 
anything about it. The liability falls back on the sheriff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bedford County commissioners plan to meet with Wright and posse  
members in May to resolve the dispute. Commissioner Gary Ebersole 
said that he knows of no complaints that the posse has been out of 
control, rude or rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
	And since the posse is a nonprofit group that doesn't work for  
Wright, the sheriff may not have the authority to disband it, 
Ebersole said.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Withdraws RJR Board Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn will not pursue a proxy  
fight over RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s decision to spin off its 
U.S. tobacco operations as a separate company owned by RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn said in a statement late Tuesday that he made his decision  
to withdraw his slate of board nominees after discussions with 
several other large shareholders, who said they did not want to 
delay the decision to spin off the companies in light of a recent 
Supreme Court decision to hear arguments on whether the federal 
Food and Drug Administration should be allowed to regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR shareholders are scheduled to vote on the spinoff at the  
company's May 12 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco, which was the target in the biggest and most  
dramatic takeover battle of the 1980s, owns the nation's 
second-biggest tobacco company that is led by the Winston, Salem 
and Camel cigarette brands. 
</P>
<P>
	It also owns an 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp.,  
which is traded separately and is the nation's biggest cookie and 
cracker maker with brands such as Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Snackwells and 
Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Icahn and RJR management feel the food company would fare  
better in the stock market if its ties were severed to the tobacco 
business which faces hundreds of lawsuits. But they had disagree 
over how to make the split leading Icahn to file a competing slate 
of candidates for the RJR board. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had said earlier his slate consisted of people whose main  
ambition would be to spin off the food business and, if that were 
blocked, try the tobacco spinoff that RJR had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Icahn reiterated his belief that his plan to  
spinoff Nabisco from RJR Holdings was the best way to go, but 
backed down after talking to other shareholders who said they would 
support the tobacco spinoff.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Patient Going Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- He made medical history, but Matthew  
Scott said Wednesday he now wants his groundbreaking hand 
transplant to become just a footnote in medical textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott has completed his treatment and began the drive home to  
Absecon, N.J., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream if I could be anonymous,'' he said at what  
he hoped would be his final news conference. ``I would very much 
like to fade into the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by his wife, Dawn, the 38-year-old paramedic  
instructor thanked his doctors and assured naysayers ``my precious 
gift is anything but useless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said he expected to return to his teaching job at a  
community college and as an emergency medical service supervisor in 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his hand in a 1985 fireworks accident. He received a  
new one Jan. 25 during a 15-hour operation at Louisville Jewish 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery prompted debate over the ethics of performing a hand  
transplant. Critics claim the risk is not worth the reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he still has no sensation in his fingertips, hand  
surgeon Warren Breidenbach said Scott was progressing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we anticipate is sensation,'' he said. Full  
sensation, he said, whatever that should be, will come in about one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As he fielded questions from reporters, Scott talked about the  
anti-rejection drugs he has come to depend on and the changes he 
expected as he returned to a normal life away from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time to be scared has come and gone,'' he said. ``Once we  
decided to go ahead, the fear more or less left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott will continue his physical therapy at home and return to  
Louisville for monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in uncharted waters,'' said Jon Jones, one of  
Scott's doctors. Scott already overcame one episode of rejection 
and the possibility exists for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're confident we can handle what comes next,'' Jones  
said.

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer Enters Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- For three years, trainer D. Wayne Lukas  
was on the run of a lifetime. Almost incredibly, he couldn't lose a 
Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 1994 Preakness through the 1996 Kentucky Derby, a Lukas  
horse was always in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won the Triple Crown, it just took a couple of horses,''  
Lukas joked Tuesday after he was elected to thoroughbred racing's 
Hall of Fame. ``I wasn't smart enough to get a good one for one 
year ... I had to relay them. We just got on a run and it just kind 
of fell into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was Tabasco Cat winning the '94 Preakness and Belmont  
Stakes; Thunder Gulch winning the '95 Derby and Belmont, with 
Timber Country taking the Preakness in between; and, finally, 
Grindstone taking the '96 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Six in a row, and victories in 10 Triple Crown races in all for  
Lukas, starting with Codex's win in the 1980 Preakness. On 
Saturday, Lukas sends out Cat Thief and Charismatic in search of 
his fourth Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Russell Baze, who rode more than 400 winners for the  
seventh consecutive year in 1998, also was elected. Entering 1999, 
Baze had 6,429 winners and earnings of more than $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoroughbreds elected were Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow.  
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are Aug. 9 at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., home  
of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' election finally fell into place after so many years of  
controversy over the Hall's eligibility rule that nominees must 
have trained thoroughbreds for 25 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas started out as a quarterhorse trainer in the 1960s, but  
also trained thoroughbreds every so often. The Hall's nominating 
committee, though, started the clock in 1974. Once, Lukas was so 
upset with the confusion, he threatened to boycott the inevitable 
announcement of his election. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't. Wearing a gray suit and black tie, attire usually  
reserved for his hundreds of trips to the winner's circle, Lukas 
patiently explained his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only take is it's not my place or anyone else's to  
determine the eligibility -- it's the Hall of Fame and its 
committee,'' he said. ``And their read in my case was not that I 
had not trained a horse as early as the early '60s, but they wanted 
it consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some breaks, not much, and I accept that. So if  
they use 1974 and that makes them happy and it's endorsed with the 
votes, so be it, and I'm very happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, Lukas will top $200 million in purse earnings,  
a staggering number considering only one other trainer -- the late 
Charlie Whittingham -- has passed $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some very good clientele that had extreme faith in me  
and backed it up with their bankroll and let me buy some of the 
best horses in the world,'' Lukas said. ``The $200 million 
represents a lot of income to a lot of people that backed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has 518 graded stakes victories, which is 7 percent of all  
the graded stakes the past 20 years. He has won 13 Breeders' Cup 
races -- more than any other trainer -- and four Eclipse Awards as 
the nation's top trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 14 of the past 17 years, Lukas was the nation's leading  
trainer in earnings, and set a record of $17.8 million in 1988, the 
year he saddled his first Derby winner, the filly Winning Colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his greatest moments in racing, Lukas cited his  
Derby wins first, followed by the rest of the Triple Crown race 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas also praised former assistants who have gone out on their  
own. The former Team Lukas crew includes Mark Hennig, Bobby 
Barnett, Kiaran McLaughlin, Dallas Stewart, Todd Plechter and Randy 
Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably proudest that six of my guys -- my alumni -- are  
out on their own and doing very well,'' the 63-year-old Lukas said. 
``Two of them will lead horses in the Derby against me on 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett saddles Answer Lively and Stewart has Kimberlite Pipe.  
</P>
<P>
	As he finished his remarks in the press box at Churchill Downs,  
Lukas said: ``On Saturday at about 6 p.m., I hope I'm back up here 
for another visit.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Can Process Backward Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Humans' ability to understand speech is so deeply ingrained that  
people can even decipher sentences that have been recorded, chopped 
up into brief segments and played backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers sliced digitally recorded sentences into very short  
segments, reversed each snippet while leaving it in its proper 
place in the sentence, then played the distorted speech to seven 
test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants had no problem understanding the sentences.  
Their brains were apparently able to perceive the syllables as 
sounding nearly the same whether heard backwards or forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you distort speech, it distorts certain aspects, but  
other parameters are still able to convey the message,'' said 
Kourosh Saberi, a researcher at the California Institute of 
Technology's division of biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberi and David R. Perrott of California State University in  
Los Angeles' department of psychology, reported their findings in 
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Kent, a professor of communicative disorders at the  
University of Wisconsin in Madison, said the research demonstrates 
that many areas of the brain are used to handle complicated 
auditory signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are both hemispheres of the brain involved in speech  
processing, but eyesight plays a significant role by allowing 
people to unconsciously lip read to fill in missing data, Kent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has gone to a party held in a crowded room filled  
with music and chattering people has tapped those skills to 
understand what others are saying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this tells us is that speech is quite robust. We can  
perceive it even when a number of things have been done to distort 
or muddy the signal,'' Kent said. ``Somehow the information is 
preserved or at least recoverable to us even when it's played 
backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Greenberg, a researcher at the International Computer  
Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said the findings could 
someday lead to improved speech-recognition programs that allow 
computers to respond to spoken commands. 
</P>
<P>
	It also adds to a growing body of evidence disputing the notion  
that individual vowels and consonants are crucial to understanding 
the spoken word, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Plan Raises Hopes for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Over the past month, Japan has loaned $400 million  
to Indonesian power companies, hundreds of millions more to build 
railways and roads in Malaysia, and $1 billion for South Korea to 
use pretty much however it sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of the ``Miyazawa Initiative,'' a $30 billion loan  
package Japan hopes will help Asia climb out of its financial 
crisis and boost this country's stature as the region's economic 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative indicates a mix of Japan's increased desire to  
exert influence on the world stage and frustration throughout Asia 
with the way the West has tried to deal with the nearly two-year 
old crisis in Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	And though the initiative was initially met with caution, it is  
now winning kudos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan has helped stabilize the situation in Asia,'' said  
Robert Alan Feldman, an economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
``Japan has been very serious in trying to help the Asian countries 
overcome some of their difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's motives aren't purely altruistic, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Asia's only economic giant hopes that by helping its neighbors  
it can also help itself. A recovery in the region would undoubtedly 
spur business for Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Japan has long been eager to assume a larger economic  
leadership role in the region, and the Miyazawa plan is seen as an 
attempt to put more control of Asian economies in Asian hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, leaders in Japan, Indonesia and elsewhere in the  
region have harshly criticized International Monetary Fund bailouts 
for Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, which they say only made 
matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue conditions imposed by the IMF, such as interest rate  
hikes and spending cuts, were too strict for wobbling economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asian countries, to be frank, are disappointed with the  
behavior of the IMF,'' said Kiyoshi Miura, chief economist at the 
Institute for International Monetary Affairs in Tokyo. ``Now is a 
very good time for Japan to take a bigger role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aid package, named for Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa, was first drafted in October, but the lending hasn't 
gathered momentum until recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than half the money, or $16.6 billion, has been  
appropriated to five crisis-struck nations -- South Korea, Thailand, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, Japanese funds will be included in a $300 million  
loan by the Asian Development Bank to help combat air pollution. 
Thailand's Health Ministry, meanwhile, will use small chunk of the 
$1.85 billion allotted the country to hire local villagers as 
temporary rat catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea will get the biggest share -- $8.35 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the IMF, Japan has imposed few conditions on the  
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money will flow to the cash-strapped countries  
through local institutions such as the Korean Development Bank. And 
although there have been a few exceptions, Japan has mostly left it 
up to those institutions to decide how to disburse the money. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a departure for Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
	Past Japanese development programs have often been criticized  
for their stringent conditions, especially for requirements that 
Japanese firms be hired for big parts of any project. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets throughout the region have rebounded strongly this  
year as investors bet the worst of the crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists generally agree that the Japanese loans are one  
reason for the growing confidence, but many believe the 
IMF-encouraged reforms are actually a bigger factor. 
</P>
<P>
	And a good deal of the Miyazawa money will be needed just to  
repair the damage Japan has caused in the region as its own slow 
growth has dragged on neighboring economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tokyo's help is being felt -- and appreciated.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have done quite well,'' Malaysian Second Finance Minister  
Datuk Mustapa Mohamad told the Malaysian newspaper Business Times 
after securing a $700 million yen loan from Japan early this month.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Wednesday, despite an  
overnight rise on Wall Street, with sentiment turning negative on 
the region's top exchanges, Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>

	Tokyo prices fell slightly as some investors sold shares before  
a series of national holidays, while the U.S. dollar slipped 
against the yen.

yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares rose early in the session, following Wall Street's  
latest gains, but slipped in later dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand was quite strong in the morning after shares in New

	``As the index spilled downward, some investors joined the  
sell-off bandwagon, triggering a greater level of loss,'' said 
George Chan of Celestial Asia Securities Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications shares, which had fueled the market's recent

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Pay Cap Effort Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bank of America Chairman Hugh McColl  
earned a smaller bonus in 1998 because of losses from a hedge fund 
and Russian bonds, but shareholders rejected a permanent cap on his 
pay at the company's annual meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists had proposed limiting McColl's total compensation, as  
well as limiting hefty severance packages like the one given to 
former Bank of America Chief Executive David Coulter. Shareholders 
overwhelmingly rejected both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulter, 51, was president of the newly merged Bank of America  
for a month when he resigned under pressure last fall. His 
departure came after the disclosure last October that the bank lost 
$372 million because of the old BankAmerica's partnership with D.E. 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulter departed with 300,000 shares of bank stock and a $5  
million annual pension for life. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal Wednesday would have limited any future severance  
packages to no more than $3 million without a vote by shareholders. 
Another would have limited the ratio between the salaries of Bank 
of America's top executives and its lowest-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, McColl's bonus from NationsBank was $3.5 million,  
accounting for more than two-thirds of his total compensation of 
$4.64 million. His 1998 bonus was $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, McColl told the bank's senior management he should  
bear responsibility for Bank of America's losses when it came time 
to hand out bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America lost $372 million because of the old  
BankAmerica's partnership with D.E. Shaw, which was using complex 
computer-driven strategies to invest in derivatives and bond 
trading strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 investor lawsuits have been filed against Bank of  
America over the Shaw losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses prompted the resignation of Coulter, the old  
BankAmerica chairman and CEO who was to be president of the 
combined bank and was widely regarded as McColl's eventual 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also voted to officially change the name of the  
bank holding company to Bank of America Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer James Hance Jr. laid out the company's  
long-term goals for shareholders, including growth in earnings per 
share in the 12 percent to 15 percent range and return on equity 
between 17 percent and 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Littleton Investigation Is Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Day after day, Columbine High  
investigators step before the mob of cameras and reporters to 
answer questions about what they know, which is quite a lot. It 
often seems like nothing compared with what they still want to find 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold rampaged through  
Columbine with bombs and guns and killed 13 people, investigators 
are still swarming through the school and fanning out across the 
region. As of Wednesday, they were following 600 leads -- each 
another unanswered question. 
</P>
<P>
	Did Harris and Klebold act alone? Authorities have named no  
other suspects. What, if anything, did the pair's parents know? How 
did they obtain their guns? How did they get their bombs into the 
school? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so busy trying to confirm what we already do know. It's  
a little early to try to figure out all that we don't know,'' said 
Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for Jefferson County District Attorney 
Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation that has produced 500 interviews and 2,000  
pieces of evidence -- including hundreds of backpacks abandoned by 
fleeing students, each backpack a potential bomb -- will naturally 
produce questions with answers still unclear: 
</P>
<P>
	-- When, and how, did Harris and Klebold bring explosives into  
the school? Did they have help from someone aware of their plans 
before the attack? That's a real possibility, Sheriff John Stone 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much stuff in there,'' he said. ``You can't walk  
in there blazing with more stuff than you can carry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Where did they get all the materials to make their explosives?  
Some apparently came from area hardware stores. ``It's a good 
possibility that all of the bombs were built out of legal stuff,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Were the three youths taken into custody near the school  
involved? Stone was ``highly suspicious'' of them, but his office 
said Wednesday that, although they knew the suspects, they had been 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Was Robyn K. Anderson, 18, a Columbine senior identified as  
Klebold's girlfriend, involved? Investigators questioned and 
released her, calling her a witness. But they said Wednesday that 
she bought three of the guns used, and they want to know if she 
knew what was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	-- How many students were absent from Columbine that day? How  
many could have been involved? Investigators are checking 
attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
	There are questions about Harris and Klebold themselves:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Was Eric Harris taking -- or not taking -- psychiatric  
medication? A family friend told The New York Times that he had 
been taking something, but a coroner's toxicology report found no 
drugs or alcohol in Harris' system. Authorities wouldn't discuss 
the matter Wednesday, but they said any such medication could be a 
factor in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What did their parents know? Many people across the country  
have blamed the Harrises and the Klebolds. But investigators have 
provided nothing specific to suggest that the parents were 
forewarned in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both boys' parents at this point have been cooperative with  
us,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Did they kill themselves simultaneously or at different times?  
The coroner hasn't said, and Davis on Wednesday cited a ``small 
possibility'' of a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Chris Colwell, the responding physician, pronounced them  
dead at 4:45 p.m. the day of the shooting, the earliest he could 
get into the library. By then, it's estimated, they had been dead 
for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	-- How long had they been planning the attack? A diary found at  
Harris' house, which referred to himself as ``Rebel'' and Klebold 
as ``Vodka,'' indicated the plot was hatched a year ago. But it's 
unclear when they started actually making preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What made them so angry? The diary, and things they told  
acquaintances, appear to blame the students who made them outcasts. 
But did other issues contribute to their deep rage? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Could they have pulled off their grand plan of killing 500  
people, hijacking a jet and crashing it into New York City? 
Investigators doubt it. Why New York? ``Maybe the density of the 
population, for all I know,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Were warning signs ignored?  
</P>
<P>
	Then there are questions about the attack itself, and the  
environment in which it occurred: 
</P>
<P>
	-- How many Columbine students belonged to the ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia''? Was it an organized group or just a flight of fancy? 
Reports have indicated the possibility of both. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What does the cafeteria security videotape contain? ``Good  
footage,'' the sheriff's office says -- enough to learn more about 
how events unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What did teachers know about the group?  
</P>
<P>
	As for the weapons, how did Klebold and Harris obtain them? They  
possessed additional guns beyond the ones authorities say Ms. 
Anderson helped them obtain. 
</P>
<P>
	And another, less pressing question is whether students will  
ever return to the current Columbine High building. Administrators 
say yes, but some students have already balked at the notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you send your child back into that building? I'm sure I  
would not,'' Denver Rocky Mountain News columnist Mike Littwin 
wrote Tuesday. ``If it's me, I build a new Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students return to class Monday to finish the school  
year at Chatfield High School, a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there is the most vexing issue, the one on everyone's  
mind in Littleton and around the country: Why? 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, is one question that the most thorough of  
investigations may never answer.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Sues 15 Florida Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's leading software  
maker, is suing 15 Florida companies, alleging that they sold or 
installed illegal copies of its programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other companies are under investigation, police said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits are the latest move in Microsoft's nationwide  
crackdown on software pirates. The suits seek unspecified damages 
and a judge's order to stop distribution of the software, said 
corporate attorney Nick Psyhogeos. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has taken similar actions in New York, New Jersey,  
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, California, Illinois, 
Minnesota and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft claims that software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in  
1997 and $490 million in lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales. 
Microsoft isn't able to estimate how much software piracy costs the 
company, but it's a $2 billion-a-year problem for the industry, a 
company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software pirates often sell programs for 50 percent of the  
average retail value, and some for as low as 10 percent, Psyhogeos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions come as the company fights federal charges that it  
illegally wields its Windows monopoly to stifle competition in the 
technology industry.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Cancer Screening Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After reviewing the results of prostate biopsies  
performed in the mid-1990s, a suburban hospital found that 20 men 
were misdiagnosed and suffer from cancer they were told they did 
not have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel shock, anger, disbelief -- there's nothing we can do,''  
said the wife of one misdiagnosed patient, requesting that the 
family's identity and hometown be kept anonymous. ``We don't know 
what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 62-year-old husband was told two weeks ago by  
Sturdy Memorial Hospital that his test had been inaccurately 
reported by a former pathologist. Since then, her husband has been 
told to seek aggressive radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the errors, the cancer was left undiagnosed and  
untreated in the 20 men for some time, perhaps lowering their 
chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital 30 miles south of Boston planned a news conference  
for today to discuss the biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	The flawed exams were performed between January 1995 and  
December 1997, The Sun Chronicle of Attleboro reported this week. 
Sturdy Memorial has said it reviewed 279 tests and discovered that 
20 were botched. Two of the 20 men have apparently died of 
unrelated causes, the hospital told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Sturdy Memorial would not release the conditions of  
the other misdiagnosed men, nor elaborate on what triggered the 
review of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistakes are under investigation by the state's Department  
of Public Health and Board of Registration in Medicine. Both groups 
refused comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were supposed to detect malignant cells in the  
prostate, a walnut-sized organ in men located just below the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 179,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer  
nationwide every year. About 37,000 men die of the disease each 
year, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year survival rate in men whose cancer is detected  
early and has not spread is nearly 99 percent, said Kara Smigel, a 
spokeswoman for the National Cancer Institute. If the cancer has 
spread to bones or organs, that figure drops to 32 percent, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one recent cancer misdiagnosis case resulted in  
criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a Wisconsin laboratory pleaded no contest to reckless  
homicide after failing to find obvious signs of cancer in Pap 
smears of two women who later died. Lawsuits against the lab, 
health maintenance organization and individuals were settled for 
$9.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Attack Prompts Manson To End Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside a  
Marilyn Manson concert, protesting possible links between his dark 
music and the Colorado school killings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the shock-rocker announced the cancellation of  
next week's last five dates of his U.S. tour, saying it was out of 
respect for the victims of the shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a great atmosphere to be out playing rock 'n' roll  
shows, for us or the fans,'' Manson said in a news release Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said he blames ignorance, hatred and access to guns for  
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	A concert by the group tonight in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was still  
scheduled and extra security was planned, promoters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, critics have charged that the dark messages  
in Manson's music can influence troubled youth. The killers in the 
school shooting were said to be Manson fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reap what we sow, and if we're filling our kids' heads with  
this garbage ... what comes out is what you put in,'' said Chris 
Rischette, a parent who demonstrated outside the Target Center 
during Tuesday's concert in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never blame Marilyn Manson or say it's his fault, but  
without a doubt it's so clear to me that he had an impact on what 
was in those boys' heads,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans said the music isn't to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	``When it gets right down to it, the kids were the ones who went  
out and did the shooting,'' said Jared Bennett. ``It's the kids' 
fault, it's not the music they listen to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to local promoters and the Marilyn Manson Web site,  
the band is postponing concerts scheduled for May 3 in Reno, Nev.; 
May 4 in Fresno, Calif.; May 5 in Las Vegas; May 7 in Phoenix, and 
May 8 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment today from the band's spokeswoman in New  
York. Jennie Boddy of Nothing/Interscope Records did not 
immediately return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cedar Rapids, officials at the Five Seasons Center have been  
telling callers it's their right to protest tonight's concert if 
they wish, but the concert will go on, said marketing director 
Tammy Koolbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our position to censor what comes into this  
building,'' Koolbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, medical personnel and fire crews normally are on duty  
outside the arena for general admission concerts, and more were to 
be on duty tonight, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn had urged that the Reno concert not be  
held, saying in a letter to the organizers Tuesday that 
cancellation would be ``a fitting show of respect for the victims 
of the Colorado tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn's letter followed a similar call by a group of parents in  
the Reno area. ``This is not about censorship,'' parent Jody 
Ruggiero said. ``This is about public safety.''

<HEADLINE> Touching Umpire Gets Vina Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Fernando Vina  
will appeal a two-game suspension for putting a finger in umpire 
Mike Winters' face while arguing balls and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident developed last Friday when Vina disputed a called  
third strike in a game in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Winters) told me, `I suppose you're going to say it's my  
fault,''' Vina told reporters before the Brewers' game Wednesday 
night with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have to say that,'' Vina said. ``That charged me up,  
I was just going to walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Vina said he stayed to argue some more and had some  
minor physical contact, apparently touching Winters' cheek. He was 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The National League said Vina was being suspended for two games  
and fined an undisclosed amount for excessive arguing of balls and 
strikes and for contact with the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was supposed to take effect Wednesday but will be  
held up while Vina appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee manager Phil Garner said the incident had not seemed  
to be a big deal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly didn't seem to be anything that seemed to be  
blatant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While not wanting to comment on the Vina incident specifically,  
Garner said problems between umpires and players have been on the 
rise in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been two-fold in this escalation of warfare,'' Garner  
said. ``I think the players have shown a more angry, a more bitter 
(type of) argument and the umpires have not been willing to walk 
away for a few moments to let things cool off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner said both sides should work to cool things down in their  
daily interactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's best when umpires avoid the confrontation. The  
umpire has to put himself above these things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think players would be wise not to argue over a ball and  
strike like it's the end of the world,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Flying High After Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Fore! The Buffalo Sabres can go golfing  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean they're finished playing hockey.  
</P>
<P>
	It just means they'll be teeing off on the front nine instead of  
on opposing goaltenders for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a swift and stunning playoff sweep of second-seeded  
Ottawa, the Sabres can keep their drivers in the same bag with 
their hockey sticks while awaiting the next Stanley Cup round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might play a round or two,'' Sabres forward Brian Holzinger,  
who scored twice in Game 3, said during a day off Wednesday. ``But 
the main thing is we have time to nurse some injuries and heal up 
while watching the other teams beat up on one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaclav Varada's two goals and Dominik Hasek's 40 saves sank the  
Senators 4-3 in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The win triggered a shower of brooms onto the ice and sent the  
Sabres out of the gate as the playoffs' lead dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years the Sabres got used to playing golf while other  
teams were still playing hockey. Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, a former 
Sabres captain, recalls seven first-round exits between 1984 and 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that I waited to see a long time, both as a  
former player and now as a coach, to see the fans get to celebrate 
after a series victory,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Sabres upset Philadelphia and swept Montreal, both  
on the road. Buffalo then fell to Washington in the conference 
final, losing the last game at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres spoke confidently going into the series with Ottawa,  
but some of them shuddered. The Northeast Division rivals were 
mired in five overtimes during the season. Four games ended in 
ties; the Senators won the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was extremely scared before this series started,'' said  
Sabres wing Dixon Ward, who assisted on both of Varada's goals in 
Game 4. ``I didn't want to play Ottawa, I'll be honest with you. 
But as the series went along we just gained more confidence. We 
seemed to get better and found ways to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres stole the first game in Ottawa and outlasted the  
Senators in double overtime in Game 2. Anchored by Hasek and 
propelled by an aggressive offense, they outplayed the Senators in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres also held Senators star Alexei Yashin to no points in  
the series despite Yashin's team-leading nine shots Tuesday. 
Buffalo captain Michael Peca and Varada did most of the work on the 
frustrated Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	The acrobatic Hasek did all but stand on his head to make the  
difference in the first game and allowed six goals on 162 shots in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek allowed nine goals in three straight losses to the  
Capitals in last year's conference finals. This season he had a 
strong start and faltered before a groin injury sidelined him for 
12 games between February and March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little hungrier this time,'' Ward said. ``He had a  
little more rest down the stretch this year. And he's extremely 
focused on trying to prove a few naysayers wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone,'' Hasek said.  
``I'm just trying to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the series against Ottawa, the Sabres got more of what helped  
them throughout the regular season, such as Hasek's good 
goaltending, plus something they lacked -- scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Sabres scored goals against the Senators and 14 finished  
with points. Alexei Zhitnik, Varada and Rasmussen, a rookie who 
shuttled between Buffalo and Rochester during the season, all 
scored their first goals in the series Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about scoring by committee and that's just what we  
needed, especially with Miro out of the lineup,'' Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing real well right now,'' Holzinger said, adding  
that the Sabres will have to find some way to stay sharp as they 
await their next playoff foe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches will make sure we're ready to go,'' Holzinger  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured include the Sabres' top scorer, Miroslav Satan, who  
bruised his foot when a teammate's shot struck him during in 
Sunday's Game 3. X-rays were negative, but Satan, a 40-goal scorer, 
was reduced to hobbling around on crutches for a couple days. 
``He's off the crutches now,'' Holzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Sanderson, who injured some ligaments in his hand when he  
was slashed in a game recently, is likely to return for the next 
round.

<HEADLINE> Infinity Beats Wall Street Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infinity Broadcasting Corp. earned $48 million  
in the first three months of 1999, edging Wall Street's forecasts 
in the radio company's first full quarter since its partial spinoff 
by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit by the operator of 160 radio stations and a major  
billboard business represented a 55 percent improvement over 
Infinity's earnings as a unit of CBS in the same period last year, 
before last June's acquisition of American Radio Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	On a per-share basis, Infinity earned 6 cents, up from 4 cents  
in the first quarter of 1998 and a penny better than what most 
analysts expected, according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues, including those from the American Radio  
System, totaled $474 million. That's an increase of about 16 
percent from the combined revenues of Infinity and ARS in the first 
quarter last year, when they were still separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity, still about 82 percent owned by CBS, attributed the  
improvement to strong revenues from both radio and billboard 
advertising, as well as the addition of ARS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Infinity continues to benefit from new Internet-related  
advertising on its radio stations and outdoor advertising venues, 
and also will benefit from its participation in the developing 
position CBS enjoys on the Internet,'' said Mel Karmazin, chief 
executive of both Infinity and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, CBS sold 140 million shares of Infinity, its most  
profitable division, for $20.50 apiece, in an initial public 
offering of stock that raised $2.87 billion. CBS had acquired 
Infinity for $3.9 billion two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the IPO, Infinity's stock has risen as high as $33.50 per  
share. On Wednesday, the shares fell $1.12 1/2 to $27 on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer Enters Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- For three years, trainer D. Wayne Lukas  
was on the run of a lifetime. Almost incredibly, he couldn't lose a 
Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 1994 Preakness through the 1996 Kentucky Derby, a Lukas  
horse was always in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won the Triple Crown, it just took a couple of horses,''  
Lukas joked Tuesday after he was elected to thoroughbred racing's 
Hall of Fame. ``I wasn't smart enough to get a good one for one 
year ... I had to relay them. We just got on a run and it just kind 
of fell into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was Tabasco Cat winning the '94 Preakness and Belmont  
Stakes; Thunder Gulch winning the '95 Derby and Belmont, with 
Timber Country taking the Preakness in between; and, finally, 
Grindstone taking the '96 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Six in a row, and victories in 10 Triple Crown races in all for  
Lukas, starting with Codex's win in the 1980 Preakness. On 
Saturday, Lukas sends out Cat Thief and Charismatic in search of 
his fourth Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Russell Baze, who rode more than 400 winners for the  
seventh consecutive year in 1998, also was elected. Entering 1999, 
Baze had 6,429 winners and earnings of more than $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoroughbreds elected were Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow.  
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are Aug. 9 at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., home  
of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' election finally fell into place after so many years of  
controversy over the Hall's eligibility rule that nominees must 
have trained thoroughbreds for 25 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas started out as a quarterhorse trainer in the 1960s, but  
also trained thoroughbreds every so often. The Hall's nominating 
committee, though, started the clock in 1974. Once, Lukas was so 
upset with the confusion, he threatened to boycott the inevitable 
announcement of his election. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't. Wearing a gray suit and black tie, attire usually  
reserved for his hundreds of trips to the winner's circle, Lukas 
patiently explained his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only take is it's not my place or anyone else's to  
determine the eligibility -- it's the Hall of Fame and its 
committee,'' he said. ``And their read in my case was not that I 
had not trained a horse as early as the early '60s, but they wanted 
it consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some breaks, not much, and I accept that. So if  
they use 1974 and that makes them happy and it's endorsed with the 
votes, so be it, and I'm very happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, Lukas will top $200 million in purse earnings,  
a staggering number considering only one other trainer -- the late 
Charlie Whittingham -- has passed $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some very good clientele that had extreme faith in me  
and backed it up with their bankroll and let me buy some of the 
best horses in the world,'' Lukas said. ``The $200 million 
represents a lot of income to a lot of people that backed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has 518 graded stakes victories, which is 7 percent of all  
the graded stakes the past 20 years. He has won 13 Breeders' Cup 
races -- more than any other trainer -- and four Eclipse Awards as 
the nation's top trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 14 of the past 17 years, Lukas was the nation's leading  
trainer in earnings, and set a record of $17.8 million in 1988, the 
year he saddled his first Derby winner, the filly Winning Colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his greatest moments in racing, Lukas cited his  
Derby wins first, followed by the rest of the Triple Crown race 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas also praised former assistants who have gone out on their  
own. The former Team Lukas crew includes Mark Hennig, Bobby 
Barnett, Kiaran McLaughlin, Dallas Stewart, Todd Plechter and Randy 
Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably proudest that six of my guys -- my alumni -- are  
out on their own and doing very well,'' the 63-year-old Lukas said. 
``Two of them will lead horses in the Derby against me on 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett saddles Answer Lively and Stewart has Kimberlite Pipe.  
</P>
<P>
	As he finished his remarks in the press box at Churchill Downs,  
Lukas said: ``On Saturday at about 6 p.m., I hope I'm back up here 
for another visit.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Dealt Another Court Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In another setback for Kenneth Starr, a  
federal judge ruled Wednesday prosecutors cannot interview jurors 
who refused to convict Susan McDougal, President Clinton's 
Whitewater partner, in her recent criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. concluded Starr's office  
had not shown ``good cause'' for the court to make an exception to 
a policy of ``not invading the province of the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had said interviewing jurors would be important to  
their decision about whether to seek a retrial of Mrs. McDougal on 
two counts that deadlocked the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are evaluating our next step,'' Starr spokeswoman Elizabeth  
Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard wrote that ``permitting the unbridled interviewing of  
jurors could easily lead to their harassment, to the exploitation 
of their thought processes ... and to diminished confidence in jury 
verdicts as well as unbalanced trial results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Various members of the jury have talked to the news media since  
the verdict this month. In interviews with The Associated Press, 
Donald Thomas, the jury foreman, said he was put off by the 
``arrogance'' of Starr's prosecutors and felt the testimony of 
Starr's deputy, Hickman Ewing, was evasive. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said ``most courts do not allow attorneys to contact  
jurors after the conclusion of a trial. Federal courts generally 
disfavor post-verdict interviewing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury this month acquitted McDougal on an obstruction of  
justice charge but deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt 
for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Julie Myers had argued that ``post-trial  
contacts with the trial jurors may help save the United States, the 
court and the defendant from undergoing another judicial 
proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, at first said he would  
welcome such interviews by the prosecution team. He later changed 
his mind and objected to the request. Geragos said Arkansans had 
been bothered enough by Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said federal rules do not allow an inquiry into the  
``mental processes'' of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are never going to retry this case,'' Geragos said  
Wednesday after the judge's decision. ``It's just more nonsense and 
a way for them to spend more tax dollars. It's time they came to 
their senses, packed up and moved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the jury foreman, had said that testimony from other  
witnesses -- especially Julie Hiatt Steele, who like Mrs. McDougal 
was charged with obstructing Starr's probe -- convinced some jurors 
that Mrs. McDougal's fears about testifying to a grand jury were 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she thought she'd be charged with perjury  
unless she falsely implicated the president and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Angela Smith, one of five jurors who wanted to convict  
Mrs. McDougal of criminal contempt, has said she saw no evidence 
Starr's team acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	But another juror, Becky Boeckmann, said she wanted to acquit  
Mrs. McDougal on all counts and doubted she knows anything of value 
to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, insisted Starr's office ``was not on 
trial here, only Mrs. McDougal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She honestly believed that she could be held for a false  
statement'' and that explained why she didn't talk, said Nance.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jason Farrell's goal in the 88th minute  
Wednesday gave the Columbus Crew a 1-0 victory over the winless 
Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City (0-7), playing its final game under interim coach  
Ken Fogerty, suffered its fifth shutout loss of the season and the 
eighth in a 10-game losing streak dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, former U.S. national team coach Bob Gansler was  
named Kansas City's new head coach. He takes over on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (4-2) managed just six shots in the game. But the Crew  
avoided a shootout when Farrell slipped past the Kansas City 
defense to take a long pass from Andy Williams, then took one step 
and fired a shot past goalkeeper Chris Snitko from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kmosko was credited with an assist on the play.

<HEADLINE> Slain Students Tenderly Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They gathered to mourn a life  
interrupted, a teen-ager lost to the violence that convulsed a 
school and saddened a nation. But those who came together to 
remember Steve Curnow had a bit of unexpected help -- from Steve 
Curnow. 
</P>
<P>
	In an autobiography he compiled for a recent class assignment,  
the 14-year-old who died last week in the Columbine High School 
shootings described ``Me in a Nutshell'' -- a blond kid who loved 
soccer, knew all the lines from ``Star Wars,'' dreamed of flying 
F-16s and frequented Angie's restaurant ``because they make a great 
pizza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a morning person, and I hate to get up in the  
morning. ... I would either like to go to college or go into the 
Air Force or Navy,'' Curnow wrote in the life story distributed at 
his funeral, where more than 1,000 people, including Gov. Bill 
Owens, said goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	Curnow and fellow Columbine student John Tomlin, 16, were  
remembered Wednesday, Tomlin 900 miles away in Waterford, Wis. The 
final funeral, for Isaiah Shoels, was to be held today. 
</P>
<P>
	How do you remember a life without reducing it to anecdote?  
Curnow's 20-year-old sister, Nancy, did her best, remembering the 
things she loved about her brother and the empty spot his absence 
created. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't have anybody to have fights with over who ...  
fills the ice cube tray or brings in the groceries,'' she said. 
``Now I can't tease you about your first girlfriend or even when 
you start to shave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, a shy, religious boy who adored his Chevy truck, was  
buried in his native Wisconsin. He was remembered by 450 people and 
buried in a casket of green and gold -- the colors of his beloved 
Green Bay Packers, who sent flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend, Michelle Oetter, 17, said she wasn't angry at  
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 12 students and a 
teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's gone, and we have to take it and trust that God brings  
good out of it,'' she said. ``There's nothing that we can 
accomplish by getting angry at those guys. Anger is what started 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the service began, Tomlin's grandmother, Elizabeth,  
placed her hands on the coffin and cried silently. ``He is a kid 
that every parent and grandparent wishes they had,'' she said. ``He 
was always there for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Curnow's funeral, mourners received a glossy pamphlet with  
his story and photos. On the front, Curnow stares out from behind 
mirrored sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Billy Epperhart, presiding over his fourth Columbine  
funeral in a week, acknowledged the personal toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never even come close to seeing this grief in the eyes  
and lives of the families of these teen-agers who were so full of 
life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Epperhart read a statement from Curnow's mother, Sue, who told  
of how, as a toddler, the boy who would grow into an accomplished 
soccer player would suck on his blanket so hard that he left holes 
in the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you,'' Mrs. Curnow wrote, ``for that special moment two  
weeks ago when you told me, `Mom, I'll bet there aren't many guys 
who talk and discuss things like we do. Anytime you want to discuss 
anything, I'd like to be there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Curnows, the days ahead will not be easy. If the wooden  
wind chimes by their front stairs ring, it will no longer mean 
Steve is leaping down the staircase and banging his head upon them 
in exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you're up there flying your F-16 and battling things  
out with Darth Vader and a light saber,'' his sister said. And she 
gave him a gentle warning: ``Don't let them cut off your hand.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Arbit Blatas, a Lithuanian-born sculptor,  
painter and stage designer noted for his portraits of Picasso, 
Matisse, Soutine, Cocteau and other artists, died Tuesday. He was 
90. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatas has a series of seven bronze tablets on a wall of the  
Campo del Nuovo Ghetto in Venice. The 1979 tablets commemorate the 
night of Dec. 5, 1943, when 200 of the city's Jews were rounded up 
for deportation and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatas also did the black-and-white drawings used in the  
introductory segments of the 1978 television series ``The 
Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last book of paintings, ``An Artist's Venice,'' was  
published in 1997.

	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- John DeCleux, a popular Ozarks radio  
show host, died Tuesday at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, DeCleux had worked with Bonnie Bell as  
co-host of KWTO-AM's ``Open Line'' on weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
	His broadcast career spanned more than 20 years and included  
time at radio stations in Flat River and West Plains, Mo.; 
Collierville and Memphis, Tenn.; and Jackson, Miss. He once had the 
top-rated radio show in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Deborah.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Melba Liston, a jazz trombonist, composer and  
arranger who worked with bands led by Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy 
Jones, died Friday after suffering a series of strokes. She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz called Ms. Liston ``one of the  
most accomplished trombonists of her generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Liston was forced to stop trombone playing in 1985 after a  
stroke left her partially paralyzed, but she continued to arrange 
music with longtime friend and pianist Randy Weston. The two shared 
billing in 1993 on their critically acclaimed album ``Volcano 
Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in her teens, Ms. Liston played in youth bands and joined  
Gerald Wilson's band as a trombonist and arranger. When the group 
disbanded in 1948, she joined Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	She briefly left jazz for a job at the Los Angeles Board of  
Education, but joined Gillespie again in 1955 for a State 
Department tour of the Middle East and Asia. She also worked with 
one of Gillespie's trumpeters, Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, she taught in Jamaica at the University of the  
West Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music. She returned to the 
United States in the early 1980s and worked with bands until she 
suffered the stroke.

                         *Sir William McCrea    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir William McCrea, an astrophysicist who made a  
vital contribution to the understanding of the sun's composition 
and went on to develop important theories about the evolution of 
galaxies and planets, died Sunday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young research student in 1929, McCrea confirmed a  
hypothesis that hydrogen was by far the most common element in the 
outer layers of the sun's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	His calculations -- and the subsequent realization that every  
star was mainly composed of hydrogen -- revolutionized the science 
of cosmology and led to the big-bang theory of the origin of the 
universe.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michi Nishiura Weglyn, who wrote a widely  
acclaimed book on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World 
War II, died Sunday of cancer at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1976 book, ``Years of Infamy, The Untold Story of America's  
Concentration Camps,'' described the experiences of 120,000 
Japanese-Americans who were rounded up by the U.S. government in 
the early days of World War II and interned as security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the book was coolly received at first, its powerful prose  
and solid documentation eventually helped spur demands for redress 
and a national apology by President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn's family was sent with thousands of others to a  
desert camp in Gila River, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	She later became a New York costume designer and was drawn to  
social causes in the 1970s. She then became a familiar figure at 
the National Archives in Washington, D.C., poring over dusty 
documents from opening to closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her research discredited President Roosevelt's 1942 claim that  
``military necessity'' justified the internments, and revealed 
thousands of Japanese from Latin American countries were also held 
in the U.S. camps.

	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A nanny caught on videotape kicking,  
hitting and tossing children in her care has pleaded innocent to 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Kahn, 59, a nanny for two families, was charged April 16  
with two counts of risk of injury to a minor. She entered her plea 
Monday and was freed on $50,000 bail.

	The father of an 11-month-old boy arranged to have a camera  
hidden in a clock in his home after he found his son and a 
10-month-old girl in Kahn's care with dirty diapers and unexplained 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The video showed the nanny repeatedly hitting, kicking and  
tossing the children. At one point, Kahn lifted the boy and slammed 
him face-down onto her thigh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn initially denied hitting the children, but when she watched  
the video, she told police she didn't remember hitting the 
toddlers, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Court Releases Microsoft Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates parried  
with government antitrust lawyers, two of his biggest rivals opened 
secret negotiations that led to America Online's nearly $10 billion 
purchase of Netscape, an executive involved in those talks 
disclosed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court where Microsoft is fighting its antitrust case also  
released 684 pages of transcripts showing Gates, the world's 
wealthiest person with an estimated $41 billion in stock, 
struggling with government questions during his three days of 
depositions last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly one-third of that testimony was previously shown on  
video as part of the trial, but a federal appeals court ordered the 
rest released Wednesday -- along with almost 10,000 pages of other 
depositions, including those from some of the high-tech industry's 
most famous executives. 
</P>
<P>
	As in portions of his interview already played in the courtroom,  
Gates can be seen carefully parsing questions put to him by 
government lawyers, who quickly grow frustrated. Tempers rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must say I think your answers are nonresponsive and  
rambling,'' said Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 20 states 
suing Microsoft along with the Justice Department. ``And if that 
continues to be the case, I'm just letting you know this is going 
to take much longer than I would have hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning continued for 19 1/2 more hours.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a Microsoft lawyer questioned Peter Currie,  
Netscape's former chief financial officer, who helped put together 
the company's sale to AOL, which was finalized last month for $9.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson previously agreed to  
allow Microsoft to gather evidence about the sale's implications on 
the trial, saying the deal ``might be a very significant change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend that Microsoft illegally forces  
consumers who buy its dominant Windows computer operating system 
also to use its bundled Internet browser, discouraging people from 
using rival Web software, such as Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that the lucrative sale of Netscape undermines  
charges that Netscape was any kind of victim and that competition 
within the industry is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, with nearly 17 million subscribers, is the world's largest  
Internet provider. Netscape produces popular Web browsing software 
and owns Netcenter, one of the most successful sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Currie testified that discussions between AOL and Netscape  
started in late August, but the sale wasn't publicly acknowledged 
until November. Government lawyers also questioned Gates in late 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Michael Lacovara asked whether Netscape,  
which supports the government's case, considered how the deal might 
affect the outcome of the trial, which started in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recollection was that there was a brief discussion whether  
it May but that we need to make decisions about the business and 
treat the trial as a separate issue,'' Currie said. ``And I have to 
say, there were very few people who were focused on the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He could not remember specific discussions about the deal's  
impact on Microsoft, but he said Netscape realized the software 
giant wouldn't be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL was willing to secure the animus of Microsoft,'' Currie  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the companies apparently cast an eye toward the courtroom.  
Currie said the sale seemed ``on quite a fast time frame'' until 
the trial started -- and executives from AOL and Netscape were the 
first witnesses for the government -- when the deal ``went on 
hiatus, when nothing happened for weeks and weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret negotiations resumed closer to November. Lacovara  
said the apparent code name chosen for Microsoft in the deal was 
Mars, the Roman god of war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft trial currently is in recess and is not expected  
to resume before the middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> NASA's X-ray Telescope Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray  
telescope will remain stuck on Earth several extra weeks because of 
an Air Force investigation into a stranded satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope was supposed to soar aboard space shuttle Columbia  
on July 9. NASA officials said Wednesday that the launch is off 
until at least the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA wants to wait until the Air Force's investigation is  
complete before proceeding with the Chandra launch. The mission 
already is a year late because of bad circuit boards that had to be 
replaced in the telescope and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Each month's delay costs NASA $6 million to $8 million, said  
agency spokesman Dave Drachlis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Air Force impounded the upper-stage  
motor intended for the telescope. It's the same kind of motor that 
apparently malfunctioned April 9 and left the military's newest 
Defense Support Program satellite in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force eventually released the upper-stage motor for  
launch preparations, but NASA decided this week to hold off on 
attaching it to the telescope. What, if anything, the Air Force had 
learned from impounding the motor was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force spokeswoman Patsy Bomhoff said Wednesday that  
controllers still were working with the stranded DSP satellite and 
had made ``great strides'' in trying to salvage it. But she said it 
will never reach the intended 22,300-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Chandra, it's come a long way despite the latest trouble,  
said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been delayed now, what, almost a year,'' he said. ``I can  
guarantee you one thing. Every `i' and `t' is going to be dotted 
and crossed before this thing is launched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, a Hubble-caliber observatory, should have rocketed into  
orbit last August. Unlike Hubble, the X-ray telescope will be 
placed in an orbit too high to be reached by spacewalking 
astronauts so it will be irreparable once launched.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Duo Takes Aim on Ky. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- So far, the trainer hasn't been around,  
nor have the owners. And the assistant trainer made only a brief 
stop at Barn 45, where Godolphin Stables' Worldly Manner and Aljabr 
are stabled at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this any way to get ready for the Kentucky Derby?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' said Eric Coatrieux, an assistant to  
Tom Albertrani, who is the assistant to trainer Saeed bin Suroor -- 
who probably won't show up at the Derby because he's saddling 
horses in Saturday's 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheikhs who run Godolphin Stable, the Dubai arm of Sheikh  
Maktoum al Maktoum's and Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's racing 
empire, have decided they want to win the Derby. And they want to 
win it their way, by privately training horses at their track in 
the desert and keeping them out of traditional Derby prep races. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that also means leaving their first Derby horses in the  
care of the third-string handler, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Worldly Manner, purchased for $5 million from John and  
Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm last fall, nor Aljabr, bred on the 
sheikhs' Shadwell Farm near Lexington, Ky., has raced as a 
3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they ran March 21 in a private trial race in Dubai.  
Worldly Manner, trained by Bob Baffert before the sale, was first 
and Aljabr second in a field of 10. If either wins Saturday, it 
would mark the first time since Regret in 1915 that a horse has won 
the Derby without racing as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is an interesting twist, isn't it?'' said trainer Bill  
Mott, who has been to the desert and won the Dubai World Cup twice 
with Cigar. ``They know what they're doing, they have all the tools 
to get it done, but we'll just have to see if it's enough. It'll 
make the race a little more intriguing, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godolphin is one of the strongest stables worldwide, but it's  
just starting to dabble in Derby fever. This might be the 125th 
Kentucky Derby, but it's Derby No. 1 for the sheikhs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to come back to Kentucky and win the  
Derby,'' Sheikh Mohammed said last month at a news conference in 
Dubai. ``Since we formed Godolphin, we didn't think we had the 
horse. Now we do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby is the most difficult race to win and this  
is the main challenge for us. We know how important it is, but if 
we don't try it, we can't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't win, it won't be on account of a money shortage.  
They secured Jerry Bailey to ride Worldly Manner, and the jockey 
reportedly is guaranteed an upfront payment of $70,000, the winning 
jockey's take from the $1 million Derby purse. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas, who sends out Cat Thief and Charismatic in  
search of his fourth Derby win, says it's tough to buy the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dubai group, by my arithmetic alone, have spent some $20  
million to get horses to the Derby, and that doesn't guarantee 
anything,'' said Lukas. ``It's not money geniuses or computers 
trying to make marriages in heaven, either. There are so many 
intangibles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why it's tough to figure what might happen when the  
gate springs open and an expected full field of 20 3-year-olds go 
1 1/4 miles for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the way they're taking it as a challenge,'' said Nick  
Zito, who trains Derby horses Adonis and Stephen Got Even. ``They 
have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but they are putting a new 
spin on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if one wins?  
</P>
<P>
	``If they win, you must take your hat off to them,'' said Zito.  
</P>
<P>
	If workouts count, there's been no indication that Worldly  
Manner, clearly the better of the Godolphin colts, is capable of 
winning the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Worldly Manner and Aljabr were far from impressive.  
Worldly Manner, who won three of four starts in California as a 
2-year-old, went 7 furlongs in a plodding 1:29 4-5. Aljabr, 3-for-3 
in races in England and France, worked 5 furlongs in 1:04. On 
Tuesday, both galloped 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, a two-time Derby winner, saw the good side of Worldly  
Manner's Sunday workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He finished unbelievable,'' said Bailey. ``He was very  
willing, handled the track well and was very relaxed the entire 
time. I always felt like there was something there if I asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Desormeaux, who was aboard Derby and Preakness winner Real  
Quiet in 1998, gets the ride aboard Aljabr should Baffert's filly 
Excellent Meeting not be entered today in the Derby. Desormeaux was 
aboard Worldly Manner in the colt's last race in the United States 
-- a win in the Del Mar Futurity in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a rangy colt, and definitely has what it takes to win a  
Kentucky Derby,'' Desormeaux said of Worldly Manner. ``He's got 
long, fluid strides, and he's powerful. The only question, like 
with the others, is the stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Derby question was answered Tuesday, when a judge in  
Little Rock, Ark., cleared the way for Arkansas Derby winner Valhol 
to run. The judge ordered the $300,000 first-prize money awarded to 
owner James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner's share was withheld pending a stewards investigation  
into whether jockey Billy Patin used an electrical device to make 
Valhol run faster. Patin, who still faces a May 5 stewards' 
hearing, lost the mount, and Willie Martinez is expected to replace 
him.

<HEADLINE> Mich. To Begin Welfare Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Welfare applicants in three areas of  
Michigan will be required to take drug tests before receiving 
benefits under a new state law that takes effect this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot program to begin Oct. 1 is believed to be the first in  
the nation to require drug tests of all applicants at specified 
welfare offices, said Bill Kordenbrock, an official with the state 
Family Independence Agency, which administers welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing is needed to make sure drug use doesn't provide a  
stumbling block to moving off welfare, said Gov. John Engler, who 
signed the bill into law Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some ... substance abuse remains a barrier to  
independence,'' he said. ``This program will help us identify these 
individuals and provide them with the incentive to change their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Michigan will use Medicaid funds to provide  
treatment for those who screen positive for drugs. Anyone refusing 
treatment will face at least a partial loss of welfare benefits, 
and applicants who refuse to take the test will have their benefits 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not determined which areas of the state will take  
part. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups and welfare advocates have said  
across-the-board drug testing of anyone who applies for welfare 
unfairly discriminates against the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Governor Engler was truly concerned about making sure  
welfare applicants could get jobs, he would also be looking at 
factors such as alcohol abuse, and literacy and homelessness,'' 
said Wendy Wagenheim of the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Michigan. ``This is just one, and it's strictly punitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new law requires drug tests to be given to welfare  
applicants statewide beginning April 1, 2003.

<HEADLINE>  Clemens Leaves With Stiff Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens' bid to become the first  
AL pitcher to win 18 straight decision ended after two innings 
Tuesday night because of stiffness in his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees trailed the Texas Rangers 5-0 when Clemens  
did not come out to pitch the bottom of the third. He was replaced 
by Hideki Irabu, who was given all the time he needed to warm up 
because an injury forced the pitching change. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens looked out of synch throughout his brief stint. He threw  
53 pitches, only 29 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first out he recorded came on an RBI fielder's choice that  
put Texas ahead 3-0. The Rangers scored twice more before making 
another out, although it began a streak of five straight outs for 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens allowed five runs on four hits and two walks. He didn't  
have any strikeouts. Two starts before, he allowed seven runs in 
three innings and left trailing Baltimore 7-6 but the Yankees came 
back to win 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who last lost May 29 against Seattle, tied the AL win  
streak record of 17 in his previous start, which also was against 
Texas. The mark was first set by Cleveland's Johnny Allen in 
1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 1968-69. Carl 
Hubbell holds the major league record with 24, set for the New York 
Giants from 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first attempt to add this record to his milestone-filled  
career, Clemens bought 50 tickets for friends and relatives. The 
drama was heightened by the fact the game was in his home state and 
against the team that nearly acquired him in a trade in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But the native Texan wasn't welcomed home.  
</P>
<P>
	A near sellout crowd booed Clemens in pre-game introductions and  
again while he warmed up before the first inning. They booed for a 
third time when pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre visited the mound 
during the first inning, then fans gave the Rangers a standing 
ovation after the five-run first. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens had won his last six decision against Texas since April  
1, 1996, when he was with Boston. The Rangers were the losers in 
streak wins Nos. 8 and 17.

<HEADLINE>  Clemens Leaves With Stiff Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens' bid to become the first  
AL pitcher to win 18 straight decision ended after two innings 
Tuesday night because of stiffness in his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees trailed the Texas Rangers 5-0 when Clemens  
did not come out to pitch the bottom of the third. He was replaced 
by Hideki Irabu, who was given all the time he needed to warm up 
because an injury forced the pitching change. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens looked out of synch throughout his brief stint. He threw  
53 pitches, only 29 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first out he recorded came on an RBI fielder's choice that  
put Texas ahead 3-0. The Rangers scored twice more before making 
another out, although it began a streak of five straight outs for 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens allowed five runs on four hits and two walks. He didn't  
have any strikeouts. Two starts before, he allowed seven runs in 
three innings and left trailing Baltimore 7-6 but the Yankees came 
back to win 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who last lost May 29 against Seattle, tied the AL win  
streak record of 17 in his previous start, which also was against 
Texas. The mark was first set by Cleveland's Johnny Allen in 
1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 1968-69. Carl 
Hubbell holds the major league record with 24, set for the New York 
Giants from 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first attempt to add this record to his milestone-filled  
career, Clemens bought 50 tickets for friends and relatives. The 
drama was heightened by the fact the game was in his home state and 
against the team that nearly acquired him in a trade in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But the native Texan wasn't welcomed home.  
</P>
<P>
	A near sellout crowd booed Clemens in pre-game introductions and  
again while he warmed up before the first inning. They booed for a 
third time when pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre visited the mound 
during the first inning, then fans gave the Rangers a standing 
ovation after the five-run first. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens had won his last six decision against Texas since April  
1, 1996, when he was with Boston. The Rangers were the losers in 
streak wins Nos. 8 and 17.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Bank Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Central Bank on Wednesday cut  
the benchmark interest rate in Brazil from 34 percent to 32 
percent, citing healthy economic signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank president Arminio Fraga announced the cut at a  
press conference in Brasilia, the capital. It is the fourth time in 
five weeks the bank has lowered interest rates, which were at 45 
percent in early March. 
</P>
<P>
	During this period foreign investment has started to return, the  
currency has strengthened and inflation has declined. Recent 
figures estimate it will be in single figures in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, there were also indications that a scandal  
involving former Central Bank president Francisco Lopes has not 
damaged foreign investors' confidence in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index closed up 2.2  
percent. The currency, the real, also ended stronger, at 1.68 to 
the dollar compared to 1.70 a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Police arrested Lopes Monday after he refused to sign an  
oath to tell the truth at a Senate inquiry into alleged banking 
irregularities. He was later released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate said Wednesday it would summon Lopes again but did  
not say when.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Takes On Afghan Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Americans not to  
become apathetic about the predicament of women suffering under 
tight restrictions imposed by Afghanistan's Taliban government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go into the 21st century without doing everything  
within our power to try to stand against such human rights 
violations and against the perils of indifference,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said Wednesday at a Capitol Hill luncheon honoring Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``When women are savagely beaten by so-called religious police  
for not being fully covered by the burqa or for making noises while 
they walk, we know that it is not just the physical beating that is 
the objective,'' the first lady said. ``It is the destruction of 
the spirit of those women as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, which seized control of the government in 1996,  
follow a strict and disputed interpretation of Islamic law that 
requires women to wear the burqa, a garment covering them from head 
to toe, while out in public or risk being beaten. They also must 
stay indoors unless accompanied by a close male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has banned girls from going to school. Male  
doctors are prohibited from treating sick women in Afghanistan, and 
women are not allowed to work, let alone practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of Afghanistan, while other women are moving  
forward, are being pushed brutally backward in time,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said. ``The opportunities they once enjoyed are being trampled by 
the iron rule of the Taliban, creating one of the clearest examples 
of the systematic violations of women's rights in any nation in the 
world anywhere today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also told the story of an Afghan teacher who was  
shot to death this month in front of her students after refusing to 
close down a home school for girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the woman living in refugee camps in Pakistan told  
human rights observers the woman was shot in the head and stomach 
in front of about 40 students, her husband and 18-month-old 
daughter after Taliban militia burst into her home demanding that 
the school be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can honor her memory ... by not forgetting her story and  
her willingness to stand against the forces of violence and 
oppression,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group Physicians for Human Rights honored Feinstein for her  
work on the issue a day after it released a report critical of 
diminishing health care and human rights for women in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said Feinstein has spearheaded efforts to get the  
Senate to pass a resolution calling for an end to the abuse of 
woman and girls in Afghanistan. She also has called for an 
international tribunal to investigate claims of rape as a tool of 
terror and oppression against women in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The physicians' report said the health of Afghan women and girls  
has worsened in the past year with the addition of new 
restrictions. Foreign humanitarian groups have been expelled from 
the country and the government has closed the few health care 
facilities that had been open to women, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Make Room in Sky for 650-Seat Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the 1970s, young children would stand in  
fields near O'Hare airport in Chicago, watching a new aerial 
behemoth -- the Boeing 747 -- head in for a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	A jet now under design by Airbus Industrie, the world's second  
biggest aircraft maker, would dwarf the 747's capacity, while 
offering features normally found on cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus hasn't signed off on building the plane, but on Tuesday a  
top company executive announced that 600 people are working on 
plans for the $10 billion project, and he sounded committed to 
seeing the plane built. 
</P>
<P>
	The A-3XX, which does not yet have a complete name, would have  
an upper deck running from its cockpit to its tail, allowing it to 
seat from 550 to 650 passengers. That's up to 200 more than the 
Boeing 747, now the largest commercial plane in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The two stories also would open up a range of possibilities not  
fully enjoyed in commercial aircraft, including the installation of 
a gym, shops and sleeping berths. Those amenities would be 
important distractions on the plane's target routes, longhaul trips 
across the Pacific Ocean and throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airline productivity jumped in 1970 with the arrival of the  
Boeing 747 -- more than twice the size of its predecessor,'' Jack 
Schofield, chairman and CEO of Airbus Industrie of North America, 
told the Aero Club of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has now come for a new, larger plane to pick up the  
pace of progress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus' chief rival, the Seattle-based Boeing Co., considers the  
A-3XX a potential white elephant, costly enough to sink a company. 
On Monday, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit told shareholders at the 
company's annual meeting that Boeing has no plans for a 600-seat 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there is a market that is big enough to support  
the development of a very large airplane,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Boeing continues work on two new versions of  
its 747-400: One that would extend the plane's range to about 8,000 
nautical miles, an increase of 600 miles, and another that would 
increase the passenger capacity from about 420 to over 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A trade publication, Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology, also  
published drawings this week of a potential Boeing ultra-widebody, 
a three-aisle jumbo jet that would seat up to 550 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Schofield, the Airbus executive, said he is not surprised Boeing  
says there is no demand to replace 747. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a family and you want to protect it, because the only  
other option is to spend money to develop a new plane,'' he said. 
``We, on the other hand, don't have a `queen of the sky' -- yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear when Airbus will have its rival aircraft.  
Development of the A-3XX has been slowed by the Asian financial 
crisis, which has pushed the possible rollout date from 2003 to 
2005. Nonetheless, Schofield said Airbus has over 600 people 
working on the project full time, and chances are good the company 
will announce early next year that it is forging ahead with its 
design. 
</P>
<P>
	The A-3XX tries to address a capacity problem in global  
aviation. The number of airline passengers is growing by about 5 
percent annually, and analysts project that world air traffic will 
double in 15 years and triple in 22. Government officials predict 
that the number of annual air travelers in the United States alone 
will increase from about 600 million to over 1 billion by 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``superjet'' has its drawbacks, however. One is that it could  
overwhelm an airport, dumping 650 people -- and their luggage -- at 
once on a system that can have trouble handling the baggage from 
tiny commuter planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is safety: The Federal Aviation Administration  
requires that a plane be evacuated within 90 seconds even if half 
of its exits are blocked. That could be a daunting challenge for a 
plane seating the equivalent of a crowded movie theater.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Losses Triple in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Losses for Amazon.com Inc. more than tripled in  
the first quarter, but sales surged as the Internet merchant worked 
to grow a base of loyal customers and give them more things to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company reported Wednesday a net loss of $36.4  
million, or 23 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, 
compared with a net loss of $10.4 million, or 7 cents a share, in 
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $293.6 million, an increase of 236  
percent over sales of $87.4 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations  
for a loss of 29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was an outstanding quarter. By just about every  
measure I track, they exceeded my expectations by a fairly 
significant margin,'' said analyst Derek Brown at Volpe Brown 
Whelan. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Amazon.com has yet to make a profit as it  
spends freely to advertise its site, expand its offerings and build 
itself into a diversified online shopping hub. 
</P>
<P>
	It is already the Internet's top seller of books, music and  
video. In recent months it has expanded into auctions, greeting 
cards and has invested in the online pharmacy drugstore.com and 
Internet pet store Pets.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Weinstein, an analyst at Pacific Crest Capital, said he  
was not especially worried about Amazon.com's continuing losses. 
The company has to spend heavily now to cement its presence on the 
Web and to establish itself as a leading brand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are expanding into a lot of new businesses, and all of  
the businesses they are looking at have tremendous opportunities,'' 
Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer, said more  
spending is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have begun and will continue to build out, a significant  
distribution infrastructure,'' Bezos said. ``This will give 
customers greater availability, faster shipping times and even 
better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also continue to invest in systems, people, and  
product expansion, each of which helps us better serve customers. 
For the rest of 1999, we expect to invest more heavily than we have 
in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Brown said Amazon.com is only spending about $10-$15 to  
bring in each new customer. And Bezos said that more than 66 
percent of the orders in the most-recent quarter were from repeat 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's basically happening is Amazon is acquiring customers  
extremely cost-effectively, then they are bringing those customers 
back through their doors at ever-increasing rates,'' Brown said. 
``And not only are they bringing them back through the doors again, 
they are providing them with a broader range of products to 
purchase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting for merger- and acquisition-related costs of $25.3  
million in the first-quarter, Amazon's net loss for the quarter was 
$61.7 million, or 39 cents a share.

<HEADLINE>  3 Teens Eyed in Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man in charge of the Columbine High  
School shooting investigation expressed suspicions about three 
teens who knew the gunmen and waited outside during the massacre. 
He also said ``the entire carnage'' in the school cafeteria was 
captured on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in combat fatigues,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John  
Stone said, referring to the three young men. ``They said they 
heard it on the radio. Well, it wasn't on the radio at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone declined to name the three teens, who have been questioned  
but not formally named as suspects in the April 20 rampage that 
left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are subjects of our investigation,'' Stone told The  
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``We'll be going back to talk to these 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marine Corps officials said 18-year-old gunman Eric  
Harris had tried to enlist but was told during an April 15 home 
visit from a recruiter that he had been rejected for medical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disclosed at that time that he had a medical  
disqualification,'' Marines spokesman 1st Lt. Jeff Sammons said in 
today's Denver Post. Harris' attempt to enlist began after he was 
contacted in a routine recruiting call April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines refused to discuss the medical reason, but a Harris  
family friend, Victor Good, told The New York Times that the teen 
had been taking psychiatric medicine -- a potentially disqualifying 
factor -- and seeing a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Stone for the first time laid out a timeline for the  
attack at the Littleton school. He also said a school surveillance 
camera filmed the bloody scene in the cafeteria, where no one died 
but wounded students were found strewn about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference called after Stone made his comments to the  
AP, the sheriff objected to the emphasis of the story without 
disputing most of his earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not recall using the word ``subjects'' and that  
no individual was the focus of the investigation. He also said he 
didn't recall telling the AP that the three were among his ``best 
leads'' into a possible conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if investigators had cleared the three teens,  
Stone said: ``In my mind, it has not been put to rest nor have my 
investigators communicated back to me that these people are totally 
clear of any suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 classmates and a teacher  
before turning their guns on themselves. In a field outside, the 
three young men in dark jackets and combat-style boots were stopped 
by deputies as television cameras broadcast the scene nationwide. 
They were frisked and taken off for interrogation. They carried no 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he has questioned for days whether the gunmen acted  
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much stuff in there,'' he said. ``You can't walk  
in there blazing with more stuff than you can carry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men, who Stone said knew the gunmen and had  
previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' have 
maintained their innocence. Investigators tested them for gun 
residue after the shootings and found no evidence that they had 
fired guns. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas told the AP that while the sheriff  
may have stronger suspicions about the three men than other 
authorities, investigators have been interested in the trio since 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're among a group of people who we think have  
information,'' Thomas said. ``Are they people we believe have 
information about this? You bet. We have said that since day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	All three claimed to have heard of the slayings on the radio --  
and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released, Stone said. He said one had been expelled from Columbine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson said the three didn't know the gunmen, telling the  
News they ``were just three punks with a lot of curiosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at Akard's home late Tuesday  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the surveillance camera, the sheriff said it captured  
Harris and Klebold as they hurled homemade bombs and opened fire on 
terrified students in the cafeteria. Authorities have sent the 
tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously had not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also said the two gunmen initially tried to escape  
through three separate exits, and killed themselves only after 
being turned back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a 
diary seized at the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen 
planned to fly to Mexico or another country if they could escape, 
and kill themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a diary 
that investigators have characterized as a sheaf of papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were also held 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have questioned Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend,  
who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and Harris. 
Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns were to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, an employee at a Hugh M. Woods store in  
Littleton, told investigators he saw Harris and Klebold buy propane 
tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- material believed used 
in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he copied keys marked ``Do Not Duplicate'' for the  
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they are searching for a missing set of keys to  
the school, which authorities speculate may have allowed the 
killers to carry bombs inside before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I duplicated some keys for them, two sets of keys. On the keys  
it said ``Do Not Duplicate,''' Sowell told the Post. ``They brought 
in a set of five keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell said he copied the keys because ``after a while, you get  
to know the schools and you know it's common for teachers to do 
that, so you don't check on them.''

<HEADLINE> NY Cops Arrested in Brothel Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two police officers were indicted Tuesday and  
two have pleaded guilty to charges they accepted sexual favors and 
a place to nap as bribes to let a brothel operate in their 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Buscarino, 34, and James Gombach, 37, face charges of  
promoting prostitution, receiving bribes, misconduct and falsifying 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	They were released without posting bail, suspended and face a  
hearing May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other officers, Lawrence Levine and James Trout, pleaded  
guilty earlier this month to taking bribes and resigned. 
Prosecutors wouldn't say whether they were promised specific 
sentences for their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	All four officers had a relationship with the madam who ran the  
brothel in central Manhattan -- home to some of the city's most 
famous areas, including Times Square and the theater district, 
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers alerted the madam to planned raids and failed to  
file reports about the brothel's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Buscarino and Gombach were assigned to desk jobs since  
disclosures last July that two dozen cops protected the brothel in 
exchange for sex and a spot to goof off or sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	As a reward, Morgenthau said, the madam gave the defendants  
thousands of dollars in cash, gifts including airline tickets and 
jewelry, and the sexual services of the brothel's prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other 20 officers have been charged.

<HEADLINE> Salvaged Architecture Goes On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When urban renewal came to Boston in the 1950s and  
'60s, no one cared much about the decorative bas-reliefs, fountains 
and Greek Revival columns that were left for the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
	No one except Jorge Epstein, a Boston jeweler and scavenger who  
rescued enough of the city's architectural heritage to fill a bus 
barn and factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, five months after Epstein's death at 85, the mammoth  
collection of salvaged architecture is being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	A tag sale of a million items -- including fireplace mantels,  
leaded glass windows, plaster ornaments -- begins Thursday at the 
factory, which came to be known as Old Mansions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, workers feverishly stacked wrought iron fences,  
Victorian doors, Greek Revival columns and dusty old paintings in 
anticipation of the hordes expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole place makes your eyes pop,'' said Mary Westcott, an  
associate at Kaminski Auctioneers, which is liquidating the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is expected to take about five months.  
</P>
<P>
	Only a small percentage of the collection had been priced. A  
pine lintel from a Colonial home was marked $300. Four 
black-and-silver art deco cornices were priced at $75 apiece. A 
framed watercolor by an unknown artist had a sticker with $175 
scrawled on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't see how people couldn't save the stuff,'' said his  
son, Norman Epstein, standing next to a dusty stack of books 
containing municipal records that hadn't been moved from its perch 
at Old Mansions in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we started taking stuff,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And selling it.  
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Epstein sold the Brooklyn Museum of Art its Sculpture  
Garden. He sold a Colonial tavern to the Smithsonian Institute. He 
sold a sermon preached before John Hancock on the first day of 
American independence at auction through Christie's auction house, 
his son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some things he couldn't stand to sell -- like rare books.  
</P>
<P>
	Other things he gave away, like bottles of 1947 Chateau  
Lafitte-Rothschild, part of the wine cellar he bought at auction 
for $50 from the Weston estate of William Blake, Thomas Edison's 
business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Mavodones, who is handling rare books and ephemera, said he  
almost threw out a dirty, dusty box filled with junk the other day. 
At the bottom of the box he found an original signature of Booker 
T. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had people who jumped up and down when they saw this  
stuff,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines Dominate Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks responded quickly last week  
to the public hunger for news about the Colorado school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Six prime-time newsmagazines, each one with reports on the  
Littleton shooting, were among the 12 most-watched programs 
measured by Nielsen Media Research during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``20/20'' on April 21 had more viewers than any other  
newsmagazine, and had its highest ratings of the year except for 
the Monica Lewinsky interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, CBS's ``48 Hours'' beat NBC's ``ER'' in the  
ratings, although last Thursday's medical drama was a rerun. CBS 
faced criticism, however, for not responding to the Littleton story 
in prime-time as fast as its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, viewership was down for the networks as they geared up  
for the May ratings ``sweeps'' period. CBS won the week with an 8.4 
rating and 14 share, NBC was second with an 8.1 rating and 14 
share, ABC had a 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.1 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.8 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular show of the week was a new episode of NBC's  
comedy, ``Friends.'' ABC's drama, ``The Practice,'' had its second 
highest rating in the history of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' did well during a busy news week, scoring  
its largest margin of victory over the ``CBS Evening News'' in more 
than two years. NBC had an 8.2 rating and 18 share, while CBS was 
at 6.5 and 14. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with a 7.9 
rating and 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 19-25, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.4; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 
12.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.1; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and 
Order,'' NBC, 11.8; ``Dateline NBC-Friday,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Dateline 
NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 11.6; ``48 Hours,'' CBS, 11.0.

<HEADLINE>  Foreman Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George Foreman testified Wednesday before a  
federal grand jury said to be investigating whether the IBF sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was in the grand jury room for  
less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	On the advice of his lawyer, Foreman would not discuss his  
testimony. But asked if he had ever paid a kickback, he said, 
``No,'' and also said this was his first appearance before any 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Lawrence H. Wechsler, would not comment either, but  
he has said federal prosecutors are examining whether Foreman was 
extorted by sanctioning groups, and that he did not know if Foreman 
ever paid to better his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	In past weeks, the grand jury has heard from officials of the  
New Jersey-based IBF, one of the world's three major sanctioning 
organizations. It does not appear that its president, Robert W. Lee 
Sr., has testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman did discuss with the media the need to reform boxing and  
the sanctioning groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that boxing should be given some time to clean up its  
act. If not someone should do it for them,'' Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although inactive in the ring for several years, Foreman -- who  
recently turned 50 -- also said he wants to fight the man he 
considers the heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to keep coming back until I'm a grandfather and  
boxing is a sport as clean as pingpong,'' said Foreman, who later 
playfully sparred with news photographers outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	At 45, Foreman captured the IBF and WBA championships to become  
the oldest champion in any weight class, and now boasts a record of 
76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury earlier this month heard from the boxing judge  
criticized for her scoring in last month's Evander Holyfield-Lennox 
Lewis title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams told the grand jury that no one attempted to  
sway her decision, her lawyer has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman had his opinion. He said, ``I think Lewis won the fight  
hands down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it was not the first robbery the sport has seen, and  
claimed his defeat in 1974 by Muhammad Ali in Zaire should be a 
prime example. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the Holyfield-Lewis fight created an  
opportunity for improvements, including having the sanctioning 
groups adopt guidelines on how they set rankings, Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, its attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, decline to  
comment on the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: the ACM Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Jo Dee Messina fanned  
herself with her hand and fluttered her eyelids, doing a send-up of 
the classic Southern belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Messina, a Yankee from Massachusetts, was expressing her joy at  
receiving three nominations at this year's Academy of Country Music 
Awards, including best new female vocalist, best female vocalist 
and best album for ``I'm Alright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The cool part is I get to sit on the ballot next to Faith  
Hill, Martina McBride, and all those people I love,'' the 
28-year-old singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACM Awards show airs May 5 on CBS from 8-11 p.m. EDT from  
the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City, Calif. Nominees for 
best entertainer are Garth Brooks, the duo Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Tim 
McGraw, George Strait and Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith Hill leads all nominees with six. In addition to best  
female vocalist, she's up for best album for ``Faith''; song, 
single and video for ``This Kiss''; and best vocal event for her 
duet with husband Tim McGraw, ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love 
Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country music artist of the decade will be announced during  
the show. Previous winners were Marty Robbins for the 1960s, 
Loretta Lynn for the 1970s and Alabama for the 1980s. The smart 
money is on Garth Brooks for the 1990s, but Gene Weed, the show's 
producer, says George Strait and Reba McEntire also are strong 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Messina's nominations cap a remarkable comeback for the country  
singer, who broke through in 1996 with two top 10 hits -- ``Heads 
Carolina, Tails California'' and ``You're Not in Kansas Anymore'' -- 
from her debut album, ``Jo Dee Messina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She leased a bus, hired a band and hit the road after her debut.  
But expenses often ran higher than her paychecks. Then the release 
of a new album was delayed when Messina and her producers had 
trouble finding songs they thought could be hits. Bookings dried up 
and things became desperate. ``I owed everybody money. It was 
gross. I was so overwhelmed,'' Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Help from her record label, a local bank and a small endorsement  
deal with a trucking company got her through the end of last year. 
And ``Bye Bye,'' the first single from ``I'm Alright,'' went 
straight to No. 1. The album has already sold a million copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACM Awards is the first of three country music awards shows  
telecast each year. The fan-voted TNN Music City News Awards follow 
in June on The Nashville Network, and the Country Music Association 
hands out trophies in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Many Films Show Substance Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marijuana, martinis and Marlboros. They're  
shown on the big screen and mentioned in popular songs blaring into 
the ears of young people. Now the government wants to know if that 
encourages America's youth to use and abuse them. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. drug officials released results of a study today that says  
people were depicted doing drugs, drinking or smoking in 98 percent 
of the top movie rentals and 27 percent of the most popular songs 
in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Human  
Services and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, revealed 
that of 669 major adult characters featured in the movies, 5 
percent used illicit drugs, 25 percent smoked tobacco and 65 
percent consumed alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs were associated with wealth or luxury in 20 percent of the  
songs, with sexual activity in 30 percent and with crime or 
violence in 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent messages in movies and music have surfaced in  
discussions about what influenced two teen-agers to walk into their 
high school in Littleton, Colo., last week and shoot 12 classmates 
and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As President Clinton proposed gun-control legislation Tuesday,  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about the school shooting 
and how children become desensitized and lose empathy for human 
life when their culture glorifies violence in music, movies and 
television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said: ``It will take more than strong leadership from  
the media and entertainment world to stop the culture of violence 
that surrounds our children. Kids need more caring, responsible 
adults in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, four members of Congress wrote a letter to ask  
Clinton to convene an emergency summit meeting at the White House 
with the leaders of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, signed by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and John  
McCain, R-Ariz., and Reps. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Dan Burton, 
R-Ind., said school violence is a complicated issue, but ``we 
believe that media violence is contributing to this problem and we 
need the help of the entertainment community to solve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., cited the school  
shootings when he introduced a bill that would let the TV industry 
air violent shows only at times when children aren't likely to be 
watching. Neither the National Association of Broadcasters nor the 
National Cable Television Association had immediate comment on the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America also  
declined immediate comment until it had time to review the new 
study about how drugs, tobacco and alcohol are depicted in 200 
movies and 1,000 songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--93 percent of the movies showed alcohol use, 89 percent  
portrayed tobacco use and 22 percent portrayed characters using 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--17 percent of the songs included lyrics about people drinking  
alcohol, 18 percent using drugs and 3 percent smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	--About a fourth of the movies that depicted drugs contained  
explicit, graphic portrayals of their preparation or ingestion. 
</P>
<P>
	--15 percent of movies portrayed substance abuse by characters  
who appeared to be younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only five of the movies were free of substance use.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- It's gotten ugly for the Los Angeles  
Lakers recently. And they find themselves with very little time to 
get things right before the playoffs begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't played very good basketball lately,'' forward Rick  
Fox understated Tuesday on the heels of two horrendous performances 
in Texas. ``Are we capable of changing that? Yeah, I'd like to 
think we're a team capable of changing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done the talking before. That's enough talk.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reached the Western Conference finals last spring,  
and were considered prime contenders to succeed the Michael 
Jordan-led Chicago Bulls as NBA champions before the start of the 
abbreviated 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, they were anointed the league's glamour team,  
as evidenced by their many games on national television -- far more 
than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	However, just about everything that could go wrong has, and now  
the Lakers have just the fifth-best record in the West with only 
four games left before the playoffs begin May 8. 
</P>
<P>
	--Coach Del Harris was fired after three straight losses dropped  
the team to 6-6 in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eccentric seven-time NBA rebounding champion Dennis Rodman was  
brought in to help on defense and on the backboards, and while he 
did help at times, he also created several disruptions. He was 
waived April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sharpshooter Glen Rice and J.R. Reid were acquired from  
Charlotte for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell just before the trade 
deadline seven weeks ago, and it's been an ill-fated deal to this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers certainly saved their worst for the last 2 1/2 weeks,  
losing six of eight games, including the last three. The six losses 
came by an average of 17 points, including a 108-81 embarrassment 
at San Antonio on Saturday night and a 102-80 humiliation at 
Houston on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The team spent nearly 2 1/2 hours behind closed doors Tuesday  
before practicing for about 70 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meetings and film, that's what went on,'' Lakers coach Kurt  
Rambis said. ``We hashed out some things as a team. The whole idea 
was to get everybody on the same page. There were some frustrations 
that were aired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis wouldn't know about all of those frustrations, because a  
players-only meeting was held, as well as an overall team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't heated,'' Kobe Bryant said of the players-only  
get-together, which he said lasted about 45 minutes. ``We were 
trying to figure out what happened, why we started spiraling 
downward, how we got to this point, how we're going to get out of 
this. It wasn't pointing fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis admitted after the game in Houston that his team didn't  
play hard. On Tuesday, he added that a lot of the problems ``come 
from within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have a tendency to play harder when you feel a  
responsibility to the team,'' he said. ``When individuals accept 
that, they play beyond their expectations, because they don't want 
to let their teammates down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports of friction between center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's No. 2 scorer, and Bryant, who ranks 15th in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to regroup,'' was one of the few things O'Neal  
told reporters Tuesday. ``I'm glad we're the underdog. You 
(reporters) counted us out about four weeks ago, you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Bryant, who shot just 3-for-14 at Houston, said  
he didn't believe the Lakers were a team in turmoil, and claimed 
the reported problems with O'Neal were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know him that well off the court,'' Bryant said. ``Our  
relationship on the court, it's very, very fine. We're constantly 
communicating on the court. It's really not that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said the two haven't had a talk about things.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, for what? Our relationship is great on the basketball  
court, and it's only going to get better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal recently told reporters: ``You know the real problem,  
you're just scared to write about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later told CBS Sportsline: ``What is this, an experiment?  
Nobody waited for me when I came into the league. ... I'm not going 
to be here that long that I want to wait years for (Bryant) to 
figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Lakers have been losing, Bryant said,  
``There's a lot of different reasons, not just one particular 
reason. I really don't want to get into it. A true team keeps 
things like that to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said he's optimistic, regardless of what's happened  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if we lose by 40,'' he said. ``I always feel we  
can bounce back.''

<HEADLINE>  Police Link Girlfriend to 3 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities on Wednesday further linked  
an 18-year-old student to the Columbine High School gunmen, saying 
she bought three of the four guns used in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had said gunman Dylan Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn  
Anderson, purchased two of the weapons. On Wednesday, they 
confirmed she bought three -- two shotguns and a rifle -- last fall. 
A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun used in the attack has not yet 
been traced. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
said. ``Did she supply the weapons to them with some idea of what 
they were planning to do with them? That's still one of the major 
things we want to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have repeatedly said Ms. Anderson is considered a  
witness and not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also reaffirmed that three young men detained near the  
school shortly after the April 20 attack had been cleared of any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the  
three youths, who were handcuffed by a SWAT team near the school, 
were ``subjects of our investigation'' and that he was suspicious 
of comments they made during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Wednesday, however, that the three have been  
eliminated as suspects and added that the sheriff had outdated 
information when he made his comments to the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under  
black trench coats, killed 12 classmates and a teacher before 
turning their guns on themselves. They also wounded 23 people and 
planted more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. 
Diaries show the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 75 detectives and crime scene experts are pursuing  
more than 600 leads, but only ``some are very good leads that may 
percolate to the top of the list,'' said another sheriff's 
spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the medical problem cited by the Marines when they  
rejected Harris just five days before the attack. Those close to 
the family have said the Columbine senior was seeing a psychiatrist 
and taking psychiatric medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, the son of a retired Air Force officer, was told by a  
recruiter visiting his suburban home on April 15 that he had been 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disqualified because of a medical prescription,'' said  
Sgt. Marc Ayalin, a Marine spokesman. He declined to identify the 
medication or the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle last  
fall, after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at 
least one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 
years of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told the AP that the FBI has  
enhanced a surveillance videotape of the cafeteria, where several 
students were wounded during the rampage. The tape was returned to 
Colorado for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men cleared by investigators may have belonged  
to the gunmen's social circle known as the Trenchcoat Mafia, Stone 
said. The teens deny it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. However, producers for 
the ``Sally Jesse Raphael'' program identified them as Matt Nalty, 
Matt Akard and Jim Brunetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunetti said on the TV show, which was taped Tuesday and is  
scheduled to air Thursday, that the three were held for an hour and 
questioned about whether they knew the Trenchcoat Mafia. ``We've 
never heard of them, before that day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, families continued to bury victims of the massacre.  
</P>
<P>
	One thousand people gathered at Trinity Christian Center to  
remember Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old who dreamed of becoming a 
Navy fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waterford, Wis., 450 people gathered at United Methodist  
Church to bury John Tomlin, 16, in a green-and-gold casket -- the 
colors of his beloved Green Bay Packers. His family moved from 
Wisconsin to Colorado four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County school system planned to hold a memorial on  
Sunday at Red Rocks Amphitheater in nearby Morrison.

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Ask For More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Paula Jones asked today for  
additional time to calculate expenses that President Clinton must 
pay for his false testimony in her sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Campbell, the lead attorney for much of Mrs. Jones' legal  
case, asked U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright to extend to 
May 7 a May 3 deadline for submitting the costs. The judge ordered 
the payments when she held Clinton in civil contempt for his 
deposition testimony in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the delay was necessary because of other court  
cases and vacation schedules in his Dallas law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright on April 12 found that Clinton gave ``intentionally  
false'' testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, 
imposing a judicial rebuke on a president for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the president to pay ``any reasonable expenses  
including attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to obey 
this court's discovery orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ordered the president to pay $1,202 as  
reimbursement for the judge's travel to Washington in the case, and 
set in motion a process that could strip Clinton of his Arkansas 
law license.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Intel Worker Loses E-Mail Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- A judge ordered a disgruntled former employee  
who bombarded Intel Corp. workers with company-bashing electronic 
mail from sending any more of the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came Tuesday in the case of Ken Hamidi, 51, of Citrus  
Heights, an Intel Corp. engineer fired in 1995 over unresolved 
claims of job-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi started a group called Former and Current  
Employees-Intel, known as Face-Intel, devoted to proving that Intel 
mistreats its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, a Santa Clara-based producer of microprocessors, says the  
stories posted on Face-Intel's Web site -- such as blaming Intel for 
one worker's suicide and accusing the company of running a 
sweatshop in Malaysia -- are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi also has waged a direct e-mail campaign, sending Intel  
employees messages seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento Superior Court Judge John R. Lewis granted Intel's  
request that Hamidi be barred from sending electronic missives to 
its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company argued that Hamidi's e-mails, sent on separate  
occasions to as many as 30,000 Intel employees, were the equivalent 
of trespassing on the company's private computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mere connection of Intel's e-mail system with the Internet  
does not convert it into a public forum,'' the judge wrote. ``The 
court finds that Hamidi's e-mails are not protected speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel vs. Ken Hamidi case gained national attention among  
First Amendment advocates. Some fear the ruling could significantly 
restrict the freedom to send e-mail to specific groups of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi said he plans to appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Can Bradley Give Gore a Race? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- In his uphill campaign against Al Gore for  
the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley is picking up 
a bit of what politicians call ``traction.'' He's getting more 
attention than seemed likely a short time ago and even Gore 
advisers say he has made the race competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the guy everywhere,'' says Iowa Democratic Chairman Rob  
Tully. ``He's able to fly under the radar screen better than the 
vice president can. I think he's going to make it a spirited 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore loyalists dismiss the phenomenon as nothing more than ``the  
Bradley boomlet,'' a label applied by one of them, Chicago 
political consultant David Axelrod. They see it as a brief and 
media-driven frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Axelrod conceded that Bradley ``is going to be  
competitive. I've always felt that Bradley had the potential to 
make some noise in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator is getting a new look from  
liberals and those who worry that Gore is too cautious; last week, 
liberal Paul Wellstone of Minnesota became the first senator to 
endorse Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Tully said he's been traveling the state and keeps crossing  
paths with Bradley, who is quietly building a network, making 
low-key, grassroots appearances in the important early states. 
While he can't match Gore's blue-chip roster of backers, he can 
spend hours rubbing shoulders in places like Iowa and New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly aware of that, Gore has picked up the pace of his  
campaign, beefing up his schedule and refocusing his style. He's 
paying attention to rubbing shoulders with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday, Gore waved off the prospect of a  
Bradley threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fully aware of how campaigns evolve over time,'' said  
Gore. ``Some who haven't been through these things before sometimes 
misinterpret the snapshots of the moment and don't see the moving 
picture of the entire campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very comfortable with where things are,'' he added.  
``I'll let others analyze the opposition. I don't have any unkind 
words for the opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some say it was inevitable that the race would turn competitive,  
even though Gore has the backing of virtually all of the Democratic 
establishment and access to the White House political network. 
</P>
<P>
	History is on his side, too. A sitting vice president hasn't  
been denied the nomination since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think there's an inevitability of the Democratic  
nominating process, which is people like competition and they like 
having a real race,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant in 
California who advises Gore. ``And they're more inclined to be for 
outsiders and insurgents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have picked up on that. They are keeping a closer  
eye on Bradley and have begun including questions about him in 
their polling. Gore aides dismiss that as a GOP effort to hurt Gore 
by building up his rival. 
</P>
<P>
	But some recent polls show Bradley as close as 20 points to  
Gore, half the gap of earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential  
nominating season, Bradley aides say his crowds have been big. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a natural advantage in this process,'' said Iowa's  
Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack. ``He can spend more time and the time 
he spends is more personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack describes himself as ``friendly'' to Bradley's effort,  
hastening to add: ``I like both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has faced challenges. A bombing campaign in  
Yugoslavia and President Clinton's affair with a White House intern 
and brush with impeachment have made it tough for Gore to break out 
on his own. There have been complaints that Gore relies too heavily 
on a tight inner circle, few of whom have presidential campaign 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all that, Gore has huge assets.  
</P>
<P>
	Axelrod said Gore has two national campaigns under his belt and  
the weight of the party's establishment behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``At these early stages, Bradley is going to wear well, but  
later on it's going to be tough,'' Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana Strother, a nonaligned Democratic strategist, dismissed  
Bradley's early fund-raising success, arguing that raising about $5 
million amounts to tapping a few friends. That's pocket change 
compared with the other $25 million Bradley must raise to be 
competitive, Strother said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley says he has big ideas,'' said Strother. ``But let  
me tell you, big money will beat big ideas.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Accused of Betraying Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Olympic leaders betrayed athletes,  
sponsors and the public in the Salt Lake bribery scandal, a senior 
IOC official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with corporate backers of the 2000 Games in Sydney,  
International Olympic Committee vice president Jacques Rogge said 
the committee must accept ``collective guilt'' for the damage 
caused by the worst corruption case in its 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a member of the IOC, I have to express my apologies for the  
wrongdoings that have been made by the IOC,'' Rogge said at the 
start of the first visit to Sydney by a top-level IOC official 
since the scandal broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very sorry, because we have betrayed the athletes whom  
we represent and for whom we are working, we have betrayed the 
sponsors, we have betrayed public opinion, we have betrayed the 
organizers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge told the sponsors that there would be ``leaner, meaner''  
IOC by the time the Sydney Olympics start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will deliver,'' Rogge said. ``We can reassure them that we  
will have in Sydney the best-ever Olympic Games and they will have 
legitimate returns on their investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, chairman of the IOC's coordination commission for the  
2000 Games that is visiting Sydney this week, said the sponsors 
were critical of the IOC and concerned about damage the scandal has 
caused to the Sydney budget and Olympic marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games announced  
last week it would cut its expected revenue from sponsors by $32 
million. With other cuts, SOCOG said, the overall budget had been 
reduced by $48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight blamed the sponsorship shortfall  
on the IOC scandal and said some services would have to be cut, but 
that the overall quality of the games would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC recognized the scandal created a ``difficult  
climate'' for attracting new sponsors, but said it was just one of 
the reasons for the budget gap and rejected suggestions the IOC 
should pay for the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian official said Sydney's sponsorship target was  
``ambitious'' to start with, and a shortfall -- blamed on the Asian 
financial crisis -- had been identified before the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking our part of the responsibility, but it is not  
the only cause,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that the SOCOG budget still projected a surplus.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal,  
which involved a million-dollar scheme to buy votes in Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday, but  
rose against the euro as the conflict continued in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.22  
Japanese yen, down from 120.40 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell 
against the dollar, trading at $1.0627, down from $1.0660. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar dropped two yen during Asian trading as the chairman  
of the Japanese government's tax commission recommended a 15 
trillion yen supplemental budget, including 5 trillion yen in tax 
cuts and credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is fighting its worst recession in decades partly through  
public works spending and such a recommendation was seen as a major 
initiative to stimulate the economy. Further rumors helped spur the 
yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big mover in the past 24 hours has been the yen,'' said  
Ben Strauss, a vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Julius 
Baer &AMP; Co. ``Everytime we see the concept raised, the yen 
rallies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally ended when Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said the plan  
was not under consideration. But traders failed to retake the 
dollar's ground against the yen despite trying through the European 
and North American trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many investors stayed away from the markets ahead  
of Japan's ``Golden Week'' holidays. Japanese financial markets 
will be closed Thursday and the first three days of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5122 Swiss francs, up from 1.5074,  
and 1.4783 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4793 late Tuesday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6137, down from $1.6179. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8406 German 
marks, up from 1.8349; 6.1728 French francs, up from 6.1538, and 
1,821.49 Italian lire, up from 1,814.88.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Backup QB Charged With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers backup  
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller proclaimed his innocence Wednesday 
after being booked on a charge that he raped a Virginia Tech 
student during a visit to his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent and that's all I've got to say right now,'' the  
6-foot-4, 240-pound Druckenmiller said as he left the Montgomery 
County jail after his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, the Hokies' quarterback at the height of their  
football success, was released on a $10,000 secured bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ray Grubbs scheduled a jury trial for July 19.  
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is accused of raping the student on March 4  
between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at a house during a visit to Blacksburg. 
The woman testified before a grand jury on April 13 and the 
indictment was unsealed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Bev Davis of Radford said Druckenmiller wants  
to get the trial out of the way before the 49ers training camp

	Davis said the woman and Druckenmiller were in a group that went  
to two Blacksburg bars on the night of March 3, then to the home of 
a Druckenmiller friend in Blacksburg, where the party continued 
into the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad judgment, but he's innocent,'' Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis and fellow defense attorney Deborah Caldwell-Bono of  
Roanoke said their client's accuser aggressively pursued him and 
had consensual sex with him on the night of the partying. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge has ``created havoc with his life and career,'' she  
said. ``He has been greatly surprised how easily these charges are 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller played in four games as a rookie, one as a  
starter, and completed 21 of 52 passes for 239 yards and one 
touchdown. But he also threw three interceptions, two inside the 
opponent's 20-yard line.

<HEADLINE> EU May Delay Aircraft Engine Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The European Union is expected to grant a  
one-year delay in imposing an aircraft engine rule that the United 
States contends will hurt American airlines and businesses, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rule would crack down on planes with engine  
mufflers known as hush kits. EU officials contend that while 
reducing noise pollution, the kits are ineffective at controlling 
air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Commerce Secretary  
William Daley said they had been told that the European Union 
Environmental Council would vote Thursday to delay implementation 
of the rule until May 1, 2000. It had been slated to take effect 
April 1, but EU officials previously accepted a one-month 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials in Washington did not return calls Wednesday  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next year, U.S. officials hope to negotiate even  
stronger international standards for air and noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have our eye and focus on the long term, and you  
don't want to get into a situation where you are acting 
unilaterally,'' said Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Department officials had warned that the rule would  
devalue planes in the U.S. fleet. They are the primary user of hush 
kits, and are often resold in Europe. Also, the department said the 
rule would hurt hush-kit makers, all of them American companies.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Question Coaches' Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A $9,100 ``business'' trip to Las Vegas  
by Minnesota basketball coach Clem Haskins, three assistant coaches 
and their spouses is being questioned in an auditing review. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was ostensibly for a coaches' seminar, but a university  
auditor found no evidence that any such event took place, according 
to memos written earlier this year to top university officials, 
including President Mark Yudof. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches later told an auditor the trip was a postseason  
``debriefing'' but presented no documentation to support the claim, 
according to Gail Klatt, associate vice president in the 
university's department of auditing. Auditors concluded it wasn't a 
legitimate business expense under university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A booster group paid for the trip, and coaches stood to avoid  
income taxes on the gift by declaring that the travel was 
business-related, Klatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	When auditors raised questions, the coaches instructed  
university bookkeepers to change payroll records to add the value 
of the trip to their incomes, Klatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service and the university consider  
business travel a legitimate expense. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the trips have been approved by McKinley Boston,  
vice president for student development and athletics, and 
then-university President Nils Hasselmo, according to the audit 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	But the coaches could be taxed for the benefit, or the  
university could seek reimbursement because such expenditures for 
spousal travel aren't allowable under university policy, the review 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the audit were reported today by both the Saint Paul  
Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, who obtained the 
information through freedom-of-information requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The university already is investigating allegations from a  
former office manager who said she wrote or helped write more than 
400 papers for players on the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 trip also included an improper charge for a clothing  
purchase that totaled nearly $300 and could have charged to the 
university twice -- once by submitting an individual receipt and 
later when the same charge was included in the hotel bill that was 
repaid. Auditors also questioned whether $562 charged to the 
university for a golf event during the trip was proper. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings from the review made public Tuesday reveal that  
auditors found that men's athletic department officials kept no 
record of checks written on a bank account and didn't balance the 
bank statement for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit review also shows that basketball and hockey coaches  
and players routinely received more meal money than the university 
allowed, and that, despite rules forbidding the practice, coaches 
mentioned their university affiliation on at least four occasions 
in promotional brochures touting private camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches are not identified in her memo, but Klatt identified  
one as Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' attorney, Ron Zamanksy, had no comment on the trip or  
the audit findings. Yudof's office referred all questions to his 
chief of staff, Tonya Moten Brown, who said the university 
president is aware of the problem and plans to address it.

<HEADLINE> What Does TV Tell Us About Violence? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By sheer coincidence, National TV-Turnoff Week  
for 1999 began just two days after last week's massacre in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	This is worth noting for a couple of reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	First: TV, of course, is among the usual suspects whenever an  
atrocity occurs within our borders. This time is no different and, 
for many of us, the carnage at Columbine High School only 
reconfirms our worst thoughts about TV's virulence. 
</P>
<P>
	Second: This kind of news story -- two teen-agers opening fire in  
their school, slaughtering 13 others before taking their own lives 
-- is uniquely suited to television coverage, and lots of it. Who 
could have turned off the TV -- TV-Turnoff Week or not -- in this 
tragedy's televised aftermath? 
</P>
<P>
	Part of what keeps us tuned in is our shock at the killings'  
senselessness. But accompanying our shock is grim familiarity. For 
the umpteenth time, we embrace human tragedy as media spectacle; we 
ache for Littleton's victims and mourners, with whom, for the 
moment, we connect. 
</P>
<P>
	Then we go to a commercial.  
</P>
<P>
	``Feeling down, overwhelmed?'' asks an actor we know from his  
role as a doctor, on an ad that ran during ``20/20'' and ``Dateline 
NBC.'' The actor pitches a product ``to help you lift your spirits 
and look on the bright side, naturally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial over, we watch sages running in place as they  
face timeworn questions like: Why do awful things like this keep 
happening? How do we stop them? What's wrong with this country? 
And, of course: What can we blame? 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of potential culprits. TV and rock music. Video  
games, movies and the Internet. Easy-to-get guns. The schools. A 
lack of values. The wrong values. 
</P>
<P>
	And out-of-touch parents.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack in Littleton has made us frightfully aware of how  
little we may know about our kids. It's estrangement assisted by 
TV, which directs programs and ads at specific age groups. Families 
are demographically fragmented under the same roof. Our kids, as 
members of a different marketing niche from our own, become 
literally none of our business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wake-up call,'' Tipper Gore told ``Meet the Press''  
moderator Tim Russert. ``We need to do a much better job of serving 
our kids in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But how can we expect a national consensus on the proper steps  
to take, when many of us are at odds on the issues, even with 
ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, what do we make of the new Fox animated comedy  
``Family Guy,'' whose cranky 1-year-old makes repeated attempts to 
kill his mother? Are toddler fantasies of matricide funny? Watching 
``Family Guy,'' we may think so ... yet also feel uneasy. But is 
``yes and no'' an answer we can live with? 
</P>
<P>
	And what can we conclude about last Thursday's edition of the  
``Fox Files'' newsmagazine? 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibiting a style hardly less rabid than the psychos it  
spotlighted, the report trumped up a question, ``Who ARE these mad 
bombers?'' Then it gave us the designed-to-spook reply: ``Ordinary 
people looking to settle a score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was a gruesome if lovingly compiled pastiche. Cars  
go up in flames. Bloody victims writhe on gurneys. Bomb makers 
chortle at their deadly skill. ``It only costs them $2 to make,'' 
the correspondent reminds us (as well as some disturbed kid with a 
grudge) -- ``but it could cost you your life!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially in the wake of the Littleton tragedy, this shameful  
12 minutes was to responsible journalism what Marilyn Manson is to 
Placido Domingo. Yet millions of us watched the show. And, 
presumably, some of us enjoyed it, whatever the depravity. 
</P>
<P>
	TV may well have earned its place in the culture of violence,  
and it may well share the blame for what happened in Littleton. But 
television programs, violent or otherwise, aren't really the point 
of TV-Turnoff Week, which ends tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television atomizes families and displaces social  
interactions,'' says Henry Labalme, executive director of TV-Free 
America, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	His primary issue with TV centers not on what we watch, but on  
what we don't do with our lives while we watch it. What TV-Free 
America prescribes is a redirection of our time and energies. 
</P>
<P>
	For those of us trying to make sense of what happened in  
Littleton, and hoping for a way to avert a reoccurrence, this might 
be a fitting strategy. Instead of looking at TV so much, we should 
look at ourselves. Maybe answers await us off the air and off-line, 
once our faulty connections in the real world are restored. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET': When detectives Falsone (Jon  
Seda) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) begin investigating the murder of a

<HEADLINE> Teaching, Counseling Juggled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At Palms Middle School in Los Angeles,  
seventh- and eighth-graders spend one English class period a week 
in Council, a conflict-resolution program where they work out 
differences that often lead to anger, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, teacher Denise Rockwell-Woods knows she must  
prepare children for tests on academic subjects that often are tied 
to promotions or graduation. But, she says, the weekly rap sessions 
are worth her time: ``I know it's saved kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burden of who's responsible for saving kids came full circle  
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where last week Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris shot 12 schoolmates and a teacher before 
turning the guns on themselves. Students claim teachers knew about 
vengeful videos the boys made last fall. School officials deny such 
videos were made. A parent blamed police for ignoring complaints 
against one gunman; the sheriff said the killers' parents should 
have known their sons planned an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, teachers are on the front lines. And despite threat  
of lawsuits from parents or students and a lack of money and time, 
teachers often take on the role of counselor at the expense of 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the best research shows the best influence (on  
children) is parental support,'' said Linda Rosenblatt, spokeswoman 
for the New York State United Teachers union. ``But if it's not 
there, we just can't roll over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key to preventing violence is not armed guards, but knowing  
individual children, said Mark Singer, a social work professor 
specializing in youth mental health at Case Western Reserve 
University. ``To that end teachers can be terrific. They can spot 
students who are alienated. They know which ones are being 
threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers are helped if classroom lessons are linked to such  
intervention, said Joe Provisor, an eighth-grade English teacher at 
Palms Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it is approved as part of our language arts-social  
studies curriculum, there's no question that it's going to 
happen,'' said Provisor, who coordinates the Council project. He 
argues that discussing hate and prejudice helps students understand 
wars or other events taught in social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
	But teachers note that students already miss math or reading  
lessons to attend anti-drug talks, divorced-parents counseling and 
anger-management classes that fill up the school day and give them 
less one-on-one time with students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the legislature mandates a new program, it impacts  
on how we can spend our time,'' said Rockwell-Woods, who teaches 
five daily computer classes of 25 students each. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problems are beyond their control anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	Children arrive at school with emotional issues, often deep,  
that no one else has addressed, said Linda Wheeler, director of 
Families and Schools Together, a project encouraging parental 
involvement in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a society, we are putting demands on the schools to take  
care of these issues rather than taking the responsibility we have 
as parents,'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers say they also need more help from school-based social  
workers and counselors, whom they outnumber by a large measure. On 
average, there's one teacher for every 17 students, but a guidance 
counselor for every 513 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking them (teachers) to spot the problems and do the  
follow-up,'' said Singer, ``and that's asking too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers also want strong policies to back up their efforts. In  
a survey of New York state teachers released last Thursday, nine in 
10 said their schools had strong conduct codes, but two-thirds said 
the schools weren't consistent in enforcing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every school should have a clear discipline code,'' said David  
Strom, legal counsel for the American Federation of Teachers union. 
``Kids want to push the envelope. It's important for them to know 
where the envelope ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few districts have enough alternative classes or schools for  
seriously troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't help the student when all that a teacher can say is  
go to the vice principal's office,'' said Jamie Horowitz, a 
spokesman for AFT. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he acknowledged, referrals can invite legal action -- a  
growing deterrent for teachers and schools trying to identify 
problem students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes us think twice,'' said Rockwell-Woods, who has taught  
26 years and believes parents and students today are much more 
likely to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	There are thousands of such lawsuits nationwide, said Julie  
Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards 
Association, based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Cabrillo, Calif., eighth-grader sued the district  
after being suspended for five days for his essays depicting a 
principal's murder. The case was later settled. In Kansas, a judge 
dismissed a seventh-grade boy's suit over being disciplined for 
drawing a Confederate flag, which violated the school hate-speech 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Though courts have sided with schools' interest in maintaining  
order and protecting students, Underwood said, teachers identifying 
problem students must walk a fine line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We advise people to act reasonably,'' she said. ``Sometimes  
kids are just acting weird because they're kids. Knowing the 
difference is more of an art than a science.''

<HEADLINE> Pincay Moves Closer to Shoemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Laffit Pincay rode four winners at  
Hollywood Park on Wednesday, closing within 98 of Bill Shoemaker's 
career record of 8,833 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay, 52, hadn't ridden four winners at Hollywood Park since  
June 5, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay won with Vichim ($9.60) in the first race, Stanton  
Harcourt ($18.20) in the second, Morell's Love ($3.80) in the third 
and Mountain Bike ($6.60) in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only other mount on the eight-race card, Pincay rode 8-1  
outsider Glass Beauty to a fourth-place finish in the sixth race. 
</P>
<P>
	With Pincay not riding in the feature, Alex Solis recorded his  
second victory of the day when 1-2 favorite Son of a Pistol breezed 
to a 2 3/4-length triumph over 8-1 outsider Ray of Sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing under high weight of 121 pounds, Son of a Pistol covered  
6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15 1-5 and paid $3, $2.40 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the $60,000 allowance for 4-year-olds and up was  
the ninth in 15 lifetime starts for Son of a Pistol and was worth 
$36,000, increasing the career earnings of the 7-year-old son of 
Big Pistol to $531,310. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray of Sunshine, ridden by Chris Antley and carrying 119 pounds,  
crossed the finish line 1 1/4 lengths in front of Invitato Mio and 
returned $4.80 and $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Invitato Mio, ridden by Chris McCarron and carrying 115 pounds,  
was two lengths ahead of Flaming West at the wire and paid $3.40 to

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earnings Up 16 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG today said strong  
U.S. sales at its Chrysler division offset weak results in Asia and 
Latin America during the first quarter, boosting operating earnings 
16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After adjustment for one-time items, earnings totaled $2.73  
billion, or $1.77 a share, compared with $2.35 billion, or $1.55 a 
share, for the company formed by the merger of Chrysler Corp. and 
Daimler-Benz AG a year ago. It was the first full quarter earnings 
report for the company since the merger in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first-quarter figures support our confidence for 1999,''  
chairman Juergen Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were up 10 percent to $37.82 billion from $34.44  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said DaimlerChrysler had a  
particularly strong quarter in the United States, but that problems 
persisted in Asia and Latin America. He also said the recent 
slowdown in Western Europe was expected to continue into the second 
half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is ahead of schedule in integrating the operations  
of the two automakers, Eaton said. Savings from combining such 
operations as purchasing and engineering should provide ``a 
tremendous opportunity for overall growth in the full year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, DaimlerChrysler plans to increase  
production this year to meet higher demand, he said. The former 
Chrysler operations were responsible for more than half of the 
first quarter earnings, but Eaton said he expected that percentage 
to decline as the rest of the company grows at a faster rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said sales of the French-built Smart car has been a  
disappointment in Europe and was a drag on Mercedes-Benz profits, 
but that the company was taking steps to boost demand, including 
lowering prices, increasing standard equipment and spending more on 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly going to try to turn that around,'' he said.  
``But it's possible we'll conclude it's a good idea but simply one 
who's time hasn't come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, where DaimlerChrysler is starting up production of  
the small Mercedes-Benz A-class car, the market remains down 
sharply. But Eaton said he was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it has hit the bottom. We're looking for a turn-up  
early next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was less optimistic about Asia, particularly Japan. ``It's  
our judgment (Japan's) not going to turn around and be positive for 
two or three years, potentially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said management will recommend at the new company's first  
annual meeting next month an annual dividend of about $2.50 a 
share, which is in line with what Chrysler paid but substantially 
above the former Daimler-Benz dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it adjusted its first-quarter results for  
one-time items from the public offering of its telecommunications 
unit Debitel and Germany's tax reform. 1998 results were adjusted 
for the sale of the group's semiconductor business and gains from 
the sale of two buildings in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of DaimlerChrysler workers worldwide increased 8  
percent during the quarter to 456,440, taking into account the 
acquisition of Adtranz, the company's rail systems unit.

<HEADLINE>  China Says Complain, Don't Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese citizens should make their complaints  
known through proper channels rather than through protests, a 
communist official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrating outside Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the  
government and the ruling Communist Party, is ``completely wrong,'' 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said late Tuesday night, quoting 
an unidentified official in charge of handling complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were part of the government's first explanation of  
how it used persuasion to defuse a massive demonstration by members 
of a martial arts sect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different views and opinions are allowable and can also be  
reported through normal channels according to law,'' the agency 
said, quoting the official. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration unnerved Chinese leaders because it came close  
to the 10th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy 
activists in Tiananmen Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's criticism of protests follows dozens of  
unrelated labor demonstrations in recent months by workers who feel 
victimized by China's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 retired miners blocked a train line Monday in  
the northeastern city of Fushun, protesting a cutoff of their 
pension payments, a labor rights group reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, more than 10,000 followers of the group Falun Gong  
surrounded the leadership compound in a silent protest to call for 
assurances that they could legally practice the teachings of their 
leader, Li Hongzhi, a Chinese native who lives in New York. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  China Says Complain, Don't Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese citizens should make their complaints  
known through proper channels rather than through protests, a 
communist official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrating outside Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the  
government and the ruling Communist Party, is ``completely wrong,'' 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said late Tuesday night, quoting 
an unidentified official in charge of handling complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were part of the government's first explanation of  
how it used persuasion to defuse a massive demonstration by members 
of a martial arts sect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different views and opinions are allowable and can also be  
reported through normal channels according to law,'' the agency 
said, quoting the official. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration unnerved Chinese leaders because it came close  
to the 10th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy 
activists in Tiananmen Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's criticism of protests follows dozens of  
unrelated labor demonstrations in recent months by workers who feel 
victimized by China's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 retired miners blocked a train line Monday in  
the northeastern city of Fushun, protesting a cutoff of their 
pension payments, a labor rights group reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, more than 10,000 followers of the group Falun Gong  
surrounded the leadership compound in a silent protest to call for 
assurances that they could legally practice the teachings of their 
leader, Li Hongzhi, a Chinese native who lives in New York. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> American Starting Flights to Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American will start flights to Alaska  
in June as part of the airline's expansion plans in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's decision to grow westward earlier this year by  
purchasing Reno Air touched off a yet-to-be-resolved feud with its 
pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the company is expanding from within. American, a  
subsidiary of AMR Corp., will be adding 20 new flights over the 
summer. As well as the Dallas to Anchorage flights, other new 
nonstop routes will include Los Angeles to Paris and Hartford, 
Conn.; Seattle to Tokyo, New York and Boston; and San Jose, Calif., 
to Tokyo, San Diego and Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making a major commitment to growth and expansion on  
the West Coast,'' said Michael Gunn, American's senior vice 
president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't American's first foray into Alaska. In the 1980s, the  
company had a pilot interchange program with Alaska Airlines. An 
American Airlines pilot would fly from Dallas to Seattle, for 
example, then an Alaska Airlines crew would continue to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s, AMR bought a small West Coast airline named  
AirCal in an effort to pick up routes along the California coast. 
American ultimately absorbed AirCal and withdrew many of its 
airplanes from the area in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, still hoping to keep a hand in California, AMR started a  
frequent-flier plan with Reno Air. All of those moves were a 
prelude to a dispute earlier this year between the company and its 
pilots, many of whom are still angry that Reno Air pilots took over 
their routes when American left the area. 
</P>
<P>
	When American announced the purchase of Reno last December, the  
dispute reached a boiling point that ultimately resulted in a 
sickout by pilots over 10 days in February. The job action cost the 
company millions of dollars, delayed jets around the world and 
stranded hundreds of thousand of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge held the Allied Pilots Association and its two  
top officers in contempt and fined them $45 million for ignoring 
his order to tell pilots to return to their cockpits. He has not 
yet decided how the three parties will divide the fine among them. 
</P>
<P>
	APA plans to appeal the judge's decision to the 5th Circuit  
Court in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration opened the way  
Wednesday for the sale of food and medical items to three countries 
listed as terrorist states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- arguing that 
economic sanctions often do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales of food, medicine and other humanitarian necessities do  
not generally enhance a nation's military capacity or support 
terrorism,'' Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told 
reporters. ``On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural 
commodities and products are not available for other, less 
desirable uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose in applying sanctions is to influence the behavior  
of regimes, not to deny people their basic humanitarian needs,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring such sales usually fails to hurt targeted regimes while  
depriving American companies of export opportunities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy is part of a broader attempt at comprehensive  
sanctions reform. The goal is to resort to unilateral sanctions 
only after all other options, including diplomacy and multilateral 
sanctions, have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changed approach, humanitarian items will be exempted  
from future sanctions. Wednesday's announcement will not affect 
Iraq, North Korea and Cuba, all sanctioned countries to which sales 
of certain items are already permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the changed policy  
meant a pending Iranian request for more than $500 million worth of 
American grain and sugar will be approved. A number of farm state 
senators and House members have been seeking approval of the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., welcomed the policy shift, saying in  
a telephone interview that the administration has, in effect, been 
telling farmers, ``'You pay the cost of our foreign policy.''' He 
added: ``Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein have never missed a meal 
because of our sanctions policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that large grain stocks have led to depressed prices.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a strong advocate of sanctions reform,  
also was supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that food and medicine should be used as a  
tool of foreign policy,'' said Lugar, the Senate Agriculture 
Committee chairman. ``Doing so typically injures innocent civilians 
in the sanctioned country, imposes little hardship on recalcitrant 
leaders whose behavior we wish to change and opens the door for 
other exporting countries to replace the U.S. as a food supplier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government experts predict the policy change could increase  
wheat and corn exports by 1 million tons, said Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the new policy is not directed at any particular  
country. Among the countries subject to curbs on food and medicine, 
only Iran has been a target of a U.S. effort for improved 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has called for resumption of an official  
dialogue with Iran but thus far has been rebuffed. Iran was one of 
America's most important allies in the Middle East until the 
pro-American monarchy was toppled two decades ago and replaced by a 
regime led largely by Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Cuba, Eizenstat noted that sales of medicine and medical  
supplies are allowed with certain limitations under legislation 
approved in 1992, and the regulated sales of food, pesticides and 
related items were permitted under a policy shift announced in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Iraq is subject to unilateral U.S. sanctions as well  
as U.N.-mandated sanctions, it has been authorized to sell oil on 
the international market so long as the proceeds are earmarked for 
purchases of humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, despite unilateral sanctions against North Korea,  
the administration approved the donation of tens of thousands of 
tons of food assistance to that country in recent years through the 
U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
offered conditional support for the policy. Marc Thiessen, a Helms 
spokesman, said: ``Every dollar Iran or Sudan or Libya wants to 
spend on American grain instead of on terrorism or weapons of mass 
destruction is fine with us.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Brit Aerospace Mulls Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC is reportedly talking with  
France's Lagardere and Italy's Finmeccanica SpA about merging their 
guided weapons operations to create the world's second-largest 
missile manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported Wednesday that British Aerospace  
chief executive John Weston said the three companies were 
discussing how to merge the operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said such a merger would create the world's  
biggest missile maker after Raytheon Co., based in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace spokesman Mike Peters confirmed Wednesday that  
the three companies have held discussions, but noted that they 
already have projects in common and refused to say whether their 
talks were aimed specifically at forming a joint project to build 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to advocate the consolidation of the European  
aerospace and defense industry on the basis that the globalization 
of the industry is moving ahead,'' Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Aerospace were up 2.3 percent in late  
afternoon trading in London, while Lagardere shares were trading 
1.0 percent higher on the Paris stock exchange. Finmeccanica shares 
slipped 1.0 percent in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace is the largest arms company in Europe and,  
with its acquisition of the Marconi defense operations of General 
Electric Co. PLC, it will rank No. 3 in the world. British 
Aerospace agreed in January to acquire Marconi in a deal worth 
$11.9 billion. It reached a definitive sales agreement with GEC on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace expects that another decade of consolidation  
in the aerospace sectors will leave just two or three companies 
capable of competing on a global scale. 
</P>
<P>
	It wants to see ``a European company with the widest possible  
distributed shareholder base'' as one of the surviving competitors, 
Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Lagardere's Matra subsidiary already have  
a guided weapons joint venture called Matra BAe Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are increasing their weapons production through  
new partnerships -- Matra through its merger with France's 
Aerospatiale, and British Aerospace through Marconi's 50 percent 
stake in a project with Alenia SpA, part of the Finmeccanica group. 
</P>
<P>
	Matra BAe Dynamics also has a 30 percent stake in LFK, the  
missiles subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, scores of peace activists were ejected from  
British Aerospace's annual shareholder meeting after they protested 
the company's sale of ground attack aircraft to the Indonesian 
government and assault rifles to the Turkish army.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Earnings Up 20 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported a 20 percent  
increase in first-quarter profits due largely to increased beer 
sales in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light said Wednesday it had net  
income of $319 million, or 66 cents per share, up from $265 
million, or 54 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $3.15 billion from $2.95 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch's domestic beer market share rose 1.5 percent to  
48.1 percent in the first quarter. Domestic revenue per barrel was 
up 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic beer shipments increased 7.9 million barrels to 23.2  
million barrels. The company said the increased shipments reflected 
the continued strength of Budweiser products and the February 
rollout of Tequiza, which combines the flavors of tequila and lime. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide beer sales volume rose 7.6 percent to 24.5 million  
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Anheuser-Busch rose 37 1/2 cents to $75.37 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks slipped today as investors sold  
issues to lock in profits before a series of national holidays. The 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.03 points,  
or 0.09 percent, ending the day at 16,942.24, erasing a 124.32 
point morning gain. On Tuesday, the average closed up 38.76 points, 
or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.08 yen at late afternoon, down 0.38 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 
120.40 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 118.25 yen to 120.28 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell in the afternoon on profit  
taking, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, prices advanced following the overnight strength  
in New York stocks. Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial 
average rose 113.12 points to 10,831.71, topping its previous 
record finish of 10,727.18, set Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand was quite strong in the morning after shares in New  
York rose overnight, but sell orders began to pour in after the 
Nikkei average surpassed the 17,000 mark,'' said Yoshio Watanabe, a 
manager at the futures section of Toyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.72 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,359.14. The 
TOPIX closed up 6.58 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 677.47 million  
shares, up from 633.38 million shares Tuesday. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 695 to 483, with 137 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on speculation that the  
government might put together a supplementary budget to prevent a 
deterioration of the economy later this year when funds for current 
stimulus measures run out. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar later rose back above 119 yen after Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi said he has no plans for an extra budget. The 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy panel chief, Yukihiko 
Ikeda, also denied the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile stocks were among shares that lost ground as the yen  
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 127.22 yen, up from  
127.02 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players remained on the sidelines ahead of Japan's ``Golden  
Week'' holidays. Japanese financial markets will be closed 
Thursday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.460 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, 
driving its price down to 102.99 yen from 103.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Expects To Play in Game 5 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- After a 30-minute workout Wednesday,  
Pittsburgh Penguins captain Jaromir Jagr said he expects to play 
against the New Jersey Devils Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, who missed three games after reinjuring his groin in Game  
1 of the opening-round Stanley Cup playoff series last Thursday, 
doesn't expect to be at full strength for Game 5 at East 
Rutherford, N.J. But through acupuncture and rest, Jagr's condition 
has improved, and he is anxious to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins and Devils are tied 2-2. Game 6 is Sunday at Civic  
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play because I think I can help the team even if I'm  
not going to be 100 percent,'' Jagr said. ``I feel I should be 
there. I feel I should play Friday, but everybody should understand 
that I cannot do much out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, who won his third NHL scoring title in five seasons and  
second straight, had an assist in Game 1, which the Penguins lost 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr has made his linemates better players. Journeyman Kip  
Miller's 19 goals and 42 points, rookie Jan Hrdina's 13 goals and 
42 points and Martin Straka's career-best 35 goals and 83 points 
are prime examples of Jagr's influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you picked a guy that you wouldn't want injured during the  
series, one of the guys would be Jaromir,'' coach Kevin Constantine 
said. ``So, when you lose him, you've lost a lot. And when you get 
him back, you get back a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jagr badly wants to play, he probably won't go if he can't  
skate at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I expect the pain, but this is different,'' Jagr  
said. ``Every time I make a step, every time I push, I feel pain. 
And it's very tough to skate. ... I don't think it matters whether 
I play five minutes or 15 minutes. If I'm going to play, it's going 
to hurt.''

	On Tuesday, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced plans  
for a ballot Aug. 8 that will deliver autonomy or independence to 
East Timor 24 years after Indonesia invaded. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations was to supervise the poll with the aid of an  
unspecified number of international police advisers and poll 
monitors from six countries, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The first U.N. officials were expected to arrive in East Timor's  
capital, Dili, within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen said they opposed the vote because it would  
foment more unrest between opposing sides of the independence 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has escalated this year since Indonesia said it would  
consider letting go of the territory, which accounts for roughly 
half the island of Timor. Dozens of people have been killed in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fight everybody who wants to trouble us and wants to  
force us to accept their opinion,'' said John Estevan Soares, a 
pro-Indonesian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reject it. We refuse it,'' he said of the August ballot.  
``The United Nations must bear the consequences if things go 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian military, accused of doing little to curb militia  
attacks on civilians, said it will disarm rival groups. But it was 
far from certain that militiamen and separatist rebels would lay 
down their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Tono Suratman, East Timor's military commander, said he  
held personal misgivings about the ballot. However, he said he 
would carry out the orders of Habibie's government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who have guns which can kill will have to surrender them  
to the police,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot plan was to be signed by Indonesia and Portugal at  
U.N. headquarters in New York next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence activists say the vast majority of East Timor's  
800,000 people want to break away from Indonesia. However, they say 
a full U.N. military peacekeeping force is required to maintain 
security vital for a free and open ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Soares said the militiamen would never accept independence and  
would even launch a guerrilla war in East Timor's mountainous 
interior if that were the outcome of the ballot. Rival 
pro-independence rebels have fought Indonesian troops this way for 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, seven Dili journalists accused militiamen and  
soldiers of harassing them. Earlier this month militia groups 
trashed the office of their newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Yayasan Hak, a Timorese human rights group, said two civilians  
had been kidnapped in Dili by anti-independence groups on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Hedge Fund Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential working group is recommending  
that risky investment funds be required by law to disclose 
financial information now deemed private, a House source said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited recommendations on hedge funds are in response  
to the near collapse of a Connecticut-based fund last fall that 
threatened to send financial markets around the world into a 
tailspin. They were to be made public Thursday by the President's 
Working Group on Financial Markets, the House official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is composed of officials from the Federal Reserve, the  
Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It has been studying for 
months the events leading to the meltdown of Long-Term Capital 
Management, a big speculative fund for wealthy investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also is recommending that Congress give the SEC and  
the CFTC more authority to collect data on unregulated affiliates 
of securities firms that participate in hedge funds, the House 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another recommendation is that the SEC begin requiring publicly  
traded companies, such as big banks and brokerage firms, to 
disclose any significant investments they have in hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	And the panel recommends that regulators require banks and  
brokerage firms to set aside more reserves to cover potential 
losses from hedge fund investments, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hedge funds would be required to disclose their financial  
data to federal regulators every three months under the White House 
panel's proposal. Currently some but not all hedge funds are 
required to file financial reports with the CFTC, but the reports 
are often out of date and kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group, however, is not calling for direct government  
regulation of hedge funds, according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Arthur  
Levitt both have said publicly in recent months they believe that 
new government controls on hedge funds aren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan acknowledged recently that the Long-Term Capital  
debacle was a failure of the current system, which relies on banks 
-- rather than federal regulators -- to supervise the hedge funds to 
which they lend money. But he called it ``a single mistake ... a 
very rare event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital's near collapse last September after its  
managers bet wrong on interest-rate swings threatened financial 
markets until the Federal Reserve helped arrange a $3.6 billion 
bailout by a group of big banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the Fed's research and  
statistics division, told lawmakers last December that banks making 
generous loans to Long-Term Capital ``didn't ask enough questions'' 
about the fund's risks and operations.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes' Roenick Returns to Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- All-Star center Jeremy Roenick, whose  
jaw was shattered near the end of the season, skated at the Phoenix 
Coyotes' practice facility on Wednesday and hinted that he might 
return to action in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have a lot of confidence in my teammates that they're  
going to finish off St. Louis,'' he said. ``It could be a couple of 
weeks yet. We'll have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes have a 3-1 lead on the Blues and could close out  
their first-round series by winning Game 5 on Friday. If Phoenix 
did advance, it would face Dallas, the No. 1 team in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher drew a seven-game suspension --  
including five in the playoffs -- for injuring Roenick in an April 
14 game. He caught Roenick, the Coyotes' leading scorer, by 
surprise with an elbow to the face and was forced to sit out seven 
games, including the first five of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Stars swept Edmonton in four games, Hatcher will  
have to miss the first game of their second-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick's right thumb also was broken in the last meeting with  
Dallas when Craig Ludwig slashed him. That injury alone was 
expected to sideline him for three to four weeks, but Roenick cut 
the cast off his hand last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of his teammates took the day off, Roenick went  
through shooting and conditioning drills. Roenick had 24 goals and 
48 assists in 78 games before the latest injury.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Olympic hurdles gold medalist Ludmila  
Engquist has been operated on for breast cancer and will undergo 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born Engquist, 35, won the 100-meter hurdles for  
Sweden at the 1996 Atlanta Games. She also won world championships 
in 1991 and 1997. Last year, her season was cut short by a 
hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	She told a news conference Wednesday she underwent surgery last  
week and although the operation went well, there were indications 
the cancer was spreading and she would need chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction was that I did not want to live any  
longer,'' she said. But now she hopes to recover quickly enough to 
compete at the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot have survival as my only goal,'' she said. ``That  
would be too boring. My goal is to come back in my best running 
form. It is good for me to have that goal; it will help me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist also won the 1991 world indoor 60-meter hurdles title  
and set the world record in the 60 hurdles in 1990.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Back at Bargaining Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA and its players association reportedly  
are close to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports News, basing its report on a source, on Tuesday night  
said the two sides are ``just one, non-basketball, charity-related 
issue away from a labor agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides returned to the bargaining table Tuesday after talking  
for eight hours Monday in a bid to resolve differences which caused 
an apparent agreement to fall apart last week. At that time, both 
sides claimed the other had injected new terms at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The league postponed its player draft which had been scheduled  
for Tuesday, causing Pam Wheeler, executive director of the WNBA 
players association, to issue a statement charging league officials 
with trying to intimidate the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the union and league agreed on a four-year deal that  
would increase minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000 for 
veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those figures would increase to 
$40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002. The benefits package 
was to include year-round health and dental benefits, pension, 
maternity benefits and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-week season is supposed to begin June 10.  
</P>
<P>
	The union claimed that the league introduced five issues in  
talks last Wednesday night and said that if the players association 
did not agree to them, there would be no deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes was the right to extend the 32-game season  
without increasing salaries, the addition of random drug testing 
and no increase in the rookie wage scale for the duration of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said the union had changed the economics of the deal  
and was trying to limit appearances players make in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old WNBA has added expansion teams in Orlando and  
Minnesota for this season and plans to add four more cities by 
2000, increasing membership to 16 franchises.

<HEADLINE> NuSouth Label Tries To Sell Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Lining the racks of a small shop in this  
city of the Old South are jackets, sweaters and caps with a 
startling Confederate Flag -- the traditional red, white and blue of 
the old Confederacy replaced with the black, red and green of black 
liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two black entrepreneurs who founded NuSouth Apparel hope  
that blending those powerful symbols as a show of unity also will 
prove profitable at a time when showing one's colors has been good 
business for the Ralph Laurens of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a clothing line with a conscience,'' said Angel Quintero  
as he sat in the company's boutique just off the beaten path in 
this city where the Civil War started. 
</P>
<P>
	What began as a design for the cover of an album by a local rap  
group is now a trademarked clothing line that Quintero and partner 
Sherman Evans promise will challenge the Calvin Klines and Tommy 
Hilfigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after the album cover and almost two years after the  
company opened its tiny boutique, NuSouth is shipping its spring 
and summer line to more than 200 retailers nationwide. A second 
store opens in Atlanta this spring and NuSouth hopes to add stores 
in Houston and Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	They sell everything from baseball caps to socks and men's  
underwear. The line includes shorts selling for $26 a pair, polo 
shirts for $29 and jackets for $62.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Audrey Guskey, a marketing professor at Duquesne University in  
Pittsburgh who has consulted for companies such as General Motors 
Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co., said the timing seems right for 
NuSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of logo that stands for a philosophy or a way of  
thinking is rare. It's coming at a time when this would be 
acceptable. Ten or 15 years ago it might have been too avant-garde, 
too risky or too controversial,'' Ms. Guskey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero and Evans say whites make up about 70 percent of their  
business and they don't want NuSouth pigeonholed as an urban brand 
just for young blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the sons and daughters of former slaves,'' reads their ad  
pitch. ``For the sons and daughters of former slave owners. Threads 
that connect us. Words that free us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to put the divisions of the past behind, Evans said.  
</P>
<P>
	``People say, 'I'm not a former slave,' or, 'I'm not a former  
slave owner.' Well, you know, somewhere in your family you have 
been one or the other,'' he said. ``Quit polarizing us and making 
it a black or white thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans and Quintero say it's not just a one-season fad.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to Atlanta,'' said Evans, who owns another  
clothing boutique across town. ``The bottom line is Atlanta is the 
capital of the South. There's Coca-Cola, there's Ted Turner and 
there's NuSouth, that's how we see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not cockiness, said Quintero who also owns an auto  
detailing shop. ``It's just that we believe in what we are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair say they use only American mills to make the clothes  
and have avoided bank financing in favor of small investors. Evans 
would not discuss how much NuSouth has raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hungry, we're aggressive and we have a vision. We're not  
selling out,'' he said. ``We tell the venture capitalists that, 
'You're not getting 65 percent of the company.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis has been on creating the brand, said Evans. Sales  
this season are ``slightly south of a million,'' he said, ``we're 
projecting this coming year $10 million total.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stores carrying NuSouth clothing must display it in an in-store  
boutique, not just on a rack with other brands. ``We're a little 
more sophisticated than people give us credit for. We understand 
the value of having a brand,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the pair designed the album cover for the local rap group  
da Phlayva, media attention followed when a girl was suspended from 
an area high school in 1994 for wearing a T-shirt with the logo and 
the group's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans and Quintero later sold some items during the Million Man  
March. Then came the boutique, a Web site and a catalogue. Articles 
in GQ and other fashion magazines spread the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	Charleston Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, who is black, bought a  
flag license plate after seeing one on Quintero's truck. Quintero 
said Greenberg pulled him over and asked where to get one. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the flag, a symbol of oppression to some people, with  
a symbol of liberation may take some explaining outside the South, 
Ms. Guskey said. ``You have to make a connection for them or have 
somebody make the connection,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also warned that NuSouth must move quickly to prevent  
knockoffs, but so far, the company has not had a bootlegging 
problem, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who would go buy a bootleg NuSouth really doesn't get  
it. NuSouth is far deeper,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Students Pass the Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Pete Forsberg is renting movies and  
having sleepovers -- and visiting hospitals. Katie Ulibarri has gone 
back to work at the mall -- in between funerals. Katie Crona is 
helping her mom with chores -- when she's not watching memorial 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Columbine High students haven't sat in classrooms or  
done homework for a week. But this is a break like no other, and 
the minutes tick by ever so slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Their minds are filled with images from last week, when two of  
their classmates killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves. 
Classes won't resume until Monday, when students head to nearby 
Chatfield High School to finish out the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, many are spending time saying goodbye to  
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to do everything to keep my mind off of it,'' said  
Miss Crona, 14. ``It happened a week ago, but it could've happened 
four to five months ago. It just seems so slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Crona, a freshman, was among two dozen students who cheered  
the Columbine Rebels girls' soccer team Tuesday afternoon. The 
game, which marked the resumption of the school's extracurricular 
activities, was played in neighboring Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
	During a moment of silence just before kickoff, students held  
hands, wept and watched a stadium flag fly at half-staff against 
dark clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	After Columbine took a 2-0 lead against rival Golden High, one  
mother in the bleachers called out: ``We are!'' With sure voices, 
the students responded with a strong ``Columbine!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg, a 17-year-old junior, wore a blue-and-silver Columbine  
memorial ribbon. Hanging out with four buddies, he said he's been 
going to the hospital, sometimes twice a day, to visit wounded 
friends. He and his friends are having sleepovers and watching 
movies like ``Airplane'' on video. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been spending a lot of time with each other because we  
draw strength from each other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents have become friends. One girl said she camped out with  
her mother and father for three nights at Clement Park, where a 
makeshift shrine now covers an area the size of a football field. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ulibarri also has been engaging in a decidedly un-teen-age  
activity by hanging out with her parents, who ``won't let me out of 
their sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten more hugs and kisses than I've gotten in my whole  
life,'' she said on her second day back to work at Afterthoughts, a 
shop in the Southwest Plaza mall near the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miss Ulibarri is staying away from Clement Park, which she  
thinks has become a tourist attraction. ``You can't go there 
without getting a camera shoved in your face,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Natalie Baker, 15, who strolled through the mall with a friend  
Tuesday, has been spending some of her time with investigators. She 
was in the cafeteria when shooting broke out, so they've come to 
her house to find out what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Miss Baker has passed the hours with friends, talking  
through what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, we just drove around 'til four in the morning,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Hughes, meanwhile, needed to get away from Littleton --  
far away. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hughes, who had known gunman Dylan Klebold since they were  
in an accelerated program together in third grade, went to Oregon 
to be with her college-student brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been too hard for her,'' said Abigail Hughes, her  
22-year-old sister. ``She's been totally depressed.''

<HEADLINE> Attack Prompts Manson To End Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shock rocker Marilyn Manson has canceled the  
band's last five dates of its American tour ``out of respect for 
those lost in the school tragedy at Littleton, Colo.,'' according 
to Manson's web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are trying to sort out what happened and to deal with  
their losses,'' Marilyn Manson said. ``It's not a great atmosphere 
to be out playing rock'n'roll shows, for us or the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band's music is popular among Gothic youth, who wear black  
and think a lot about death. The two students at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. who fatally shot 12 students, a teacher 
and then committed suicide, were members of a group that called 
itself the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' and appeared to have adopted some 
of the Gothic lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media has unfairly scapegoated the music industry and  
so-called Goth kids and has speculated -- with no basis in truth -- 
that artists like myself are in some way to blame,'' Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragedy was a product of ignorance, hatred, and an access  
to guns. I hope the media's irresponsible finger-pointing doesn't 
create more discrimination against kids who look different,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The band will postpone concerts scheduled for May 3 in Reno, May  
4 in Fresno, May 5 in Las Vegas, May 7 in Phoenix and May 8 in Los 
Angeles. It was not clear when the band would hold the concert or 
what ticketholders should do with their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson had been scheduled to headline a concert in Denver on  
April 30. The show was canceled by the radio station sponsoring it.

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks Compromise on Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is searching for a formula for  
legislation that would prevent an avalanche of lawsuits arising 
from Year 2000 computer breakdowns without eroding basic legal 
rights to redress wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of Senate leaders and key players Tuesday failed to  
resolve several remaining issues, including how to cap punitive 
damage awards so as to discourage frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding issues ``are tough. They are very difficult,''  
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the ``Y2K'' 
litigation bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``I'm not sure we will 
be able to resolve them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow companies 90 days to fix faulty computers  
before lawsuits can go forward, and encourage mediation. It would 
also put a $250,000 cap on most punitive damage awards and make it 
harder to file class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Strongly backed by the high tech industry and business groups,  
the measure is aimed at blunting what some experts warn could be 
the largest crush of lawsuits in U.S. history, a $1 trillion mass 
of litigation that could cripple the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	One potentially dangerous result of computer breakdowns -- and a  
possible source of big lawsuits -- was the subject of a House 
hearing Tuesday, where health experts acknowledged that they can't 
guarantee that hospitals and doctors will have their biomedical 
equipment -- MRI machines, pacemakers and dialysis machines -- ready 
for Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear is that some computers will mistake the year 2000 for  
1900, causing errors and breakdowns. Almost all hospitals say they 
will have their computers fixed by yearend, but Joel Willemssen of 
Congress' General Accounting Office said hospitals surveyed in 
February found that only 6 percent of medical devices and 13 
percent of information systems were Y2K-compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of McCain's bill, led by Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.,  
argue that hospitals and other businesses will, out of 
self-interest, address the problem so as to avoid losing customers 
and attracting lawsuits. Hollings said the real purpose is to 
change tort law to favor defendants trying to avoid huge penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wyden argued that there is a ``real centrist coalition''  
growing behind a bill that both protects consumers and ensures ``we 
don't have bedlam in our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said major pro-consumer changes had been made in McCain's  
original bill, such as limiting the bill to three years to make 
clear it is not changing basic tort law and eliminating punitive 
damage caps when fraud or willful negligence is involved. Language 
in the original bill that exempted company directors and officers 
from personal liability also was modified. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats are still pushing for removal of all caps on  
punitive damages and want stronger language on officer liability. 
Also at issue is language that a person is liable for damages only 
if it is determined he acted with specific intent to injure the 
plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would order  
a vote Thursday to cut off debate and move to a final vote if 
differences aren't settled before then. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those differences has nothing to do with the computer  
problem, but concerns Democratic demands they be given a chance 
soon to take up some of their priorities, including gun control 
legislation. Democrats have threatened to attach gun control 
amendments to the Y2K bill if Lott doesn't agree to their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S.96.

<HEADLINE> IMF Prepares To Help Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The international community is preparing  
significant contributions to deal with the human and economic costs 
of the air war in the Balkans, top officials of the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A donor conference Tuesday night, representing both wealthy  
industrial countries and six Balkan nations affected by the Kosovo 
crisis, produced good results in terms of assessing initial needs 
and making sure financial support begins quickly, said Michael 
Deppler of the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was successful in galvanizing the process of  
international economic cooperation,'' Deppler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the spring meetings of the 182-nation IMF and its sister  
lending organization, the World Bank, wrapped up today, officials 
reported much less success on other major agenda items dealing with 
helping the global economy recover from nearly two years of 
currency turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF also failed to resolve a number of differences in  
approaches to overhauling the financial architecture to prevent or 
at least better cope with future crises. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has throughout the four days of talks, the United States  
continued to warn against complacency in addressing the reform 
issues, now that there are hopeful signs the crisis is drawing to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis has abated. But it is still a dangerous world out  
there and profound challenges remain,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement released after the Kosovo discussions, the  
IMF and World Bank said the meeting, called at the request of 
France, had been attended by seven international agencies and 33 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	While preliminary European estimates for reconstruction in the  
Balkans have put the costs as high as $30 billion, officials urged 
caution in using such high figures, saying much more needs to be 
known about the damage done by the NATO bombing, how long the war 
will last and how quickly economic activity may recover to 
pre-crisis levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the countries taking part were the six Balkan nations  
outside Yugoslavia most directly affected -- Albania, Bosnia, 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speakers (at the meeting) broadly endorsed the methodology  
adopted by the joint IMF/World Bank paper to assess the economic, 
financial and social costs of the crisis,'' the agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank and the 15-nation European Union will coordinate  
assessing needs and how they are provided, the statement said. 
Donor countries will hold pledge meetings in the next few weeks for 
the Balkan countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate communique Tuesday night, the IMF conceded that it  
had failed to reach agreement on a number of outstanding issues on 
dealing with future currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the IMF's policy-setting interim committee issued a  
10-page final statement pledging to continue efforts to resolve 
competing proposals put forward by the United States and other 
industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It hailed as its one major achievement the creation of new  
U.S.-proposed contingent credit lines that could provide billions 
of dollars for warding off financial panic to countries pursuing 
sound economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But agreements could not be reached on involving the private  
sector in sharing the cost of future bailouts or monitoring the 
borrowing practices of countries with emerging economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,  
favored a more market-oriented, case-by-case approach for 
private-sector involvement. Britain and other nations preferred 
specific rules defining the obligations of investors whose bets on 
emerging markets go bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues left on the table included ways to better manage  
wild currency fluctuations both in developing countries and 
industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opposed efforts pushed by Japan and Germany  
for more coordinated efforts among countries to manage currency 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in areas where there was agreement, such as the need to  
provide greater debt relief for the poorest countries, the IMF 
could not resolve how much of its gold reserves should be sold to 
help finance the initiative, or how much money wealthy nations 
would be willing to contribute to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief was also expected to be taken up when President  
Clinton and the other leaders of the world's seven largest 
economies hold their annual economic summit in mid-June in Cologne, 
Germany.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Faces Obstruction Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot acquitted of  
manslaughter in the Italian cable-car tragedy that killed 20 people 
went on trial Wednesday on obstruction charges for allegedly 
helping to destroy a video shot from the cockpit of his jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements in the court-martial were interrupted for  
seven hours while the judge weighed and then rejected a request 
from the defense for a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's lawyers objected to what they said was a  
prosecutor's suggestion that Ashby's silence about the videotape 
was evidence of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, agreed that the prosecutor's  
comments were improper but called a mistrial a ``drastic remedy'' 
and told the military jury to disregard the remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they might appeal the ruling on grounds that it  
impedes their attempt to show Ashby remained silent to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys acknowledged in opening statements that Ashby  
took the videotape from the plane but only because his navigator, 
Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, asked him to. The prosecution will begin 
questioning witnesses Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted in March of  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 1998 accident in 
which his EA-6B Prowler sliced through a ski gondola cable in the 
Alps. Prosecutors said he was flying recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being tried separately on charges of obstruction and  
conspiracy for allegedly helping to destroy a videotape shot by his 
navigator minutes before the jet hit the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby could get up to 10 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, said Ashby deliberately  
concealed evidence when he replaced the video with a blank tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to make his own judgment of that videotape,'' she  
said. ``He knew that after that flight, the tape would be nitpicked 
by investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce also said Ashby failed to tell authorities about the  
videotape and invoked his right to silence before an Italian 
magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement prompted defense attorney Frank Spinner to  
complain that the government was saying that Ashby ``must be guilty 
because he elected to remain silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted he gave the videotape to Schweitzer.  
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., said he threw the tape into a 
fire because he feared a frame on it of his smiling face might be 
used to vilify him and the rest of the crew in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce also said Schweitzer was concerned that the tape might  
have shown an acrobatic maneuver before the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction and conspiracy in the  
destruction of the tape and was ordered dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement, Ashby lawyer Maj. Bill Weber said  
Ashby removed the tape after nursing the crippled jet back to the 
Aviano, Italy, air base because Schweitzer asked him to He said 
Ashby gave Schweitzer the tape a day or two later because it 
belonged to Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to get into an argument'' with Schweitzer about  
the tape, Weber said. He said Schweitzer had a plan to destroy the 
tape and Ashby did nothing to stop it.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questions Netscape Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Microsoft today interviewed an  
executive involved in America Online's nearly $10 billion purchase 
of Netscape, after a judge questioned whether the deal might affect 
the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara questioned Peter Currie,  
Netscape's chief administrative officer, today. Currie also is 
Netscape's former chief financial officer and helped put together 
the company's sale to AOL, which was finalized last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a highly unusual twist, reporters were allowed to attend  
almost all Currie's interview at a hotel in downtown Washington 
because of an obscure 1913 law covering antitrust depositions, 
which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers closed the room for only 10 minutes, when questions  
turned to confidential business plans. The interview with Currie 
spanned more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara asked Currie mostly about the origins of AOL's stunning  
$9.9 billion purchase of Netscape. Currie said the first 
discussions started in late August but turned serious in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1913 law also forced the disclosure of transcripts from more  
than 90 depositions already taken in preparation for the trial. 
Most of those, including three days of interviews with Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates, were released publicly today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates transcripts mostly duplicate excerpts from testimony  
already played in court, but also include new sections related to 
Microsoft's dealings with Netscape and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates reluctantly admitted that Netscape's Internet software,  
its browser, was Microsoft's prime competitor at the dawn of what 
lawyers in the case refer to as the ``browser wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point we definitely thought of the Netscape browser as  
the number one in terms of how our Windows browsing would be 
compared by users and which they would select,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	In early 1996 Netscape's browser, called ``Navigator,'' held  
more than half the market for browsers -- dwarfing Microsoft's rival 
``Internet Explorer'' product. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accuses Microsoft of illegally using its  
influence as the maker of the dominant Windows operating systems to 
defend its monopoly and try to extend into new markets, including 
Internet browsers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' hedged admission followed lengthy verbal gymnastics  
during the September 1998 deposition with government lawyer David 
Boies. Gates tried hard to avoid even saying the word ``Netscape,'' 
but eventually relented. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson previously decided  
to allow Microsoft -- in the middle of its antitrust trial -- to 
begin gathering evidence about the implications of AOL's purchase 
of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, with nearly 17 million subscribers, is the world's largest  
Internet provider. Netscape produces successful Web browsing 
software and owns Netcenter, one of the most popular sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the sale was announced last November, the judge  
suggested that there ``might be a very significant change in the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft asked Currie when the Justice Department was notified  
about the deal, since it could affect its legal case against 
Microsoft. ``I don't know when the Justice Department was informed, 
maybe September,'' Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the implications of the purchase on the trial was  
``not my bailiwick.'' He said the companies knew the arrangement 
could affect the ongoing trial, but decided that ``we need to make 
decisions about the business and treat the trial as a separate 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies later denied that the Justice Department knew about AOL's  
plans until November. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft illegally wields its influence as the manufacturer of the 
dominant Windows operating system, which is used to run most of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, government lawyers contend that Microsoft forces  
consumers who buy Windows also to use its bundled Internet 
software, discouraging people from using rival Web software, such 
as Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the Justice Department's arguments in the courtroom have  
focused on AOL's decision in March 1996 to distribute Microsoft's 
browser, not Netscape's, to its millions of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	But with AOL's purchase of Netscape, Microsoft executives --  
including Gates -- expect AOL eventually to distribute Netscape's 
browser, giving it a dramatic boost. AOL is contractually obligated 
to continue distributing Microsoft's browser until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Another deposition was set for Friday in San Francisco, where  
Microsoft was expected to question Mike Popov, vice president and 
chief operating officer at Sun Microsystems Inc. It also will be 
open to the public and media.

<HEADLINE> Osmonds To Host Beauty Pageant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There they are: new Miss America hosts Donny  
and Marie Osmond. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother and sister act will replace last year's hosts,  
Boomer Esiason and Meredith Vieira, pageant officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osmonds, popular TV and concert performers in the '70s and  
'80s, reunited last fall for a syndicated talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant has had a rapid turnover of hosts following Bert  
Parks' quarter-century reign, which ended in 1980. Parks was best 
known for serenading Miss America winners with the trademark 
anthem, ``There She Is.'' He died of lung cancer in 1992 at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79th annual Miss America Pageant, dubbed Miss America 2000,  
will be broadcast live from Atlantic City, N.J., on ABC on Sept.

	Economic Recovery Called Fragile  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, disappointed with  
the failure to reach agreement with its major allies on a strategy 
to reform the global economy, warned today that despite recent 
glimmers of an upturn in many crisis countries, ``it's still a 
dangerous world out there.'' The International Monetary Fund and 
its sister lending agency, the World Bank, concluded four days of 
talks with pledges to intensify efforts to deal with weaknesses 
exposed by the Asian-currency crisis. But they left most of the 
hard decisions until later. Some officials expressed concerns that 
recent rebounds in the markets of several of the countries leveled 
by the currency crisis over the last two years may have reduced a 
needed sense of urgency.

	Japanese Plan Raises Hopes for Asia

	TOKYO (AP) -- Over the past month, Japan has loaned $400 million  
to Indonesian power companies, hundreds of millions more to build 
railways and roads in Malaysia, and $1 billion for South Korea to 
use however it sees fit. It's all part of the ``Miyazawa 
Initiative,'' a $30 billion loan package Japan hopes will help Asia 
out of its financial crisis and boost this country's stature as the 
region's economic leader. The initiative indicates both Japan's 
desire to exert influence on the world stage and frustration 
throughout Asia with the way the West has tried to deal with the 
nearly two-year-old crisis.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as  
investors again collected profits from technology shares. But they 
continued to buy big industrial stocks, pushing the Dow industrials 
up 13.74 to 10,845.45, its second consecutive closing high. The 
enthusiasm for manufacturing stocks was bolstered by this morning's 
Commerce Department report that orders to factories for big-ticket 
durable goods rose 2 percent in March after an end-of-winter slump. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 11.89 to 1,350.91, and the Nasdaq 
fell 52.14 to 2,550.27. Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst with 
Prudential Securities, said there was some caution in the market 
today as investors awaited an earnings report from Amazon.com, 
scheduled to be released after the close of trading. Amazon.com

executives of paying a researcher at Avery Dennison Corp. to hand 
over adhesives industry trade secrets. The case was the first to 
reach trial under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act, which banned the 
theft of trade secrets. Pin Yen Yang, president of Four Pillars 
Enterprise Co. Ltd., and his daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang,

information in business. Greenspan, testifying today before a House 
panel, was asked about a proposal adopted by the House Banking 
Committee last month that would restrict the sharing of certain 
information among affiliated banks, brokerage firms and insurance 
companies. Under the provision, customers' transaction data still 
would be allowed to be shared among affiliated financial companies. 
Greenspan said the issue ``is going to become increasingly

representatives fear the dispute will escalate like the battle over 
banana imports, which resulted in the United States imposing 100 
percent tariffs on selected EU imports. The WTO has ruled that the 
European Union is acting illegally in banning imports of beef 
treated with certain hormones from countries including the United 
States and Canada. But in an apparent widening of the divide, the 
European Commission received the go-ahead to ban all imports of 
American beef as of June 15.

	Coca-Cola Must Inform EU of Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union asserted  
jurisdiction today over Coca-Cola Co.'s proposed $1.75 billion 
acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes PLC's beverage brands outside the 
United States. EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said 
failure to notify the 15-nation EU of its plans could result in 
``heavy penalties'' for the Atlanta-based soft drink maker. 
Coca-Cola has claimed it doesn't need to notify the EU executive

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported a 20 percent  
increase in first-quarter profits due largely to increased beer 
sales in America. The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light said it had 
net income of $319 million, or 66 cents per share. Revenues rose to 
$3.15 billion from $2.95 billion. Anheuser-Busch's domestic beer 
market share rose 1.5 percent to 48.1 percent in the first quarter, 
and domestic beer shipments increased 7.9 million barrels to 23.2 
million barrels. Worldwide beer sales volume rose 7.6 percent to 
24.5 million barrels. Anheuser-Busch stock rose 1 1/2 to 75 3/8.

<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG today said strong  
U.S. sales at its Chrysler division offset weak results in Asia and 
Latin America during the first quarter, boosting operating earnings 
16 percent. After adjustment for one-time items, earnings totaled 
$2.73 billion, or $1.77 a share, compared with $2.35 billion, or 
$1.55 a share, for the company formed by the merger of Chrysler 
Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG a year ago. It was the first full quarter 
earnings report for the company since the merger in November. 
Co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said DaimlerChrysler is ahead of 
schedule in integrating the operations of the two automakers. 
DaimlerChrysler shares fell 2 3/16 at 99 1/8.

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc., maker of premium  
Ray-Ban sunglasses since the 1920s, is selling its sunglass 
business for $640 million to Italy's Luxottica Group SpA, owner of 
the LensCrafters retail chain. While Bausch &AMP; Lomb controls around 
40 percent of the world's premium fashion eyewear business, the 
sunglass unit has struggled of late to turn a profit. Bausch &AMP; Lomb 
has been refocusing in recent years on eye care -- contact lenses,

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders Undergoes Toe Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Even surgery has managed to further cloud  
the mystery of Deion Sanders' left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders underwent surgery to repair the troublesome toe in New  
York City on Wednesday, but it remained unclear when the Pro Bowl 
cornerback and punt returner will be ready to take the field again. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said because the  
case of Deion's damaged digit is ``very unique,'' it would 
inappropriate to establish a projected return date. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surgery was performed to explore and repair what Dr.  
(William) Hamilton described as a `rare and unusual variation of 
turf toe,''' Jones said in a release from Cowboys headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor has informed us that it is very difficult to  
compare Deion's condition to that of any other athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is the specialist who performed the operation.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders injured the toe in the first period of the Cowboy's  
35-28 victory over the Arizona Cardinals last Nov. 15 in Tempe. He 
played briefly in the next game against Seattle, and then was out 
until the Cowboys' playoff loss to Arizona on Jan. 2. Dallas went 
2-3 during the five full games Sanders missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors said at the time that there was nothing that could  
be done to help the toe except to wait. Wait they did, and Sanders 
said he was ready to play just in time for the Pro Bowl on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question, of course, is whether Sanders and his toe will  
be ready for either the start of training camp of July 26 or the 
season opener on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll basically prepare the team as if he's not going to be  
there,'' Jones said, as in those seasons when Sanders was wrapping 
up his baseball season in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the team was not caught off guard by the operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``The surgery was prescribed at this time -- and not an earlier  
date -- because an extensive evaluation period of healing and 
therapy had to first take place,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was clear that Sanders was not going to be able to  
perform at his usual level, Sanders and the team opted for surgery, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The late decision could explain why the issue of depth at  
cornerback wasn't dealt with in the draft. Kevin Smith, who was 
expected to be phased out, and Kevin Mathis are the remaining 
cornerbacks when Sanders is out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great confidence in the abilities of Kevin Smith and  
Kevin Mathis,'' team spokesman Rich Dalrymple said. 
</P>
<P>
	How the injury will affect Sanders' ongoing contract  
negotiations is unclear, and Jones refused to discuss the issue. 
Sanders reportedly is seeking a five-year deal worth a $50 million, 
including a $10 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' agent, Eugene Parker, did not return a call from The  
Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> 3 Teens Eyed in Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man in charge of the Columbine High  
School shooting investigation expressed suspicions about three 
teens who knew the gunmen and waited outside during the massacre. 
He also said ``the entire carnage'' in the school cafeteria was 
captured on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in combat fatigues,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John  
Stone said, referring to the three young men. ``They said they 
heard it on the radio. Well, it wasn't on the radio at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone declined to name the three teens, who have been questioned  
but not formally named as suspects in the April 20 rampage that 
left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are subjects of our investigation,'' Stone told The  
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``We'll be going back to talk to these 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marine Corps officials said 18-year-old gunman Eric  
Harris had tried to enlist but was told during an April 15 home 
visit from a recruiter that he had been rejected for medical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disclosed at that time that he had a medical  
disqualification,'' Marines spokesman 1st Lt. Jeff Sammons said in 
today's Denver Post. Harris' attempt to enlist began after he was 
contacted in a routine recruiting call April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines refused to discuss the medical reason, but a Harris  
family friend, Victor Good, told The New York Times that the teen 
had been taking psychiatric medicine -- a potentially disqualifying 
factor -- and seeing a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Stone for the first time laid out a timeline for the  
attack at the Littleton school. He also said a school surveillance 
camera filmed the bloody scene in the cafeteria, where no one died 
but wounded students were found strewn about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference called after Stone made his comments to the  
AP, the sheriff objected to the emphasis of the story without 
disputing most of his earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not recall using the word ``subjects'' and that  
no individual was the focus of the investigation. He also said he 
didn't recall telling the AP that the three were among his ``best 
leads'' into a possible conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if investigators had cleared the three teens,  
Stone said: ``In my mind, it has not been put to rest nor have my 
investigators communicated back to me that these people are totally 
clear of any suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 classmates and a teacher  
before turning their guns on themselves. In a field outside, the 
three young men in dark jackets and combat-style boots were stopped 
by deputies as television cameras broadcast the scene nationwide. 
They were frisked and taken off for interrogation. They carried no 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he has questioned for days whether the gunmen acted  
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much stuff in there,'' he said. ``You can't walk  
in there blazing with more stuff than you can carry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men, who Stone said knew the gunmen and had  
previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' have 
maintained their innocence. Investigators tested them for gun 
residue after the shootings and found no evidence that they had 
fired guns. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas told the AP that while the sheriff  
may have stronger suspicions about the three men than other 
authorities, investigators have been interested in the trio since 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're among a group of people who we think have  
information,'' Thomas said. ``Are they people we believe have 
information about this? You bet. We have said that since day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	All three claimed to have heard of the slayings on the radio --  
and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released, Stone said. He said one had been expelled from Columbine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson said the three didn't know the gunmen, telling the  
News they ``were just three punks with a lot of curiosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at Akard's home late Tuesday  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the surveillance camera, the sheriff said it captured  
Harris and Klebold as they hurled homemade bombs and opened fire on 
terrified students in the cafeteria. Authorities have sent the 
tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously had not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also said the two gunmen initially tried to escape  
through three separate exits, and killed themselves only after 
being turned back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a 
diary seized at the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen 
planned to fly to Mexico or another country if they could escape, 
and kill themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a diary 
that investigators have characterized as a sheaf of papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were also held 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have questioned Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend,  
who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and Harris. 
Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns were to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, an employee at a Hugh M. Woods store in  
Littleton, told investigators he saw Harris and Klebold buy propane 
tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- material believed used 
in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he copied keys marked ``Do Not Duplicate'' for the  
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they are searching for a missing set of keys to  
the school, which authorities speculate may have allowed the 
killers to carry bombs inside before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I duplicated some keys for them, two sets of keys. On the keys  
it said ``Do Not Duplicate,''' Sowell told the Post. ``They brought 
in a set of five keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell said he copied the keys because ``after a while, you get  
to know the schools and you know it's common for teachers to do 
that, so you don't check on them.''

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Ace Glavine Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Almost a month into the season, Tom Glavine  
hardly looks like the 20-game winner who captured the Cy Young 
Award a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves left-hander is still seeking his first  
victory after four starts, his ERA a most un-Glavine-like 5.61. 
He's 0-3 for the first time since his rookie season in 1988, and 
he's given up a staggering 33 hits in 25 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	This from the pitcher who has averaged more than 16 victories a  
year since '89, including four 20-win seasons. Last year, he won 
his second Cy Young after going 20-6 with a 2.47 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just four out of 35 or 36 starts,'' said Glavine, who  
pitches again Wednesday night against Pittsburgh. ``There's a lot 
of time to turn it around and get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers have speculated that Glavine's problems can be  
traced to baseball's attempts to better define the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the biggest disputes have involved the outside  
strike, most notably Eric Gregg's trampoline-size plate when Livan 
Hernandez had 15 strikeouts against the Braves in a 1997 NL 
championship series game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, who works most effectively when his changeup is an inch  
or two off the plate, insists that a narrower strike zone is not 
his problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``My location is, at best, inconsistent,'' he said. ``But I'm  
not far off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves don't seem too concerned about Glavine's early woes,  
even though he always has been a fast starter in the past. Prior to 
this season, he was 24-13 with a 2.66 ERA in the first month of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a slump,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``It's just like  
a hitter who goes a few games without getting a hit. Same thing for 
a pitcher. They go through slumps, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there was ever a pitcher who could handle the fickleness of  
the game, it's Glavine. He's been there for all of Atlanta's good 
times during this decade, including his eight-inning, one-hit 
performance in the deciding game of the '95 World Series. But he's 
also been the losing pitcher in the final game of the NLCS the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In every case, his poker-faced expression never changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's real mature,'' Lopez said. ``He's know how to handle it.  
It's just a matter of trying a little harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine looks like his old self when throwing the slider and  
fastball on the outside corner of the plate. But he's struggled 
with his best pitch, the changeup, and he's been hammered when he 
tries to come inside to right-handed hitters with the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he throws the changeup, it's not slow and sinking like it  
was last year,'' Lopez said. ``And he's leaving his fastball over 
the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Mark Wohlers, who was finally dumped by the Braves  
because of control problems, Glavine's command of the strike zone 
may be a little too precise. He's only had four unintentional walks 
through his first four starts, an average of 1.4 per nine innings. 
His career average is three walks per nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at a lot of guys and sometimes they've struggled  
because they're not throwing strikes and walking people,'' Glavine 
said. ``That's not my problem. My problem is too many strikes that 
are good. I'm catching too much of the plate.''

<HEADLINE> United Developing Turbulence Sensor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Passengers had settled in for the night on a long  
flight from Tokyo to Honolulu when it felt like a giant fist 
slammed into the United Airlines jumbo jet. A pocket of air 
turbulence hit with such violence in the late 1997 incident that 
one woman suffered a broken neck and died while 100 other 
passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Turbulence often strikes without warning, but now United and two  
technology companies -- AlliedSignal Aerospace and Coherent 
Technologies -- hope to develop a system that could give passengers 
a one-minute warning to fasten their seat belts to avoid being 
tossed around the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence-detection system being sought by the No. 1 U.S.  
airline is at least three years from being implemented and would 
provide no guarantee of an end to stomach-wrenching gyrations. But 
safety officials, airlines and their employees are hoping it will 
go a long way toward reducing the dozens of serious injuries that 
occur annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'd give us a 60-second warning so we could get everybody  
seated and hanging on,'' Bill Cotton, United's manager of air 
traffic and flight systems, said Wednesday as the search for the 
warning system was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's kind of like closing the door after you've let  
the horse out of the barn: turning on the seat belt sign after 
we've run into turbulence,'' said Cotton, a pilot for 32 years who 
flies 747s and 767s. ``The new radar would be far more valuable to 
pilots in knowing exactly when we were going to encounter 
turbulence than anything that's available today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration says that outside of fatal  
accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to 
passengers and flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that United is taking the lead and developing  
technology to predict turbulence,'' said FAA spokeswoman Tammy 
Jones. ``Helping passengers avoid injuries caused by turbulence is 
one of the initiatives under the FAA's safer skies agenda and we 
support anything that would achieve that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots for decades have used airborne radar to steer clear of  
rain and thunderstorms often associated with turbulence, but there 
is no means for detecting bumpy weather that occurs in so-called 
clear-air conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	That has forced pilots to rely on the reports of airplanes that  
have flown the same route ahead of them, which could have 
disastrous consequences since clear-air turbulence often develops 
quickly and is concentrated over small areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Turbulence is created when the fastest winds in the jet stream  
slow down, causing upward air motion. Airflows over mountains and 
the heating of land masses during daytime are other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	While pilots often warn passengers to keep seat belts fastened  
while seated, there are few ways to enforce it. And turbulence 
often can cause loose objects to fly around the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	In January alone, five people were injured when a Tokyo-bound  
United jumbo jet from Chicago hit severe turbulence. Ten days 
later, 22 were hurt when a Continental Airlines flight from Tokyo 
to Honolulu hit severe turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	To combat that, a prototype developed by Coherent Technologies  
Inc. would use a newly developed infrared radar to transmit energy 
beams up to 18 miles ahead of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Those beams would be reflected by the microscopic particles  
suspended in the earth's atmosphere and would provide a picture of 
``wash'' or turbulent air patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	A systems test in March, sponsored by NASA's aviation safety  
program ``demonstrated we could see at significant range and showed 
we can measure strength (of turbulence) and provide time of impact 
predictions to pilots,'' said Paul A. Reveley, Coherent's director 
of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now is working with AlliedSignal Inc. to combine its  
infrared radar with AlliedSignal Aerospace's new radar that is 
capable of better detecting turbulence during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the program still are working out the costs for  
the joint all-weather radar as well as key features, including 
whether warnings would be relayed to the cockpit or immediately 
into the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking to other major carriers to get a feel for their  
reaction because we want to develop a product that meets the needs 
of the industry as a whole,'' Reveley said. 
</P>
<P>
	If additional tests are successful and have a low false-alarm  
rate, the new radars likely would be installed on all of United's 
585 planes, said airline spokesman Joe Hopkins.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Upsets Germany in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scotland beat Germany for the first time in 40 years, getting a  
66th-minute goal from Don Hutchison in a 1-0 victory in an 
exhibition game Wednesday night at Bremen. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland had been winless in six games against the Germans since  
1959. 
</P>
<P>
	At Arnhem, Youssef Chippo scored in the 59th minute and  
Salaheddine Bassir scored 10 minutes later as Morocco beat the 
Netherlands 2-1 in another exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	African player of the year Mustafa Hadji set up both goals. Ruud  
van Nistelrooij scored in the final minute for the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy played a scoreless tie against Serbia at Zagreb, and  
England conceded its first goal against Hungary in seven games 
since 1981 in a 1-1 tie at Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	With England missing 14 regulars because of injury, Alan Shearer  
put the visitors ahead with a penalty kick in the 21st minute. But 
Janos Hrutka tied the score on a 25-yard free kick with 13 minutes 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dublin, Ireland ended Sweden's nine-game unbeaten streak,  
winning 2-0 on goals by Graham Kavanagh in the 75th minute and Mark 
Kennedy in the 77th. Kavanaugh was playing his first international 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	In European Championship qualifiers, Norway (3-1-1) won 4-1 at  
Georgia (1-3-1) and took over the Group Two lead. Tore Andre Flo 
scored twice, and Steffen Iversen and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got one 
goal each -- all in the first 34 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania (0-1-3) and Latvia (2-1-2) tied 0-0 in the same group  
while Austria (3-1-1), a 9-0 loser against Spain a month ago, took 
over the Group Six lead with a 7-0 rout over San Marino (0-6) at 
Graz.

<HEADLINE> Realtors Get More for Their Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- A new study showing that real-estate  
brokers sell their own houses for 3.1 percent more on average than 
their clients' homes isn't getting much credence from area brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's baloney, I really do,'' said Janet Stahlman,  
co-owner of Linn Realty Group in Bellefonte. ``We don't determine 
the prices. Something is only worth what someone is willing to pay 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added another Linn co-owner, JoAnn Knupp: ``The business is too  
competitive to have anyone pulling strings. We make money no matter 
which property we sell. If they don't want mine, they're going to 
want someone else's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new study of more than 21,000 home sales in Texas also  
indicates that brokers' homes do not languish on the market any 
longer to get those higher prices, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commissions fail to give agents an incentive to work hard to  
get a better price for you,'' explained Abdullah Yavas, a professor 
of business administration at Penn State, one of three universities 
that conducted the study. ``They would rather get the deal done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While brokers work to secure the best possible price for their  
clients, they are also motivated by a need to work quickly. At the 
same time they are selling homes, they are also competing for new 
clients -- and vying with other brokers to find buyers for listed 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissions from a sale range from 2 to 10 percent, although  
sometimes they must split that with their brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
	If the average commission amounts to 6 percent, that means for  
an extra $1,000 in the sales price, they get a grand total of $60. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if it's their own property, that's $1,000 more for them,''  
Yavas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study -- which also involved researchers from the University  
of Texas at San Antonio and the Florida Atlantic University -- 
examined the sale of 21,235 houses in Fort Worth between 1993 and 
1995. Nearly 400 houses were owned by brokers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The data included age, square footage and location of the  
houses. The listings also detailed the number of bathrooms, when a 
house was sold and whether someone lived there at the time of the 
sale. That information allowed the researchers to control for 
variables, Yavas said. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, brokers' houses were listed at prices 3 percent  
higher than the rest of the group. Yet they sold just as quickly, 
leading researchers to assume the brokers must have worked harder 
to sell their own. 
</P>
<P>
	If homeowners believe Yavas' research, why not simply force  
their broker to boost listing prices by 3 percent? Yavas said it's 
not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a trade-off between getting a high price and selling  
it quickly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Yavas, he hasn't had a chance to test his theory  
personally -- despite moving from Iowa to Illinois to Michigan to 
State College, Pa., in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still haven't bought a house yet,'' he said with a shrug.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flood Out of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- Nearly 2,000 refugees from Kosovo fled  
into Albania early today, telling of a new Serb campaign to clear 
villages in southern Kosovo and alluding to a possible new 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Macedonia, aid officials warned that the refugee  
camps were so overcrowded that rioting could soon break out. 
</P>
<P>
	Several refugees told reporters in Albania that Serb police  
surrounded their villages Tuesday and told them to leave 
immediately. They made the 12-mile journey on tractors, wagons and 
other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Several refugees claimed Serb troops had stopped some vehicles  
along the way and took away young and middle-aged men. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhen Berisha said he first tried to flee his village, Madanaj,  
on April 14 but he was stopped by Serb forces, who told him to 
return home because NATO was bombing near the border. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came to our houses and said `Now is the day. You have to  
leave,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several refugees said they had seen bodies lying in the streets  
of Meje, a village near Djakovica, in southwestern Kosovo. One 
refugee, Lule Ndue, said she saw scores of bodies when she passed 
through the area between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Another refugee, Rahime Becaj, said she saw Serb police rounding  
up young men when she traveled through the same village earlier 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, up to 5,000 ethnic Albanians entered Macedonia on  
Tuesday -- the highest single-day total in weeks. They were 
apparently the leading edge of a major exodus touched off by 
intensified Serb ethnic cleansing south and east of Kosovo's 
provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge. Many more are coming,'' said Azem Rrahmani, who  
said Serb police expelled him from the town of Urosevac. He was 
among more than 3,000 refugees that reached the Blace border post 
after being herded on to buses and trains. 
</P>
<P>
	As darkness fell, workers at the border pounded stakes and dug  
latrines as a tent city grew in a muddy riverside field intended as 
a transit point. Refugees were handed plastic sacks of water and 
food before being led to tents. 
</P>
<P>
	To the east, up to 2,000 others entered at the Lojane border  
post, out of the easy reach of aid groups, said Ron Redmond, a 
spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The new onslaught of more than 13,000 refugees in four days  
further stressed Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency warned today that camps packed beyond  
capacity in Macedonia were ``on the verge of rioting'' because of 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get another trainload or two and a few busloads again  
today, it's really going to be a horrific situation there in terms 
of overcrowding,'' said spokesman Kris Janowski in Geneva, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Macedonian government, led by its Slavic majority, insists  
the country can accept no more refugees and worries about the 
demographic scales tipping in favor of ethnic Albanians, who 
comprised a third of the country's 2.1 million people before the 
Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials estimate that at least 136,000 ethnic Albanians  
from Kosovo are presently in Macedonia: about 79,000 staying in 
private homes and the rest in six government-run camps. Macedonian 
officials place the refugee total at 183,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although conditions in some camps have improved considerably,  
cases of measles, hepatitis and dysentery have surfaced recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid this is a sign of things to come,'' said Redmond.  
</P>
<P>
	Efforts were being made to expand some of the existing camps and  
construct a new area for up to 15,000 people. But Macedonian 
officials have delayed plans to expand the refugee sites because of 
disputes over who will install sanitation and other systems, aid 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now jammed to the breaking point ... we will be seeing  
people sleeping in the open,'' said Redmond. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Radusa camp, 20 miles northwest of the Macedonian capital  
of Skopje, two buses carrying more than 150 refugees arrived early 
Tuesday. With no place to accommodate the newcomers, they were 
forced to sleep in makeshift shower areas and in a tent used as the 
camp's school.

<HEADLINE> Dow Opens Up 41.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly higher in early Wall Street  
trading Wednesday as investors, feeling increasingly confident 
about the world economy, continued a buying spree that included a 
wide variety of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 41.23 at 10,872.94 after rising 113.12 Tuesday to a new closing 
high of 10,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 3.70 at 1,366.50, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 3.32 at 2,599.09 but regaining lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some selling in technology issues, traders were  
optimistically picking up stocks on the growing belief that the 
second half of this year would bring strong corporate profits. The 
current crop of earnings reports has generally been very positive, 
including some pleasant surprises like IBM's first-quarter results, 
and analysts said that bodes well for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A big impetus to buy has come from increasing signs that the  
global economy is recovering. That has increased trader appetites 
for economically-sensitive companies like Dow component Alcoa, 
which was up 2 7/8 at 58 1/4 today. Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber was up 1 1/8 at 
55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities,  
said there was some caution in the market today as traders awaited 
an earnings report from Amazon.com, scheduled to be released after 
the close of trading. Investors have been a little skittish about 
Internet stocks lately, and Amazon's results were being watched 
closely as a possible harbinger of what's to come for other online 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 114.36 million 
shares, down from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.29 at 644.56, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.04 at 774.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.09 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 4.07 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.07percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.52 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Klebold Girlfriend Bought Three Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities on Wednesday further linked  
an 18-year-old student to the Columbine High School gunmen, saying 
she bought three of the four guns used in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had said gunman Dylan Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn  
Anderson, purchased two of the weapons. On Wednesday, they 
confirmed she bought three -- two shotguns and a rifle -- last fall. 
A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun used in the attack has not yet 
been traced. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
said. ``Did she supply the weapons to them with some idea of what 
they were planning to do with them? That's still one of the major 
things we want to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have repeatedly said Ms. Anderson is considered a  
witness and not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also reaffirmed that three young men detained near the  
school shortly after the April 20 attack had been cleared of any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the  
three youths, who were handcuffed by a SWAT team near the school, 
were ``subjects of our investigation'' and that he was suspicious 
of comments they made during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Wednesday, however, that the three have been  
eliminated as suspects and added that the sheriff had outdated 
information when he made his comments to the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under  
black trench coats, killed 12 classmates and a teacher before 
turning their guns on themselves. They also wounded 23 people and 
planted more than 50 bombs at the school. Diaries show the plot had 
been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 75 detectives and crime scene experts are pursuing  
more than 600 leads, but only ``some are very good leads that may 
percolate to the top of the list,'' said another sheriff's 
spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the medical problem cited by the Marines when they  
rejected Harris just five days before the attack. Those close to 
the family have said he was seeing a psychiatrist and taking 
psychiatric medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, the son of a retired Air Force officer, was told by a  
recruiter visiting his suburban home on April 15 that he had been 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disqualified because of a medical prescription,'' said  
Sgt. Marc Ayalin, a Marine spokesman. He declined to identify the 
medication or the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle last  
fall, after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at 
least one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 
years of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told the AP that the FBI has  
enhanced a surveillance videotape of the cafeteria, where several 
students were wounded during the rampage. The tape was returned to 
Colorado for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men cleared by investigators may have belonged  
to the gunmen's social circle known as the Trenchcoat Mafia, Stone 
said. The teens deny it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. However, producers for 
the ``Sally Jesse Raphael'' program identified them as Matt Nalty, 
Matt Akard and Jim Brunetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunetti said on the TV show, which was taped Tuesday and is  
scheduled to air Thursday, that the three were held for an hour and 
questioned about whether they knew the Trenchcoat Mafia. ``We've 
never heard of them, before that day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, families continued to bury victims of the massacre.  
</P>
<P>
	One thousand people gathered at Trinity Christian Center to  
remember Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old who dreamed of becoming a 
Navy fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waterford, Wis., 450 people gathered at United Methodist  
Church to bury John Tomlin, 16, in a green-and-gold casket -- the 
colors of his beloved Green Bay Packers. His family moved to 
Colorado four years ago from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County school system planned to hold a memorial on  
Sunday at Red Rocks Amphitheater in nearby Morrison.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Hamstrung in Bid for Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens thinks there are more  
important things to worry about than breaking records. One such 
thing is his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens left Tuesday night's start against the Texas Rangers  
after two innings when the back of his left leg stiffened. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to stay in the rotation and he's not thinking about  
going on the disabled list -- although neither option was ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said the discomfort didn't affect his pitching, but  
something seemed out of whack -- he allowed five runs in the first 
inning. The New York Yankees got him off the hook by rallying for a 
7-6 victory, capped by two runs in the ninth off closer John 
Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Clemens with a no-decision. He remains tied for the AL  
record, having won 17 straight decisions. He'll try again for No. 
18 in his next start, but there's some question about when that 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
	His turn comes Sunday in Kansas City and Clemens plans to make  
it. Asked if he could be headed to the DL, he said, ``I hope not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The injury has been there awhile, off and on, but I thought I  
could work through it,'' said Clemens, who is treating his leg with 
muscle relaxants and ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens hurt his hamstring while running, but he wouldn't say  
when. He said he tweaked it during his previous start, when he beat 
Texas in New York to tie the record, but he didn't expect it to be 
a problem Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt strong warming up and in the first inning,'' said  
Clemens, who had bought tickets for 50 family and friends to watch 
his first attempt at the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens didn't look strong. The first five Texas hitters reached  
base, prompting a visit from pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. A 
grounder to short turned into a fielder's choice for the first out, 
but a run scored to put the Rangers ahead 3-0. When a two-run 
double followed, Dan Naulty started warming up in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens retired the next five batters, but he went to full  
counts on three of them -- a sure sign he was struggling. Then, when 
the Yankees batted in the top of the third, Clemens talked things 
over with the trainer and coaches and decided to call it a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go out and continue, but I think I probably would  
have made it worse,'' said Clemens, whose ERA shot to 5.47. ``It 
was in my best interest not to return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens hung around and cheered the comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying, `Way to go, guys, great win,''' said Clemens,  
who hasn't lost since last May 29. ``I really don't even worry 
about the streak. There's more things to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second time in three starts Clemens was hit hard.  
On April 15, Baltimore took a 4-0 lead and was ahead 7-6 when 
Clemens left after three innings. New York bailed him out then by 
winning 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens also had a rocky first inning last Thursday against the  
Rangers, but he ended up giving up only two runs in seven innings. 
He closed that outing by retiring the last 14 batters. 
</P>
<P>
	That victory tied the AL record set by Cleveland's Johnny Allen  
in 1936-37 and matched by Baltimore's Dave McNally in 1968-69. The 
major league record is 24 by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants 
from 1936-37.

<HEADLINE> Boy Bids $1 Million on Internet Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Ont. (AP) -- A 13-year-old New Jersey boy probably  
won't soon forget who Sir John A. Macdonald is after bidding 
$900,000 on the Internet for Canada's first prime minister's bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's parents have also discovered their son placed several  
bids totalling more than $1 million over the last month using the 
facilities of eBay, a giant U.S.-based Internet auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not supposed to talk about it,'' the boy told the  
Kingston Whig-Standard on Saturday afternoon. ``I'm off the 
Internet now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his eBay shopping spree, the boy -- identified by The  
Star-Ledger of Newark in Wednesday's editions as Andrew Tyler of 
Haddonfield, N.J. -- placed several other bids including $15,000 for 
a 1955 Ford convertible and $125,000 for a Superman comic. He also 
placed bids on a physician's office clinic in Florida, two mobile 
kitchens for movie shoots and a Van Gogh painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Auction House says the boy sent his bid on the 1860s  
era bedroom suite, purported to have once been owned by Canada's 
father of confederation, last Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The suite went up for auction April 15 and had gained bids of up  
to $12,000 before the boy's bid arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of eBay's bidding system, the boy -- who has become what  
is known at eBay as a `deadbeat' bidder -- would have been billed 
only $400,000 because his bid hit the reserve bid price demanded by 
the suite's owners and no other bidder offered more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction House owner Aubrey Garrett spoke to the boy's mother  
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said he bought a $400,000 bedroom suite and she said, `I'm  
hyperventilating','' Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at this as a funny story,'' the boy's father  
said Saturday, asking that reporters stop calling his home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, eBay spokeswoman Jennifer Chou said minors are not  
allowed to place bids. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she admitted the company operates on an honour system, and  
anyone with a computer online can sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet Auction House is considering legal action against  
eBay for failing to head off the prank. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay officials said Monday they had suspended the boy's  
account.

<HEADLINE> Senate Bill Would Limit TV Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters and cable TV companies could air  
violent shows only at times when children are unlikely to be 
watching under a bill introduced this week in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would direct the Federal Communications Commission to  
decide the time period in which television stations and most cable 
programmers would be allowed to air such programs. It couldn't be 
when children would comprise a substantial part of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also would decide what constitutes a violent program.  
</P>
<P>
	The bill would apply to all cable channels except premium ones  
such as HBO and Showtime and those offered on a pay-per-view basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., offered the bill Monday night,  
citing last week's shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the National Association of Broadcasters nor the  
National Cable Television Association had immediate comment on the 
bill. Its prospects are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent events in Littleton, Colo., serve to highlight the  
sad and unfortunate fact that violence in our culture is begetting 
violence by our youth,'' Hollings said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------

<P>
	The bill is S. 876

<HEADLINE> Report: Bayer Plans Plant Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German drug and chemical giant Bayer  
plans to save about $382 million by closing four or five 
pharmaceutical plants worldwide over the next three years, a 
business weekly reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will include German and other European operations,  
company chairman Manfred Schneider was quoted as saying by the 
publication Wirtschaftswoche. In Germany, Bayer's pharmaceutical 
businesses will be merged, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer officials were not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Schneider also said Bayer plans to build a second biotechnology  
plant, probably in Germany, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer releases first-quarter data Friday. Analysts expect a drop  
in earnings after Bayer revealed a 10 percent fall in combined 
January and February sales.

<HEADLINE> Actors Lift 'Ring Around the Moon' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The champagne may not be served in the most  
stylish way possible, but there still is plenty of fizz in ``Ring 
Round the Moon,'' Christopher Fry's adaptation of French playwright 
Jean Anouilh's comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the effervescence is provided by two actors -- Toby  
Stephens, who fortunately plays twins, and Marian Seldes, 
Broadway's reigning interpreter of grandes dames -- of both the 
domestic and European varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	This elegant comedy demands the lightest of touches, something  
director Gerald Gutierrez doesn't always supply, either in his 
choice of supporting players -- whose acting varies wildly -- or in 
his uneven pacing of the play's three leisurely acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln Center Theater production, which opened Wednesday at  
Broadway's Belasco Theater, looks delightful. Designer John Lee 
Beatty's setting of a winter garden in a French chateau is a giant 
white birdcage. The structure exudes an airiness and buoyancy that 
immediately lifts the audience, even before the story unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
	Anouilh's early 20th century fairy tale (the play is set in  
1912) concerns twins, two brothers with opposite personalities and 
philosophies. Hugo is the cynic, a petulant manipulator who wants 
to disrupt his brother's engagement to a wealthy young woman. 
Frederic is a romantic, insecure and perpetually trying to please. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo hires a young ballet dancer to flirt with Frederic and win  
his heart. She does her job too well. It takes the intervention of 
the aunt, played by Seldes, to set everyone straight and pave the 
way for a happy ending, matching the right girl with the right boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens, the son of Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens, does  
distinctive double duty. His Hugo is smugly confident, a peacock 
waiting to be plucked; his Frederic all a-quiver with trying to say 
and do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Seldes' Madame Desmermortes may be confined to a wheelchair but  
she rules the stage. With a withering stare and a frosty voice just 
the right side of condescension, the actress tosses off Anouilh's 
bons mots with the authority of a championship tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
	The young ladies, played by Haviland Morris and Gretchen Egolf,  
are not nearly as memorable. A jarring Joyce Van Patten, as the 
ballet dancer's ambitious mother, seems to be in another play 
entirely, possibly a Neil Simon comedy rather than an elegant 
French comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anouilh's story eventually trips over itself, introducing too  
many subplots that are more confusing than they are funny. Such 
pros as Simon Jones and Fritz Weaver are defeated by the material, 
and Gutierrez has them pushing too hard for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several veteran actors shine in minor roles, especially Frances  
Conroy as a dithering assistant to the despotic madame. Richard 
Clarke crumbles effectively as an aging butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is Seldes on hand to tie up all the loose plot  
points at the end of the evening. ``Ring Round the Moon,'' first 
done on Broadway in 1950, shows its age, but with her and Stephens 
around, this ``Moon'' often shines brightly.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Park-Ranger Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TILLAMOOK, Ore. (AP) -- A man accused of robbing two unarmed park  
rangers of their truck before marching them into dense forest and 
shooting them, killing one, was charged with murder Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers Danny Blumenthal and John ``Jack'' Kerwin were  
inspecting a bathroom Tuesday at Oswald West State Park, about 65 
miles west of Portland, when they encountered Larry G. Cole inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole, 52, told the rangers he was tired of sleeping on the  
ground and wanted their truck, according to Candace Nelson, a 
neighbor of Kerwin's who talked to the ranger about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	He demanded their keys and wallets, which they gave him, then  
forced the rangers to walk across the highway and up a steep, 
wooded path about one-quarter mile. He tried to tie them to a tree, 
but apparently frustrated in his efforts, pointed a pistol at their 
heads and opened fire, police charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal, 50, was killed. Kerwin, 51, lay motionless on the  
ground, feigning death, despite the gunshots to his jaw. When the 
gunman left, he made his way to the highway and flagged down a 
truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Cole then fled the oceanside park in the ranger  
truck. He was arrested about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, police said a second man who was near the scene  
of the shootings was wanted for questioning.

<HEADLINE> Fortune Brands To Leave Connecticut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Fortune Brands Inc. said moving its  
corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Illinois, and cutting 
about 60 jobs, will save $25 million to $30 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune Brands Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas C.  
Hays said the move from Greenwich to Lincolnshire, Ill., will be 
cost effective because the corporate office will then be located in 
the same building as the company's home and office businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's spirits and wine business is based in nearby  
Deerfield, Ill. Together, the three businesses represent more than 
80 percent of Fortune Brands' operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``But even with these compelling benefits, this was a difficult  
decision that will affect many dedicated associates and the 
community, and was only reached after extensive consideration,'' 
Hays said in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer products company now has about 185 corporate office  
employees, 150 of those at its corporate headquarters in Greenwich 
and the remainder in Deerfield and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune Brands has operating companies with brands in home and  
office products, golf equipment, spirits and wine. Brands include 
Moen faucets; Titleist, Cobra and FootJoy golf equipment, and Jim 
Beam bourbon, Whyte &AMP; Mackay Scotch and Canyon Road wines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to reduce corporate personnel by about a  
third. Spokesman Clarkson Hine said the company has offered 
employees a voluntary early retirement incentive program, which 
will be followed by a reduction in force. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune Brands expects to record charges of approximately $60  
million to $70 million over the remainder of 1999 for 
restructuring, the move and other nonrecurring charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the corporate downsizing, the company plans to  
initiate further restructuring steps over the next 12 to 18 months 
to reduce its operational costs. The company said it expects an 
additional restructuring charge of between $100 million and $150 
million, but it said the moves will result in substantial savings 
when fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune Brands said it also has decided to change the method of  
accounting for evaluating the recovery of goodwill and other 
intangibles. The change, from an undiscounted cash flow basis to a 
discounted cash flow basis, will result in a noncash charge of 
approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Suburb OKs Anti-Gang Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Leaders of this blue-collar Chicago suburb  
that mobster Al Capone once called home have a message for 
modern-day gangsters: Shape up or get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an ordinance approved Tuesday by the Town Board, anyone  
proved to be involved in illegal gang activity would be given 60 
days to leave Cicero or face a $500-a-day fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Gang members who promise not to commit more crimes could stay,  
but would be subject to a one-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this town are petrified,'' said board member Mike  
Frederick. ``Some people are afraid to let their kids go outside 
because they're afraid they'll get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials said the ordinance protects gang members' rights.  
Officials must hold a hearing and prove a person is a gang member 
and involved in crimes, said town attorney Barry Pechter. 
</P>
<P>
	Once banned, a gang member may not return, even to visit  
relatives. The ordinance also would apply to minors, whose parents 
either would have to move or give custody of their children to 
someone in another town, said town President Betty Loren-Maltese. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the measure is fraught with problems -- including the  
fact that the accused do not have to be convicted of their alleged 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't address crimes committed by people who are not  
gang members or whether a gang member can be kicked out for past 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has so many holes in it, we don't know how it's  
going to all sort out,'' said Jay Miller, executive director of the 
American Civil Liberties Union's Chicago office. ``I don't 
understand what they're doing here and I don't think they 
understand it either. It's almost silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said his group has no plans to sue the town unless an  
ousted gang member asks for representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials said they expect legal challenges but maintain  
the measure is necessary to fight crime in the Chicago suburb of 
70,000. The ordinance was endorsed by 95 percent of voters two 
weeks ago, and the seven-member Town Board unanimously enacted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero has long had a reputation for mob activity. Capone, the  
Chicago mob boss during the Prohibition era, ran his bootlegging 
empire from the town after being driven from Chicago. And the 
federal government has been investigating corruption in the town 
for the last three years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jungle Fighting Camp To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT SHERMAN, Panama (AP) -- It was a three-week trip to the  
tropics for the young man from Texas. The weather was hot and the 
water was close. But this was no vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Avellaneda is a soldier. He came to this jungle base that  
once trained fighters for the Vietnam War to crawl through the mud 
and fight off mosquitos in one of the base's last military 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	After four decades, the base will be turned over to Panama on  
June 30 as part of the handover of all the U.S. installations here 
-- and finally the Panama Canal itself -- by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Sherman, a 23,000-acre reservation on the Caribbean side of  
the canal, is the United States' only major jungle training camp. 
Located in the rain forest, it is home to snakes, monkeys, birds 
and wild cats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Avellaneda, a sergeant sent down from Fort Campbell, Ky.,  
wasn't admiring the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
	He was guarding a swamp with his M-4 carbine, his uniform  
covered in mud and his face painted. He dabbed insect repellent on 
his uniform, but it was no match for the mosquitos. He was tired 
after spending the night in the swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough experience, but interesting, too,''  
Avellaneda said, catching his breath. ``It rains and it's sunny and 
hot. There are a lot of mosquitos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman was built at the beginning of the century, but the Army  
started to use it for jungle training only in 1953. Many of the 
American soldiers who fought in Vietnam trained here, and the base 
also played host to joint exercises by U.S. and Latin American 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
	With its hot, humid climate and flat and hilly sections, Fort  
Sherman has been an ideal place for U.S. soldiers to learn the 
ropes of tropical combat. U.S. Navy sailors also have trained on 
the fort's Caribbean coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only place to train in a tropical area with a  
structure like this,'' said Sgt. David Steward, an Ohioan in the 
Jungle Operations Training Battalion based at Ford Sherman. ``This 
has been like a school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sherman closes, the U.S. Army plans to train its soldiers  
in joint exercises with other countries that have tropical rain 
forests, including Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama, which doesn't have an army, plans to develop Fort  
Sherman into a resort for ecological and adventure tourism.

<HEADLINE> Casino, Lottery Moratorium Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharply divided, a panel studying gambling in  
America voted Wednesday to recommend a moratorium on the spread of 
casinos, lotteries and slot machines around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission cannot impose a  
moratorium, but its report will call for ``a pause'' in the growth 
of legalized gambling and encourage state and local governments to 
form their own gambling study commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some policy-makers at all levels may want to impose an  
explicit moratorium on gambling expansion while awaiting further 
research and assessment,'' reads language adopted by the 
commission, which has until June 18 to submit its report to 
Congress, the White House, governors and Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-member panel split over the language, particularly the  
use of the word ``moratorium.'' Five commissioners approved the 
wording, while four voted no. At least one pro-gambling commission 
member, MGM Grand Inc. chairman J. Terrence Lanni, now plans to 
write a minority report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a problem with the notion that we're going to stop the  
world or pause or create a moratorium'' just to wait for more 
research, said commissioner Robert Loescher, an Alaska businessman 
and native American. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, who represents casino workers as  
general president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees 
Union, said commissioners who support gambling endorse efforts to 
address its social costs, but the panel's gambling opponents 
``don't give a damn'' about jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the language encouraging a moratorium, Wilhelm  
proposed an additional sentence encouraging an expansion of 
gambling in ``economically depressed communities for which the 
economic benefits of gaming are most clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission defeated that language, leaving Wilhelm to warn  
that the report is becoming ``one-sided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our record is that in many kinds of communities in this  
country, including in particularly economically depressed 
communities -- urban and rural, as well as Indian reservations -- 
that there is a net positive economic impact'' from casinos, 
Wilhelm said. ``But you can't find that in any of these drafts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commission Chairwoman Kay James pleaded for patience, saying,  
``We still have the ability'' to achieve consensus. The report is a 
work in progress, so ``anything can change,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the casino industry's chief lobbyist in  
Washington, said he believes the commission will reconsider the 
disputed language at its final meetings in May or June. ``It's 
still just part of a draft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In approving the moratorium idea, the commission called for what  
amounts to a national deep breath -- a moment to consider gambling's 
proliferation before more casinos are built and lottery games 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're saying is, there's not enough information, we need  
more research, we need more data, and whatever direction you're 
going to go, a pause is a prudent course at this point in time,'' 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the commission in 1997 to conduct a two-year  
study of the economic and social effects of legalized gambling, 
which has proliferated during the 25 years since the last national 
study. President Clinton and the congressional leaders of both 
parties divided up the nine commission appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous native American tribes refused to provide information  
on the casinos they operate, maintaining they are being asked to 
disclose proprietary financial information. Gambling commission 
members chose not to begin a court battle with the National Indian 
Gaming Commission, but James said the final report will note the 
lack of cooperation and recommend that Congress find a way to 
provide the information.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Look To Finish Off Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Nobody understands better than the Phoenix  
Coyotes how difficult it is to go from where they are to where they 
want to be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes have a 3-1 lead on the St. Louis Blues and could  
close out the first-round series and move into the second round for 
the first time in 12 years with a victory in Game 5 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But their pursuit of the Stanley Cup has ended in the first  
round seven times since 1987, and the Coyotes have been 
tantalizingly close. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the then Winnipeg Jets had a 3-1 lead on Edmonton but  
lost the next three games while the Oilers went on to win the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg was ahead of Vancouver 3-1 in 1992, and the Coyotes had  
a 2-1 lead on Detroit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the other team swept the last three games and took  
momentum into the second round while the Coyotes cleaned out their 
lockers for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't over by any means,'' said Rick Tocchet, who helped  
Pittsburgh win the Cup in 1992. ``It's a long series, and they're 
not going to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning that fourth game is going to be a bear,'' coach Jim  
Schoenfeld said. ``As well as we played, and I'm extremely pleased, 
I think we're going to have to play much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes earned their commanding lead with a 2-1 victory  
Tuesday night, their third straight one-goal victory since the 
Blues beat them 3-1 in the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Displaying the kind of self-sacrifice that Schoenfeld called  
for, Phoenix players blocked 14 shots and blanked St. Louis in four 
power plays, an area in which the Blues were dominant the first 
three contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Adams, back after two games out to rest a groin pull,  
scored the first goal, and Dallas Drake got the winner with 35 
seconds left in the second period, deflecting a shot by Teppo 
Numminen as Grant Fuhr gave up his 11th goal of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third period, Keith Tkachuk frequently braved the hardest  
slap shot in the NHL, flopping crosswise on the ice in front of St. 
Louis' Al MacInnis to keep MacInnis from unleashing his 100 mph 
blasts on Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real frustrating,'' Blues center Terry Yake said. ``We  
were in good position in Game 2 to maybe take a 2-0 lead and come 
home and take control of the series, and here we are in just the 
opposite situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numminen is the only Coyote who played a full season with  
Winnipeg in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Tkachuk, the team captain, played in 17 games that season, and  
believes the past means nothing because of the turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 20 other guys here,'' Tkachuk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Blues defenseman Chris Pronger sees hope for extending the  
series and returning to St. Louis for a sixth game on Sunday -- not 
in the Coyotes' past but in his team's 14-4-1 record in its last 19 
regular-season road games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 20 games or so, we've shown we can win on the  
road,'' Pronger said. ``We've won in there before, and now we've 
got to win two there to win the series. It will be an uphill 
battle. We just have to take the next game and not look too far 
ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Second Dragging Death Trial To Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The judge in the second trial over the  
dragging death of a black man agreed Wednesday to move the case out 
of Jasper after the defense argued the town may be inclined to 
convict the white defendant to salvage its image. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Lawrence Russell Brewer will be tried won't be made public  
until May 14. Judge Monte Lawlis said jury selection may not begin 
until July. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, District Attorney Guy James Gray persuaded Lawlis to  
reject defense efforts to move Brewer's trial from Jasper. But then 
Gray decided he didn't want the defense to be able to bring up the 
change of venue issue in an appeal if Brewer is convicted. So Gray, 
too, asked the judge to move the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm trying to do is avoid a sideshow,'' Gray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, is one of three white men accused of chaining James  
Byrd Jr. to a pickup truck last June and dragging him to death for 
three miles along a rural road. In February, John William King, 24, 
was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer smiled and shook his attorneys' hands after Wednesday's  
hearing. The attorneys said Jasper County residents would be 
unfairly inclined to clean up the image of Jasper, a racially mixed 
timber town that became infamous nationwide after Byrd's gruesome 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray and defense attorney Doug Barlow both refused to comment on  
areas under consideration for Brewer's trial. The likeliest place 
appears to Georgetown, a city of 22,000 about 200 miles west of 
Jasper, near Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials there confirmed that Jasper authorities contacted them  
a week ago about the possibility of holding the trial there. Other 
possible locations are Corpus Christi, Kerrville and New Braunfels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said location doesn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
	``A jury in some other county is going to be just about like a  
jury in Jasper or anywhere else,'' he said. ``They're going to 
decide this case on facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial date for the third defendant, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, has  
not been set.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Charged After Beaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A University of Evansville baseball  
player who was hit in the face by a pitch as he stood about 15 feet 
from home plate has charged the Wichita State pitcher who hit him 
with assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Molina, who had fractures of three bones around his left  
eye, said Ben Christensen hit him intentionally while warming up 
before Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina filed assault charges with Wichita police.  
</P>
<P>
	``My main concern right now is about seeing again,'' Molina  
said. ``They told me today that my vision is 20/400 in my left eye, 
and that there's a chance I might never get my vision all the way 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen was quoted in the Wichita State Eagle as saying that  
he threw toward Molina to keep him from timing pitches while on 
deck, but that he never intended to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Valley Conference is investigating.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods jumped a larger-than-expected 2 percent in 
March, raising hopes that better days may be ahead for America's 
beleaguered manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the March  
increase in orders for durable goods followed a 3.9 percent decline 
in February, which was revised upward to show more strength than 
the initial estimate of a 4.9 percent plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe into  
recession has severely cut into American exports and also opened up 
U.S. manufacturers in such sectors as steel to increased 
competition from cheaper priced foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has been performing well,  
manufacturers have been forced to cut more than 300,000 jobs in the 
past year as America's trade deficit hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted that the better-than-expected March rise in  
orders represented the fourth gain in factory demand in the past 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector may be turning the corner,'' said  
Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. ``It is 
too soon to declare an end to manufacturing's long hard winter, but 
spring appears to be bringing a new bloom to this sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, said that while the rebound in March was skewed by 
strength in the volatile transportation sector, there were 
encouraging signs of strength in other sectors, including consumer 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The indication of new life in manufacturing helped lift spirits  
even higher on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 
at another record, although prices fell on the inflation-sensitive 
bond market as traders adopted a more cautious approach before 
release of a report Thursday on wage pressures in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall 2 percent in durable goods orders was led by a 3.6  
percent jump in demand for autos, airplanes and other 
transportation goods. Without this increase, the overall advance 
would be been a smaller 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for industrial machinery rose 2.9 percent last month  
while orders for electronic equipment were up 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The one area of weakness was primary metals, including steel, a  
sector that is petitioning the government for higher tariffs to 
slow a flood of cheaper foreign steel from coming into the United 
States. In March, orders for primary metals for U.S. plants fell 
1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for military goods soared 36.2 percent in March.  
Excluding defense items, orders for all other goods rose 1 percent 
for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of durable goods, which economists closely watch for  
signals about current conditions, rose 1.3 percent in March, 
following a much weaker 0.1 percent February gain.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Matthew Lillard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Forget weepies like ``Deep End of the Ocean.'' The most  
convincing tears on the silver screen this spring are those that 
pour forth from Matthew Lillard, playing Stevo in ``SLC Punk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevo is a blue-haired, body-pierced teen-ager living in Salt  
Lake City at the height of the Reagan era. While he and his friends 
rail against the conventions of their conservative hometown, his 
father begs him to shed the full-body leather and go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevo's dirty little secret: He likes school, he studies, and  
when his stellar grades earn him a place at Harvard Law School (his 
dad forges his application), he's tempted. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stevo mulls his future, catastrophe strikes one of his  
closest friends. Stevo's reaction is truly hard-core: Lillard's 
lanky body convulses, his veins throb and teardrops fly from his 
blood-red eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just lose your mind for a little while,'' Lillard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lillard, 29, is quickly building a reputation for playing  
slightly unhinged characters. Moviegoers who shuddered through 
``Scream'' will remember him as murderous prankster Stuart. This 
year, he played Brock, a washed-up graduate of MTV's ``The Real 
World'' in ``She's All That.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lillard's real world has been turned upside down by a blitz of  
publicity for ``SLC Punk,'' while he's wrapping up work in London 
on Kenneth Branagh's version of ``Love's Labour's Lost.'' Branagh's 
retelling of the Shakespearean comedy uses the lilting tunes of 
George Gershwin and Cole Porter, a drastic change from The Dead 
Kennedys and The Ramones songs that score ``SLC Punk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most brilliant thing I've ever worked on,'' Lillard  
said during the final days of filming ``Love's Labour's Lost.'' But 
Stevo, he says, holds a special place in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to carry a film for the first time, to be funny, to kiss  
a beautiful girl,'' he said. ``It was the whole arc, from boy to 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And from sidekick to star.  
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you become interested in ``SLC Punk''?  
</P>
<P>
	LiIlard: I actually passed on it the first time I saw it. I  
thought it was kind of interesting, but wasn't sure it was really 
something I wanted to do. And I might have been a little 
apprehensive about carrying a film. But then I talked to the 
producers, then I met James (director James Merendino), and within 
five minutes, I was set. This movie meant so much to him. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What did you think of Stevo?  
</P>
<P>
	Lillard: He's great. I mean, you do have these beliefs as a  
young person that you live and die on. Do you sell out, do you buy 
in? It's a constant struggle. As an actor, it's the same thing. Do 
you do the commercials, the TV shows, just hoping for a paycheck? 
Or do you wait it out and do the things you really want to do? 
</P>
<P>
	3. Stevo's dad gave him a lot of pressure to give up his life as  
a punk and head to Harvard. Were you ever pressured to pursue a 
different path? 
</P>
<P>
	Lillard: I don't think anyone else ever tried to talk me out of  
acting, but I myself didn't even accept the fact I could become a 
professional actor until I was 19. I'd been doing it all though 
school, but I really considered it just a hobby. Theater was the 
only place that being funny was OK, that I didn't get in trouble. I 
could be a big clown if I wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Have you been targeting roles as the offbeat, quirky guy? Or  
are those the parts that come to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Lillard: I definitely went out looking for them in the  
beginning. I mean, I play big energy. In the beginning, that's what 
I was drawn to, and now people seek me out to play the kind of 
crazy guy. 
</P>
<P>
	5. I checked you out on the Internet, and you have a ton of fan  
pages. But on one, some teen-age girl called you a ``second-banana 
hunk.'' How do you feel about that? 
</P>
<P>
	Lillard: Second-banana hunk? Wow. What does that mean? Well,  
it's nice to be considered a hunk at all. Over time, maybe I can 
look forward to being considered less of a second banana and become 
more of a first-banana hunk.

<HEADLINE> Orlando Sues Newton in Theater Fued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tony Orlando sued Wayne Newton on  
Wednesday for more than $15 million, accusing his former friend of 
wrongly throwing him out of the theater they once shared and 
damaging his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers last year shared what was then the Talk of the  
T.O.W.N. Theatre in the country music mecca of Branson, until 
Newton, whose company held the lease on the building, locked 
Orlando out, saying Orlando owed him more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando denied it and was evicted by Newton, his wife and  
Newton's management company, the lawsuit charged. 
</P>
<P>
	That not only cost Orlando $125,000 from 11 canceled shows last  
year, but millions more in earnings he would have made over the 
next two seasons, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando would not comment. Newton spokesman Howard Cotner said  
he was flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you serious? Are you sure it's not the other way around?''  
he asked. ``This guy walked out of town owing the Newtons 
$800,000.''

<HEADLINE> Conn. Gov. Says Pats Deal Is Solid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland dismissed the latest  
proposal Wednesday by Massachusetts lawmakers to keep the New 
England Patriots and compared it to Connecticut's dealings with the 
Hartford Whalers just before the team left for North Carolina in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once a decision was made by the Whalers, they were gone,''  
Rowland said. ``Well, the Patriots are leaving (Massachusetts). 
They're gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts legislative leaders late Tuesday announced a plan  
to spend $70 million for roadways, sewer lines and other 
infrastructure for a new stadium in Foxboro. Under the plan, the 
Patriots would have to pay $1.4 million annually over 25 years in 
surcharges on off-site parking and stadium user fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland said Connecticut's proposal to build a $374 million  
stadium and guarantee $13 million per year in luxury seat revenues 
dwarfs the offer by Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland also pointed to the agreement the state had signed with  
Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the Connecticut Legislature's approval 
of the deal, and the environmental drilling that had already begun 
on the site of the proposed stadium to prove that the team's deal 
with the state was solid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots submitted an application to the NFL last week for  
permission to move to Hartford. Kraft has until May 2 to back out 
if he decides Connecticut hasn't made sufficient progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots refused to comment on the Massachusetts proposal  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jay Malcynsky, a lobbyist representing the team in  
Connecticut, said he had spoken with Robert Kraft and his son 
Jonathan Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Krafts didn't view the new plan as substantially  
different from an offer last year by Massachusetts House Speaker 
Thomas Finneran to spend $57 million in state money for 
infrastructure improvements near the stadium in Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old dress on the same old dog,'' Malcynsky said.  
``Instead of $50 million, it's $70 million, and now they want Kraft 
to forfeit a portion of the parking revenues to pay the state's 
contribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the $70 million would help the Krafts pay for  
construction of a new stadium, Malcynsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert Kraft told me flat out, he's got the deal he wants, and  
it's in Hartford, Connecticut,'' Malcynsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL called the Massachusetts proposal ``a step in the right  
direction toward a Patriots alternative in Foxboro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Massachusetts must also take other steps to  
keep the team, the most immediate of which should be a long-term 
commitment by the business community to buy luxury suites and club 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative leaders in Massachusetts said they planned to pass  
the proposed legislation by May 25, when the NFL owners meet in 
Atlanta to vote on the Patriots' move, among other topics. NFL 
rules require the approval of three-quarters (24 of 31) of owners 
for a team to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcynsky said if the owners voted against a Patriots move to  
Connecticut, Kraft could sue the league, just as Raiders owner Al 
Davis did successfully when he moved his team from Oakland to Los 
Angeles in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: the ACM Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Jo Dee Messina fanned  
herself with her hand and fluttered her eyelids, doing a send-up of 
the classic Southern belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Messina, a Yankee from Massachusetts, was expressing her joy at  
receiving three nominations at this year's Academy of Country Music 
Awards, including best new female vocalist, best female vocalist 
and best album for ``I'm Alright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The cool part is I get to sit on the ballot next to Faith  
Hill, Martina McBride, and all those people I love,'' the 
28-year-old singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACM Awards show airs May 5 on CBS from 8-11 p.m. EDT from  
the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City, Calif. Nominees for 
best entertainer are Garth Brooks, the duo Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Tim 
McGraw, George Strait and Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith Hill leads all nominees with six. In addition to best  
female vocalist, she's up for best album for ``Faith''; song, 
single and video for ``This Kiss''; and best vocal event for her 
duet with husband Tim McGraw, ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love 
Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country music artist of the decade will be announced during  
the show. Previous winners were Marty Robbins for the 1960s, 
Loretta Lynn for the 1970s and Alabama for the 1980s. The smart 
money is on Garth Brooks for the 1990s, but Gene Weed, the show's 
producer, says George Strait and Reba McEntire also are strong 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Messina's nominations cap a remarkable comeback for the country  
singer, who broke through in 1996 with two top 10 hits -- ``Heads 
Carolina, Tails California'' and ``You're Not in Kansas Anymore'' -- 
from her debut album, ``Jo Dee Messina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She leased a bus, hired a band and hit the road after her debut.  
But expenses often ran higher than her paychecks. Then the release 
of a new album was delayed when Messina and her producers had 
trouble finding songs they thought could be hits. Bookings dried up 
and things became desperate. ``I owed everybody money. It was 
gross. I was so overwhelmed,'' Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Help from her record label, a local bank and a small endorsement  
deal with a trucking company got her through the end of last year. 
And ``Bye Bye,'' the first single from ``I'm Alright,'' went 
straight to No. 1. The album has already sold a million copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACM Awards is the first of three country music awards shows  
telecast each year. The fan-voted TNN Music City News Awards follow 
in June on The Nashville Network, and the Country Music Association 
hands out trophies in the fall.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Campaign Spending Declined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer competitive races meant fewer  
congressional candidates last year, and campaign spending declined 
for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional candidates spent $740 million on their races in  
the 1997-98 election cycle, a decline of $25 million from what they 
spent in 1995-96, the Federal Election Commission reported 
Wednesday. The number of congressional candidates declined as well, 
from 2,605 in 1996 to 2,100 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first drop in both the number of candidates and the  
money they spent running for Congress since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Political observers said fewer candidates entered the races  
because many potential challengers felt they couldn't win. Many 
incumbents ran in districts with enrollment heavily tilted toward 
their political party, while others raised enough money to 
discourage strong challengers from taking them on. And party 
leaders focused only on those districts or states where they 
thought they had the best chances to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-four incumbents had no major party opposition in 1998,  
and another 114 faced opponents who raised $25,000 or less, 
according to Common Cause, an advocacy group that favors taxpayer 
financing of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have many people who feel they can't raise the money  
needed to reach the voters,'' said Kent Cooper, co-founder of 
Public Disclosure, an Internet consulting firm specializing in 
money and politics. ``At the same time, I don't think they really 
recruited in some of these districts. Someone on the national level 
said, 'We don't want to be spread too thin. Let's narrow our 
targets.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said the two parties had some  
problems lining up strong challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last cycle, it was harder for both parties to recruit  
challengers to incumbents because the conventional wisdom was that 
this was going to be a strong incumbent year,'' Fenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Senate spender in 1995-96 was Republican Alfonse  
D'Amato of New York, who lost his re-election bid to Democrat 
Charles Schumer despite spending $24.2 million. Schumer ranked 
third in spending with $16.7 million. Second was Republican Peter 
Fitzgerald of Illinois, who spent $17.7 million in ousting 
incumbent Democrat Carol Moseley Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House side, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., spent  
$7.6 million, much of it to help fellow Republicans. But the next 
four biggest spenders all lost their races -- Democrat Philip Maloof 
of New Mexico; Democrats Christopher Gabrieli and John O'Connor of 
Massachusetts, both of whom lost a primary for the nomination to 
succeed retiring Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II; and former Rep. Bob 
Dornan, R-Calif., who failed to win a rematch with Democratic Rep. 
Loretta Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tigers Trade Hunter to Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Less than an hour before their teams played each  
other, the Detroit Tigers traded center fielder Brian Hunter to the 
Seattle Mariners for two minor leaguers to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 28, was batting only .236 this season with no RBIs in 55  
at-bats. He had been thrown out in all three of his steal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to add Brian to our roster,'' Mariners  
general manager Woody Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunter will bring speed and a base-stealing threat to the top  
of our order, something we have been seeking for several months,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter has spent the past two-plus seasons with the Tigers after  
arriving in a trade with Houston on Dec. 10, 1996. In his first 
season, he led the league with 76 stolen bases and hit .269 in 162 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, Seattle optioned right-handed  
pitcher Brett Hinchliffe to Triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit will recall outfielder Gabe Kapler from Triple-A Toledo.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal came before the Tigers played Seattle in the third game  
of a four-game series at the Kingdome.

<HEADLINE> Past Is Prologue for Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a city trying hard to focus on the  
future, the two leading candidates for mayor can't seem to shake 
their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	John Street, the buttoned-down former City Council president  
seeking to become Philadelphia's second black mayor, is trying to 
live down his reputation from the 1980s as a hothead and a 
rabble-rouser. His opponent is running a commercial with footage 
from 18 years ago of Street -- then a community activist with a big 
Afro -- angrily shoving a reporter to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Street's chief rival for the Democratic nomination, lawyer Marty  
Weinberg, finds himself defending his political relationship with 
the late Mayor Frank Rizzo, one of the most polarizing figures in 
Philadelphia history. Rizzo left office 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the nature of Philadelphia politics to let these  
things go,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a Millersville University 
political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Weinberg lead a field of five Democrats trying to  
succeed Mayor Edward G. Rendell, who in two terms brought the city 
back from the brink of financial disaster. Philadelphia is now 
undergoing a downtown building boom, and its bright future includes 
the Republican National Convention in 2000. Rendell is prohibited 
from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the May 18 primary will face wealthy GOP  
businessman Sam Katz in the fall. Rendell himself describes Katz as 
a formidable opponent with a chance to become Philadelphia's first 
Republican mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The race has drawn national big-league political talent for a  
race that experts say could be one of the most expensive mayoral 
contests in U.S. history, running up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, a political power broker making his first bid for  
office, has raised more than $3 million. Airing TV spots months 
before his rivals helped. In January, polls had him dead last. This 
month, a new poll showed him tied with Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was a law professor at Drexel University when Rizzo  
named him city solicitor in 1972. The two forged a close political 
relationship that lasted until Rizzo's death in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzo's administration was blamed for police brutality and  
financial mismanagement, and on the campaign trail, Weinberg always 
gets questioned about his ties to Rizzo. In a recent television 
debate, Street said he ``would hate to go back'' to the Rizzo 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg stands by his political mentor.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Rizzo did a lot of very good things for the city of  
Philadelphia. He was not perfect. He made mistakes. But nobody can 
ever deny the fact he loved this city and devoted his life to it,'' 
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia politics, the question of race is never far  
below the surface. But political observers said so far, it has not 
become a dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the candidates are really striving hard to avoid these  
deep racial divisions,'' Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg, who is white, expects to do well in the blue-collar  
rowhouse neighborhoods of this city of 1.5 million people, more 40 
percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a formidable foe in Street, who forged a close  
alliance with Rendell early this decade. Together, they took on the 
city's municipal unions and helped turn a $250 million budget 
deficit into a surplus before Street stepped down from the City 
Council to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who leaves office with a glittering future and has  
discussed running for governor, has endorsed Street's candidacy and 
appeared in one of his campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Street was a vociferous community activist in his early days,  
protesting everything from vending regulations to housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a temper. Besides shoving the TV reporter (who sued  
and settled for $1,000), Street is notorious for a 1981 fistfight 
on the floor of City Council spurred by the possibility of a school 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	After that episode, Street began exerting more control over  
himself. His political views changed, too. Once a liberal, he had 
become by 1989 a fiscal conservative and a budget hawk. Street was 
elected City Council president in 1992, the year Rendell took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's changed,'' said Randall Miller, a St. Joseph's University  
professor who follows Philadelphia politics. ``He's changed because 
he has exercised extraordinary self-discipline, as he insisted the 
city should do.''

<HEADLINE>  Foreman Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George Foreman testified Wednesday before a  
federal grand jury said to be investigating whether the IBF sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was in the grand jury room for  
less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	On the advice of his lawyer, Foreman would not discuss his  
testimony. But asked if he had ever paid a kickback, he said, 
``No,'' and also said this was his first appearance before any 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Lawrence H. Wechsler, would not comment either, but  
he has said federal prosecutors are examining whether Foreman was 
extorted by sanctioning groups, and that he did not know if Foreman 
ever paid to better his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	In past weeks, the grand jury has heard from officials of the  
New Jersey-based IBF, one of the world's three major sanctioning 
organizations. It does not appear that its president, Robert W. Lee 
Sr., has testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman did discuss with the media the need to reform boxing and  
the sanctioning groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that boxing should be given some time to clean up its  
act. If not someone should do it for them,'' Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although inactive in the ring for several years, Foreman -- who  
recently turned 50 -- also said he wants to fight the man he 
considers the heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to keep coming back until I'm a grandfather and  
boxing is a sport as clean as pingpong,'' said Foreman, who later 
playfully sparred with news photographers outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	At 45, Foreman captured the IBF and WBA championships to become  
the oldest champion in any weight class, and now boasts a record of 
76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury earlier this month heard from the boxing judge  
criticized for her scoring in last month's Evander Holyfield-Lennox 
Lewis title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams told the grand jury that no one attempted to  
sway her decision, her lawyer has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman had his opinion. He said, ``I think Lewis won the fight  
hands down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it was not the first robbery the sport has seen, and  
claimed his defeat in 1974 by Muhammad Ali in Zaire should be a 
prime example. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the Holyfield-Lewis fight created an  
opportunity for improvements, including having the sanctioning 
groups adopt guidelines on how they set rankings, Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, its attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, decline to  
comment on the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Justices Ponder Meaning of Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, trying to define the scope  
of a federal ban on discrimination, struggled Wednesday with a 
basic question: Who is disabled? 
</P>
<P>
	As the court heard arguments about two nearsighted women who  
want to be United Air Lines pilots and a truck driver blind in one 
eye, some justices questioned whether poor eyesight is a disability 
protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have difficulty reading restaurant checks in dim light,''  
said Justice David H. Souter, who spoke of being ``at sea'' in 
trying to interpret the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia added, ``I'm worried that everyone in the  
country is protected against discrimination based on a physical 
characteristic ... This statute wasn't meant to apply to all 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked whether someone who had  
an artificial leg but did not have a problem driving would be 
considered disabled. ``The employer says, you know, `I just don't 
want to take a chance with you.' Is he regarding that person as 
disabled?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	By July, the justices are expected to use those cases and a  
third argued Tuesday to clarify who can sue under the ADA, a 1990 
law best known for requiring handicap access ramps in public 
buildings. Tuesday's case involves a Kansas man fired from his 
mechanic's job because of high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA bars employers from discriminating against a ``qualified  
individual with a disability'' because of that disability. 
</P>
<P>
	A qualified person is defined as one who can perform a job when  
given reasonable accommodation, and a disability is a condition 
that substantially limits a major life activity. The ADA also 
protects people who are ``regarded as'' having a disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Aaron Hughes, the lawyer representing the two would-be  
pilots, argued that Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton were qualified 
to become pilots but were rejected because of United's 
``preconceived notion'' about nearsighted people. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler, arguing in support  
of the two women, said United tried to have it both ways by saying 
they were not disabled because their vision could be corrected, but 
refusing to hire them because of their poor vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts ruled the two were not protected by the ADA because  
their nearsightedness is fully correctable with glasses or contact 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	United's lawyer, Roy T. Englert Jr., said the airline's vision  
standard justified its decision not to hire the two women. 
</P>
<P>
	``This statute was absolutely not designed to make every  
employer ignore every disability,'' Englert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer worried that some people with  
disabilities, such as those needing artificial limbs or deaf people 
with hearing aids, could be left out if their disabilities were 
viewed only in their corrected state. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer also suggested that reading the law to protect people  
whose conditions easily are correctable might not lead to a large 
number of lawsuits because discrimination against such people 
``hardly exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second case argued Wednesday was brought to the court by  
Albertson's supermarkets, which fired truck driver Hallie 
Kirkingburg after he failed a test to meet Transportation 
Department vision standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg performed well on a road test although he is almost  
blind in one eye. He sued Albertson's, saying it discriminated 
against him by refusing to let him go back to work after he got a 
waiver from the DOT standard. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court said Kirkingburg must be given a chance  
to prove his claim in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In his case, too, the justices seemed to have trouble reaching a  
comfortable definition of ``disabled'' or ``qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This statute wasn't meant to apply to all Americans,'' said  
Scalia, but not before Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether 
``Hooters'' restaurants could be sued for discriminating against 
some women because of physical characteristics if only women with a 
40 bra size were hired as waitresses.

	House Votes To Limit Clinton on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided House voted today to require  
President Clinton to get congressional approval before injecting 
``ground elements'' into the conflict in Yugoslavia. The 249 to 180 
vote to limit his ability to widen the war came despite Clinton's 
appeal to Congress that the United States must speak ``with a 
single voice'' on the crisis, as he said NATO had done. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Presses for Kosovo Funds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed Congress today to  
approve swiftly $6 billion to pay for the conflict with Yugoslavia, 
urging lawmakers to resist Republican-led efforts to double his 
request. A White House spokesman said that Clinton fears that ``any 
additional funding creates the potential for political fights and 
dangerous delay.'' Clinton accused Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic of waging a ``meticulously planned'' campaign to drive 
1.8 million ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.

	Outspoken Yugoslav Official Is Ousted

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's moderate deputy prime  
minister was fired today after urging Serb leaders to realize that 
``we cannot defeat NATO.'' Vuk Draskovic has been critical of 
President Slobodan Milosevic and urged compromise with NATO. 
Draskovic was once the main opposition leader before joining the 
government three months ago. A NATO spokesman has pointed to 
Draskovic's recent remarks as a sign of serious cracks in the 
Yugoslav regime. 

</P>

	White House Concerned About Jackson  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House expressed concern today about  
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's visit to Yugoslavia and indicated that 
NATO would not suspend its airstrikes while he is in Belgrade. 
Jackson and a delegation of U.S. religious leaders are to leave 
tonight to meet with three captive American soldiers and try to 
secure their freedom. The group is also expected to meet with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

Harris had tried to enlist but was told by a recruiter visiting his

KXPX to drop Stern's show. The day after the shootings, Stern 
reportedly wondered on his show whether the gunmen tried ``to have 
sex with any of the good-looking girls'' who fled the school. Also, 
a Denver TV station is pre-empting Stern's Saturday night show for

	Second Dragging Death Trial To Move

<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A judge today approved a deal to move the  
second trial in the dragging death of a black man away from Jasper. 
Attorneys for Lawrence Russell Brewer claimed that Jasper County 
residents have a vested interest in convicting all three suspects 
in an effort to vindicate the town's image. Brewer is one of three 
white men accused of capital murder in the brutal slaying of James 
Byrd Jr., who was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged 
three miles along a rural road. John William King was convicted in 
February of capital murder and sentenced to death.

segments and played backwards. Researchers said the study shows 
that even if the message is distorted, ``other parameters are still

<HEADLINE> Japan Set To Forgive Nations' Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan is ready to cancel the debt of the world's  
most impoverished nations as long as those countries implement 
reforms and other industrialized countries share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
	As the biggest provider of Official Development Aid loans, Japan  
has been reluctant to join other rich countries in announcing plans 
to waive its loans to the 41 most indebted Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government has decided that these countries will be  
eligible for complete debt relief if they demonstrate an ability to 
manage their economies responsibly, a Foreign Ministry official who 
spoke on customary condition of anonymity said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has already implemented an 80 percent debt forgiveness  
plan for impoverished countries. In order to raise the debt relief 
ceiling to 100 percent, Tokyo wants other industrialized countries 
to contribute funds to help cover the cost of Japan canceling its 
$7.82 billion in ODA loans, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The debts would effectively be canceled by expanding grants to  
the impoverished countries. The program would be facilitated by 
cooperation among industrialized countries to contribute to debt 
relief programs of the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund, the Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan also wants the IMF to sell its gold reserves in order to  
bolster Third World debt relief measures, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government also said it is prepared to increase the  
debt relief ceiling for non-ODA loans to poor countries beyond the 
current 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	World leaders hope to agree on a debt forgiveness strategy for  
impoverished countries at a summit of G-7 nations in Germany in 
June. German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder has said he wants 
industrialized countries to waive all ODA loans to the 41 
impoverished countries by 2000.

<P>
	LISLE, Ill. (AP) -- Budget Rent a Car will allow its customers to  
bid online to get the best price available, a move that extends the 
growing Internet auction business further into the travel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Web surfers can already name their own prices for airline  
tickets, hotel rooms, new cars and home mortgages on priceline.com, 
a popular Internet site that links buyers with sellers willing to

	Budget Group Inc., the parent of Budget Rent a Car, said  
Wednesday it will offer the car rental industry's first online 
bidding, beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will give customers a chance at bargain prices and  
give Budget a way to rent cars that otherwise would have sat in a 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us an opportunity to control our fleet and enhance  
both revenue and utilization per vehicle,'' Sandy Miller, Budget 
Group's chairman and CEO said Wednesday. ``The notion of renting 
just one more car each day, in each city, will have a very positive 
financial impact on Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a hotel room. If it goes empty, you never get that  
day back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make their bids, customers would go to the Budget Web site  
and click on the BidBudget icon. They would then fill out a short 
form showing location and dates they want the car picked up and 
returned, as well as the car type and the desired price. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget officials promise to respond within a day with an e-mail  
notifying the customer if the bid was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget Rent a Car, headquartered in the west Chicago suburb of  
Lisle, has more than 3,200 airport and local market locations in 
more than 120 countries and territories.

<HEADLINE> Stunned Senators Clean Out Lockers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ont. (AP) -- After being swept in four games by the  
Buffalo Sabres, the Ottawa Senators talked of progress Wednesday, 
of learning how to make the next step toward becoming an elite 
hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized how good we can be,'' said defenseman Wade Redden,  
heading for Norway to play for Canada at the world championships. 
``But what counts is the playoffs. Everyone is very disappointed 
after the way this ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot to think about.''  
</P>
<P>
	After just barely qualifying for the playoffs for two seasons,  
the Senators raised the bar this year, amassing 103 points and 
finishing the regular season as the second best team in the Eastern 
Conference. But the second quickest team to clinch a post-season 
spot was the first to be eliminated after Tuesday's 4-3 loss in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa has the youngest average age of any NHL club, and  
defenseman Lance Pitlick says the experiences the team goes through 
now will make them a better club soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that we've had some kind of  
disappointment,'' he said. ``But it's no different than anything 
else. They say the best way to learn is from the school of hard 
knocks. We missed a few classes this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa coach Jacques Martin made reference to one of his old  
teams, the 1994-95 Quebec Nordiques. Martin was an assistant coach 
there when the Nordiques lost in the conference quarter-finals 
after finishing first in the Northeast Division with 104 points. 
The next season, after moving to Colorado, the former Nordiques won 
the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience we've gained this year will help us in our  
progress next year,'' Martin said. ``Unfortunately, we had to take 
a step back with the loss to Buffalo. We've learned that success in 
the regular season doesn't automatically mean you'll be successful 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that it's a step for whatever reason. You have to  
learn from these experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators could have other problems. Nine players -- Redden,  
Pitlick, Janne Laukkanen, Jason York, Bruce Gardiner, Ted Donato, 
Nelson Emerson, Radek Bonk and Magnus Arvedson -- will become 
restricted or unrestricted free agents this summer, and a handful 
more have options being held by the club.

<HEADLINE>  Reservists Prepare for Kosovo Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Vik Malling had hoped to use  
the next few weeks to settle into a new home and spend time with 
his family. Instead, he's headed for a NATO base in Europe and the 
fighting in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Malling, a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, was among 33,102  
reservists called to active military duty Tuesday by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we really look forward to, but we are  
trained and ready to go if called,'' Malling said of his unit, the 
940th Air Refueling Wing stationed at Beale Air Force Base about 35 
miles north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's KC-135 tankers will fly midair refueling missions  
and could be gone for up to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather stay here,'' Malling said. ``I have just moved  
here. I have not settled into my house here, and there were things 
I was planning to do with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``This is our job and the mission we train for.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine members of the 927th Air Refueling Wing at Selfridge  
Air National Guard base in Michigan also got the call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I salute each of you and your families for your sacrifices and  
your commitment to our nation,'' said Col. Robert Bailey, commander 
of the 927th. 
</P>
<P>
	The involuntary call-up is the first since NATO began its air  
campaign against Yugoslavia on March 24. The mobilization is the 
largest since 240,000 served in the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reservists to get the call are from Air Force units  
based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go through several different emotions all in about 30  
seconds,'' Col. Dean J. Despinoy, commander of the 931st Air 
Refueling Group at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kan., said 
of the activation. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Mascia, a maintenance crewman in the 171st Air Refueling  
Wing at Pittsburgh International Airport, said it was important to 
keep emotions in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know what is going to happen,'' he said.  
``You see things on the news, so everybody has a pretty good idea 
of what is up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes March is a Republican state lawmaker in Arizona who helps  
oversee supply and maintenance for air tankers with the 161st Air 
Refueling Wing in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to weasel out of this war,'' he said. ``As tough  
as it's going to be on my family, it's my commitment to this 
country and this state to protect us.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Satellite TV Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite TV customers nationwide would be  
able, for the first time, to watch their favorite local broadcast 
TV shows via their satellite systems under a bill the House passed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved on 422-1 vote, is meant to resolve a dispute  
between satellite companies and broadcasters over conditions under 
which viewers who get their television from satellite can watch 
broadcast TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would let DirecTV, EchoStar and other companies beam  
local broadcast signals to customers who use either pizza-sized 
dishes or big ``backyard'' dishes no matter where they live. Under 
existing law, companies can't do this. 
</P>
<P>
	With the change, satellite TV customers wouldn't be forced to  
use rooftop antennas or subscribe to cable TV to receive local 
broadcast signals. They would be able to get them directly from a 
satellite company, probably for a small monthly fee. Eventually, 
the companies would have to carry all local broadcast stations in a 
given market. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one satellite TV company, EchoStar, currently provides,  
under what it says are very limited conditions, some local 
broadcast stations in a few markets for a small fee. The company 
believes it can do this under existing law, but broadcasters 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill aims to make satellite companies stronger competitors  
to cable TV providers, which carry local TV signals. That should 
serve as a check on cable rates, which were recently deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of local broadcasting programming is the No. 1 reason  
why consumers aren't willing to subscribe to satellite service and 
therefore are limited to a single competitor: the cable operator,'' 
said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who wrote the bill along with Rep. 
Howard Coble, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill still must go through several steps to become law. The  
Senate has not yet voted on its version. Assuming the Senate bill 
passes, the two bills would have to be reconciled, and the 
resulting bill would need to be approved by both chambers and 
signed into law by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill also would direct the Federal Communications  
Commission to come up with a better way of determining which 
satellite TV customers are eligible to receive broadcast network 
programs from ``distant'' network affiliates, Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing law lets satellite companies provide customers with  
``distant'' network signals, those from other broadcast areas, only 
if those customers cannot receive local stations using rooftop 
antennas. The current law doesn't take into account quality of 
local reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret the arcane legal test that determines 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal and thus is 
eligible to receive network programs by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill tries not to disturb major parts of an agreement  
between DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite TV company, some 
small backyard dish providers and the four major broadcast 
networks, Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that agreement, satellite customers who aren't eligible to  
receive distant network signals and who live closest to their local 
TV stations would be cut off from ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC programs on 
June 30. But the bill does require DirecTV and others to provide 
ineligible customers who have been cut off with free antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under the deal, ineligible customers who live on the  
fringes of their local stations' coverage areas would be cut off 
from network signals on Dec. 31. Under the bill, those customers 
would continue to receive network signals until the FCC develops a 
new way of determining eligibility, taking into account local 
reception quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Two major satellite players, EchoStar and PrimeTime 24, are not  
part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The only dissenter from the passing vote was Rep. Robert Brady,  
D-Pa. He voted against the bill at the request of a labor union, 
said Brady's chief of staff, Stanley White. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1554.

<HEADLINE> Misinformation Given in Colo. Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Sheriff John Stone had old information  
when he described his suspicions about three men detained near 
Columbine High School during last week's massacre, Stone's 
spokesmen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Stone said  
he believed three camouflage-clad youths who knew the gunmen and 
were wandering outside during the attack may have played some role. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, investigators rousted Stone from bed to explain his  
comments. The Jefferson County sheriff held a late news conference 
and said he was ``highly suspicious'' of the three. He added, 
though, that he didn't intend to give the impression that the 
investigation was focusing on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, his spokesmen said the sheriff hadn't been updated  
on the latest information in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the sheriff can't know every single little  
detail in a case this huge,'' spokesman Jim Parr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone had told the AP that he was suspicious of the three  
because they had claimed to have heard of the killings on the radio 
-- and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman didn't address that issue, but merely said the  
three had been cleared after being questioned twice. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of publicity missteps in the  
wearying investigation into one of the nation's bloodiest school 
massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and other investigators have felt the crush of a probe  
involving hundreds of sheriff's officials, dozens of state, federal 
and local agencies and a complex case in which much of the evidence 
hasn't even been reviewed. Stone's department is the lead agency in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports that 25 were killed were eventually revised to  
15. Investigators first said three gunmen were in the school, then 
changed that to two. Investigators said a girlfriend of one of the 
gunmen bought a handgun and a rifle used in the crime -- and then on 
Wednesday said she actually bought two shotguns and a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	A sleepy Stone answered dozens of sometimes hostile questions  
from reporters during his nationally televised late-night new 
conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should just let my professionals handle it and get  
back to my job as county sheriff,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Landing Gear Blamed for F-16 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- A landing gear problem is being blamed  
for the latest crash of an F-16 military jet at Luke Air Force 
Base, the nation's largest training ground for F-16 fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash on Monday was the sixth at Luke in six months. Air  
base officials grounded about 200 F-16s and ordered inspections for 
about 100 equipped with similar landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second grounding and mass inspection this month. After  
a crash on March 26, inspectors found hairline cracks in the 
engines of 18 of the 190 F-16s at Luke equipped with Pratt &AMP; 
Whitney 220 engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane involved in the latest crash had passed the engine  
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of five crashes have been linked to engine trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's crash, instructor pilot Maj. Kevin Grove, 36, and  
Capt. Stephan Kleinheyer, 31, a German pilot training at Luke, 
reported a problem with the jet's landing gear after a routine 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	With the plane was running low on fuel and unable to land  
safely, both crewmen bailed out safely. The $20 million jet crashed 
in the White Tank Mountain range, a remote area northwest of Luke.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Teams Return to Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARVADA, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School junior Matt Wells  
took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile, 
chew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good to be smiling and laughing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a 16-year-old catcher on Columbine's varsity baseball  
team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on 
Wednesday. There were cheers and grins here, eight days after 
teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12 
students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the gunmen had complained about their  
treatment at the hands of athletes at Columbine. When they burst 
into the library on April 20, one of the gunmen yelled: ``All jocks 
stand up! We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed  
crime scene. Hundreds of backpacks and other personal belongings 
abandoned in the crisis still litter the hallways and classrooms. 
School athletic equipment is also trapped, probably for the rest of 
the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to an outpouring of donations and support from the  
community and the sports world, Columbine's baseball team has 
uniforms, gloves, balls and everything they need to get back on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the equipment and clothing donations, the Columbine  
Rebels would have been forced to end their season, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have played,'' he said. ``We wouldn't have been  
able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball team has received an estimated $5,000 worth of  
clothing and gear from Reebok, Mizuno, Denver Athletic Supply and 
other sports companies. The gifts include dozens of bats, stark 
navy blue uniforms, never-used leather gloves, even socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're taking care of us,'' coach Robin Ortiz said. ``I hate  
to say it, but it's been like Christmas at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team members decided they wanted to play out the rest of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of them, it's a chance to start healing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some players also had the chance to realize a dream. The  
Colorado Rockies opened their doors to Columbine players Monday, 
allowing the team to work out in their hitting cages and tour Coors 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies worked with the Denver Police Activities League to  
help coordinate the donations and support. League director Nick 
Arcuri said he hopes the efforts show the teens they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was around these kids at practice the other night and some  
of them are afraid to smile,'' he said. ``They need to know that 
people out there care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.  
Katie Crona, a junior varsity soccer player with the Rebels, said 
her team received new uniforms from Adidas and assistance from 
rival Arapahoe High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been so wonderful to us,'' the 14-year-old freshman  
said. ``It's so nice to know they care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said the donations and support will encourage them  
to play better. But Wells said he is more interested in simply 
trying to have fun and move beyond the tragedy that put his life on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting back to normal life,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Skin Cancer Ad Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Biederman lost his nose to skin cancer.  
Now, a picture of his face is the central feature of a highly 
graphic public service campaign designed to shock people into being 
more careful about exposure to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Biederman, a 64-year-old Los Angeles attorney is shown in TV and  
magazine ads removing his prosthetic nose, revealing a gaping hole 
left by 30 skin cancer operations. Above that image, in print ads, 
reads: ``Skin Cancer Can Kill You. And Now For the Really Bad 
News.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was launched Wednesday by the American Academy of  
Dermatology, which represents 12,000 skin specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	However, whether most Americans will see it remains in question.  
The academy is asking media to run the ads for free as a public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Television has already refused because of the content, but  
other networks are still considering them, according to the public 
relations firm that designed the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort aims to persuade Americans to protect themselves from  
harmful sun exposure and to visit a dermatologist at the first sign 
of any skin abnormalities. ``It certainly is an attention 
grabber,'' said Dr. Darrell Rigel, academy president and a 
dermatologist in New York City and Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is not meant to instill fear, he said. ``Fear has  
to do with something not factual, we are trying to get the facts 
across about what really might happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer; about 1 million  
Americans are expected to be diagnosed this year, including 44,200 
with the most deadly form called melanoma, according to the 
American Cancer Society. About 80 percent of the 9,200 skin cancer 
deaths expected this year come from melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason behind the graphic nature of the campaign was  
Biederman's willingness to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Biederman's saga began in 1995 when he noticed a red spot at the  
end of his nose. When it didn't go away after a few days, he had 
his dermatologist remove it. Doctors determined the growth was 
malignant. Since then Biederman has endured numerous surgeries as 
doctors tried to remove all the cancer, and then rebuild his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Since early 1997, doctors have told Biederman that he is  
cancer-free. Biederman thinks he knows what caused his cancer: 
Endless days on the beach and on his father's boat while growing up 
in Long Island, N.Y. He said he never used sun screen because his 
friends thought burning was the best way to ensure a healthy tan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We baked like lobsters,'' he said. ``It never occurred to me  
that I would pay a price years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some marketing experts caution that youngsters -- the main  
targets of the ads -- will ignore them.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Estate Resignations Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is threatening to  
revoke the tax-exempt status of a wealthy trust for Hawaiian 
schoolchildren unless its five trustees resign, two newspapers 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS made the mass resignation a condition for concluding its  
three-year probe into the Bishop Estate trust, The Honolulu 
Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported, citing 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, established to educate ``the children of Hawaii'' in  
1884 by the will of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, has assets 
valued at up to $10 billion, making it one of the nation's richest 
private charitable trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	The state says the trustees invested $350 million in income  
instead of following the trust's direction and spending it on its 
beneficiary, the Kamehameha Schools, a 600-acre campus for 3,100 
students of Hawaiian descent on a wooded hillside overlooking 
downtown Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the trustees have been involved in a melodrama of  
boardroom intrigue, questionable investments, IRS audits and 
criminal investigations. Several petitions seeking their removals 
have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tax-exempt status allows it to avoid paying millions of  
dollars a year in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees, Henry Peters, Richard ``Dickie'' Wong, Gerard  
Jervis, Lokelani Lindsey and Oswald Stender, met Tuesday night to 
discuss the IRS demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS in Honolulu did not return several calls from The  
Associated Press seeking comment. In the past, the agency has 
refused to confirm or deny that it was auditing the Bishop Estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong said Wednesday he had no immediate plans to resign. He also  
said trustees still are obtaining more information about the audit 
and were surprised by the IRS' stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not resigning because I'm not sure what I'm being accused  
of,'' Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bishop Estate spokesman did not return a message from The  
Associated Press seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Cancer Screening Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Years after receiving good news about their  
prostate exams, 18 men were recently called by a suburban hospital 
and told there had been a mistake and they had cancer. Two other 
men had already died of what the hospital said were unrelated 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the errors, the cancer was left undiagnosed and  
untreated in the 20 men, perhaps lowering their chances of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	A pathologist at Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro had  
misread the men's biopsies, The Sun Chronicle of Attleboro 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel shock, anger, disbelief -- there's nothing we can do,''  
said the wife of one misdiagnosed patient Wednesday, requesting 
that the family's identity and hometown be kept anonymous. ``We 
don't know what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 62-year-old husband was told two weeks ago that his  
test had been misread. Her husband was told by his urologist to 
seek immediate aggressive radiation. It isn't clear yet how far the 
cancer has progressed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biopsies were performed between 1995 and 1997, The Sun  
Chronicle reported. The hospital said it reviewed 279 tests and 
discovered that 20 had been inaccurate. Of those 20, two patients 
have apparently died of unrelated causes, the hospital told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The biopsies were supposed to detect malignant cells in the  
prostate, a walnut-sized organ in men located just below the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Sturdy Memorial refused to comment Wednesday and  
would not release the identities or conditions of the misdiagnosed 
men, or say what prompted the review. The hospital planned a news 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistakes are under investigation by state medical  
authorities, who refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 179,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer  
nationwide every year. About 37,000 men die of the disease each 
year, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year survival rate in men whose cancer is detected  
early and has not spread is nearly 99 percent, said Kara Smigel, a 
spokeswoman for the National Cancer Institute. If the cancer has 
spread to bones or organs, that figure drops to 32 percent, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one recent cancer misdiagnosis case resulted in  
criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a Wisconsin laboratory pleaded no contest to reckless  
homicide after failing to find obvious signs of cancer in Pap 
smears of two women who later died. Lawsuits against the lab, 
health maintenance organization and individuals were settled for a 
total of $9.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturdy Memorial is a small community hospital about 30 miles  
south of Boston.

<HEADLINE> Author Michi Weglyn Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michi Nishiura Weglyn, who wrote a widely  
acclaimed book on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World 
War II, has died at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn died in New York on Sunday after a yearlong battle  
with cancer, according to a friend, Julie Azuma. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1976 book, ``Years of Infamy, The Untold Story of America's  
Concentration Camps,'' described the experiences of some of the 
120,000 Japanese-Americans who were rounded up by the U.S. 
government in the early days of World War II and interned as 
security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the book was coolly received at first and even rejected by  
some bookstores, its powerful prose and solid documentation 
eventually helped spur demands for redress and a national apology 
by President Gerald Ford. In 1988, Congress granted $20,000 
settlements to thousands of former internees and their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn was born to Japanese immigrant farmers in Stockton,  
Calif. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, her family was sent with 
thousands of others to a desert camp in Gila River, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A Quaker group gained her release so she could attend Mount  
Holyoke College in Massachusetts, which she eventually left due to 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn later became a New York costume designer and was  
drawn to social causes in the 1970s. She then became a familiar 
figure at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., poring over 
dusty documents from opening to closing time, pausing only to eat 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Her research discredited President Roosevelt's 1942 claim that  
``military necessity'' justified the internments, and revealed that 
thousands of Japanese people from Latin American countries were 
also held in the U.S. camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn ``always had the people who had suffered inequities  
uppermost in her mind,'' said a friend, Bob Suzuki, president of 
California State Polytechnic University at Pomona. ``She was a hero 
to so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn's husband, Walter Weglyn, a Jewish refugee from the  
Netherlands, died in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Sues Handgun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati has joined a growing number of  
cities suing gun manufacturers to recover damages for crimes 
involving firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council on Wednesday voted 5-4 to file a suit that will  
seek millions of dollars in damages from handgun manufacturers for 
alleged expenses stemming from gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit is similar to those filed by officials in Atlanta,  
Bridgeport, Conn., Cleveland, Chicago, Miami-Dade County, Fla., 
Detroit and Wayne Co., Mich., and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal court jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., found nine  
gun makers liable for shootings. Three companies were ordered to 
pay a total of $500,000 to one of seven plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms industry representatives say the lawsuits do nothing to  
prevent crime and are aimed at driving gunmakers out of business.

<HEADLINE> Teaching Hospitals Facing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's top teaching hospitals say  
they are paying the price for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 
struggling to survive under a law designed to rein in Medicare 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with shrinking HMO reimbursements, the government  
budget cuts have led to thousands of layoffs, operating losses, 
deficits -- and could lead the hospitals to abandon their teaching 
and research missions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very accurate to call it an absolute crisis,'' said Neil  
Rudenstine, president of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's five major teaching hospitals have deficits totaling  
$150 million this year. Detroit's ailing hospitals have eliminated 
4,500 jobs since January. The University of Texas medical branch at 
Galveston projects a $110 million deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the nation's 400 major teaching hospitals are on the same  
downward slope, Rudenstine said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three more years like this and you would have some  
institutions either going out of business or turning from their 
current mission to turning to for-profit,'' Rudenstine said. ``They 
wouldn't do teaching and they wouldn't do research because you 
can't have a for-profit that does that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching hospitals train 75 percent of the nation's doctors,  
provide 44 percent of indigent care and perform the vast majority 
of clinical research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burn units, trauma units, cardiac care units -- those are  
unique services you're more likely to find at a major teaching 
hospital,'' said John Parker, spokesman for the Association of 
American Medical Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching hospitals in regions where managed care dominates the  
market are feeling the pain earliest. Georgetown University Medical 
Center in Washington, D.C., for example, has laid off workers under 
a strict cost-control plan. The center had a loss of $62.4 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hospitals have been further hit by state Medicaid cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Welfare changes in Pennsylvania, which lowered payments for  
Medicaid patients, contributed to big losses at Philadelphia's 
teaching hospitals: In 1998, the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System lost $90 million on operations; the Temple University Health 
System lost $24.7 million; and the Jefferson Health System lost 
$30.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest looming problem, however, is the deepening cutback  
in Medicare, the single biggest source of revenue for teaching 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1998 to 2003, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ratchets down  
Medicare payments to hospitals, with the biggest hits coming in 
later years. So far, only 10 percent of the $9 billion in scheduled 
cuts have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	The law will cost Massachusetts teaching hospitals alone $900  
million over five years, according to the Conference of Boston 
Teaching Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an extraordinarily painful and difficult issue,'' said  
Peter Van Etten, president and CEO of UCSF Stanford Health in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have accused us of crying wolf in the past,'' he  
said. ``Given what we're going through with these reductions, 
that's not the case now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCSF Stanford recently announced plans to eliminate 2,000  
positions, or 15 percent of its work force, because of the Balanced 
Budget Act, state cuts in Medicaid and managed care.

<HEADLINE> Moon Signs 2-Year Deal With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- If Warren Moon plans to unseat Elvis  
Grbac and become Kansas City's No. 1 quarterback, he's keeping it a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Moon, after signing a two-year contract as  
Grbac's backup, was saying all the right things Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elvis is the guy playing from the outset here,'' he said. ``In  
order for this football team to do well, I've got to support him 
just like everybody else does. Believe me, I'll be behind him and 
answer any question he might have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most prolific passers in NFL history during a 15-year  
career with Houston, Minnesota and Seattle, Moon is advertised as 
nothing more than the backup to Grbac, who has missed 16 games the 
past two seasons because of injury and ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does spark a quarterback controversy, it would be nothing  
new for Kansas City. Last year, Rich Gannon played better than 
Grbac when given the chance and became the favorite of most fans 
and many players. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gannon signed a free agent contract with Oakland when the  
Raiders offered to make him their starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quarterback controversies only come when one guy doesn't do  
well and the other guy does well,'' Moon said. ``If that doesn't 
happen, that's where I step in. But we really shouldn't even talk 
about controversy until it gets to some point like that. Right now, 
he's the guy. I think he's going to grasp the position and take 
control and go. I'm very confident he is going to play well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can help (Grbac) get a little bit better,  
hopefully I can push him and take him to new heights,'' added Moon, 
who started 10 games for Seattle last year. ``If not, I'll be there 
to take over the slack. That's basically my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon has passed for 49,097 yards and 290 touchdowns. Before  
that, he passed for 21,228 yards and 144 touchdowns in six years 
with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League after not 
being drafted by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 16, 1990, in Kansas City, he passed for 527 yards -- 37  
yards short of the NFL's single-game record -- in leading Houston 
past the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon spent the past two years at Seattle as both a starter and a  
backup and admits it's not easy being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. There's no question it's tough. I've been a  
starter all my life and I've been very successful all my life. But 
I'm at a point in my career where you have to take advantage of 
whatever there is for you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs also announced they signed veteran linebacker Marvcus  
Patton, 31, to a three-year contract. Patton spent the past four 
seasons with Washington, leading the Redskins in tackles in three 
of those seasons. He spent the preceding five with the Buffalo 
Bills, playing in 144 straight games.

<HEADLINE> Obesity Risks Decline With Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as  
it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are similar to those in a study reported last year  
that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 
75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people 
are extremely obese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get  
older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor 
decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the 
University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the 
latest study. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said the findings are not that meaningful.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this  
study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr. 
JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and  
women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an 
average of 14.8 years. The patients, who were referred to an 
obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and 
body mass index. 
</P>
<P>
	Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard  
way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare 
the girth of people of different heights. BMI is body fat in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared. 
</P>
<P>
	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of  
Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 
and above is obese. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese  
person -- with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or 
younger. Moderately obese men and women -- with a BMI between 32 and 
40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is  
a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density 
declines with age. They also noted that the study participants were 
recruited rather than randomly selected.

<HEADLINE> Execs Convicted of Trade Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- The conviction of two Taiwanese  
executives in the first trial under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act 
may deter others who consider spying on a competitor, a security 
managers trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a federal jury convicted the two adhesive industry  
executives of paying an Ohio-based Avery Dennison Corp. researcher 
to slip them confidential reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Yen Yang, 72, president of Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd.,  
and his daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, 40, were each found 
guilty of two counts of economic espionage. The jury also found 
Four Pillars guilty of the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Ricci, a spokesman for the American Society for  
Industrial Security in Alexandria, Va., said the case is important 
because it means the federal law worked in its first real test. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will deter people from getting involved in economic  
espionage, and it gives us more power to protect our secrets,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the Yangs received secrets about adhesives used  
in products such as self-stick postage stamps, name labels, diaper 
tape and battery labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys immediately filed for a mistrial, arguing that  
federal prosecutors did not prove their case. U.S. District Court 
Judge Peter Economus did not immediately rule on the motion and did 
not say when he would make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. No  
sentencing date was set. The company will be fined according to how 
much Economus determines Avery Dennison lost because of the spying. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yangs were arrested in 1997, the FBI estimated the  
company lost as much as $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Neal, Avery Dennison's president and chief executive,  
released a statement saying he was ``extremely pleased'' with the 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman John Russell said ``the statute was  
used here as Congress intended -- to stop corporations from stealing 
trade secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney Nancy Luque said the law was misused  
against the Yangs and Four Pillars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors in this case jumped at the chance to participate  
in the first court test of the Economic Espionage Act, which was 
enacted to keep high-tech secrets out of the hands of foreign 
governments,'' she said. ``But we have maintained all along that 
this case was a gross misapplication of the EEA and we plan to 
appeal the jury's verdict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan-based Four Pillars is an adhesives maker that competes  
with Avery Dennison, based in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Yang and his daughter paid about $160,000 over  
eight years to Avery Dennison researcher Ten Hong ``Victor'' Lee, 
who worked at a laboratory east of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwanese native, testified he struck a deal to pass  
information to the Yangs while on a trip to his homeland in 1989. 
Lee said he worked with the Yangs until 1997, when he was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded guilty to wire fraud and began cooperating with the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors' case hinged on a secretly record FBI videotape  
showing a September 1997 meeting between the Yangs and Lee, in 
which Sally Yang cuts the ``confidential'' stamp off an Avery 
Dennison report. Pin Yen Yang then instructs Lee to dispose of the 
clipping. 
</P>
<P>
	But in closing arguments, defense attorneys said Avery Dennison  
indiscriminately marked documents as confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs originally were charged with 21 counts each but  
Economus dismissed 18 of them before the jury began deliberating.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Takes On Afghan Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The predicament of women living under tight  
restrictions imposed by Afghanistan's Taliban leaders must not be 
forgotten, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot go into the 21st century without doing everything  
within our power to try to stand against such human rights 
violations and against the perils of indifference,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said at a Capitol Hill luncheon honoring Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, who seized control of the government in 1996,  
follow a strict and disputed interpretation of Islamic law that 
requires women to wear the burqa, a garment covering them from head 
to toe, while out in public or risk being beaten. Women must stay 
indoors unless accompanied by a close male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``When women are savagely beaten by so-called religious police  
for not being fully covered by the burqa or for making noises while 
they walk, we know that it is not just the physical beating that is 
the objective. It is the destruction of the spirit of those women 
as well,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has banned girls from going to school. Male  
doctors are prohibited from treating sick women in Afghanistan, and 
women are not allowed to work, let alone practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of Afghanistan, while other women are moving  
forward, are being pushed brutally backward in time,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group Physicians for Human Rights honored Feinstein for her  
work on the issue a day after it released a report critical of 
diminishing health care and human rights for women in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we honor especially what (Feinstein) has done to bring  
to public attention and work toward the end of the widespread 
violations of women's rights in Afghanistan,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein has spearheaded efforts to pass a Senate resolution  
calling for an end to the abuse of woman and girls in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told the story of an Afghan teacher who was shot to  
death over a year ago in front of her students after refusing to 
close down a home school for girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives living in refugee camps in Pakistan told human rights  
observers the woman was shot in the head and stomach in front of 
about 40 students and her family after Taliban militia burst into 
her home demanding that the school be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can honor her memory ... by not forgetting her story and  
her willingness to stand against the forces of violence and 
oppression,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of Afghan women and girls has worsened in the past  
year with the addition of new restrictions, the report said. 
Foreign humanitarian groups have been expelled from the country and 
the government has closed the few health care facilities that were 
open to women.

<HEADLINE> Origin of Food on Labels Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers eager to boost sales of American  
meat and produce are once again eyeing mandatory labels that would 
declare the country of origin for those products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of ironic that in the marketplace we label products  
from T-shirts to computers but we don't label food,'' Rep. Earl 
Pomeroy, D-N.D., and a co-sponsor of legislation to require country 
of origin labeling for meat, said at a House hearing Wednesday. 
``If it's good for T-shirts, it's good for T-bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added the bill's sponsor, Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, ``With  
free and open trade comes the responsibility to protect American 
consumers from inferior foreign product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to know what you are getting,'' said Rep. Mary  
Bono, R-Calif., sponsor of a companion piece that would require 
labeling of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The country of origin debate has been waged in Congress for some  
time but with the agricultural economy sluggish partly from lagging 
exports, lawmakers are hoping to make headway on the issue this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent General Accounting Office study found that the United  
States imported 16 billion pounds of fresh produce in 1997, mostly 
from Mexico, Canada and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meat sector, the Agriculture Department estimates that 1  
percent of domestic beef consumption is from imported beef muscle 
cuts and that 24 percent of lamb consumption is imported. No 
figures were available on pork. Both the beef and sheep industries 
support labeling, but the National Pork Producers Association 
opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Patrick Boyle, president of the American Meat Institute,  
which represents meatpackers, warned lawmakers that mandatory 
labeling is ``not helpful but actually harmful to the U.S. 
livestock, meat and retail industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle said the legislation would cause a financial burden for  
producers, who would be required to keep good records to guarantee 
labeling accuracy, as well as packers who would have to spend 
millions to segregate domestic and foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Anderson, president of the American Frozen Food Institute,  
complained that labels would be particularly burdensome for frozen 
food. He noted that a package of frozen lasagna, for instance, 
contains numerous ingredients. Documenting the origin of each 
ingredient would be cumbersome, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country of origin marking at the ingredient level would  
complicate significantly the manufacture of a frozen meat lasagna 
or other frozen food product,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont., and others said imported meat  
products entering the United States are allowed to carry the 
``USDA'' label, which could mislead consumers.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Bank Robber Nabbed in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 78-year-old man who escaped from San  
Quentin Prison in a makeshift kayak 20 years ago has been captured 
in Florida and accused of robbing a bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrest Silva Tucker, whose criminal record stretches to the  
1930s, was arrested last week in a school parking lot near Pompano 
Beach. He was jailed without bail in connection with a local bank 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Tucker and two other inmates at San Quentin built a  
crude boat and set out from the beach. The flimsy vessel, assembled 
from plastic sheets, wood, duct tape and Formica, held together 
long enough for them to paddle several hundred yards to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker had been serving time at San Quentin for a string of bank  
robberies in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested in Boston a few years after his escape, but  
somehow authorities didn't realize that he still had time to serve 
in California, and he was freed. Over the next few years, 
Massachusetts officials said, Tucker joined the Over-the-Hill Gang, 
a group of elderly thieves who robbed supermarkets in the Boston 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was visiting a girlfriend in Florida last week when  
authorities caught up with him. He tried to get away but crashed 
his vehicle into a palm tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the car, investigators found burglary tools, weapons,  
police scanners and a large amount of cash.

<HEADLINE>  3 Teens Eyed in Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man in charge of the Columbine High  
School shooting investigation expressed suspicions about three 
teens who knew the gunmen and waited outside during the massacre. 
He also said ``the entire carnage'' in the school cafeteria was 
captured on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in combat fatigues,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John  
Stone said, referring to the three young men. ``They said they 
heard it on the radio. Well, it wasn't on the radio at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone declined to name the three teens, who have been questioned  
but not formally named as suspects in the April 20 rampage that 
left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are subjects of our investigation,'' Stone told The  
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``We'll be going back to talk to these 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marine Corps officials said 18-year-old gunman Eric  
Harris had tried to enlist but was told during an April 15 home 
visit from a recruiter that he had been rejected for medical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disclosed at that time that he had a medical  
disqualification,'' Marines spokesman 1st Lt. Jeff Sammons said in 
today's Denver Post. Harris' attempt to enlist began after he was 
contacted in a routine recruiting call April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines refused to discuss the medical reason, but a Harris  
family friend, Victor Good, told The New York Times that the teen 
had been taking psychiatric medicine -- a potentially disqualifying 
factor -- and seeing a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Stone for the first time laid out a timeline for the  
attack at the Littleton school. He also said a school surveillance 
camera filmed the bloody scene in the cafeteria, where no one died 
but wounded students were found strewn about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference called after Stone made his comments to the  
AP, the sheriff objected to the emphasis of the story without 
disputing most of his earlier statements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not recall using the word ``subjects'' and that  
no individual was the focus of the investigation. He also said he 
didn't recall telling the AP that the three were among his ``best 
leads'' into a possible conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if investigators had cleared the three teens,  
Stone said: ``In my mind, it has not been put to rest nor have my 
investigators communicated back to me that these people are totally 
clear of any suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 classmates and a teacher  
before turning their guns on themselves. In a field outside, the 
three young men in dark jackets and combat-style boots were stopped 
by deputies as television cameras broadcast the scene nationwide. 
They were frisked and taken off for interrogation. They carried no 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he has questioned for days whether the gunmen acted  
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much stuff in there,'' he said. ``You can't walk  
in there blazing with more stuff than you can carry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three young men, who Stone said knew the gunmen and had  
previously been associated with their ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' have 
maintained their innocence. Investigators tested them for gun 
residue after the shootings and found no evidence that they had 
fired guns. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas told the AP that while the sheriff  
may have stronger suspicions about the three men than other 
authorities, investigators have been interested in the trio since 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're among a group of people who we think have  
information,'' Thomas said. ``Are they people we believe have 
information about this? You bet. We have said that since day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	All three claimed to have heard of the slayings on the radio --  
and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released, Stone said. He said one had been expelled from Columbine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson said the three didn't know the gunmen, telling the  
News they ``were just three punks with a lot of curiosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at Akard's home late Tuesday  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the surveillance camera, the sheriff said it captured  
Harris and Klebold as they hurled homemade bombs and opened fire on 
terrified students in the cafeteria. Authorities have sent the 
tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously had not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also said the two gunmen initially tried to escape  
through three separate exits, and killed themselves only after 
being turned back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a 
diary seized at the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen 
planned to fly to Mexico or another country if they could escape, 
and kill themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a diary 
that investigators have characterized as a sheaf of papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were also held 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have questioned Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend,  
who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and Harris. 
Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns were to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, an employee at a Hugh M. Woods store in  
Littleton, told investigators he saw Harris and Klebold buy propane 
tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- material believed used 
in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he copied keys marked ``Do Not Duplicate'' for the  
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they are searching for a missing set of keys to  
the school, which authorities speculate may have allowed the 
killers to carry bombs inside before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I duplicated some keys for them, two sets of keys. On the keys  
it said ``Do Not Duplicate,''' Sowell told the Post. ``They brought 
in a set of five keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell said he copied the keys because ``after a while, you get  
to know the schools and you know it's common for teachers to do 
that, so you don't check on them.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 40.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street trading  
Wednesday as investors continued buying big industrial stocks but 
took profits in technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 40.66 at 10,872.37 after rising 113.12 Tuesday to a new closing 
high of 10,831.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 0.02 at 1,362.82, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 5.39 at 2,597.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were optimistically picking up stocks on the growing  
belief that the second half of this year would bring strong 
corporate profits. The current crop of earnings reports has 
generally been very positive, including some pleasant surprises 
like IBM's first-quarter results, and analysts said that bodes well 
for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A big impetus to buy has come from increasing signs that the  
global economy is recovering. That has increased trader appetites 
for economically-sensitive industrial companies like Dow component 
Alcoa, which was up 3 15/8 at 59 5/16 today. Another Dow stock, 
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, was up 1 7/16 at 55 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology stocks were falling on profit-taking and some  
lingering anxiety about Internet stocks that have soared in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities,  
said there was some caution in the market today as traders awaited 
an earnings report from Amazon.com, scheduled to be released after 
the close of trading. Amazon's results were being watched closely 
as a possible harbinger of what's to come for other online 
companies. The company's stock was down 6 13/16 at 199 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 300.1 million shares, 
up slightly from Tuesday's pace.

</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas told the AP that while the sheriff  
may have stronger suspicions about the three men than other 
authorities, investigators have been interested in the trio since 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're among a group of people who we think have  
information,'' Thomas said. ``Are they people we believe have 
information about this? You bet. We have said that since day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News identified the three as Matthew  
Christianson, Matt Akard and Jim Branetti. 
</P>
<P>
	All three claimed to have heard of the slayings on the radio --  
and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released, Stone said. He said one had been expelled from Columbine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson said the three didn't know the gunmen, telling the  
News they ``were just three punks with a lot of curiosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at Akard's home late Tuesday  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have absolutely no interest in benefiting my son and I  
have nothing to say to you,'' the woman said before hanging up. 
Efforts to locate Christianson and Branetti were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the surveillance camera, the sheriff said it captured  
Harris and Klebold as they hurled homemade bombs and opened fire on 
terrified students in the cafeteria. Authorities have sent the 
tapes to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., to be analyzed 
frame-by-frame. Authorities previously had not said whether the 
tapes contained any useful images. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cafeteria attack, the two gunmen ran upstairs to the  
library where they caught many students studying during their lunch 
hour. They then ran into the administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shot the hell out of the administration office, but  
apparently there was no one in there,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also said the two gunmen initially tried to escape  
through three separate exits, and killed themselves only after 
being turned back by deputies' gunfire each time. Stone said a 
diary seized at the home of one of the killers indicated the gunmen 
planned to fly to Mexico or another country if they could escape, 
and kill themselves if they couldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island, some place to  
get away from America, or maybe come out and hijack and crash an 
airplane in New York City,'' he said, giving details from a diary 
that investigators have characterized as a sheaf of papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's disclosure came one week after the rampage. On Tuesday,  
silence fell across the Denver area and church bells tolled 15 
times -- one for each victim and the two gunmen. Televisions and 
radios fell silent for one minute at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, 
the bells rang out in joyous tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals for three more victims -- Matthew Kechter and Kyle  
Velasquez, both 16, and Corey DePooter, 17 -- were also held 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have questioned Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend,  
who bought at least two weapons used by Klebold and Harris. 
Investigators want to know whether she knew how the guns were to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, an employee at a Hugh M. Woods store in  
Littleton, told investigators he saw Harris and Klebold buy propane 
tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- material believed used 
in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he copied keys marked ``Do Not Duplicate'' for the  
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they are searching for a missing set of keys to  
the school, which authorities speculate may have allowed the 
killers to carry bombs inside before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I duplicated some keys for them, two sets of keys. On the keys  
it said ``Do Not Duplicate,''' Sowell told the Post. ``They brought 
in a set of five keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell said he copied the keys because ``after a while, you get  
to know the schools and you know it's common for teachers to do 
that, so you don't check on them.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Can't Substantiate Racial Slur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Embroiled in another racial controversy, the  
NHL had to admit the ugly reality of life on the ice. ``Zero 
tolerance'' often is hindered when there are zero witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Fact is, the annoying, personal and sometimes hateful words  
exchanged by players who are fighting for supremacy in a brutal 
game rarely travel to the ears of others or get caught on tape. The 
league ruled Tuesday that it was unable to confirm the latest 
accusation of racial hatred that crept into the game, leaving Sandy 
McCarthy and Tie Domi to settle their dispute the way it started -- 
one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing tapes and interviewing both players, league  
disciplinarian Colin Campbell ruled McCarthy and Domi are the only 
ones who know what happened Monday night on the national stage of a 
Stanley Cup playoff game. Both players will be on the ice again 
tonight in Game 4 of the contentious first-round series between 
Philadelphia and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the on-ice or off-ice officials could confirm having  
heard an offensive remark,'' Campbell, vice president and director 
of hockey operations, said in a statement from New York. ``The 
league is on record as having a zero-tolerance policy regarding any 
racially motivated behavior, and any claim that a taunt or slur 
took place is an extremely serious one. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a thorough investigation, however, we have concluded  
this allegation cannot be independently substantiated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After trading shoves and words with Domi during Toronto's 2-1  
victory Monday night, McCarthy said the Maple Leafs forward 
``dropped an N-bomb on me'' during a heated exchange in the second 
period. Officials on the ice and players for both teams said they 
didn't hear the slur. Domi denied using it, saying instead that 
McCarthy had spit in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never use those kind of words, and he knows that,''  
Domi said. ``He can say what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, whose father is black and mother white, said it was  
the first time he'd had a racial slur directed at him in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's awful for the game,'' McCarthy said Tuesday at  
the Flyers' training facility in suburban New Jersey. ``That's why 
it shouldn't be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said he was sure Domi used the slur.  
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt whatsoever,'' McCarthy said. ``You can't mistake that  
word for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a workout at a separate New Jersey training site, Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn defended Domi. Asked why McCarthy would make such 
an accusation, Quinn said, ``I think he's bloody embarrassed by 
spitting in the man's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi added: ``It's something that will hopefully blow over. I've  
played with black guys in the league and I respect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, some NHL players have been accused of attacking  
the heritage of black players, whose numbers are still small but 
growing in a sport dominated by whites. In fact, McCarthy was 
involved in one of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	While with Tampa Bay, he and Darcy Tucker were cleared of  
accusations they made racial gestures at Florida Panthers forward 
Peter Worrell, who is black, during an exhibition game in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was proven that nothing happened,'' McCarthy said. ``We  
talked to Peter on the phone, and he said, `I don't know what's 
going on, but I didn't hear anything and nothing happened.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Berube, now with the Flyers, was found guilty of using a  
slur while with Washington in November 1997 and was suspended. 
Shortly thereafter, the league announced a ``zero-tolerance'' 
policy on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing a sport where guys are nuts out there  
sometimes,'' Berube said. ``They're losing their minds, they're 
saying things. I say things. Everybody says stuff and does stuff 
they shouldn't do. You don't want to do it, but at the time you're 
not thinking like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though no league action was taken, the specter of racial hate  
still hangs over the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said racial insults were  
prevalent during his Hall of Fame career. Even fewer blacks were in 
the league when he played from 1969-84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you're a black player like Sandy McCarthy, none of us  
can understand what calling a person that name does to you,'' 
Clarke said. ``It's up to the league to control that kind of stuff. 
And if an official hears it, then they should do something to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes down to one player's words against another's,  
there seem to be zero answers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Intel Worker Loses E-Mail Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- A judge ordered a disgruntled former employee  
who bombarded Intel Corp. workers with company-bashing electronic 
mail from sending any more of the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came Tuesday in the case of Ken Hamidi, 51, of Citrus  
Heights, an Intel Corp. engineer fired in 1995 over unresolved 
claims of job-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi started a group called Former and Current  
Employees-Intel, known as Face-Intel, devoted to proving that Intel 
mistreats its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, a Santa Clara-based producer of microprocessors, says the  
stories posted on Face-Intel's Web site -- such as blaming Intel for 
one worker's suicide and accusing the company of running a 
sweatshop in Malaysia -- are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi also has waged a direct e-mail campaign, sending Intel  
employees messages seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento Superior Court Judge John R. Lewis granted Intel's  
request that Hamidi be barred from sending electronic missives to 
its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company argued that Hamidi's e-mails, sent on separate  
occasions to as many as 30,000 Intel employees, were the equivalent 
of trespassing on the company's private computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mere connection of Intel's e-mail system with the Internet  
does not convert it into a public forum,'' the judge wrote. ``The 
court finds that Hamidi's e-mails are not protected speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel vs. Ken Hamidi case gained national attention among  
First Amendment advocates. Some fear the ruling could significantly 
restrict the freedom to send e-mail to specific groups of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamidi said he plans to appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods jumped a larger-than-expected 2 percent in 
March, raising hopes that better days may be ahead for America's 
beleaguered manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the March  
increase in orders for durable goods followed a 3.9 percent decline 
in February, which was revised upward to show more strength than 
the initial estimate of a 4.9 percent plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe into  
recession has severely cut into American exports and also opened up 
U.S. manufacturers in such sectors as steel to increased 
competition from cheaper priced foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has been performing well,  
manufacturers have been forced to cut more than 300,000 jobs in the 
past year as America's trade deficit hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted that the better-than-expected March rise in  
orders represented the fourth gain in factory demand in the past 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector may be turning the corner,'' said  
Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. ``It is 
too soon to declare an end to manufacturing's long hard winter, but 
spring appears to be bringing a new bloom to this sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, said that while the rebound in March was skewed by 
strength in the volatile transportation sector, there were 
encouraging signs of strength in other sectors, including consumer 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The indication of new life in manufacturing helped lift spirits  
even higher on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 
at another record, although prices fell on the inflation-sensitive 
bond market as traders adopted a more cautious approach before 
release of a report Thursday on wage pressures in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall 2 percent in durable goods orders was led by a 3.6  
percent jump in demand for autos, airplanes and other 
transportation goods. Without this increase, the overall advance 
would be been a smaller 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for industrial machinery rose 2.9 percent last month  
while orders for electronic equipment were up 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The one area of weakness was primary metals, including steel, a  
sector that is petitioning the government for higher tariffs to 
slow a flood of cheaper foreign steel from coming into the United 
States. In March, orders for primary metals for U.S. plants fell 
1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for military goods soared 36.2 percent in March.  
Excluding defense items, orders for all other goods rose 1 percent 
for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of durable goods, which economists closely watch for  
signals about current conditions, rose 1.3 percent in March, 
following a much weaker 0.1 percent February gain.

<HEADLINE> Photo Satellite Never Reached Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A satellite that can take the kind of  
detailed photos once limited only to spy satellites never made it 
into orbit and any surviving remnants likely dropped into the South 
Pacific, the rocket's manufacturer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1 disappeared Tuesday almost immediately after it was  
launched from California's coast. The loss was a blow to Space 
Imaging, a Denver company that planned to market the 
high-resolution images, and Lockheed Martin, maker of the 
four-stage Athena II rocket that carried the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket apparently did not have enough velocity to place the  
satellite into orbit, disappearing while trying to reach orbit, 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not say how much money was invested in satellite  
and the launch but said the mission was insured. Athena launches 
run from about $20 million to $25 million, according to the 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ikonos images were expected to draw buyers for use in urban  
planning, environmental monitoring, mapping, assessing the scope of 
natural disasters, oil and gas exploration, monitoring farmland and 
planning communication networks, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1, named after the Greek word for ``image,'' has a camera  
capable of resolving objects 1 meter square -- about 10 square feet. 
The satellite would be able to distinguish between a car and truck, 
according to Space Imaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, only military satellites have been able to photograph  
Earth in such detail. Some experts said they worried that images 
from Ikonos 1 could be used by terrorists or enemy governments to 
plan attacks or spot mobilizing troops, but the federal government 
approved the satellite in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Doc Apologizes for Taking Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A Japanese doctor apologized for taking  
medical research from the Mayo Clinic and agreed to help the 
prestigious institution validate years of study that were 
compromised by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	All charges against Dr. Yoichi Ito will be dismissed if he  
fulfills the conditions of a negotiated agreement within six 
months, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ward. The agreement 
was reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ito, 32, downloaded research information dating back to 1990  
onto disks, photographed the laboratory and took tissue samples, 
gene-sequencing data and original research books critical to the 
lab's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The orthopedic surgeon had nearly completed a two-year research  
fellowship at Rochester-based Mayo when he was arrested March 25, 
days before his scheduled return to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear why Ito took the research, the U.S. attorney's  
office said. In his apology, Ito said that taking the material was 
``reckless'' because the tissue samples could have been lost or 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ito's attorney, Charles Hawkins, said his client had permission  
to take some tissue and slides with him to continue his research in 
Japan, but mistakenly thought he could also take data and 
additional samples. 
</P>
<P>
	He now expects to finish the required work at Mayo within two  
weeks and then return home, Hawkins said.

<HEADLINE> Archer Offers Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unfazed by lack of support from his own  
party's leaders, a Republican House committee chairman unveiled an 
alternative to President Clinton's Social Security rescue plan 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there are plenty of politicians on both sides  
of the aisle who don't want to touch Social Security,'' said Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. ``Our challenge is to put politics aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer has worked for weeks with Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. to  
develop a GOP Social Security plan that would use stock market 
earnings from new individual retirement accounts to finance some 
future Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the accounts would come from Social Security payroll  
taxes that are now collected in excess of what's needed to pay 
benefits to current retirees. With the huge baby boom generation in 
middle age and still working, those Social Security surpluses are 
expected to accumulate for about 15 more years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Archer aides said that once baby boomers begin  
retiring, some additional money may be needed to finance the 
accounts during a transition period -- something that could clash 
with GOP desires to offer broad income tax cuts in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, pledged in a statement to  
``take a close look'' at the Archer-Shaw proposal. But he added: 
``Make no mistake. Any efforts to enact a Social Security reform 
plan must be done in a bipartisan manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have told the party's rank-and-file that  
trying to move a GOP Social Security initiative through Congress 
before the 2000 presidential campaign would be too risky 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he will seek negotiations with the White House in  
pursuit of a bipartisan compromise based on his plan, rather than 
trying to push legislation through his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the president told Archer in a  
telephone conversation Tuesday evening that he prefers his own 
approach to reforming the nation's retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan includes having the government handle bulk  
investment of some Social Security cash reserves in the stock 
market, as well as new government-subsidized personal retirement 
accounts for low- and middle-income workers that would be in 
addition to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the president said he would examine the Archer-Shaw  
alternative and consult with congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president said was ... he appreciated that chairman  
Archer was putting forward a serious proposal ... and that if we 
had criticisms of it that they would be done in a constructive 
manner,'' said Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Democrats quickly called a news conference to  
question both Archer's intentions and the soundness of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rhetoric and in a close look it's a risky scheme,'' said  
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Archer-Shaw plan, American workers would get a tax  
credit, equal to 2 percent of their wages up to the limit of 
earnings taxed by Social Security. That limit is $72,600 this year, 
so the largest possible credit if the plan were in effect for 1999 
would be $1,452. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would go into individual ``Social Security Guarantee''  
accounts that workers could choose to invest with private 
investment firms offering what would essentially be 
government-approved mutual funds comprised of 60 percent stocks and 
40 percent bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Once workers retired, their accounts would go toward buying an  
annuity plan to help pay their Social Security benefits. For people 
whose accounts run short, the government would make up the money 
needed to give them retirement benefits equal to what Social 
Security promises now. Those whose accounts earned extra could keep 
it.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Pay Cap Effort Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bank of America Chairman Hugh McColl  
earned a smaller bonus in 1998 because of losses from a hedge fund 
and Russian bonds, but shareholders rejected a permanent cap on his 
pay at the company's annual meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists had proposed limiting McColl's total compensation, as  
well as limiting hefty severance packages like the one given to 
former Bank of America Chief Executive David Coulter. Shareholders 
overwhelmingly rejected both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulter, 51, was president of the newly merged Bank of America  
for a month when he resigned under pressure last fall. His 
departure came after the disclosure last October that the bank lost 
$372 million because of the old BankAmerica's partnership with D.E. 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulter departed with 300,000 shares of bank stock and a $5  
million annual pension for life. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal Wednesday would have limited any future severance  
packages to no more than $3 million without a vote by shareholders. 
Another would have limited the ratio between the salaries of Bank 
of America's top executives and its lowest-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, McColl's bonus from NationsBank was $3.5 million,  
accounting for more than two-thirds of his total compensation of 
$4.64 million. His 1998 bonus was $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, McColl told the bank's senior management he should  
bear responsibility for Bank of America's losses when it came time 
to hand out bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America lost $372 million because of the old  
BankAmerica's partnership with D.E. Shaw, which was using complex 
computer-driven strategies to invest in derivatives and bond 
trading strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 investor lawsuits have been filed against Bank of  
America over the Shaw losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses prompted the resignation of Coulter, the old  
BankAmerica chairman and CEO who was to be president of the 
combined bank and was widely regarded as McColl's eventual 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also voted to officially change the name of the  
bank holding company to Bank of America Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer James Hance Jr. laid out the company's  
long-term goals for shareholders, including growth in earnings per 
share in the 12 percent to 15 percent range and return on equity 
between 17 percent and 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Renault To Build Plant in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- French automaker Renault on Wednesday  
laid the cornerstone of a $120 million engine plant in southern 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The new factory will be built in the city of Curitiba, 217 miles  
southwest of Sao Paulo, next to the auto plant Renault inaugurated 
less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is expected to be concluded by early 2000 with an  
initial annual output of 57,000 engines, the automaker's press 
office said. By 2002, the factory will be producing 280,000 units a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The engines to be produced at the new plant will equip the cars  
produced by Renault in Brazil and Argentina and will later be 
exported to other Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
	They will also equip the cars that will be made by Peugeot,  
which is building a factory in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Peugeot 
is expected to purchase 250,000 Renault engines between 2001 and 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Inaugurated Dec.4, 1998 the Renault factory produces the Scenic  
minivan and will start making the Clio compact model later this 
year.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Campaign Spending Declined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of congressional candidates dropped  
last year, when many challengers who didn't have a real chance to 
win decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission said 2,100 candidates ran for  
the House and Senate in 1998, down from 2,605 in 1996. The amount 
of money they spent declined as well, from $765 million in the 
1995-96 election cycle to $740 million in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first drop in both the number of candidates and the  
money they spent running for Congress since 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican political consultant Jack Cookfair said some  
candidates figured that if they couldn't win in 1996, a 
presidential election year when voter turnout is higher, they 
weren't going to win the next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you couldn't get it done in '96, you couldn't get it done  
in '98,'' Cookfair said. ``I assume there were many districts like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other political observers said prospective candidates saw that  
they couldn't raise the money to run a competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 94 incumbents had no major party opposition in 1998,  
and another 114 faced opponents who raised $25,000 or less, 
according to Common Cause, an advocacy group that favors 
overhauling the way congressional campaigns are funded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money is typically so dominated by incumbents that  
challengers can't compete or they don't even run at all,'' said 
Donald Simon of Common Cause. ``We're simply having fewer and fewer 
real elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Senate spender in 1995-96 was Republican Sen.  
Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who lost his re-election bid to 
Democrat Charles Schumer despite spending $24.2 million. Schumer 
ranked third in spending with $16.7 million. Second was Republican 
Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, who spent $17.7 million in ousting 
incumbent Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House side, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., spent  
$7.6 million, much of it to help fellow Republicans. But the next 
four biggest spenders all lost their races -- Democrat Philip Maloof 
of New Mexico; Democrats Christopher Gabrieli and John O'Connor of 
Massachusetts, both of whom lost a primary for the nomination to 
succeed retiring Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II; and former Rep. Bob 
Dornan, R-Calif., who failed to win a rematch with Democratic Rep. 
Loretta Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	The average House candidate spent $247,268 last year and the  
average Senate candidate spent $1.1 million.

<HEADLINE> 200 Arrested in Car Theft Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- FBI agents have launched a crackdown on auto  
theft rings across the nation, setting stings with the help of 
state lawmen against dozens of traders in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal agents have targeted more than 200 people for  
arrest in 22 cities in Operation Sudden Stop; almost 100 are 
suspected of running major operations in the San Antonio region, 
150 miles from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like a lot of the cars we weren't recovering were  
going into Mexico,'' police Lt. Mike Ross said Tuesday. ``They 
would go out all in one day and steal this number of cars that were 
on their shopping list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auto thefts are declining -- down 3.8 percent in 1997 and 16.5  
percent since 1993. But FBI Assistant Director Thomas Pickard said 
recoveries of stolen vehicles also are down, and only 14 percent of 
auto thefts result in arrests, ``the lowest success rate for any 
major crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard blamed the low rate in part on the FBI's ``lack of focus  
on it due to violence in the cities.'' He said in the early and 
mid-1990s, the FBI and state and local police shifted agents from 
interstate theft work to higher priority operations against violent 
street gangs and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 1.4 million vehicles worth $8 billion were stolen and  
nearly 447,000 were never recovered. Pickard said the FBI and 
Customs Service estimate that 200,000 of these were shipped 
overseas for resale. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickard said they found theft rings whose members came from  
traditional 1930s organized crime groups and others made up 
primarily of Russian or Asian organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI worked in task forces with the Customs Service; the  
National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit insurance industry 
group; and state and local police and U.S. attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	They used surveillance, informants, wiretaps and even set up  
undercover storefronts to buy stolen parts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to San Antonio, authorities said arrests had  
happened or were expected in Cleveland; Columbia, S.C.; Detroit; 
Houston; Indianapolis; Las Vegas, Nev.; Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis, 
Tenn.; Miami; Mobile, Ala.; Oklahoma City; Salt Lake City; San 
Diego; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Springfield, Ill.; St. Louis; Tampa, 
Fla.; Pittsburgh; Omaha, Neb.; Sacramento, Calif.; and Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration opened the way  
Wednesday for the sale of food and medical items to three countries 
listed as terrorist states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- arguing that 
economic sanctions often do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales of food, medicine and other humanitarian necessities do  
not generally enhance a nation's military capacity or support 
terrorism,'' Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told 
reporters. ``On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural 
commodities and products are not available for other, less 
desirable uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose in applying sanctions is to influence the behavior  
of regimes, not to deny people their basic humanitarian needs,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring such sales usually fails to hurt targeted regimes while  
depriving American companies of export opportunities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy is part of a broader attempt at comprehensive  
sanctions reform. The goal is to resort to unilateral sanctions 
only after all other options, including diplomacy and multilateral 
sanctions, have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changed approach, humanitarian items will be exempted  
from future sanctions. Wednesday's announcement will not affect 
Iraq, North Korea and Cuba, all sanctioned countries to which sales 
of certain items are already permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the changed policy  
meant a pending Iranian request for more than $500 million worth of 
American grain and sugar will be approved. A number of farm state 
senators and House members have been seeking approval of the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., welcomed the policy shift, saying in  
a telephone interview that the administration has, in effect, been 
telling farmers, ``'You pay the cost of our foreign policy.''' He 
added: ``Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein have never missed a meal 
because of our sanctions policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that large grain stocks have led to depressed prices.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a strong advocate of sanctions reform,  
also was supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that food and medicine should be used as a  
tool of foreign policy,'' said Lugar, the Senate Agriculture 
Committee chairman. ``Doing so typically injures innocent civilians 
in the sanctioned country, imposes little hardship on recalcitrant 
leaders whose behavior we wish to change and opens the door for 
other exporting countries to replace the U.S. as a food supplier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government experts predict the policy change could increase  
wheat and corn exports by 1 million tons, said Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the new policy is not directed at any particular  
country. Among the countries subject to curbs on food and medicine, 
only Iran has been a target of a U.S. effort for improved 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has called for resumption of an official  
dialogue with Iran but thus far has been rebuffed. Iran was one of 
America's most important allies in the Middle East until the 
pro-American monarchy was toppled two decades ago and replaced by a 
regime led largely by Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Cuba, Eizenstat noted that sales of medicine and medical  
supplies are allowed with certain limitations under legislation 
approved in 1992, and the regulated sales of food, pesticides and 
related items were permitted under a policy shift announced in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Iraq is subject to unilateral U.S. sanctions as well  
as U.N.-mandated sanctions, it has been authorized to sell oil on 
the international market so long as the proceeds are earmarked for 
purchases of humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, despite unilateral sanctions against North Korea,  
the administration approved the donation of tens of thousands of 
tons of food assistance to that country in recent years through the 
U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
offered conditional support for the policy. Marc Thiessen, a Helms 
spokesman, said: ``Every dollar Iran or Sudan or Libya wants to 
spend on American grain instead of on terrorism or weapons of mass 
destruction is fine with us.''

<HEADLINE> Hasselhoff Has Ideas for 'Baywatch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The head lifeguard for ``Baywatch Hawaii'' has  
dined with Gov. Ben Cayetano, scouted out story ideas and started 
looking for a house. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hasselhoff said he already has five episodes in mind as  
the syndicated adventure show moves production from California to 
the Aloha State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get into the folklore of Hawaii -- the real life  
stories,'' the 46-year-old star of the series said Monday. ``I want 
to play off the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, watched by 100 million people in 148 countries, is  
moving from Los Angeles after nine seasons because of increasing 
costs and declining ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii offered the show a $3 million incentive package plus free  
airfare, hotel and car rentals. The private sector also chipped in 
to outbid Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will film in Haleiwa on Oahu's North Shore and in the  
same Honolulu film studio once used by ``Hawaii Five-0.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Futures Soar on Inventory Data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures soared back above $18 a barrel Wednesday on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange after weekly inventory figures 
showed sharp declines, signalling producers are adhering to 
promised cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium futures fell sharply, while grains  
and soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped after the American Petroleum Institute reported  
U.S. inventories tumbled 4.7 million barrels last week to 336.4 
million barrels after a sharp decline in imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline -- nearly four times the size of analysts'  
expectations -- was the first strong indication that world oil 
producers are finally serious about slashing daily output to 
sustain higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and  
other key producers agreed to remove 2.1 million barrels daily from 
the market beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said if they succeed at reducing about two-thirds  
that amount, supplies would be cut enough to force prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	American inventories now are 6.6 million barrels lower than this  
time a year ago and could get smaller. Venezuela, widely considered 
one of the weak links in meeting quotas, announced its output will 
fall below current production targets as some refineries undergo 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts cautioned that reports of tanker loadings  
show an increase in activity that could cause supplies to rebound 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for June delivery rose 62 cents to $18.45 a barrel; May  
heating oil rose 1.06 cents to 44.11 cents a gallon; May unleaded 
gasoline rose 1.29 cents to 53.89 cents a gallon; May natural gas 
rose 1.7 cents to $2.348 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures tumbled 4 percent on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after Russia's main producer of the industrial metal said 
it had resumed shipments after a long halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant Norilsk Nickel mine, the main Russian producer, said  
Monday it had resumed shipments after a four-month absence from the 
market that had driven prices sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Western manufacturers, particularly Japan, used palladium in  
cleaner-burning emissions controls for cars and in electronics. 
Russia, which producers about two-thirds of the world's supply, 
however, has not shipped the metal since December amid bureacratic 
wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium fell $15.50 to $335.50 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade  
after the Clinton administration moved to ease some sanctions 
against foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rose after President Clinton acted to exempt food and  
medicine from future sanctions, a decision that could significantly 
boost export demand for beleaguered American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, commercial licenses to sell agricultural  
and medicinal products under existing U.S. sanctions -- against 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Sudan -- will be reviewed 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also rose amid continued uncertainty about  
weather conditions in Midwest growing regions. The National Weather 
Service is calling for normal temperatures and above-normal 
rainfall over the next week, while some private forecasters say 
showers will only be scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer will determine whether farmers will be able to  
proceed with fieldwork already delayed by heavy recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.63 1/2 a bushel; July corn fell 1/4  
cent to $2.19 1/2 a bushel, while other contract months rose; July 
soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.89 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Chief Khmer Rouge Torturer Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The feared chief of the Khmer  
Rouge's security service, who ordered the torture and killing of at 
least 14,000 men, women and children in the late 1970s, has been 
found, a newsmagazine reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the man known as Duch was to appear in  
Thursday's issue of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic 
Review, the weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	British photographer Nic Dunlop and Review reporter Nate Thayer,  
who in 1997 became the first outsider to see the notorious Khmer 
Rouge leader Pol Pot in 18 years, met Duch. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch disappeared when the Khmer Rouge were toppled in 1979 and  
has long been presumed dead. Actually, he converted to Christianity 
and worked until late last year with various international aid 
organizations who were unaware of his identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government privately confirmed awareness of Duch's general  
whereabouts two years ago, though no move was made to take him into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch, 56, told the Review that he was deeply sorry for the  
killings and was willing to face an international tribunal. Genuine 
remorse would contrast with the grudging apologies offered by some 
Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch's emergence could increase pressure on Prime Minister Hun  
Sen to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to trial. In theory, he could be 
the key witness, able to implicate those above and below him. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk Chhang, director of a documentation center that has  
gathered evidence for such a trial, shook his head in amazement 
today when shown a recent image of Duch by Associated Press 
Television News, which has obtained exclusive video shot by Dunlop. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's important is to have him alive,'' Youk Chhang said.  
``He's the key person who could testify as to how the leaders 
advised him, in terms of security, on assassination and killing of 
the so-called enemies of the revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duch brought the organizational abilities of the teacher he once  
was to his job as security chief, helping create the Khmer Rouge 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	The best estimate -- made by the U.S.-funded Cambodian Genocide  
Program -- is that 1.7 million Cambodians out of a population of 7.9 
million were killed, tortured, starved or worked to death during 
the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch -- born Kaing Khek Iev in 1942 -- headed the internal  
security organization and was the director of Tuol Sleng, a Phnom 
Penh high school transformed into an interrogation prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims were chained to bed-frames and tortured to force false  
``confessions'' -- often to spying for the United States and Vietnam 
-- and then executed in a field outside the capital, where a pile of 
skulls serves as their memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven people out of thousands survived Tuol Sleng.  
</P>
<P>
	One, artist Vann Nath, 53, was kept alive to paint propaganda  
pictures. After the Khmer Rouge fell, he painted scenes of the 
horror that now hang on the walls of Tuol Sleng, which has been 
made into a genocide museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Shown a recent photograph, Vann Nath had no problem recognizing  
his former jailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duch,'' Vann Nath said, pointing. ``Even though he is old, I  
recognize him. He's alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Duch and other Khmer Rouge should be prosecuted,  
Vann Nath said: ``That's up to the government, not to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say prosecution would be easy. His signature is  
everywhere. A 1978 document shows that 17 children whose parents 
were suspected of treachery were brought to Tuol Sleng. Duch signed 
an order saying, ``Kill them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such notes went to Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader who was  
himself toppled in a power struggle in 1997 and died a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass executions of members of the old government followed the  
Khmer Rouge victory over a U.S.-backed regime in 1975. The cities 
were emptied and the entire population forced into rural slave 
labor camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978, and took Phnom  
Penh two weeks later. Hanoi's troops found the last victims of Tuol 
Sleng, executed while still chained to the beds, blood smearing the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch reportedly fled just ahead of them, but not before  
executing a prisoner who had helped him destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Supported by the United States, China and Thailand, the Khmer  
Rouge fought from the jungles against Vietnam's occupation through 
the 1980s. They rejected a U.N. peace plan and kept fighting 
against a Cambodian government elected in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one senior Khmer Rouge figure, hard-line general Ta Mok, is  
in custody awaiting trial. Most other leaders are living in freedom 
in exchange for making peace with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors indicated this week that they may charge Nuon Chea  
and Khieu Samphan, two close lieutenants of Pol Pot.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Changing Sanctions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government experts believe an easing of  
restrictions on the sale of humanitarian items to adversary 
countries could increase American wheat and corn exports by 1 
million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	One such country, Iran, has a pending request for the purchase  
of $500 million worth of American grain and sugar. U.S. officials 
said there was no certainty the request would be approved, despite 
the easing of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries eligible to purchase humanitarian items under  
the rules change announced Wednesday are Libya and Sudan. The three 
countries are on a State Department list of state sponsors of 
terrorism, but the Clinton administration concluded that sanctions 
on exports of food and medical items were counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales of food, medicine and other humanitarian necessities do  
not generally enhance a nation's military capacity or support 
terrorism,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told 
reporters. ``On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural 
commodities and products are not available for other, less 
desirable uses. Our purpose in applying sanctions is to influence 
the behavior of regimes, not to deny people their basic 
humanitarian needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring such sales usually fails to hurt targeted regimes while  
depriving American companies of export opportunities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy is part of a broader attempt at comprehensive  
sanctions reform. The goal is to resort to unilateral sanctions 
only after all other options, including diplomacy and multilateral 
sanctions, have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., welcomed the policy shift, saying in  
a telephone interview that the administration has, in effect, been 
telling farmers, ``You pay the cost of our foreign policy.'' He 
added: ``Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein have never missed a meal 
because of our sanctions policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changed approach, humanitarian items will be exempted  
from future sanctions. Wednesday's announcement will not affect 
Iraq, North Korea and Cuba, all sanctioned countries where 
conditioned sales of certain items are already permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
said the new policy entails only modest changes that he could 
support. Helms said he had received assurances that food and 
medical sales to affected countries will be carried out only if 
there are no U.S.-backed subsidies of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Iran wants to pay cash-on-the barrel for American grain,  
that's fine with me,'' he said. ``Every dollar that Iran spends on 
U.S. farm products is a dollar that Iran cannot spend on terrorism 
or weapons of mass destruction.''

<HEADLINE> A Recluse No More: Salman Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was no ordinary reading. Bags, briefcases and  
knapsacks were banned. Picture IDs were required. The hundreds of 
people entering the Great Hall at Cooper Union were frisked and 
scanned like airline passengers during a state of alert. 
</P>
<P>
	When the theater lights dimmed, the audience snapped into  
silence. A few minutes and two short introductions later, a smiling 
Salman Rushdie walked on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry about the inconvenience,'' the author said mildly, his  
voice accented more by his adopted country, England, than by his 
native India. ``But we're all inside now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had plotted this drama. The location was revealed days in  
advance. He chose a setting where previous speakers include 
anarchist Emma Goldman and statesman and journalist Frederick 
Douglass. He was undeterred by the fate of one predecessor, whose 
picture hung on the back wall: Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie read for half an hour from his new novel, ``The Ground  
Beneath Her Feet,'' a reworking of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice 
as lived out by an Indian rock band. He sounded confident, 
determined. ``I'm still alive,'' one passage from the book read, 
``and I've been spat at and called names only a couple of hundred 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For another half hour, Rushdie took questions. He was  
congratulated, analyzed, criticized. The tensest moment came after 
one woman offered a few complimentary words. She then approached 
the stage, security men responding in kind, and held up what 
appeared to be a bouquet of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	It was indeed a bouquet of carnations.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are writers who don't like reading their work and there  
are writers who do,'' Rushdie said to applause. ``I am one of the 
latter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With each question, he seemed less a myth, more a writer.  
Audience members had actually read him, not simply about him. One 
said his books were difficult (Rushdie didn't disagree). Another 
asked why his female characters were so loud and devouring, so 
larger than life. (Rushdie cited his three sisters as inspiration.) 
</P>
<P>
	Like his characters, Rushdie is not quite a man of this world.  
He is famous, controversial, an object of morbid fascination. He 
can write about rock stars not only because he knows some -- Lou 
Reed and U2's Bono are among his friends -- but because he has some 
idea what it is to be one. 
</P>
<P>
	And just as rock stars like the road, so does Rushdie. The  
``fatwa'' ordering his death came as he was about to tour the 
United States to promote ``The Satanic Verses.'' Now the threat is 
at least partly lifted and he's touring again, as if resuming a 
conversation cut off a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the fatwa came down,'' said his friend, John Irving, ``I  
remember thinking it couldn't have happened, for a lot of reasons, 
to a worse person. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of solitude that was suddenly imposed, the  
reclusiveness that became mandatory. I know a lot of writers for 
whom this wouldn't have changed their lives so traumatically. But 
Salman went everywhere and did everything and was a real social, 
urban guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few days before his reading, Rushdie sat for an interview. He  
was supposed to meet for dinner at a midtown Manhattan cafe, but at 
the last moment thought it wiser to avoid crowds. A snag had 
developed that no security measures could prevent: The author had 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	So, instead, he remained safely at the midtown offices of his  
agent, Andrew Wylie, a celebrity among agents whose clients include 
Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer and Philip Roth. 
</P>
<P>
	Without so much as a quick frisk, a reporter entered the office  
suite, the only visible security a large man in the reception area 
who wore a blue suit and did not smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated on a couch in a back room, Rushdie at 51 looks like a  
hip, tenured professor: round face and salt-and-pepper beard, 
wrinkled blazer, wrinkled khakis, unwrinkled T-shirt. He is relaxed 
and friendly, an articulate man who, but for his flu, likely could 
have talked into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feels ``80 percent'' safe, a change from last fall  
when he joyously, perhaps prematurely, told the media that his 
troubles were over. The Iranian government had distanced itself 
from the fatwa and Rushdie declared that the ``last chapter'' of 
his ordeal was complete, even boasting he was ``happy'' not to be a 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
	But now he shares the concerns that friends like authors Susan  
Sontag and Paul Auster have expressed about him. Religious leaders 
and others in Iran and elsewhere still wish him dead. He remains a 
prize both for determined enemies and misguided fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual crazies are things lots of so-called well-known  
people have to deal with,'' Rushdie said. ``And there are ways of 
dealing with it, as individuals. It doesn't always work -- John 
Lennon, Gianni Versace -- but usually you can construct a private 
life and guard yourself against the individual crank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is murder in his new novel, and disasters of a more  
natural kind. ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is set in Bombay, 
London and New York City. It has three main characters: Vina 
Apsara, a world famous rock singer; guitarist and songwriter Ormus 
Cama, her lover and band mate; and the narrator, a tone-deaf 
photographer known as Rai. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Eurydice died and Orpheus descended to the underworld to  
retrieve her, Vita is lost in an earthquake in Mexico and Ormus 
tries to bring her back, even finding someone else he thinks is 
her. In this book, reality itself rests on a fault line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is, and is not, a work of  
fiction. It is set in the counterculture of the 1960s, '70s and 
'80s. But this culture lives only in the author's mind. President 
Kennedy survives Dallas, John Lennon sings Rolling Stones music and 
Nathan Zuckerman writes a controversial novel called ``Carnovsky'' 
(both fictional creations of Philip Roth). 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie also reinvents some personal history. The fictional  
earthquake happens on Feb. 14, 1989, the day the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini's fatwa was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted the date to mean something different for me. I didn't  
want it to have just this terrible meaning. And I thought, `Now, 
it's the date my novel begins.' It's a way of repossessing my 
life,'' Rushdie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his name was in headlines, it was in bookstores. He was a  
gifted young writer, admired for his uninhibited language, his 
storytelling and his humor, likened to Gunter Grass and Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just such a wonderful writer,'' said Nobel laureate  
Nadine Gordimer, ``somebody who's extravagant, wild, full of 
wonderful imagination, bursting with ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``And as he himself has said, `What a writer is for, is to say  
the unsayable.' And that's what he has done and that's what brought 
him so much trouble. But there is so much tenderness and love of 
life in his book. People simply know about the fatwa and the 
offense he has supposedly caused. But they haven't read the 
books,'' the South African writer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie has written seven novels, a collection of short stories  
and three nonfiction books. His second novel, ``Midnight's 
Children,'' won the Booker Prize and is regarded by many as among 
the finest works of fiction of the past 30 years. ``The Satanic 
Verses'' and ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' are nearly as acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The odd experience of reading his work is that you can't always  
tell what preceded the fatwa and what came after. In ``Midnight's 
Children,'' published in 1981, the narrator defines himself as 
``destined to forsake privacy, and be sucked into the annihilating 
multitudes.'' He is a man ``handcuffed to history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The narrator is, and isn't, Salman Rushdie. Both were born in  
Bombay in 1947. But his character was born in August, at the very 
moment of India's independence. Rushdie was born two months before. 
</P>
<P>
	His father was a businessman, both parents storytellers. They  
were Muslim, but remained so more out of convenience than creed. 
One reason the fatwa shocked him was that Rushdie had grown up in a 
household that tolerated the most blasphemous thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandfather was very religious. He said his prayers five  
times a day. (But) ... he was the most open-minded man,'' Rushdie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would sit down next to him and you would say,  
`Grandfather, I don't think there's a God.' And he'd say, `Really? 
Tell me all about it.' And I'd say, `Well, where does he live? He 
doesn't live in the sky. There are airplanes in the sky.' And he'd 
say, `That's true,' and he'd just hear you out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Rushdie considered an ordinary childhood changed as a  
teen-ager when he went to mission school in England. Racism rudely 
expanded this bright kid's mind. He was aware for the first time of 
being separated by color and culture, themes that appear in 
virtually all of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rushdie remained in England, studying history at his  
father's alma mater, King's College, Cambridge. He worked in 
underground theater, then as an advertising copywriter, writing 
fiction in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the narrator of ``The Moor's Last Sigh,'' Rushdie is an  
``information magpie.'' His influences include Greek and Roman 
literature, ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Shakespeare, Indian mythology, 
Elvis Presley and ``The Thousand and One Nights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first novel, the science fiction story ``Grimus,'' was  
published in 1975 and soon forgotten, likely the only uneventful 
book he will write. Over the next few years, Rushdie said, he 
realized that the best way to free his mind was to begin with 
something he knew. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was ``Midnight Children,'' in which he re-created his  
childhood Bombay and then narrated the city's downfall. Acclaimed 
worldwide, the novel was especially influential in India, a 
statement of literary independence the way ``Leaves of Grass'' was 
for American writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In India, the English language had come to be considered a  
symbol of the shame of colonialism,'' fellow Indian author Anita 
Desai later wrote. Rushdie transformed it into a symbol of India's 
energy and diversity, ``revitalized what had seemed faded, dormant 
and close to decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie said he never intended to be controversial (he naively  
thought everyone shared his opinions), but even before ``The 
Satanic Verses'' he was getting in trouble. The Gandhi family took 
offense to his portrayal of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 
``Midnight's Children.'' His next novel, ``Shame,'' was no kinder 
to the government in Pakistan, where the book was banned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he meant ``Satanic Verses'' to be based on his  
experiences in England. Religion was part of it -- the Prophet 
Mohammed and the origins of the Koran are duly satirized -- but 
hardly all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Satanic Verses'' was published in England in the fall of  
1988 to rave reviews. India, South Africa and other countries 
banned it. Protesters burned it. Riots killed five in Pakistan. In 
India, one person was killed and over 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Khomeini then announced the fatwa, which promised Rushdie's  
killer a place in heaven, and several Iranian leaders put a $5.2 
million bounty on Rushdie's head. The novel rushed to the top of 
best-seller lists. The author rushed into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I was less scared than disappointed,'' Rushdie said,  
who hid in Britain. ``You spend five years, which is what `Satanic 
Verses' took to write, really breaking yourself apart, stretching 
yourself, trying to utter something you hope is of interest and 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you're told that all you've done is insult someone. ...  
And I thought, all that work and is this what I get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writers throughout the world defended him. Petitions were  
signed. Rallies staged. Committees established. A memorable 
reaction was a poem from ``Invisible Man'' author Ralph Ellison: 
``Keep to your convictions/Try to protect yourself/A death sentence 
is a rather harsh review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But support was not universal, even among non-Muslims, even  
among writers. Former President Jimmy Carter thought his book ``a 
direct insult.'' Author Roald Dahl called him a ``dangerous 
opportunist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Personal feuds developed. In 1993, Rushdie divorced his wife,  
American author Marianne Wiggins, who initially joined him in 
hiding. She later said that Rushdie was self-obsessed and failed to 
help lesser-known authors in danger, a charge he called ``a serious 
defamation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, novelist John le Carre said Rushdie was ``arrogant''  
and that ``there was no law in life or nature that says great 
religions may be insulted with impunity.'' Rushdie called le Carre 
``pompous'' and a ``philistine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never used to be called arrogant until I started to defend  
`Satanic Verses,''' Rushdie says now. ``When you write a book and 
commit a public act, if you can't stand up for it then you're an 
idiot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His revenge, and his salvation, was to keep writing. In 1990, he  
published ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories,'' a short fable about a 
storyteller battling the evil opponents of imagination. Then came a 
collection of stories, ``East, West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he published ``The Moor's Last Sigh,'' his first  
full-length work since the fatwa. The book is narrated by an exiled 
storyteller whose body ages at double speed. Its tone is urgent, 
defiant. ``Fear,'' Rushdie wrote, is ``like any bullying tyrant, it 
rules your life with a stupid blinding omnipotence, or else you 
overthrow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew that before the page could be turned I actually  
had to write the next big novel,'' Rushdie said during the 
interview. ``I had to show myself that I hadn't been wrecked by it. 
... There was a lot riding on it. And there were a lot of people 
waiting for me to take a tumble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years after the fatwa, Rushdie says he has never been  
happier. He is remarried, with a daughter who is nearly 2. He is 
deeply grateful to those who spoke out on his behalf. He is proud 
that he avoided two traps set by the fatwa: writing timid novels, 
or writing bitter ones. 
</P>
<P>
	What he learned, he says, is not how bad people can be but how  
good. If Rushdie were to write a memoir, it would resemble, of all 
things, what he calls ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'': a love 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayhem continues, I don't deny it, but we're also capable  
of this,'' he writes near the end of the novel, when the narrator 
winds up in a calm, happy relationship. ``(D)rinking o.j. and 
munching muffins. Here's ordinary human love beneath my feet. Fall 
away, if you must, contemptuous earth; melt, rocks, and shiver, 
stones. I'll stand my ground, right here.''

	Yugoslav President's Hometown Bombed  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Belgrade television is reporting  
that a NATO missile struck the Yugoslavian President's Slobodan 
Milosevic's hometown. The Beta news agency said a ``powerful 
blast'' shattered windows in Pozarevac, 40 miles southeast of 
Belgrade. Last week, NATO missiles demolished one of Milosevic's 
Belgrade residences, although he had not been staying there. 
Meanwhile, Milosevic's regime has fired a deputy premier who 
suggested Belgrade was ready to accept key NATO demands for ending 
the crippling air campaign.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided House Wednesday night withheld its  
support for U.S. airstrikes in Yugoslavia after voting to limit 
President Clinton's authority to use ground troops. The House first 
voted 249 to 180 to make Clinton obtain congressional approval 
before sending ``ground elements'' to Yugoslavia. Then Democrats 
sought approval of a resolution to bestow after-the-fact blessings 
on the NATO bombing campaign. Despite the support of Republican 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, it failed on a 213-213 tie.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen pregnancy plummeted 17 percent in the  
1990s to the lowest level since 1973, and teen abortion rates were 
down, too. Researchers point to a mix of reasons, including more 
reliable contraception, fear of AIDS, a new focus on abstinence and 
even the strong economy. New statistics from the Department of 
Health and Human Services show that births to teen-agers fell 4 
percent in 1997, helping to push the national birth rate for all 
women to a record low.

said negotiations had resolved the major issues that had prevented 
the IMF from resuming a lending program cut off in August. After a

three of the four guns used in the massacre. Investigators had said 
gunman Dylan Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, bought two 
shotguns and a rifle last fall. A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun 
has not yet been traced. Authorities have repeatedly said Anderson

 *Tidbits From the Business World    	
</P>
<P>
	REVAMPING THE ANNUAL REPORT: Most corporate annual reports are  
slick publications, filled with stunning photos of corporate 
headquarters and research labs and shots of beaming customers and 
contented workers. Cognex Corp., which makes machines that inspect 
products during manufacturing, takes a different approach with its 
1998 report. Printed on plain brown paper and illustrated with line 
drawings and graphs that use pine trees instead of bars, the report 
is set up like an adventurer's guide. It has chapters called 
``Terrain,'' ``Navigation'' and ``Climate'' to detail its 
performance. The report has quotes from well-known people such as 
Oliver Wendell Holmes and Alexander Graham Bell (``leave the beaten 
track occasionally and dive into the woods''), and the only photo 
is of chairman Robert Shillman, wearing safari garb. The report 
does say Cognex's results dropped last year due to the Asian 
economic crisis, and says business should be better this year 
although ``it's still going to be chilly.''

	VANISHING BONUSES: While many Americans hope for a big cash  
bonus at work, most of them don't seem to have too much fun with 
the money once they get it. A survey of 1,000 Americans taken by 
the polling company Wirthlin Worldwide for American Express found 
that 29 percent of the respondents used their last cash bonus or 
reward to pay bills. Another 18 percent don't remember where the 
money went. Only 9 percent used the money for something special, 
and 5 percent took a vacation. Other uses for the money included 
gifts for family members, the purchase of household items and 
deposits to savings.

	BUSINESS IS GOING SWIMMINGLY: The booming economy and more  
secure paychecks has prompted more homeowner to install swimming 
pools, reports the National Spa &AMP; Pool Institute. The trade group 
says inground pool sales rose 14 percent last year, a big increase 
over a 0.6 percent increase in 1997. Installation of the pool 
itself can cost up to $25,000, with decking, landscaping and other 
features adding to the price. The institute says there are 
currently about 3.8 million residential inground pools in the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> States Mull Gun Lawsuit Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	State senators in Florida and North Carolina shelved bills  
banning class action lawsuits against gunmakers, saying debate 
would be unseemly after the shooting at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House lawmakers in North Carolina and South Carolina  
approved similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the bill appeared headed for passage before the  
massacre in Littleton, Colo., where two teen-agers used shotguns 
and semiautomatic weapons to kill 13 people and then themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the Colorado situation last week, I think the  
discussion of the bill would not be on the merits of the bill but 
on the emotional aspect of the tragic killings of the students and 
the teacher,'' Florida Senate President Toni Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida House canceled debate on the bill last week.  
</P>
<P>
	The action came as legislatures in other states have been  
pulling gun proposals from debate. Meanwhile, cities including 
Miami, Chicago, New Orleans and Detroit have sued gunmakers in 
efforts to recover damages for crimes involving firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some support for the gun industry in the  
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, the House approved a bill Tuesday blocking  
class-action lawsuits against gun manufacturers. However, the 
Senate decided to pull its version of the plan from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsor, Sen. Fountain Odom, remained confident it  
would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fairly limited in scope,'' the Democrat said. ``It just  
deals with what political subdivisions should be allowed to take an 
action.'' 
</P>

	In South Carolina, a bill banning local governments from suing  
gun manufacturers received approval in the House on Tuesday. The 
bill would allow only the state to sue the gun industry in cases 
involving design, marketing or sale of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, has said he would sign such a bill  
into law.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Look To Finish Off Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Nobody understands better than the Phoenix  
Coyotes how difficult it is to go from where they are to where they 
want to be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes have a 3-1 lead on the St. Louis Blues and could  
close out the first-round series and move into the second round for 
the first time in 12 years with a victory in Game 5 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But their pursuit of the Stanley Cup has ended in the first  
round seven times since 1987, and the Coyotes have been 
tantalizingly close. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the then Winnipeg Jets had a 3-1 lead on Edmonton but  
lost the next three games while the Oilers went on to win the 
championship with a goaltender named Grant Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg was ahead of Vancouver 3-1 in 1992, and the Coyotes had  
a 2-1 lead on Detroit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the other team swept the last three games and took  
momentum into the second round while the Coyotes cleaned out their 
lockers for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't over by any means,'' said Rick Tocchet, who helped  
Pittsburgh win the Cup in 1992. ``It's a long series, and they're 
not going to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning that fourth game is going to be a bear,'' coach Jim  
Schoenfeld said. ``As well as we played, and I'm extremely pleased, 
I think we're going to have to play much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes earned their commanding lead with a 2-1 victory  
Tuesday night, their third straight one-goal victory since the 
Blues beat them 3-1 in the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Displaying the kind of self-sacrifice that Schoenfeld called  
for, Phoenix players blocked 14 shots and blanked St. Louis in four 
power plays, an area in which the Blues were dominant the first 
three contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Adams, back after two games out to rest a groin pull,  
scored the first goal, and Dallas Drake got the winner with 35 
seconds left in the second period, deflecting a shot by Teppo 
Numminen as Fuhr gave up his 11th goal of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third period, Keith Tkachuk frequently braved the hardest  
slap shot in the NHL, flopping crosswise on the ice in front of St. 
Louis' Al MacInnis to keep MacInnis from unleashing his 100 mph 
blasts on Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real frustrating,'' Blues center Terry Yake said. ``We  
were in good position in Game 2 to maybe take a 2-0 lead and come 
home and take control of the series, and here we are in just the 
opposite situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numminen is the only Coyote who played a full season with  
Winnipeg in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Tkachuk, the team captain, played in 17 games that season, and  
believes the past means nothing because of the turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 20 other guys here,'' Tkachuk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Blues defenseman Chris Pronger sees hope for extending the  
series and returning to St. Louis for a sixth game on Sunday -- not 
in the Coyotes' past but in his team's 14-4-1 record in its last 19 
regular-season road games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 20 games or so, we've shown we can win on the  
road,'' Pronger said. ``We've won in there before, and now we've 
got to win two there to win the series. It will be an uphill 
battle. We just have to take the next game and not look too far 
ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Texas, Virginia Execute Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Self-described cold-blooded and  
remorseless killer Aaron Christopher Foust was executed by 
injection Wednesday night for robbing and strangling a hospital 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Virginia, a man who killed two women during a six-day  
spree of hammer beatings was executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Foust, 26, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. He had demanded that  
no appeals be filed on his behalf, clearing the way for the 10th 
execution this year in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adios, amigos,'' Foust said in a brief final statement. ``I'll  
see ya'll on the other side. That's it. I'm ready, ready when ya'll 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former welder and carpenter who dealt drugs on the side, Foust  
was a week away from entering the Army in May 1997 when he killed 
David Ward, 43, at Ward's Fort Worth apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward was about to leave on a month-long vacation to England when  
Foust and an accomplice arrived at his home to collect what Foust 
claimed was a $500 drug debt. When Ward balked, he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the guy,'' Foust said last week. ``Mostly it was  
his attitude. He had a real arrogant, snobbish kind of attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Eric Payne, 26, was executed by injection for  
killing Ruth Parham, 61, and Sally Fazio, 57, in the Richmond area 
in June 1997, six months after he finished serving a six-year 
prison term for possession of LSD. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final statement, Payne said: ``I love you Margie, and we'll  
be together again.'' A corrections spokesman said the reference was 
to Payne's ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> Marfan Patients Urged On Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Surgery to correct a life-threatening heart defect  
in people with Marfan's syndrome is far safer if done before 
symptoms develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Marfan's is an inherited disorder of the connective tissue.  
Those who inherit it are often unusually tall and are likely to 
have weakened aortas that can rupture disastrously, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1970s, the average life expectancy of people with  
the disorder was about 45. But it is now in the 70s, in part 
because of the use of open-heart surgery to repair weakened aortas. 
</P>
<P>
	New research concludes that this repair should be performed as  
soon as the defect is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Vincent L. Gott and others from Johns Hopkins University  
compared the results of routine aorta repair with waiting until the 
condition causes symptoms, when the surgery often must be done as 
an emergency operation. They reviewed the records of 675 patients 
who underwent aorta repair between 1968 and 1996. The study was 
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who got elective surgery, about 2 percent died  
during the month following the operation. However, when the 
operation was considered an emergency, 12 percent died. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200,000 people in the United States have Marfan's  
syndrome. If they are found to have weak spots in the aorta, the 
body's main blood vessel, the defect can be fixed with Dacron 
replacement tubes.

<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Four people on their way to the Bahamas  
were killed on Wednesday when their small plane crashed into a 
neighborhood shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Cessna 210 crashed between three homes near  
Vero Beach Municipal Airport, where the pilot had attempted to 
return after reporting mechanical trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane lost its wings as it hit a tree and a power pole  
before landing in the neighborhood and bursting into flames. No one 
on the ground was injured.

<P>
	``You could hear the people moaning and we tried to help,'' said  
Keith Chisholm. ``But at that point there was nothing we could 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was registered to John Tinthoff, of Peoria, Ill., who  
sheriff's officials said was aboard the aircraft. The identities of 
the three others were not immediately known.

<HEADLINE> Saving Incentive Offered to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To encourage savings, some senators want the  
federal government to pay up to $300 a year to low-income people 
who put money in a bank and take a lesson in Savings 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legislation to be introduced today, individuals could only  
use the tax-free earnings to buy a home, start a business, attend 
school or learn new job skills. The earnings would be financed 
through special tax credits given to banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said the proposal was a chance for  
poorer families to share in the tax cuts under consideration in 
Congress. He said the targeted people generally earn too little to 
pay income taxes and would not otherwise benefit from tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said savings could help people improve their lives.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wealth is through ownership,'' he said at a news conference  
Tuesday. ``That is how most people in America accumulate wealth, 
through ownership and savings. We're providing incentives for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would encourage individuals to set up savings  
accounts with a local bank. The bank would match those savings 
dollar for dollar and then deduct the full amount of the match from 
its federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Before withdrawing the matching funds, individuals must complete  
an economic literacy course that teaches about saving, banking and 
investing. The course would be provided by the bank or community 
organizations, and the government would reimburse some costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some banks and community groups already offer these types of  
matching savings accounts but fund them through private donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would make an estimated $2.5 billion available from  
the government over five years and could be incorporated into a 
broader package of tax cuts, said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. He 
said more than 10 million Americans do not have a bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickie B. Tassan, senior vice president for community  
development banking at the Bank of America, said the proposal would 
help change behavior and introduce more people to banking.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Officials Arrested for Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Two city officials were charged  
Wednesday with accepting at least $4,800 in bribes in exchange for 
lowering the property tax bills of an FBI informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Pannone, chairman of the city Board of Tax Assessment  
Review, and David Ead, the vice chairman, were charged with 
conspiracy and money laundering. The board handles requests for 
reductions in property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said other officials may have participated in the  
scheme. Agents also are investigating whether Providence officials 
accepted bribes from property owners who leased buildings to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents raided City Hall and searched tax, planning and building  
inspection offices Wednesday morning, forcing the tax collector and 
tax assessor's office to close for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The money laundering charges stem from attempts to conceal the  
alleged bribes. Ead allegedly issued bogus invoices from his soda 
distribution business to disguise the bribes as legitimate payments 
for juice and soda. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the men had attorneys who could comment.  
Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. said he would not comment until he 
learned more about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, 21 people in his administration were convicted on  
corruption charges. Cianci was not among them.

<HEADLINE> United Developing Turbulence Sensor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Passengers had settled in for the night on a long  
flight from Tokyo to Honolulu when it felt like a giant fist 
slammed into the United Airlines jumbo jet. A pocket of air 
turbulence hit with such violence in the late 1997 incident that 
one woman suffered a broken neck and died while 100 other 
passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Turbulence often strikes without warning, but now United and two  
technology companies -- AlliedSignal Aerospace and Coherent 
Technologies -- hope to develop a system that could give passengers 
a one-minute warning to fasten their seat belts to avoid being 
tossed around the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence-detection system being sought by the No. 1 U.S.  
airline is at least three years from being implemented and would 
provide no guarantee of an end to stomach-wrenching gyrations. But 
safety officials, airlines and their employees are hoping it will 
go a long way toward reducing the dozens of serious injuries that 
occur annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'd give us a 60-second warning so we could get everybody  
seated and hanging on,'' Bill Cotton, United's manager of air 
traffic and flight systems, said Wednesday as the search for the 
warning system was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's kind of like closing the door after you've let  
the horse out of the barn: turning on the seat belt sign after 
we've run into turbulence,'' said Cotton, a pilot for 32 years who 
flies 747s and 767s. ``The new radar would be far more valuable to 
pilots in knowing exactly when we were going to encounter 
turbulence than anything that's available today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration says that outside of fatal  
accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to 
passengers and flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that United is taking the lead and developing  
technology to predict turbulence,'' said FAA spokeswoman Tammy 
Jones. ``Helping passengers avoid injuries caused by turbulence is 
one of the initiatives under the FAA's safer skies agenda and we 
support anything that would achieve that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots for decades have used airborne radar to steer clear of  
rain and thunderstorms often associated with turbulence, but there 
is no means for detecting bumpy weather that occurs in so-called 
clear-air conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	That has forced pilots to rely on the reports of airplanes that  
have flown the same route ahead of them, which could have 
disastrous consequences since clear-air turbulence often develops 
quickly and is concentrated over small areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Turbulence is created when the fastest winds in the jet stream  
slow down, causing upward air motion. Airflows over mountains and 
the heating of land masses during daytime are other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	While pilots often warn passengers to keep seat belts fastened  
while seated, there are few ways to enforce it. And turbulence 
often can cause loose objects to fly around the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	In January alone, five people were injured when a Tokyo-bound  
United jumbo jet from Chicago hit severe turbulence. Ten days 
later, 22 were hurt when a Continental Airlines flight from Tokyo 
to Honolulu hit severe turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	To combat that, a prototype developed by Coherent Technologies  
Inc. would use a newly developed infrared radar to transmit energy 
beams up to 18 miles ahead of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Those beams would be reflected by the microscopic particles  
suspended in the earth's atmosphere and would provide a picture of 
``wash'' or turbulent air patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	A systems test in March, sponsored by NASA's aviation safety  
program ``demonstrated we could see at significant range and showed 
we can measure strength (of turbulence) and provide time of impact 
predictions to pilots,'' said Paul A. Reveley, Coherent's director 
of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now is working with AlliedSignal Inc. to combine its  
infrared radar with AlliedSignal Aerospace's new radar that is 
capable of better detecting turbulence during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the program still are working out the costs for  
the joint all-weather radar as well as key features, including 
whether warnings would be relayed to the cockpit or immediately 
into the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking to other major carriers to get a feel for their  
reaction because we want to develop a product that meets the needs 
of the industry as a whole,'' Reveley said. 
</P>
<P>
	If additional tests are successful and have a low false-alarm  
rate, the new radars likely would be installed on all of United's 
585 planes, said airline spokesman Joe Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, United was  
up $1.25 at $82.31 1/4 a share and AlliedSignal had an even steeper 
gain, jumping 5.5 percent, or by $3.06 1/4, to $59.06 1/4.

	Investors were back in a trading pattern that began last week.  
They were buying the previously ignored stocks of companies whose 
fortunes are closely tied to the economy, in response to growing 
signs that the global economy is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	That pushed up the shares of industrial stalwarts like Dow  
component Alcoa, which was up 4 5/8 at 60. Another Dow stock, Goodyear 
Tire &AMP; Rubber, was up 1 5/8 at 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiasm for manufacturing stocks was bolstered by this  
morning's Commerce Department report that orders to factories for 
big-ticket durable goods rose 2 percent in March after an 
end-of-winter slump. The increase followed a 3.9 decline in demand 
for durable goods in February, although revised figures released 
today pegged that drop at much lower than the 5.0 percent first 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were generally optimistic about corporate profits for  
the second half of this year. The current crop of earnings reports 
has generally been very positive, including some pleasant surprises 
like IBM's first-quarter results, and analysts said that bodes well 
for the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which has surged higher over the past week, was down 4 1/16  
at 207 15/16 today amid profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology stocks were falling as traders collected  
profits, and analysts reported lingering anxiety about Internet 
stocks that have soared in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities,  
said there was some caution in the market today as investors 
awaited an earnings report from Amazon.com, scheduled to be 
released after the close of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's results were being watched closely as a possible  
harbinger of what's to come for other online companies. The 
company's stock was down 8 3/4 at 197 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of America Online, which surpassed analyst expectations  
in an earnings report issued late Tuesday, were down 4 1/16 at 148 
15/16. Lycos, which runs an internet search engine, was down 2 
11/16 at 98 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were higher as crude prices rose on an unexpected  
decline in domestic supplies. Dow component Exxon was up 2 15/16 at 
81 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 747.72 million 
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Protest Rules set for Orioles-Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE -- Political banners, flags and even musical  
instruments will be banned at Camden Yards. And flights over the 
ballpark might be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball and the Baltimore Orioles are doing all  
they can to limit possible disruptions during Monday's game against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional police will be assigned downtown that day to monitor  
and separate several planned demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ludicrous; it's ridiculous; it's not American,'' said  
Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who has been involved in organizing 
anti-Castro protests to be held in Baltimore during the evening 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're being extreme. I expect this from Castro in Havana. I  
don't expect this from (team owner) Peter Angelos and the 
Orioles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles said strict guidelines for fan conduct will be  
enforced, and fans may be asked to leave, even for chanting, if it 
disturbs other fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have also sold tickets in pairs, making it difficult  
for larger groups to sit together. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman John Maroon said the banner policy is the same  
for every regular-season game -- banners cannot be displayed during 
play and political and commercial messages are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people wishing to make any kind of political statement  
will have every right to do so in a predetermined area outside the 
ballpark,'' Maroon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said he expects up to a thousand anti-Castro protesters  
from the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to board buses for 
Baltimore on Monday. Menendez has been an outspoken critic of the 
Orioles' exhibition games with Cuban teams, saying human rights 
abuses by the Castro regime are being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is another face to these games and that face is very  
brutal,'' Menendez said. He noted that four dissidents who were 
arrested in 1997 for publicly criticizing Communist Party policy 
were sentenced last month to up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups plan demonstrations in favor of ending the  
four-decade U.S. embargo against Cuba, which they say hurts the 
island nation's people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not saying their government does not have  
abuses, but they certainly have the right to govern themselves, and 
our policy is causing harm to their people and is just as 
abusive,'' said Jodie Zisow of the Maryland Coalition to End the 
Embargo of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Zisow said her group has distributed 500 tickets for the game to  
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball spokesman Rich Levin said the  
commissioner's office has asked federal authorities to restrict 
airspace over Camden Yards to prevent aerial protests. However, 
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said no 
such request has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-American pilot Jose Basulto of Miami tried to drop  
leaflets during the March 28 game in Havana. In that game, the 
first time in 40 years major leaguers played in Cuba, the Orioles 
beat a Cuban all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto, a veteran of the U.S. sponsored invasion of Cuba in  
1961, said federal aviation officials conducted a surprise 
inspection that day, which he described as a thinly veiled delaying 
tactic by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials have said the inspection was not out of the  
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto took off toward Havana but aborted the mission because  
of a wind change. He did not enter Cuban airspace because pilots 
with his group have been shot down and killed in the past while 
attempting similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not discounting any options,'' Basulto said of the  
Baltimore game, refusing to tip his hand as to whether he planned a 
similar protest May 3.

<HEADLINE> Etbauer Squeezed Out of Ky. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A judge in Arkansas and a filly from  
California put Etbauer on the sideline for Saturday's Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, a judge said Valhol should be awarded the  
$300,000 for winning the Arkansas Derby on April 10. Then, trainer 
Bob Baffert decided Wednesday to enter the filly Excellent Meeting 
in Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	That combination left Etbauer No. 21 on the graded stakes  
earning list of Derby hopefuls. Only the top 20 are entered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crummy feeling,'' Etbauer trainer Steve Wren said  
Wednesday. He and owner Hays Biggs hung around Churchill Downs 
during the morning, waiting for Baffert to make a decision about 
Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly and General Challenge are owned by the Golden Eagle  
Farm of John and Betty Mabee and Mabee said entering Excellent 
Meeting was an insurance policy of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer has $75,000 in graded earnings, but Valhol had only  
$38,400 prior to the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Racing Commission ordered Oaklawn Park to put the  
first-place check on hold during an investigation that began after 
Oaklawn officials said they had evidence that Valhol jockey Billy 
Patin might have carried an illegal electrical device. Patin says 
he is innocent and a hearing in the case is May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said Wednesday he considered challenging the judge's  
ruling, but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby, to me, is the epitome of horse racing,''  
he said. ``I was just not going to tarnish it. Horse racing has 
been tarnished enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to sound like a guy bellyaching about spilled  
beans but that should have never happened,'' Biggs said. ``I feel 
bad that my horse and my trainer are penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week, when they have the hearing and all this is going to  
come out, it will not be easy to swallow,'' Biggs said. ``I've been 
in athletics all my life. The coach says always play by the rules. 
I've always raised my family that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people in this game don't play that way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer ran second in his two races last year and started 1999  
with a 6 1/2-length victory in a maiden race. He won an allowance race 
at Oaklawn Park by a length and then captured the Grade III Rebel 
by almost a length on March 20. He finished sixth in the Arkansas 
Derby and jockey Calvin Borel said the son of Silver Deputy didn't 
like the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer will probably make his next start in the May 8 Illinois  
Derby 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said he was surprised that Baffert entered Excellent  
Meeting, but realized it was the trainer's prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs drove to Louisville because he planned to bring in his six  
children for the race and knew he would need extra vehicles to 
transport everybody. He plans to head home Thursday and said he 
would not watch the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got very close to getting in,'' he said. ``It would be very  
difficult for me.''

<HEADLINE> Northeast, South Seek Milk Compacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regional dairy compacts that set prices for  
milk are stirring a new political war in Congress, with lawmakers 
from the Northeast and South uniting against the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Establishing permanent dairy cartels is a poor legislative fix  
and bad precedent to deal with low milk prices,'' Sen. Russ 
Feingold, D-Wis., said Tuesday. Added Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, 
``Renewing and expanding these price-fixing regimes would be a 
devastating step backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are regional dairy compacts in which states band  
together and set what they consider a ``fair price'' for fluid 
milk. A commission funded with dairy producer contributions 
controls the operations and establishes a price higher than the 
federal government's price for the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress established the Northeast Dairy Compact as part of the  
1996 farm law, covering Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. But it's due to expire Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That compact's authorization is due to expire Oct. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Legislation introduced Tuesday would make the Northeast compact  
permanent and add Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland and Ohio to it. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would also establish a Southern Dairy Compact to include  
Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia. 
Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas also could 
join it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has 39 cosponsors in the Senate and more than 150 in  
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the compacts shield already-struggling dairy  
farmers from fluctuating prices. Just last February, the government 
said the price producers received for milk would fall $6 to $10.27 
per hundred pounds of milk, the sharpest decline from one month to 
another in the industry's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to stand by and do nothing is totally irresponsible,''  
said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. ``This is a life and death issue for 
our family farms,'' added Rep. John E. Sweeney, R-NY. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argue that compacts serve the interests of a few,  
harming consumers and scores other producers. Lawmakers from the 
Midwest fear an overproduction in milk in compact areas would 
depress prices for Midwestern producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compact fever is being fueled by narrow, geographic  
self-interest,'' said Connie Tipton, senior vice president of the 
International Dairy Foods Association, which represents milk 
processors. 
</P>
<P>
	IDFA argues that higher prices for producers means higher prices  
when consumers go to buy a gallon of milk.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Near Labor Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although its union claims the sides are close to  
reaching the WNBA's first ever collective bargaining agreement, the 
league says there are unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of negotiations, a union spokesman said the only  
issue separating the sides involves player appearances at charity 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	But WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said, ``There are a number of  
unresolved issues and we do not have a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No formal talks were held Wednesday while the sides considered  
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue we shouldn't even be talking about,'' said  
Pam Wheeler, executive director of the union. ``Our position is 
that part of the draw and success of the WNBA has been the women 
participating and helping charitable events. The limit would 
prevent them from supporting these efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-week WNBA season is scheduled to begin June 10. The labor  
dispute forced the postponement of the player draft, scheduled last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Players are now required to make 22 appearances, eight of them  
commercial sponsor spots for which they are paid, four unpaid team 
appearances and up to 10 unpaid promotional appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the player association's right to do additional  
not-for-profit events using its logo. The WNBA owns marketing and 
licensing rights to the union logo. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is not allowed to use its logo for commercial purposes  
with the men or women, but is permitted to use it for up to eight 
not-for-profit events for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the sides had reached and then abandoned a four-year  
agreement when eacj claimed the other injected new terms at the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and league had agreed on a four-year deal that would  
increase minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000 for veterans and 
$25,000 for rookies. Those figures would increase to $40,000 and 
$30,000, respectively, by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits package was to include year-round health and dental  
benefits, pension, maternity benefits and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	That tentative agreement included a reopener option for the  
league or the union after three years, with both sides agreeing to 
no-lockout, no-strike clauses. That agreement called for 5 percent 
increases a year for draft picks. Players from the folded ABL would 
be treated as rookies for salary purposes this year but not subject 
to option clauses that teams hold on other rookies for their second 
seasons. Veterans would no longer be subject to such options.
