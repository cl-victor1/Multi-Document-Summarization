<HEADLINE> Sudanese IOC Member Got $24K Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
delegate from Sudan ousted in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, 
admitted today that he received $24,000, but insisted it was a 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir told The Associated Press  
that he had accepted the money as a loan to help cover the cost of 
his son's studies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City had proposed paying $1,000 to cover my son's  
monthly study expenses, and we agreed that the money is considered 
a loan and will be repaid on graduation,'' Abdel-Gadir. ``That was 
my condition and that was how it went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had told the IOC about the loan when he answered a  
questionnaire sent by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have explained this to the committee,'' Abdel-Gadir said.  
``But this is an exceptional circumstance and, in such cases, we 
know the reaction would not be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdel-Gadir was ousted Sunday along with five other members in  
an unprecedented housecleaning stemming from the biggest corruption 
scandal in Olympic history. Another delegate also resigned Sunday.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela and the United States signed  
a treaty Monday to eliminate double taxation of corporations and 
individuals in the two countries, a move expected to boost 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, companies from one nation operating in the  
other's territory will pay sharply lower taxes. Artists, athletes, 
students and retirees will also be exempt from double taxation. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which took nearly eight years to negotiate, will  
take effect Jan. 1, 2000, if each country's Congress approves it. 
Venezuela is the first country in South America to sign such a 
treaty with the United States. Mexico and Trinidad have also done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador John Maisto called the treaty ``a stimulation  
for investment in both directions'' and said the U.S. Congress is 
expected to approve it this year. 
</P>

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela and France agreed Monday to  
allow their citizens to travel between the two countries without a 
visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens will need only a valid passport to enter the countries  
and will be permitted to stay for up to three months. After that, 
they must wait six months before returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela has similar agreements with Mexico, Italy and Spain.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The bishop of an evangelical church in  
Venezuela's capital was among seven people being held Monday in the 
killing of a motorist on Christmas Eve two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Ramon Perez, bishop of the Rebirth Church, his son,  
another church pastor and four other people were arrested Sunday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members of the arrested group allegedly tried to steal a  
car from a liquor industry worker in the upscale Las Mercedes 
neighborhood on Dec. 24, 1996. When the worker resisted, they 
allegedly shot him and dumped the body in another part of the city, 
said Jose Ramon Lazo Ricardi, head of the Judicial Technical 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardi said Perez apparently was at the scene of the killing  
but was not necessarily the one who pulled the trigger.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A bishop from the southern state of Chiapas  
on Monday applauded Pope John Paul II's condemnation of free-market 
economic policies that marginalize the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing remarks by the pope during his five-day visit to Mexico,  
Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia said a growing gap between rich and poor 
poses a danger ``to the survival of humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragic way of thinking, in which a person's worth is  
determined by the market, rather than putting a person's value 
above economic considerations, is extremely brutal, and that is 
what we have to fight,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz leads the Chiapas diocese of San Cristobal de Las Casas and  
is best known for his role as mediator between the Mexican 
government and Chiapas' leftist Zapatista rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	He has acknowledged sympathy for the goals of the rebellion but  
disavows the use of violence.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Thousands of Indians protested in  
the capital of Honduras on Monday, demanding that the government 
improve their living conditions and investigate the killings of 
several dozen of their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be here until the government meets its promises to our  
people,'' a spokesman for the protesters, Jose Gomez, said at a 
news conference at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Tegucigalpa. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 Indians participated in this, the eighth protest in  
Tegucigalpa by the Civic Committee of Popular and Indigenous 
Organizations since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian groups accuse the government of failing to abide by  
agreements to give them more than 25,000 acres of land and to look 
into the slayings of 42 Indian leaders.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Head Rejects Call To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch went on the attack Monday, angrily firing back at his 
critics, praising his record and dismissing renewed calls for his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased with myself, what I have done these 18 years,''  
Samaranch said. ``Today, the International Olympic Committee is 
very important in our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after expelling six members in the biggest corruption  
scandal in Olympic history, Samaranch took the offensive, giving a 
series of interviews to show he is still in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his lifestyle, often described as a series of  
first-class travel and posh hotel suites, was much simpler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' he said. ``I am a normal man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers around the world continued to criticize the IOC and  
called on Samaranch to step down in the wake of the bribery scandal 
that has engulfed the Salt Lake City Winter Games of 2002. ``It is 
brazen of Samaranch to stay put. It means that a nasty odor still 
clings to the IOC,'' said a front-page editorial in the Dutch 
newspaper, Trouw. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 78-year-old Spaniard remained defiant and said the IOC  
needs him more than ever because the organization is going through 
the worst crisis in its 105-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' he said. ``In  
these moments, the Olympic movement is in real danger. ... I have 
been elected by the members of the IOC, not by outside people. Not 
a single (resignation) call is coming from an IOC member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took direct aim at Robert Helmick, a former IOC vice  
president and head of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Helmick, who 
resigned from both organizations in 1991 following 
conflict-of-interest allegations, has led a vocal campaign for 
Samaranch's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual public attack on another person, a visibly angry  
Samaranch said Helmick has no business calling for his resignation. 
He said Helmick left the IOC because he would have been expelled 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these propositions are coming from Helmick, for me, they  
have not any kind of value,'' Samaranch said. ``He was a man who 
had to resign because he was facing expulsion from the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Des Moines, Iowa, Helmick said Samaranch's actions Sunday  
were ``a good first step'' but far from enough to solve the 
problems facing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``For his own sake, I hope he will carefully consider all  
actions possible for the IOC to cleanse itself of this mess, and 
how new leadership might help,'' Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch announced Sunday he would put his leadership to a vote  
of confidence at a special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he 
fails to get the members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch 
said. At the moment, the chances of his losing the vote are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in 1980, Samaranch intends to retire when he completes  
his final term in 2001, when he will be 81. He ruled out being 
drafted for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch confirmed that the six IOC members who were  
``temporarily excluded'' Sunday had effectively been expelled. If 
they fight their ouster, he said, they will need to seek 
reinstatement at the March session, a reversal ``I cannot 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposition to expel the members is very clear,'' he said.  
``All the documents will be in the hands of the members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was referring to the IOC investigative report showing  
that 14 members received cash payments, scholarships, medical 
services and other favors stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members have resigned in the case. In addition to the six  
expelled, one received a warning and three others -- including 
powerful executive board member Kim Un-Yong of South Korea -- remain 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the enormity of the scandal, Samaranch cited the huge  
media coverage of Sunday's news conference as proof of the IOC's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means the Olympic movement and IOC is very much  
important, even much more important than I thought in our society 
of today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch defended himself against charges that he is a symbol  
of excesses associated with the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' he said. ``I am a normal man. My style  
of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I have 
no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like big dinners, big lunches. I am doing my best to  
try to be fit with physical exercises every morning. That's my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who lives much of the year in Lausanne, said he keeps  
a ``very small suite'' at the Palace Hotel, costing $220 a night 
when he stays there and $73 a night when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who does not receive a salary as IOC president, said  
his successor should be paid and live in Lausanne as a full-time 
executive president. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch deflected criticism of his leadership style, saying,  
``The IOC is not run by myself. The IOC is run mainly by the 
executive board of the IOC. ... I am not the boss. I am the 
president following the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the IOC should be run more like a business, he  
said, ``I think the IOC is run very well. The results are 
excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Samaranch, the Olympics have moved from near-bankruptcy to  
billion-dollar success. IOC director general Francois Carrard 
acknowledged that the Olympic bidding process became rife for 
abuses once the games became a big-money attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flaws have begun because you meet people who are eager to  
do anything, to seduce, to influence people,'' he said. ``At first, 
it's not all necessarily by corruption. But you want to convince, 
you want to be kind, you want to be nice, you want to influence, 
you want to seduce. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when the temptations begin. When you have money  
involved, the stakes are very high. Some members were not all able 
to resist as they should have and they did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano's mayor acknowledged ``excesses'' in his city's winning  
bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics and said IOC officials received 
free trips to the ancient capital of Kyoto. Mayor Tasuku Tsukada 
denied wrongdoing by Nagano bidders and couldn't recall any demands 
for cash or valuable goods by IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gen. Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir of Sudan, one of the IOC  
members expelled, said $1,000-a-month payments from Salt Lake 
bidders to his son were education-aid loans that he intended to 
repay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have explained this to the committee (IOC),'' Gadir told  
The Associated Press in Khartoum. ``But this is an exceptional 
circumstance and, in such cases, we know the reaction would not be 
normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Another implicated member, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands,  
said official warning for his financial conduct was ``absolutely 
unjustified'' and blamed Dutch Olympic officials for his plight. 
Geesink was cautioned because of a $5,000 payment made by the SLOC 
to the Friends of Anton Geesink Foundation, a nonprofit group that 
funds his work promoting Olympic ideals and his IOC efforts.

<HEADLINE> Norton Works in Your PC's Sewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Utilities programs do the everyday chores around your computer --  
sweeping, taking out the trash, making sure the electronic doors 
are locked. 
</P>
<P>
	That means checking for viruses, deleting useless files, and  
making information stored on the hard disk readily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 95 and 98 come with disk scanning and defragmenting  
utilities, and there are individual programs available to 
accomplish other chores. But if you want a one-stop problem-solver, 
check out Norton SystemWorks from Symantec. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton Utilities has been around for years, filling the  
user-friendliness gaps that Microsoft left in DOS, and later in 
Windows. This latest incarnation is a suite of programs that make 
life with a PC decidedly easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The package includes Norton Anti-Virus 5.0, Norton Utilities  
3.0, Norton Crashguard 4.0 and Norton Cleansweep 4.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer viruses are self-replicating programs that cause  
mischief and even physical damage. They travel on the Internet and 
on shared disks. Although often hyped, especially by companies that 
offer solutions, they are real; and if you spend a lot of time 
downloading Internet files, you should have protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton Utilities includes several handy tools. There's an  
unerase function, a disk optimizer, a utility for cleaning up disk 
space, a crash-recovery and prevention module, and ``doctors'' for 
both Windows and the hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
	Crashguard offers a parachute when Windows practices its  
annoying habit of shutting down programs it deems to be operating 
illegally and losing your work in the process. With Crashguard 
running, you can terminate the application and save your work. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors diagnose and fix problems, keeping you informed in  
the process. Because Windows is so complex internally, installing 
and uninstalling plenty of software can cause a mess. A doctor 
usually can rescue you on its own; when it can't, it refers you to 
one that can. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleansweep utility tackles your hard drive and helps you  
remove unwanted cookies, plug-ins and outdated files. It also keeps 
track of everything that's installed to the drive so that it can be 
uninstalled properly and completely -- something Windows' add/remove 
programs and individual software installations sometimes don't do. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nicest features of the package for novices is a  
dictionary available in the Help file. It translates any 
highlighted term from Technobabble into English. If you can't 
distinguish UART from a Yugo, it'll be a friend indeed. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes Norton Web Services, a site for  
software patches and product updates aimed at the business user. 
Patches are software fixes that update an original product shipped 
with a shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements for Norton SystemWorks are modest: 486/66 or  
higher processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, at least 105 megabytes of 
free hard disk space and Windows 95/98. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton products are widely available at retail. The suggested  
price for SystemWorks is $69.95. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comforts Tornado Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEEBE, Ark. (AP) -- The impeachment trial seemed worlds away as  
President Clinton walked the streets of Little Rock, comforting 
tornado victims and viewing the damage along the same route he used 
to jog when he was Arkansas' governor. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got to the small town of Beebe on Sunday, the  
scandal caught up to him. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching Clinton from the back of a small crowd at the wrecked  
shell of the junior high school was none other than Paula Jones, 
whose sexual harassment suit against Clinton set in motion the 
events leading to his impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come to see him,'' said Jones, an Arkansan who now  
lives in California. She said that she had been staying with 
friends in the area when the tornadoes tore through it on Thursday. 
``I came to see what they're going to do about the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared unaware that she was in the crowd, and he  
ignored reporters who sought some reaction from him to the twist. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Clinton seemed to draw as much emotionally from  
the storm victims as he gave. He clasped old friends in long hugs 
and reached into trucks to shake hands with National Guardsmen who 
had been called to duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for him, and it's good for them,'' said  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, also an Arkansan. ``You 
know who your friends are when you're standing with them in 
difficult times, and they're standing with you in difficult 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Harvest Foods, where the Clintons used to buy groceries,  
the roof was ripped off and the brick storefront was in pieces. 
Shrink-wrapped boxes sat on their pallets in the middle of what had 
been orderly aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke in the open air, just in front of the check-out aisles,  
exhorting the residents from nearby neighborhoods to ``fix the 
roofs, replace the trees and keep the spirit of the place alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Arkansas counties and one county in Tennessee were declared  
disaster areas after Thursday's storms, which killed seven people 
and injured 55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that everyone who possibly can will rebuild,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving in Beebe, where winds up to 200 mph tore through Center  
Street, Clinton met with a family he has known since his first race 
for governor. The meeting was on the foundation of what had been 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	A few stools, a bed frame and a bathtub remained, as did a  
couple of photographs Clinton had signed to them. In the back 
ground, metal from the roof of the junior high several hundred 
yards away was draped through the withered branches of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just destruction,'' said Sherry Wooten, a neighbor whose  
red house had lost its windows and back porch. ``There's nothing 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was waiting just a short drive away, dressed in a white  
jacket, red shirt and blue jeans, and hanging back in the crowd 
with two children. She recently received an $850,000 payment from 
Clinton to settle her suit, which had been dismissed by a federal 
judge but was being considered for reinstatement by an appeals 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much Mrs. Jones will be able to keep after  
paying the multiple lawyers who handled her case.

<HEADLINE> Phil Simms' Son Will Attend Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Chris Simms, son of former New York Giants  
quarterback Phil Simms, had a change of heart and will play 
football at Texas instead of national champion Tennessee, his coach 
said Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise switch came more than a month after a mid-December  
announcement that Simms would join the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Penn State were the other finalists in the recruiting  
battle for the left-handed quarterback considered among the top 
prep players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has had some time over the last few weeks to reflect and  
think about it before he made it final, and he weighed it out in 
his mind and he just felt Texas was a better fit for him,'' said 
Mike Miello, Simms' coach at Ramapo (N.J.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Simms was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Simms' choice will not become official until he signs a national  
letter of intent on Feb. 3, the first day high school players are 
permitted to sign with a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised with the first decision and then he changed  
his mind, but I am happy for him because he looks at peace with his 
decision,'' Miello said. ``There's no apprehension with it at all. 
He really feels good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simms also seemed happy making his initial choice of Tennessee  
on a local cable TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be a Vol and it's a good place for me,'' Simms  
said at the time. ``I'm a big fan of coach Fulmer and I think it 
fits me right. I feel so relieved and finally I can get back to 
being a high schooler and enjoying myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee won the national championship a few weeks later,  
beating Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Tee Martin returns at quarterback for Tennessee, but Simms may  
have wavered when A.J. Suggs, another top quarterback prospect from 
Georgia, also verbally committed to the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, meanwhile, has Major Applewhite returning for the next  
few seasons, but Simms could move up quickly in since the Longhorns 
lack depth at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 218-pounder, Simms threw for 7,055 yards and 63  
touchdowns during his high school career. He threw for 18 
touchdowns with only four interceptions in his senior season.

president and head of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Helmick, who 
resigned from both organizations in 1991 following 
conflict-of-interest allegations, has led a vocal campaign for 
Samaranch's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual public attack on another person, a visibly angry  
Samaranch said Helmick has no business calling for his resignation. 
He said Helmick left the IOC because he would have been expelled 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these propositions are coming from Helmick, for me, they  
have not any kind of value,'' Samaranch said. ``He was a man who 
had to resign because he was facing expulsion from the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Des Moines, Iowa, Helmick said Samaranch's actions Sunday  
were ``a good first step'' but far from enough to solve the 
problems facing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``For his own sake, I hope he will carefully consider all  
actions possible for the IOC to cleanse itself of this mess, and 
how new leadership might help,'' Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch announced Sunday he would put his leadership to a vote  
of confidence at a special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he 
fails to get the members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch 
said. At the moment, the chances of his losing the vote are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in 1980, Samaranch intends to retire when he completes  
his final term in 2001, when he will be 81. He ruled out being 
drafted for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch confirmed that the six IOC members who were  
``temporarily excluded'' Sunday had effectively been expelled. If 
they fight their ouster, he said, they will need to seek 
reinstatement at the March session, a reversal ``I cannot 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposition to expel the members is very clear,'' he said.  
``All the documents will be in the hands of the members of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was referring to the IOC investigative report showing  
that 14 members received cash payments, scholarships, medical 
services and other favors stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members have resigned in the case. In addition to the six  
expelled, one received a warning and three others -- including 
powerful executive board member Kim Un-Yong of South Korea -- remain 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the enormity of the scandal, Samaranch cited the huge  
media coverage of Sunday's news conference as proof of the IOC's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means the Olympic movement and IOC is very much  
important, even much more important than I thought in our society 
of today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch defended himself against charges that he is a symbol  
of excesses associated with the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' he said. ``I am a normal man. My style  
of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I have 
no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like big dinners, big lunches. I am doing my best to  
try to be fit with physical exercises every morning. That's my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who lives much of the year in Lausanne, said he keeps  
a ``very small suite'' at the Palace Hotel, costing $220 a night 
when he stays there and $73 a night when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who does not receive a salary as IOC president, said  
his successor should be paid and live in Lausanne as a full-time 
executive president. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch deflected criticism of his leadership style, saying,  
``The IOC is not run by myself. The IOC is run mainly by the 
executive board of the IOC. ... I am not the boss. I am the 
president following the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the IOC should be run more like a business, he  
said, ``I think the IOC is run very well. The results are 
excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Samaranch, the Olympics have moved from near-bankruptcy to  
billion-dollar success. IOC director general Francois Carrard 
acknowledged that the Olympic bidding process became rife for 
abuses once the games became a big-money attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flaws have begun because you meet people who are eager to  
do anything, to seduce, to influence people,'' he said. ``At first, 
it's not all necessarily by corruption. But you want to convince, 
you want to be kind, you want to be nice, you want to influence, 
you want to seduce. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when the temptations begin. When you have money  
involved, the stakes are very high. Some members were not all able 
to resist as they should have and they did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano's mayor acknowledged ``excesses'' in his city's winning  
bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics and said IOC officials received 
free trips to the ancient capital of Kyoto. Mayor Tasuku Tsukada 
denied wrongdoing by Nagano bidders and couldn't recall any demands 
for cash or valuable goods by IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gen. Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir of Sudan, one of the IOC  
members expelled, said $1,000-a-month payments from Salt Lake 
bidders to his son were education-aid loans that he intended to 
repay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have explained this to the committee (IOC),'' Gadir told  
The Associated Press in Khartoum. ``But this is an exceptional 
circumstance and, in such cases, we know the reaction would not be 
normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Another implicated member, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands,  
said official warning for his financial conduct was ``absolutely 
unjustified'' and blamed Dutch Olympic officials for his plight. 
Geesink was cautioned because of a $5,000 payment made by the SLOC 
to the Friends of Anton Geesink Foundation, a nonprofit group that 
funds his work promoting Olympic ideals and his IOC efforts.

<HEADLINE>  ABL Players Give Last Salute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- A month after their league folded, the  
sense of loss lingers. Seeking closure, 15 members of the defunct 
ABL gathered on the basketball court to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day they were supposed to hold their league's all-star  
game at the San Jose Arena, the former ABL players met in a 
community college gym Sunday to give their final salute to the 
women's pro basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Azzi, who starred for the San Jose Lasers and helped  
round up players for Sunday's hoopSalute game, said the healing 
process continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you still face it. It's one thing to lose your own  
job, but that's nothing compared to this because it affects so many 
people,'' Azzi said. ``I find it hard to explain to young girls 
that come to my basketball camp. I think that's where the real loss 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players ran through the crowd for high-fives and tossed sneakers  
to fans during introductions. There were more hugs than handshakes 
on the bench. And one of the all-stars sang the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for me it's really a good feeling to be able to say  
goodbye to the fans,'' said Kate Starbird, who played for the 
Seattle Reign. ``After a month I've been through the shock phase 
and the grieving phase. I'm trying not to be sad about things, but 
to celebrate the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL folded suddenly three days before Christmas amid unpaid  
bills and an inability to withstand the challenge of the rival 
WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had known that was going to be our last game (in  
mid-December), we would have smiled more or reached out to the 
fans,'' Azzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what they did Sunday in a game that doubled as a  
memorial to the ABL. Among the bonuses for fans was hearing Naomi 
Mulitauaopele of the Reign do an unaccompanied version of the Star 
Spangled Banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans paying up to $1,500 per ticket packed the 1,600-seat  
bleachers at tiny De Anza College. Many wore Lasers shirts or other 
ABL gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to raise at least $10,000 for charities,  
including the De Anza women's team and a shelter for victims of 
domestic violence. Expenses included $5,000 per player. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was organized in 17 days by volunteers, mostly via  
e-mail. The effort was led by Gay Katilius, who quit her job as a 
sales manager for a small software firm to set up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a sense of closure,'' said Katilius, whose only  
previous exposure to the ABL was as an avid Lasers fan. ``Women are 
victims all the time. Things happen to us that we have no control 
over. I just wanted to write a happier ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment of silence was held before the game to honor ABL player  
Katrina Price, who died of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun 
blast to her head last week. Price's death intensified some of the 
sense of loss the players already had been feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sad thing is that if the ABL didn't go out,  
Katrina would have been in a hotel room preparing for a game,'' 
Starbird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Edwards, who played with Price on the Philadelphia Rage,  
said Sunday's game was a chance for players and fans to honor 
Price's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for those people to reach back out to  
her family,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer was an assistant coach for  
one of the all-star teams. She and many Lasers fans bemoan the loss 
of a team and a league that they thought represented a big step 
forward for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the league disbanded, local officials tried to hold  
the all-star game at the San Jose Arena. But that fell through, 
leaving volunteers to organize Sunday's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, we were all devastated by the ABL's folding and then by  
the cancellation of the all-star game,'' said Kristin Noel, a 
Lasers fan who bought two of the eight $1,500 tickets that were 
sold. ``Out of the ashes, a phoenix arose.''

	Senate Hears Dismissal Motion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Byrd has introduced a motion to  
dismiss impeachment charges against President Clinton and House 
managers and the president's lawyers will spend the next couple of 
hours arguing the issue. Opening the arguments against dismissal, 
Republican Congressman Charles Canady said dismissal would be

	U.S. Says Iraq Provoked Strike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American officials said today a U.S. attack on  
an air defense installation in southern Iraq was in response to 
Iraqi provocations, but Iraq claimed missiles hit heavily populated 
areas, killing several civilians. A Pentagon spokesman could not 
deny the claims, saying the United States is still assessing 
damage. One Defense Department official said there was no initial 
indication that the U.S. planes hit anything other than their 
intended military targets. U.S. planes fired on Iraqi air defense 
sites in both northern and southern Iraq. In at least one case in 
the north, Iraq fired a surface-to-air missile at a U.S. plane but 
missed.

it will offer free software to allow customers to easily turn off 
the feature permanently on its upcoming line of Pentium III 
computer chips, to be sold within months. Intel also said it will 
turn off the feature by default for Pentium III chips that haven't 
already been produced. Intel, the world's largest chip-maker with 
$26.2 billion in sales last year, announced last week that its new 
chip will by default transmit its unique serial number internally

 *Monday, Jan. 25, 1999    	

</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A U.S.-British missile attack today hit a  
crowded area in the southern city of Basra, killing and wounding 
civilians, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. The agency said 
a missile hit the al-Jumhuriya section of the city at 9:30 a.m. 
local time. The agency said several houses were destroyed. U.S. 
warplanes patrolling the southern no-fly zone in Iraq have been 
firing missiles regularly at Iraqi air defense positions in 
response to being locked onto by radar from the military positions. 
A Pentagon spokesman said today that ``there were airstrikes in the 
south, in the vicinity of Basra, as a result of provocation.'' He 
gave no other details.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- The mayor of Moscow, a potential successor to

Madeleine Albright today on several issues that have soured 
U.S.-Russian relations. Warning he intended to be blunt, Mayor Yuri 
Luzhkov challenged Albright on U.S. policy on Iraq, Kosovo, missile 
defenses and technology sales by Russian firms to Iran. Luzkhov's 
main complaint was that ``the United States had moved forward 
without taking Russia's concerns completely into account,'' a 
senior U.S. official told reporters after the meeting in Moscow's 
municipal offices. Albright stood her ground, telling the mayor 
U.S. bombing of Iraq and pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic over Kosovo were correct.

<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced  
a leadership challenge from his former political mentor today, a 
day after being branded untrustworthy by his outgoing defense 
minister. Netanyahu's character and divisive style, rather than his 
hard-line policies, have increasingly been cited by former allies 
who are trying to topple him. However, in today's primaries, 
Netanyahu appeared in no danger of losing leadership of the Likud 
Party to his former political mentor, Moshe Arens. Arens, a 
73-year-old former defense and foreign minister, returned from 
political retirement earlier this month to challenge Netanyahu.

yesterday that the 67 votes needed to remove him from office are 
not there. They also said they are seeking a way for graceful exit 
from the yearlong scandal. A vote this week to allow witnesses, if 
it fails, could set the stage for a final vote on conviction or 
acquittal. But House prosecutors pressed ahead yesterday with 
preparations to subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview 
with Ms. Lewinsky that Senate Democrats denounced as an act of

sporting event after its biggest ethics scandal ever. IOC President 
Juan Antonio Samaranch said he hopes the housecleaning and the

took no personal responsibility for the improper behavior of IOC 
members accused of soliciting cash payments and other favors in 
exchange for selecting Salt Lake City as the site for 2002 Winter 
Games. But he apologized and pledged to root out misconduct once

Lindros as the starting center, had a goal and two assists. His 
goal extended his All-Star record to 13 in 18 games and his two 
assists gave him 12, tying him with four other players for the 
career mark.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Have No Bananas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union failed  
Monday to agree on a compromise aimed at defusing a dispute over 
bananas before it escalates into a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have a deal,'' said EU Ambassador Roderick Abbott as  
he emerged from a 1 1/2-hour afternoon negotiating session with his 
U.S. counterpart, Rita Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	The two ambassadors then rejoined a meeting of the 133-member  
World Trade Organization that was to take up the U.S. request for 
approval of $520 million in sanctions on EU imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But two Caribbean nations that side with the EU, Dominica and  
St. Lucia, used a procedural maneuver to reject the agenda, thus 
postponing a vote on the sanctions. The meeting will reconvene 
Tuesday morning in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
said the EU was behind the delaying maneuver to reject the WTO 
agenda. She said the United States would continue to push its case 
for sanctions on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely dismayed that the EU would jeopardize the  
operation of the WTO in this way,'' Barshesfsky said in a 
statement. ``Fortunately, we will have another opportunity tomorrow 
to see if the EU will reconsider this drastic step and permit the 
WTO meeting to proceed. I certainly hope it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade Minister Brian Wilson, in Los Angeles for a  
Foreign Trade Association meeting, urged the parties to avoid 
escalating the banana dispute into something more. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sanctions ``would have a very heavy economic and  
human impact in the U.K. and elsewhere in the European Union, 
particularly on companies exporting to the U.S. whose products are 
completely unrelated to this dispute,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Latin American countries claim the EU's  
trade policy on bananas violates global trading rules because it 
favors producers in former European colonies. The EU rejects the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott and Hayes were discussing a compromise offered by World  
Trade Organization Director-General Renato Ruggiero, which called 
for a panel looking at the new EU banana import system to also 
consider whether the proposed U.S. sanctions are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	George Williams, trade ambassador for Dominica, said the  
blocking of the agenda represented small countries standing up 
against big ones. It was the only way to stop sanctions being 
approved before it was proved the EU was in the wrong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, spokesman for EU trade commissioner Sir Leon  
Brittan, told reporters in Brussels, ``We have absolutely no desire 
for a clash with the United States or an escalation of this 
dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out the possibility that the EU would retaliate by  
imposing its own sanctions, saying Europe would seek a solution 
through the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it is ready to sit down with the EU  
at any time to discuss the matter, but the EU says it will not 
negotiate while the threat of sanctions hangs over its head.

<HEADLINE> AMA Criticized for Firing Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former editor of the Journal of the American  
Medical Association, fired over a sex survey published to coincide 
with President Clinton's impeachment trial, has won support from 
editors at other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	In a weekend editorial posted on the Internet, the editor of the  
prestigious British medical journal The Lancet said AMA Executive 
Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson ``brutally treated an internationally respected editor  
and brought the AMA to what most observers thought was impossible: 
a new and sinking low in its history,'' wrote The Lancet's editor, 
Dr. Richard Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former editors of at least seven other medical  
journals have also denounced the AMA for firing Dr. George Lundberg 
on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson criticized Lundberg for publishing a survey in JAMA  
that showed 59 percent of college students questioned did not 
consider oral-genital contact to be sex. Anderson felt the survey 
inappropriately interjected JAMA into the debate surrounding the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA Chairman Randolph Smoak called Horton's demand for  
Anderson's resignation ``very irresponsible'' and said the AMA 
stood by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not know the details that led to this decision,''  
Smoak said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Lundberg, who was editor of JAMA for 17 years,  
said he was ``enormously gratified by the outpouring of support.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Census Can't Use Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the 2000  
census cannot use statistical sampling to enhance its accuracy, a 
decision making it more likely millions of people will be left out. 
The 5-4 ruling requires the traditional nose count to determine how 
many members of Congress each state should have. 
</P>
<P>
	Left in doubt, however, was whether the sampling the Clinton  
administration favors will be used to determine state-by-state 
eligibility for $180 billion in federal money each year of the 
coming decade -- or for drawing election districts at all levels of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	That may depend on whether the Republican-led Congress provides  
enough financing for the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court ruled that a 1976 federal census law  
``directly prohibits the use of sampling in the determination of 
population for the purposes of apportionment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the setback for the  
Clinton administration a ``limited decision'' and noted that the 
justices did not say sampling is unconstitutional. That means 
Congress could decide to amend the 1976 law and support the method. 
</P>
<P>
	But such action by Congress seems remote since Republicans  
oppose statistical sampling. The Republican majority in Congress 
also is expected to resist efforts to let the Census employ two 
differing methods in counting the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration should abandon its illegal and risky  
polling scheme and start preparing for a true head count,'' said 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said, ``The  
new arena in this battle is the House of Representatives, and there 
are two certainties: The Republicans will try to block a fair 
count, and Democrats will fight them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampling probably would help Democrats because minorities and  
inner-city residents, who tend to vote Democratic, made up a large 
share of the estimated 4 million people missed by the 1990 count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose adjusting the numbers to make up for that  
undercount, because people who tend to vote for GOP candidates also 
are more likely to voluntarily respond to the census. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, reacting to the ruling, said  
the Census Bureau may use a two-track system. But he acknowledged 
conducting the census in two distinct ways would be a ``massive 
undertaking'' and would cost ``substantially more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a flurry of activity, the court also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled that the Federal Communications Commission, and not each  
of the 50 states, may set the pricing rules and other regulations 
for long-distance companies and others to enter the $110 billion 
local telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
	--Set the stage for an enormously important states' rights  
decision next year by agreeing to decide in a pair of Florida cases 
whether the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 wiped out 
the immunity that states and their agencies enjoy against lawsuits 
in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to use a dispute over Missouri's campaign-finance  
restrictions to clarify how far states can go in limiting the size 
of individual contributions to political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the census case, the Clinton administration's plan to use  
statistical sampling was challenged by taxpayers in six states -- 
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania and 
Wisconsin. They contended that adjusting the real count would cost 
them money and political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit  
had joined the administration's appeal in the Supreme Court, 
claiming they will be shortchanged if sampling is not used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are thrilled,'' said Matthew Glavin, the Southeastern Legal  
Foundation president who was one of the suing taxpayers. ``We will 
continue to work with Congress to ensure that the proponents of 
census sampling do not attempt an end-run around this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of her party's  
Congressional Census Caucus, said ``supporters of an accurate 
census'' favor using sampling ``for non-apportionment purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The census these days largely is conducted by mail, and about  
two-thirds of Americans return their forms. Census workers then 
begin knocking on doors to find the rest, but that does not always 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Census counts have been imperfect since Thomas Jefferson oversaw  
the first in 1790. All sides acknowledge that census-takers cannot 
expect to find every American, but they are deeply divided over the 
wisdom of using modern statistical knowledge to estimate how many 
people were missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants to use traditional methods to  
find 90 percent of Americans, and then use a separate survey of 
750,000 people across the country as a ``quality check'' to decide 
where people were overcounted or undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech last week, President Clinton  
said, ``Since every person in America counts, every American ought 
to be counted. We need a census that uses the most modern 
scientific methods to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court, in the opinion by Justice Sandra Day  
O'Connor, said such methods are barred by law when it comes to 
deciding how many congressional seats each state gets. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote tracked the court's ideological split.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The four more liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H.  
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- dissented.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth 4Q Profits Rise 37 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. Monday reported fourth-quarter  
net income of $1 billion, or 51 cents per share, up 37 percent from 
$729 million, or 37 cents per share, in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for the most recent quarter included one-time gains  
of $172 million for the sale of a New Zealand unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected quarterly earnings of 41 cents per share,  
excluding one-time items, according to a survey by First Call. 
BellSouth said its earnings per share without the one-time gains 
were 42 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of BellSouth tumbled 11 percent, or $5.06 1/4, to close at  
$43 on the New York Stock Exchange, a decline that analysts 
attributed to a Supreme Court decision that should expand 
competition among long-distance phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter operating revenues were a record $6.17 billion,  
up 10 percent from $5.6 billion in during the same period a year 
earlier, the Atlanta-based telecommunications company said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, BellSouth reported net income of $3.53 billion, or  
$1.78 per share, up 8 percent from $3.26 billion, or $1.64 per 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the year were a record $23.12 billion, a 12.5  
percent increase from $20.56 billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Lott Believes Trial Won't End Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton's impeachment trial at  
a crossroads, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today he had 
enough GOP votes to thwart a Democratic attempt to dismiss the 
perjury and obstruction charges against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the votes, I believe, not to dismiss it at this  
point,'' Lott said. ``I think that is a short-circuiting of the 
process that would not be fair. The American people would not agree 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said senators would vote as early as Tuesday on the more  
difficult issue of whether to allow House prosecutors to call 
witnesses. As both sides met in private, Lott declined to predict 
the outcome of that later floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats supported a new proposal calling for final votes on  
the articles of impeachment on Friday, with no chance of witnesses. 
Republicans ``summarily rejected'' the idea during a closed-door 
meeting, according to John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators delayed the resumption of the trial today by an  
hour to keep talking among themselves. Lott told Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist after the ceremonial opening that the two sides 
are ``close on an agreement'' on procedures for the next few days. 
``What we're discussing would save some time and lead us to a fair 
procedure,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart criticized the Republicans  
for rejecting a plan ``that on a bipartisan basis could bring this 
case to a conclusion in an expedited way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings came as House prosecutors held a private meeting of  
their own to draw up a list of witnesses they'd like to testify, 
Monica Lewinsky among them. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator, Gordon Smith of Oregon, indicated a vote  
on calling witnesses may fail, even though the GOP holds a 55-45 
majority in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote  
for witnesses,'' Smith said on CNN. ``I think there is reason to 
wonder whether or not the votes are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel on  
Sunday, and her attorney said afterward she had provided no 
information not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
One of her lawyers made clear today she does not want to testify 
from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered every question they asked,'' attorney Jacob Stein  
said. She now wants to avoid being used in ``what cannot be 
anything but an unseemly circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled to debate two rival motions beginning  
today -- one sought by Democrats to dismiss the charges, the other 
sought by the House prosecutors to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle told reporters of an ``alternative  
scenario'' that would scrap those two votes. He set out a schedule 
for final arguments and Senate deliberations that would culminate 
in a vote on the articles of impeachment themselves on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were to have been granted two hours later  
today to offer a formal rebuttal to the White House's defense 
arguments, and each side was to have had time for closing arguments 
on Tuesday. Then Wednesday and Thursday were to have been set aside 
for deliberations of the articles, with votes on Friday. Some 
Democrats also said they wanted provisions for censuring the 
president immediately after the articles of impeachment were voted 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of the alternative wasn't completely clear. Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he and GOP Sen. Slade Gorton had 
discussed the idea late last week. Separately, Democrats said they 
had handed it to Lott late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., opposed the  
idea. ``It is a step by step process that should not be ended 
before the time is right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., countered: ``There's a feeling  
that if the House managers have their way we're never going to get 
a bipartisan conclusion.'' And that conclusion, he said, is what 
both parties are determined to achieve, especially given the 
ferocity of the partisanship that gripped the House during its 
portion of the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came against the backdrop of a widely held  
belief that Clinton will win acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. A 
two-thirds vote would be required to convict and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the topic dominated the TV interview programs on  
Sunday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Grams, R-Minn., sounding a position held by most  
conservative Republicans, said he would be inclined to vote for 
witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were meeting today to finalize their witness  
list and submit it to the Senate. Among the names they were 
considering were Ms. Lewinsky, Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and possibly former presidential 
political adviser Dick Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to  
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that the former White House intern resisted and that Senate 
Democrats denounced as an act of desperation. A judge order Ms. 
Lewinsky to undergo the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts for the former intern.

<HEADLINE>  Iraq: U.S. Missiles Kill 11 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASRA, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. missiles slammed into residential  
neighborhoods in southern Iraq on Monday, demolishing sturdy, 
stone-walled homes. Iraqi officials reported at least 11 people 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said its Air Force and Navy jets fired at air  
defense systems in response to ``threats by anti-aircraft artillery 
fire'' and by four Iraqi warplanes flying south of the 33rd 
parallel in violation of the no-flight ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said it was likely that U.S. jets targeting  
the Iraqi air defense installations misfired and that at least one 
missile may have killed civilians in and around the city of Basra. 
Spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said U.S. officials were 
``still assessing the site damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles hit five areas of southern Iraq, including the  
working-class al-Jumhuriya neighborhood on the outskirts of Basra, 
Iraqi officials said. Several homes in that neighborhood were 
destroyed, their roofs caved in. Broken dishes and kitchen utensils 
were strewn among the rubble. Civilians worked late into the night 
to clean the debris from the morning strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash, the governor of Basra, said two aircraft  
fired five missiles that killed 11 people and injured 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles struck in the morning and Hamash said most of the  
casualties were women, children or the elderly because many men had 
already left for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles hit three civilian areas in or near Basra, as well  
as a site near the airport and another near the Rumeilah oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	An engineer at the oil field was reported injured in the  
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials took reporters to the al-Jumhouri hospital, one  
of the city's two main hospitals. Several injured children and 
women were at the hospital. Iraqi officials said they had been 
wounded in the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In al-Jumhuriya, four homes were completely destroyed and six  
damaged, including Lufti Swadi's house. The blast ripped the front 
door off the 28-year-old baker's home, shattered parts of the walls 
and scattered the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Abu al-Khaseeb, four houses were destroyed and  
another four damaged. Iraqi officials were still assessing damage 
in the other civilian area that was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamash said there were no military installations in the areas  
that were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not even a police station there, let alone a military  
installation,'' he said. ``The United States claims to be a 
humanitarian nation but they are enemies of that concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the al-Jumhouri hospital in Basra, Marwa Ali, 6, lay on a  
hospital bed swathed in a pink blanket. Dried blood was caked on 
her nostrils. She was about to go to school to take an exam when 
the missile struck, her sister Zeinab, 25, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It began with a big bang,'' said Zeinab Ali, who was slightly  
injured with cuts and bruises. ``I could see my house coming down 
on us. There was dust all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marwa suffered multiple wounds to the scalp and a deep knee  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz condemned the attack and said  
the United States and its allies would be held responsible. His 
remarks were reported by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Basra, 350 miles south of Baghdad, is within the southern  
``no-fly'' zone that the United States and its allies set up after 
the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims who rose up against the 
government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern no-fly zone Monday, U.S. aircraft attacked three  
separate Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries, U.S. officials said. They 
said the aircraft fired missiles and dropped bombs after Iraq 
targeted or fired on the warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican condemned the bombing raids, saying Monday in a  
statement from Mexico City that the military action ``confirms once 
again'' Pope John Paul II's belief that ``military measures don't 
resolve problems in themselves, rather they aggravate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has consistently opposed the military actions  
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamash, meanwhile, vowed defiance after the attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to oppose any over-flying of our territory by  
enemy aircraft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been challenging the no-fly zones with increasing  
regularity since Dec. 16-19 airstrikes by the United States and 
Britain. Those attacks were aimed at punishing Iraq after U.N. 
weapons inspectors released a report saying that Baghdad was 
obstructing their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Defense Ministry said its warplanes were not  
involved in the latest attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, U.S. aircraft fired on two surface-to-air missile  
sites in separate incidents in the northern no-fly zone, U.S. 
officials said. It was a second consecutive day that U.S. warplanes 
patrolling the no-fly zones opened fire after being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest attack comes one day after Arab foreign ministers met  
in Egypt and refused to condemn last month's airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Information Minister Humam Abdel-Khaliq claimed that the Arab  
foreign ministers had given the United States and Britain ``an Arab 
green card'' to attack Iraq.

Spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said U.S. officials were 
``still assessing the site damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles hit five areas of southern Iraq, including the  
working-class al-Jumhuriya neighborhood on the outskirts of Basra, 
Iraqi officials said. Several homes in that neighborhood were 
destroyed, their roofs caved in. Broken dishes and kitchen utensils 
were strewn among the rubble. Civilians worked late into the night 
to clean the debris from the morning strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash, the governor of Basra, said two aircraft  
fired five missiles that killed 11 people and injured 59. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles struck in the morning and Hamash said most of the  
casualties were women, children or the elderly because many men had 
already left for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles hit three civilian areas in or near Basra, as well  
as a site near the airport and another near the Rumeilah oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	An engineer at the oil field was reported injured in the  
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials took reporters to the al-Jumhouri hospital, one  
of the city's two main hospitals. Several injured children and 
women were at the hospital. Iraqi officials said they had been 
wounded in the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In al-Jumhuriya, four homes were completely destroyed and six  
damaged, including Lufti Swadi's house. The blast ripped the front 
door off the 28-year-old baker's home, shattered parts of the walls 
and scattered the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Abu al-Khaseeb, four houses were destroyed and  
another four damaged. Iraqi officials were still assessing damage 
in the other civilian area that was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamash said there were no military installations in the areas  
that were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not even a police station there, let alone a military  
installation,'' he said. ``The United States claims to be a 
humanitarian nation but they are enemies of that concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the al-Jumhouri hospital in Basra, Marwa Ali, 6, lay on a  
hospital bed swathed in a pink blanket. Dried blood was caked on 
her nostrils. She was about to go to school to take an exam when 
the missile struck, her sister Zeinab, 25, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It began with a big bang,'' said Zeinab Ali, who was slightly  
injured with cuts and bruises. ``I could see my house coming down 
on us. There was dust all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marwa suffered multiple wounds to the scalp and a deep knee  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz condemned the attack and said  
the United States and its allies would be held responsible. His 
remarks were reported by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Basra, 350 miles south of Baghdad, is within the southern  
``no-fly'' zone that the United States and its allies set up after 
the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims who rose up against the 
government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern no-fly zone Monday, U.S. aircraft attacked three  
separate Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries, U.S. officials said. They 
said the aircraft fired missiles and dropped bombs after Iraq 
targeted or fired on the warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican condemned the bombing raids, saying Monday in a  
statement from Mexico City that the military action ``confirms once 
again'' Pope John Paul II's belief that ``military measures don't 
resolve problems in themselves, rather they aggravate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has consistently opposed the military actions  
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamash, meanwhile, vowed defiance after the attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to oppose any over-flying of our territory by  
enemy aircraft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been challenging the no-fly zones with increasing  
regularity since Dec. 16-19 airstrikes by the United States and 
Britain. Those attacks were aimed at punishing Iraq after U.N. 
weapons inspectors released a report saying that Baghdad was 
obstructing their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Defense Ministry said its warplanes were not  
involved in the latest attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, U.S. aircraft fired on two surface-to-air missile  
sites in separate incidents in the northern no-fly zone, U.S. 
officials said. It was a second consecutive day that U.S. warplanes 
patrolling the no-fly zones opened fire after being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest attack comes one day after Arab foreign ministers met  
in Egypt and refused to condemn last month's airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Information Minister Humam Abdel-Khaliq claimed that the Arab  
foreign ministers had given the United States and Britain ``an Arab 
green card'' to attack Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Senators Have To Be Bipartisan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Far to the east, in the nation's capital,  
the U.S. Senate tries to look fittingly bipartisan as it sits in 
judgment of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Out here, in the other Washington, sits a fidgeting legislature  
forced by fate not only to look bipartisan, but to be bipartisan. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, for just the second time in the state's 110-year  
history, Washington voters elected 49 Republicans and 49 Democrats 
to the 98-member state House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we're two mongrel dogs chained up together,'' said  
Hans Dunshee, a Democrat from a rural district north of Seattle. 
``Now, when I talk to the Republicans, I say, `May I share some 
information?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The need for enforced courtesy and cooperation showed up even on  
opening day, when Republican Clyde Ballard, an Eastern Washington 
farmer, and Democrat Frank Chopp, a Seattle social worker, grabbed 
a peculiar, two-handled gavel to bang the session to order as 
co-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The gavel, with its mallet head between the handles, was used  
the last time the House was split in the 1979-80 session. It's only 
one of the oddities. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative language has also been transformed. Instead of the  
typical, sneaky parliamentary maneuvers and testy news conferences, 
members of both parties say they are ``looking for empathy'' and 
``building relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You go first,'' Democrat Brian Hatfield told his Republican  
counterpart, Brad Benson, as the co-chairmen convened their House 
Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, you go first,'' Benson replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, you first,'' Hatfield insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you two guys hug, I'm leaving,'' growled Richard DeBolt, a  
Republican committee member. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington House is one of 33 house and 28 senate chambers  
with equal numbers of members, meaning ties can occur. But this 
year, it is the only one with an even split, says the National 
Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The split has forced Dunshee to swallow his trademark wicked wit  
now that he and the longtime butt of his verbal barbs -- Republican 
Brian Thomas of suburban Seattle -- share the chairmanship of the 
House Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, instead of constantly casting the droll and careful Thomas  
as a hapless puppet of big business, Dunshee must work with him in 
tandem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreed there will be no surprises, no stuff to  
embarrass the other chairman,'' Dunshee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good,'' Thomas said. Since the 105-day legislative  
session began Jan. 11, the two have met several times to filter 
legislation before it goes to their equally balanced tax committee. 
They have promised that no bills will pass without majority 
agreement of each side of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a much more deliberative process,'' Thomas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, said Co-Speaker Ballard, ``there will be a  
heckuva lot less legislation'' out of that committee and others 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the divided House does pass legislation, it will go to the  
solidly Democratic Senate and finally to Gov. Gary Locke, also a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, whose party wielded majority power the last four years,  
said Republicans this year and next will essentially have only veto 
power. ``In the House,'' he said, ``we can stop things for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, both sides have vowed to be nice.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most difficult part of this legislative session for  
me,'' said Republican John Pennington of Battle Ground. ``I 
consider myself a pretty nice guy, but I don't like to be forced to 
be nice. It really, really stinks.''

<HEADLINE> Rosie Perez Gets New Film Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Following a four-year hiatus from the movies,  
Rosie Perez wasn't interested in returning to the big screen for a 
minor role. 
</P>
<P>
	So when she was offered the part of a receptionist in ``24 Hour  
Woman,'' which opens Friday, the 34-year-old actress did some fast 
talking to persuade director Nancy Savoca to give her a bigger 
part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to her, 'I know you think I'm loud because of the press  
you read, but it's not true. I have the ability to do this -- all I 
need is the opportunity. ... I want the lead and I want to produce. 
Here's my resume,''' Perez recalled for Sunday's Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got tired of being offered this and that -- I was like  
'I'm better than that,''' she said. ``I'm not great but I'm trying 
to get the opportunity to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the new movie, Perez -- whose high-pitched Brooklyn voice  
echoed throughout the 1989 Spike Lee film ``Do The Right Thing'' -- 
takes on the role of a ``well-rounded, complex'' television 
producer who decides to share her pregnancy with the show's 
audience.

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils $128M Reading Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore stressed the importance  
of reading skills and called for continued federal participation in 
scientific research and development during his visit to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reading is more than a source of pleasure and pride. It is a  
vital tool for success,'' Gore said Sunday as he announced a $128 
million program to help youngsters learn to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the excitement about the information superhighway comes  
to naught if someone is unable to read,'' he said. ``A child can 
turn on the computer and point and click and connect to the 
Internet, but the screen might as well be dark if that child is not 
able to read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child literacy proposal includes $26 million for the Reading  
Excellence Act, which will make local grants available for reading 
improvement, and $50 million for a program that targets reading 
problems in the youngest children, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came during Gore's two-day tour through  
California. The pledge also comes as the state's new Democratic 
Gov. Gray Davis pushes a new slate of similar education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was scheduled to appear today in Sacramento and San  
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was part of a push to put volunteers from the  
national service program AmeriCorps in three San Diego schools that 
have between 64 percent and 94 percent Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning today, corps members will start a new literacy program  
that provides tutoring, home visits and classrooms for children who 
need help with their reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said schools nationwide need attention, from more teachers  
and smaller class sizes to upgraded buildings and equipment. But 
the most important skill for any child is learning to read well by 
the end of the third grade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke Sunday to a crowd of educators, parents and  
AmeriCorps volunteers after reading to children who earned the 
privilege to visit him by having perfect attendance. He made no 
reference to President Clinton's ongoing impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, while attending the American Association for the  
Advancement of Science in Anaheim, Gore said the federal government 
must support research not only for specific applied needs, but 
``the government should also support rigorous research even when we 
don't know where it will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He announced a $366 million high-tech appropriation and a  
proposed $2.4 billion research tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Technological advances must not come at the expense of ``the  
most cherished values of our nation,'' he said. ``As genetic 
science maps the blueprint of lives, it may open a Pandora's box of 
ethical concerns. Some of these concerns are absurd, but some are 
not receiving the attention they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research and development should be used ``to end suffering, to  
eradicate diseases and promote the freedom to educate our children 
and lives for our families and our nation,'' the vice president 
said. ``We haven't a moment to waste.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Heavyweight Champ Moore Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURFREESBORO, Tenn. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Michael  
Moorer faces charges of drunken driving and evading arrest after 
driving his car into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford County police arrested Moorer, 31, of Boca Raton,  
Fla., early Sunday morning after he crashed his 1997 Mercedes Benz 
into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	Moorer, who lost a title bout to Evander Holyfield in November  
1997, had been visiting with his brother and some friends. Police 
reports show that Moorer became upset while at a bar and drove 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Moorer soon struck a guard rail with his car. Deputy Brian  
Guthrie said he tried to talk to Moorer. But the boxer drove away, 
and the deputy followed until Moorer crashed the car into a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy reported that he was forced to pull his gun on  
Moorer, who was very angry and did not want to cooperate. Two 
friends finally talked Moorer into surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is set for Feb. 24 in Rutherford County General  
Sessions Court.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Jumps 40.1 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world soared in 1998  
to a record high, the government said Monday, reflecting Japanese 
consumers' reluctance to spend amid Japan's worst recession in 
decades, cutting demand for imports and making Japanese 
manufacturers more reliant on sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement prompted immediate reaction from a top U.S.  
trade official who said Washington wants to reverse the recent 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus rose 40.1 percent in 1998 from the  
previous year to 13.9 trillion yen, or $121.8 billion, the Finance 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's surplus with the United States increased as well,  
rising 33.4 percent to $58.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that isn't sustainable,'' Deputy U.S. Trade  
Representative Richard Fisher said. ``We're obviously interested in 
having these numbers reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus for 1998 topped the old largest annual surplus of  
$120.4 billion set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and  
other trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its 
weak economy and spurring demand for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, in Tokyo to meet with Japanese government officials,  
said Japan must also improve access to its markets for foreign 
companies to shrink the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's talks with representative from the Ministry of  
International Trade and Industry and the agricultural ministry were 
expected to focus another sensitive issue: Tokyo's increasing steel 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	For the whole of 1998, U.S.-bound steel exports soared 91.2  
percent to $3.6 billion. On a volume basis, they were up a sharp 
166.6 percent at 6.9 million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	For December, however, steel exports fell for the first time in  
33 months, meaning that Japan may have averted the imposition of 
U.S. anti-dumping penalties. Steel exports to the United States 
fell 20.8 percent and were down 14.9 percent in terms of volume. 
</P>
<P>
	A Finance Ministry official briefing reporters said the pace of  
overall growth in the trade surplus should stabilize, although the 
ministry needs to monitor changes in the level of the surplus in 
the medium term. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are unlikely to grow rapidly due to weak shipments to  
other Asian countries, while imports should begin rising if a 
series of policy measures the government has taken succeed in 
bolstering the domestic economy, the official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, exports fell 0.6 percent to $440.7 billion because of  
sluggish exports of semiconductor-related electronic products and 
office equipment, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports tumbled 10.5 percent to $319.6 billion, mainly due to  
steep declines in global oil and gas prices and partly because of 
poor demand for wood products used to build housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time both exports and imports declined in a calendar  
year was 1993, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal of Clinton Case Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate closed its doors Monday to debate a  
Democratic attempt to dismiss all charges against President Clinton 
and bring his impeachment trial to an end. House prosecutors 
pressed their case for testimony by Monica Lewinsky and a shortened 
list of additional witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators deliberated for 4 1/2 hours in a rare secret evening  
session as the White House, confident of Clinton's ability to win 
eventual acquittal, announced it would ignore a written list of 
questions submitted by Majority Leader Trent Lott and other 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt by two Democrats to open the debate to the public was  
rejected, 57 senators voting against it and 43 for it. A two-thirds 
majority was needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators began their closed-door debate after two final  
hours of arguments by the White House and House prosecutors on the 
question of dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was reconvening at noon EST on Tuesday, when it may  
turn its attention to the subject of possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, told the Senate that  
dismissal would mean that ``charges of perjury, obstruction of 
justice are summarily dismissed, disregarded, ignored, brushed off, 
and these are charges that send ordinary folk to jail every day of 
the week and remove federal judges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be continuing contention about Clinton's case, he  
said, unless the articles of impeachment themselves are brought to 
a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case cannot be made. It is time to end it,'' countered  
Nicole Seligman, a private attorney who has long represented 
Clinton and is part of his impeachment defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	No votes are expected before Tuesday or possibly Wednesday, but  
after more than two weeks, the first presidential impeachment trial 
in 131 years was fast approaching a pivotal moment. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans are expected to produce a formal proposal for  
witnesses on Tuesday, to be voted on after the Democratic attempt 
to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, a spokesman for Lott, R-Miss., confirmed that  
Republican leaders were seriously considering a plan by Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine, to allow the Senate to find Clinton guilty 
without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would prevent Clinton from emerging from the trial  
unscathed if the 67 votes needed for his conviction don't 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by the House prosecutors to winnow their witness list  
during the day marked an attempt to hold the support of wavering 
Republican senators whose votes will be crucial when the roll is 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky remains at the top of the list, House officials  
said, and there is continued interest in seeking testimony from 
Betty Currie, the president's secretary. Additional consideration 
is being given to adding presidential friend Vernon Jordan to the 
list, or perhaps a White House aide, either chief of staff John 
Podesta or Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
idea of trying to question Kathleen Willey had been dropped, as had 
the idea of summoning any of a handful of other, less well-known 
women who have alleged that Clinton made unwelcome sexual advances. 
House prosecutors had long sought their testimony to see whether 
Clinton or associates tried to intimidate them to change their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to prioritize this and get down to the bare minimum  
and not run the risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on 
too many,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., a members of the House 
team prosecuting the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense lawyers were granted an hour apiece to  
argue the motion to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leader Lott claimed enough votes to squash the  
attempt, and no Democrat disputed him. In fact, one Democrat, 
Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, sought unsucessfully during the day 
to have the effort to dismiss separated into two votes, one for 
each article of impeachment, thereby leaving open the question of 
how he might vote. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Democrats expressed confidence they could  
produce enough votes to make it clear that Clinton will eventually 
be acquitted on the impeachment charges. It takes a majority vote 
to dismiss the charges, but two-thirds to convict the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid to open deliberations, led by Democratic Sens. Tom  
Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, drew the support of 
40 Democrats and three Republicans. Opposed were 52 Republicans and 
five Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sergeant at arms will please close the doors,'' Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist ordered as soon as the roll call had been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in both parties have begun to call in increasing  
numbers for an end to the trial, which has consumed virtually all 
the Senate's time since it convened on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic support for Clinton has hardened over that period,  
virtually assuring his acquittal when the final vote is called. But 
now some Republican senators, too, are publicly urging an end to 
the trial, at the same time House Republicans are pressing to 
extend the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling that if the House managers have their way  
we've never going to get a bipartisan conclusion,'' Democratic Sen. 
Richard Durbin of Illinois told reporters before the day's trial 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, too, favor bipartisanship, but not at any price.  
``There ought to be a way to have an exit strategy that's 
honorable,'' said Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one stab at bipartisanship was made during the day, as  
GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas met with Democratic Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts on a possible agreement. No deal was 
struck on what officials said was a GOP suggestion for a limited 
number of witnesses to be questioned in private on a compressed 
timetable before a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with members of both parties meeting separately to  
weigh a Democratic proposal to bring the trial to an end by Friday 
with a vote on the articles of impeachment themselves. That would 
have ended any chance of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was ``summarily rejected by Lott and the Republican''  
caucus, according to John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the majority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	That left each side wondering how the roll call would come out  
on witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, seizing on a comment made Saturday by White House  
lawyer Gregory Craig, dispatched several questions to the White 
House for the president's ``personal response, in writing, and 
under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questions dealt with issues including Clinton's testimony in  
his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and before Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said questions to the  
president are ``not called for in the Senate procedure'' and 
Clinton won't answer them.

<HEADLINE> Senators Face Crucial Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With House prosecutors intent on having Monica  
Lewinsky testify before the Senate, senators are facing crucial 
votes that could abruptly end President Clinton's trial or prolong 
it indefinitely. One Republican said today she is leaning against 
hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the senators sitting in judgment of Clinton agreed  
Sunday that the 67 votes needed to remove him from office are not 
there. They also said they are seeking a way for graceful exit from 
the yearlong scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote this week to allow witnesses, if it fails, could set the  
stage for a final vote on conviction or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.''  
said Sen. Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today she  
is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made that 
decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., also on ABC, said deciding  
against witnesses would allow the Senate to end the trial this 
week. ``Ninety senators have asked 104 questions over two days,'' 
he said. ``There is a growing sense ... that we have enough to make 
the fundamental decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to  
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that the former White House intern did not want and that Senate 
Democrats denounced as an act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts for the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors met for nearly two hours with Ms.  
Lewinsky and her lawyer at the upscale Mayflower Hotel about six 
blocks from the White House. The meeting took place after 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, citing the immunity agreement 
she signed with his office, on Saturday obtained a court order 
requiring her attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found her to be a very personable and impressive young  
woman, and we found that she might be a very helpful witness to the 
Senate if she is called,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said today that the weekend episode  
with Ms. Lewinsky reeks of partisanship. ``This little dance of the 
Republican House managers with Kenneth Starr in a $5,000-a-day 
suite really smacks of a publicity stunt more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed with Leahy on CBS' ``This Morning,'' Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah, said House prosecutors have a right to interview Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``I have a lot of questions I'd like to ask her that 
haven't been asked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said his client had  
been ``extremely truthful'' but said: ``She added nothing to the 
record that is already sitting before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She should not be called to testify, Cacheris said, ``because  
all of her testimony is fully and completely disclosed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Starr watched, said Rep. Asa Hutchinson's 
spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of the 
interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and the entire 
session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors insisted that witnesses were needed to prove  
their case that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in 
trying to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	They said witnesses could clear up contradictions arising in the  
first eight days of the trial, such as who initiated the 
concealment of gifts Clinton gave to Ms. Lewinsky and whether there 
was a tacit understanding that she would lie in the Paula Jones 
case to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats warned that witnesses could extend the trial for  
months and several Republicans said they were skeptical of the need 
for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do proceed (with witnesses), we want to make sure that  
it doesn't turn out to be `The Jerry Springer Show,''' Snowe said 
on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Before moving to the witness issue, the Senate was expected  
today to take up a motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss 
the case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, a stickler for maintaining Senate traditions, has been  
strongly critical of the president's behavior. His decision to come 
out against removal from office was a blow to Republicans who had 
hoped he would be the catalyst for a Democratic shift against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House lawyers and the House prosecutors each have an  
hour to speak on dismissal. Senators then may call a break in the 
trial to debate the issue, either in open or closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the trial would take up the question of whether to depose  
witnesses, the first step to live testimony, before voting on 
dismissal and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors also were expected to make public their  
proposed list of witnesses. It likely would include Clinton's 
friend, Vernon Jordan; Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie; 
and other White House officials as well as Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris also was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators Sunday. He said he 
was asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky 
scandal was breaking a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who hold a 55-45 majority in the House, appeared  
solidly against dismissal, and some Democrats agreed that it was 
more appropriate to end the trial with a straight vote on the 
charges. With acquittal, the next question would be whether to 
write a censure resolution condemning Clinton for the affair.

<HEADLINE> Senators Send Clinton Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and nine  
other Republican senators sent President Clinton written questions 
Monday on unresolved issues in his impeachment trial, but the White 
House said they won't be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 10 questions touches on a subject the Senate has  
approached warily -- Clinton's assertion that only Monica Lewinsky's 
conduct constituted sexual relations, according to a narrow 
definition approved in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it your position that Ms. Lewinsky was lying ... when she  
said that you engaged in conduct with her that constituted 'sexual 
relations' even under your narrow interpretation of the term ...?'' 
Clinton was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cover letter, the senators acknowledged that Clinton was  
not compelled to respond. But the Republicans took advantage of an 
offer Saturday by White House special counsel Gregory Craig, now 
withdrawn, to answer written questions. 
</P>
<P>
	James Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
said senators had the opportunity to ask Clinton's defense team 
questions on the Senate floor. The cover letter asserted, however, 
that only the president could answer many of the questions because 
they ``concern his state of mind or facts that only he is privy 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questions are valuable, however, because they spotlight  
issues that remain on senators' minds as they wrestle with how to 
conduct the remainder of Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the question on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, the  
senators asked the president about the truthfulness of his 
statements under oath, statements he made to his secretary and his 
aides, the retrieval of his gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, his ``cover 
story'' with the former intern, a poll by political consultant Dick 
Morris and Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators asked Clinton whether he stood by his testimony  
that Ms. Lewinsky would have to turn over his gifts to Mrs. Jones' 
lawyers if they were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	They wanted to know who ``ordered and paid for'' a poll by  
political consultant Morris on whether Americans would forgive the 
president if he committed perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the judge in the Jones case instructed all parties  
not to disclose the substance of their depositions, the senators 
asked Clinton about his call to Oval Office secretary Betty Currie 
the day after his sworn testimony. He asked her to come to work the 
next day, a Sunday, to discuss his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was this consistent with Judge (Susan Webber) Wright's  
protective order?'' Clinton was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit on the Jones case,  
denying a sexual affair, the president was asked: ``Did you either 
personally or through some other person participate in any way in 
the preparation'' of the affidavit?

<HEADLINE> Study Shows U.S. Ecosystem Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Scientists have long known that foreign  
plants and animals are damaging various parts of the U.S. 
ecosystem. They just didn't know it's costing the nation about $123 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by David Pimentel, an ecologist at Cornell University,  
estimates that alien weeds such as purple loosestrife are costing 
Americans $35.5 billion annually, insects like fire ants are 
costing $20 billion more and disease-causing organisms are costing 
$6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining economic costs are spread over causes ranging from  
rats and plant diseases to non-native fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take many troublemakers to cause tremendous  
damage,'' Pimentel told The Oregonian in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even animals as familiar as dogs and cats cause huge problems.  
The nation's 63 million domestic cats and 30 million feral cats are 
estimated to kill about 200 million birds each year -- birds that 
would otherwise eat many insect pests. 
</P>
<P>
	At an estimated $30 per pest-eating bird, that amounts to $6  
billion in damage by cats alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dog bites send 800,000 people to emergency rooms annually,  
resulting in about $30 million in medical costs. Wild dogs running 
in packs in Florida, Texas and other states cause an estimated $10 
million a year in livestock losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gypsy moths, elm disease, fire ants and zebra mussels also are  
among other damaging organisms listed in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study confirmed what many Oregon ranchers, farmers and  
fishermen already feared. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state that stretches from ocean to desert, and relies on  
agriculture as its largest single industry, the threat from 
non-native plants and animals is serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful loosestrife takes over native aquatic species in  
wetlands and along streams, removing hiding cover and food for 
birds and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheatgrass on rangelands accelerates the spread and frequency of  
wildfires. Bullfrogs are killing off native turtle species, and the 
green crabs pose a threat to clams, oysters and Dungeness crabs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the economic costs, Pimentel said, nonindigenous  
species are responsible for more than 40 percent of the plants and 
animals that are on the nation's endangered or threatened list. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Pimentel points out that 98 percent of the nation's food  
supply comes from introduced species such as wheat, rice, domestic 
cattle and poultry. Those have a value of about $500 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimentel reported his findings Sunday at the annual meeting of  
the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Anaheim, 
Calif., where he urged policy-makers to devote more resources to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too late to send these organisms back,'' Pimentel said.  
``We will be lucky to control further damage to natural and managed 
ecosystems.''

<HEADLINE> Fox TV Star Has Style Cramped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMANA, Iowa (AP) -- Ashton Kutcher liked the retro look better  
when it was his choice and not his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutcher, one of the stars of Fox's ``That '70's Show,'' said he  
wore bell bottoms, puka shell necklaces and polyester shirts before 
he started playing Michael Kelso -- a big, dumb guy with a whiny 
girlfriend. So he had to change his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to have a different identity than my character, so I  
couldn't wear them any more. I had to buy new clothes. I was kind 
of bummed about that,'' Kutcher, 20, said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen in late  
Tuesday morning trading in the absence of fresh news to move the 
market. Japanese stock prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.71 yen, down 0.63 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also below its level of 113.96 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traders have already factored the Brazilian economic crisis  
and the U.S.-Japan trade issue into the dollar-yen rates. Without 
new developments in these issues, it's hard to break out of the 
range,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 226.92 points, or 1.60 percent, to  
end the morning session at 14,435.73 points. On Monday, the average 
closed up 54.41 points, or 0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a decline in New York, the dollar weakened slightly in  
Tokyo but stayed in a narrow range. Traders continued to avoid 
taking new positions amid uncertainty about the economic situation 
in Brazil, South America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which had strengthened Friday and early Monday in  
part due to rumors of an impending Chinese devaluation, retreated 
after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji announced the yuan would remain 
stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.53 yen, down  
from 132.70 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, a gain on Wall Street helped push Tokyo's  
main stock index higher. In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 82.65 points to 9,203.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping the stock market was an announcement Monday by the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission that major Japanese banks will 
be required to make provisions covering 70 percent of their 
unguaranteed loans to companies that ``may go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting rid of the massive bad debts held by banks is considered  
a major step in helping Japan's recession-hit economy get back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 11.71 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,110.42. 
The TOPIX closed up 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 1.805 percent from 1.780 percent late Monday. Its price 
fell to 99.95 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., EU Have No Banana Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union reached  
no immediate agreement today on defusing a dispute over bananas 
that threatens to escalate into a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were closeted in discussions even as they were  
supposed to be attending a meeting of the 133-member World Trade 
Organization. On the agenda of the meeting was the U.S. request for 
approval of $520 million in sanctions on EU imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Latin American countries claim the union's  
trade policy on bananas continues to violate global trading rules 
because it favors producers in former European colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The union rejects the claim, saying it has complied with a 1997  
judgment by the WTO dispute panel. A WTO panel has yet to rule on 
the Europeans' claim of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were consulting with officials in Washington and  
Brussels after a weekend of mediation by WTO Director-General 
Renato Ruggiero, trade officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that we can make progress today,'' Ruggiero told the  
meeting. ``In all my suggestions to both parties, I have never 
asked anyone to make concessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a compromise suggested by Ruggiero, the panel looking at  
the new EU banana import system will also consider whether the 
proposed U.S. sanctions are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ruggiero is just trying to get both parties to talk, but  
these are technical procedures and nothing has been agreed to,'' 
U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, spokesman for EU trade commissioner Sir Leon  
Brittan, told reporters in Brussels that it was ``a fair proposal, 
which we are supporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out the possibility that the union would retaliate by  
imposing its own sanctions, saying Europe would seek a solution 
through the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have absolutely no desire for a clash with the United  
States or an escalation of this dispute,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said the planned U.S. sanctions would affect a lot of  
people who had nothing to do with bananas. The imposition of 
100-percent tariffs on selected import goods is expected to hit 
Britain and Italy particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO officials said the compromise would give both parties a bit  
of breathing space to see if they can resolve their underlying 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it is ready to sit down with the  
union at any time to discuss the matter, but the Europeans say they 
will not negotiate under the threat of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> `Varsity Blues' Holds Onto Top Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The high school football movie ``Varsity  
Blues'' clung to No. 1 again during a lackluster box office weekend 
that saw Sharon Stone's ``Gloria,'' the only new movie in wide 
release, fail to break the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 12 films generated about $63 million in North American  
receipts, 19 percent less than the comparable 1998 period, 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. said after tallying final figures 
Monday.

<P>
	``Varsity Blues,'' starring ``Dawson Creek'' TV star James Van  
Der Beek, earned $10.6 million to top the box office heap for a 
second week. It has earned $30.8 million since its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gloria,'' a remake of John Cassavetes' 1980 picture about a  
mob mistress who flees with a young boy after hitmen kill his 
family, placed 15th with a meager $2.1 million in its debut and was 
15th with a grim $1,403 per-location average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' was in second place with $8.1 million, followed  
by ``A Civil Action'' with $7.6 million and ``The Thin Red Line'' 
with $5.8 million. ``Stepmom'' was fifth with $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``At First Sight'' was sixth with $4.9 million and ``You've Got  
Mail'' was seventh with $4.1 million. ``The Prince of Egypt'' was 
eighth with $3.9 million and ``Shakespeare in Love'' was ninth with 
at $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The critically praised ``A Simple Plan'' rounded out the top 10  
with $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday  
through Monday, followed by studio, gross, number of theater

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the capital  
murder trial of John William King, one of three men facing the 
death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, wore a bulletproof vest as he was escorted by deputies  
into Jasper County Courthouse. He is accused in the June 7 slaying 
of James Byrd Jr., who was stripped, chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged until his head came off. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 400 county residents randomly selected for  
jury selection showed up. The selection process is expected to last 
three weeks. Twelve jurors will be selected, plus two alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy said many people have told  
him they were reluctant to serve because of the case's high 
profile. Byrd's murder made national news far beyond Jasper, an 
East Texas timber town of 8,000 people just west of the Louisiana 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of you guys,'' he told reporters Sunday.  
``They're afraid of having their picture taken. They're afraid of 
being interviewed. And they're afraid of serving on a big case like 
this with a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is an ex-convict once involved in a racist prison  
gang. Whether he intended to kidnap Byrd and then to kill him will 
be key in the capital murder case -- and, if he is convicted, to 
whether he's sentenced to life in prison or put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 23, whose engraved wrench was found near  
Byrd's body, was the only defendant to give a statement about 
events leading to Byrd's death. But his statement is legally 
inadmissible unless he testifies, and his attorney says he won't 
permit Berry on the stand without a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- King, Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 --  
were roommates who shared an apartment. Berry told officers the 
three men had been drinking on June 6. Late that evening or shortly 
after midnight, the men went out for a ride in Berry's rusty, 1982 
gray Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what Berry says happened after the pickup truck stopped  
to pick up Byrd, who was walking home from his niece's bridal 
shower: 
</P>
<P>
	King objected to giving a ride to Byrd and, after the group  
stopped at a convenience store, drove to an abandoned logging road 
outside town. There, King declared he was ``fixing to scare'' Byrd. 
Berry watched as Brewer and King allegedly beat Byrd into 
unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry fled and King drove after him. After Berry got back in and  
the truck took off, he turned and said he saw Byrd's body bouncing 
behind, fastened to the bumper with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The route they took, a two-mile asphalt stretch of Huff Creek  
Road, was later marked with 75 red spray-painted circles to show 
where police found Byrd's keys, dentures and parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged King, Brewer and Berry with capital murder  
but decided to try the cases separately. King's is the second 
capital murder trial in Jasper County. The only other one was in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Unpredictable Night at Globe Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There was something for everybody  
during the 56th Golden Globes awards, an unpredictable evening that 
set the stage for an unpredictable Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Carrey wasn't making off-color quips, or Jack Nicholson  
wasn't remembering the Globe's less golden moments, Steven 
Spielberg was thanking U.S. fighting men for preserving democracy 
and ending the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of freewheeling ceremony in which Christine  
Lahti could draw laughs by walking on stage with toilet paper stuck 
to her shoe, and Michael J. Fox and Gwenyth Paltrow could bring 
tears to the ballroom crowd with their emotional acceptance 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' won best dramatic film and Spielberg was  
honored for directing the brutally realistic World War II combat 
story, while ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and 
``Elizabeth'' won major awards Sunday at the annual awards from the 
Hollywood Foreign Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globes, traditional Oscar predictors, did little to help  
handicap the Academy Awards race. It was between ``Ryan'' and 
``Shakespeare'' before the Globes, and it's between them still, 
with perhaps a little more push for ``The Truman Show'' and its 
award-winning star Carrey, who barely hid his Oscar aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey jokingly thanked the ``Academy'' for his Globe award,  
which actually was selected by entertainment journalists -- not the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm sorry I was thinking of something else,'' said Carrey,  
named best actor in a dramatic movie, beating out a field that 
included the strong acting of Ian McKellen of ``Gods and 
Monsters,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey's co-star Ed Harris picked up a supporting actor trophy,  
setting the irreverent tone for much of the evening by putting a 
toothpick in his mouth and saying, ``Oh, man, I just got through 
eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen's co-star Lynn Redgrave got a surprise supporting  
actress award as the gruff-but-loving maid in ``Gods and Monsters'' 
and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' was best actor in a musical 
or comedy motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a more serious note, Spielberg, whose film is a major  
contender for an Oscar, recalled ``all the veterans that are out 
there that saved Western civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 
1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage, he said: ``I hope the movie is a way at looking  
back... and saying thanks to all of our grandfathers and fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' won best comedy or musical film and  
picked up awards for star Paltrow -- best actress in a comedy -- and 
for screenplay. Paltrow fought back tears and her voice choked as 
she thanked her parents and her ailing grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchette of ``Elizabeth'' won best dramatic actress for  
her role as the title character in second movie set during the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, the Hollywood Foreign Press  
Association voted ABC's ``The Practice'' as best television drama 
series, and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' won as best television comedy 
series. Both are produced David Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do... and just take every 
day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes are awarded for film and television in what  
can be a more colorful affair than the stodgier Academy Awards. 
Last year, Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a 
winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she showed up as a presenter 
with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, he reminisced about the bawdy antics of Joan  
Crawford and Rita Hayworth in bygone Golden Globe awards. ''I like 
fun. What can I say?'' Nicholson said.

<HEADLINE> NBC Explains False DiMaggio Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A technician in NBC's New York control room  
inadvertently sent an erroneous report on ``Dateline NBC'' that 
baseball legend Joe DiMaggio had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just hit the wrong button,'' network spokesman Cory Shields  
said Sunday. Shields would not identify the technician. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, sent out live to all the network's East Coast  
affiliates Sunday evening, was corrected about 20 minutes after it 
was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	It came on as a crawl, or words running at the bottom of the  
television screen, at about 7:30 p.m. EST: ``This is an NBC News 
Special Report. Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio has died at his 
Florida home. He was 84 years old and had.'' The message was then 
cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC employee had typed the report and stored it in NBC's  
computer earlier in the day after reading a New York Daily News 
report that DiMaggio was in grave condition and using a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC ran another crawl about 20 minutes later, saying its  
previous report that DiMaggio had died was inaccurate. ``Mr. 
DiMaggio remains in stable condition at his Florida home,'' the 
report said, running over a taped Katie Couric interview with 
actress Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is trying to reach DiMaggio's family to apologize, Shields  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left with Dr. Earl Barron, DiMaggio's doctor,  
and with the Hall of Famer's friend and lawyer, Morris Engelberg, 
were not returned to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio spent 99 days in intensive care at Memorial Regional  
Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., after contracting lung cancer. He is 
too weak to undergo chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the erroneous NBC report was only sent out live on East  
Coast stations, some affiliates in the Midwest or West may have 
also picked up the report and ran it, Shields said.

<HEADLINE> Notes From the Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Petr Korda, the 1998 Australian Open  
champion, will fall to around 75th in the rankings following his 
third-round loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda climbed to No. 2 after winning his first grand slam event  
here last year at age 30. But he slumped and, at No. 20, was not 
seeded for this year's Australian. He lost in the third round to 
15th-seeded Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he stayed home, citing fatigue, Pete Sampras won't lose  
his No. 1 ranking as a result. All the players with a chance of 
overtaking him now have lost or withdrawn. No. 2 Marcelo Rios 
pulled out with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Also safe is Lindsay Davenport's No. 1 ranking on the women's  
tour. Even if she wins the Australian, No. 2 Martina Hingis cannot 
gain enough points to overtake her. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's side, Alex Corretja, a second-round loser here,  
will replace Rios at No. 2, the highest ranking for a Spaniard 
since Manuel Orantes reached No. 2 in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov can reach No. 3 by winning the  
title, or at least No. 5 by reaching the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Martin, who reached No. 5 in 1994 but is seeded 15th here,  
can return to the top 10 by reaching the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Enqvist, who climbed to No. 6 in 1996, already is assured  
of a top 15 ranking after reaching the quarterfinals here. He now 
is ranked 21st. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PREENING FOR PIERCE: If some of her male fans want to wear  
dresses exactly like hers while cheering her on at the Australian 
Open, that's fine with Mary Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it when guys wear my dress,'' she said after beating  
another fan favorite, Anna Kournikova, in the fourth round Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings good atmosphere to the court, gets the crowd going.  
It's fun,'' Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes she gets just as much fan support in France, she said,  
but ``in France, guys don't wear dresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TALE OF THE TAPE: Known for her involuntary face-pulling and  
other on-court gestures, Mary Pierce has been studying herself in 
action in an effort to iron out some of the idiosyncrasies, for 
which she has received bad press in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched some videos of myself playing, it was a big laugh,''  
said Pierce. A photo in an Australian newspaper illustrated her 
problem. She looked like she was sucking a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have made a big effort to eliminate them. At the beginning  
it was difficult but it gets easier the more you concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPORT FIRST: WTA chief executive officer Bart McGuire is worried  
that the marketing of some women players is more about looks than 
their performance on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in the business of what people in other industries  
call sexploitation,'' McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he made no apology for women tennis players being  
attractive, but he agreed the style of support for players such as 
Russian teen-ager Anna Kournikova could at times be over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, attractive is a much broader word than just physically  
attractive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was important to promote women not just in the sports pages  
to tennis fans, but also to people are interested in attractive, 
articulate, intelligent, talented and successful people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chief Justice Rejects Harkin's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after Monica Lewinsky was interviewed by  
House impeachment prosecutors, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
rejected on Monday a Democratic senator's bid to stop such 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot accede to your request'' to intervene, the chief  
justice said in a letter to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view it is quite debatable whether merely interviewing a  
witness'' would violate impeachment trial rules that require Senate 
approval before witnesses can be required to submit sworn 
statements, Rehnquist said in a letter to Harkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the interview caused an uproar at the Senate trial  
Saturday when independent counsel Kenneth Starr won a federal court 
order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to questioning by his office 
or House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin then wrote a letter to Rehnquist asking him to stop the  
interview on grounds it would violate the Senate's constitutional 
authority to decide how questioning of witnesses would proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist's response Monday said it was ``by no means certain''  
he could issue such an order while the Senate was not in session. 
Even if he could, he said he would use the authority only when 
clearly warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation you pose, in my view, does not meet that  
criterion,'' Rehnquist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors interviewed Ms. Lewinsky for almost two  
hours Sunday in a session they called productive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said she added no new  
information to her previous testimony about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin's spokesman, Patrick Dorton, said the senator believed  
Rehnquist's letter ``underscores the need to clarify ambiguities in 
the Senate rules.''

<HEADLINE> Motion To Dismiss Trial Argued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators struggled with the question of  
witnesses, a senior Democrat today introduced a motion asking the 
Senate to dismiss the charges against President Clinton and end his 
impeachment trial. House prosecutors strongly opposed the idea 
while the president's lawyer declared, ``It is time to end it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in the well of the Senate as the members listened  
intently, prosecutors argued it was wrong to end the trial before 
witnesses were even called. The prosecutors signaled they had 
whittled their proposed list to as few as three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to consider the harm he caused, the indignity he  
brought to the institution of the presidency,'' Rep. Charles Canady 
of Florida said in arguing against the long-anticipated motion by 
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Senate Republicans predicted they had 
enough votes to defeat the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., added his plea that senators not  
end the trial just ``because you do not think there are presently 
enough votes for conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's private lawyers, urged  
senators to dismiss the ``defective'' and ``deeply troubling'' 
impeachment articles accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice and 
perjury. She said Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky did not rise to the level of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We submit to you that the moment has arrived where the best  
interests of the nation, the wise prescription of the framers and 
the failure of the managers' proof all point to dismissal. You have 
listened, you have heard. The case cannot be made. It is time to 
end it,'' Ms. Seligman argued. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that, ``impeachment was never meant to be another  
weapon in the arsenal of partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Byrd made his dismissal motion, Republican Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., declared he had enough GOP votes to defeat it. 
``I think that is a short-circuiting of the process that would not 
be fair. The American people would not agree with that,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Republicans rejected a plan that would have brought the  
trial to an end on Friday with no witnesses. The White House 
criticized that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lott and nine other senators submitted 10 written  
questions to the president. The White House has said Clinton would 
not answer them personally, and spokesman James Kennedy said today 
his lawyers also did not plan to respond to them. 
</P>
<P>
	While not attempting to compel Clinton to answer, the Republican  
senators said in a cover letter that ``only President Clinton can 
provide complete answers to these questions because many of them 
concern his state of mind or facts that only he is privy to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators asked whether Ms. Lewinsky was lying when she  
described certain sexual contacts by the president. They also 
inquired about statements the president made to his secretary and 
his aides, and the retrieval of presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said senators would vote Tuesday or Wednesday on the more  
difficult issue of whether to allow House prosecutors to call 
witnesses. As both sides met in private, Lott declined to predict 
the outcome of that later floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	With all 45 Democratic senators united in opposition to  
witnesses, one Republican senator conceded there could be enough 
GOP defections to defeat the plan. Republicans hold a 55-45 
majority in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote  
for witnesses,'' Smith said on CNN. ``I think there is reason to 
wonder whether or not the votes are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecution team, meanwhile, eliminated from its  
potential witness list a number of women mentioned in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case. Among those dropped: Kathleen Willey, 
who accused the president of making a sexual advance near the Oval 
Office. Former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris also was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	One House official, speaking only on condition of anonymity,  
said the prosecutors may ask for only three witnesses: Monica 
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and one of three others -- presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan, White House aides Sidney Blumenthal and John 
Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel on  
Sunday, and her attorney said afterward she had provided no 
information not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
One of her lawyers made clear today she does not want to testify 
from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered every question they asked,'' attorney Jacob Stein  
said. She now wants to avoid being used in ``what cannot be 
anything but an unseemly circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle had spoken in favor of  
``alternative scenario'' that would scrap the votes on dismissal 
and witnesses. He set out a schedule for final arguments and Senate 
deliberations that would culminate in a vote on the articles of 
impeachment themselves on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of the alternative wasn't completely clear. Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he and GOP Sen. Slade Gorton had 
discussed the idea late last week. Separately, Democrats said they 
had handed it to Lott late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came against the backdrop of a widely held  
belief that Clinton will win acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. A 
two-thirds vote would be required to convict and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the topic dominated senators comments in public.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Grams, R-Minn., sounding a position held by most  
conservative Republicans, said he would be inclined to vote for 
witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said.

<HEADLINE> High Court Takes States Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set the stage Monday for an  
important states' rights ruling, agreeing to decide in a trio of 
cases from Florida and Alabama on whether state employees can file 
age discrimination suits in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether a federal anti-bias law, the Age  
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, wiped out the immunity 
that states and state agencies enjoy, under the 11th Amendment, 
against being sued in federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases will be argued next fall, and a decision is likely  
sometime in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court, ruling jointly on the three cases, said  
the 1967 law cannot be invoked in federal lawsuits against states 
or state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In that same ruling, the appeals court said states and their  
agencies could be forced to defend themselves against federal 
lawsuits involving another anti-bias law, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. Florida officials appealed from that aspect of 
the 11th Circuit court's ruling, but the justices took no action on 
that appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court in 1996 breathed new life into the  
11th Amendment, a longstanding albeit somewhat obscure rallying 
point for advocates of states' rights.. 
</P>
<P>
	In its decision two years ago, the court said Congress may wipe  
out a state's 11th Amendment immunity only when it is going after 
some specific discriminatory harm and when it unequivocally says it 
is targeting that immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	In splintered voting last April, a three-judge panel of the  
Atlanta-based 11th Circuit court relied on those two factors in 
concluding that Congress had trumped states' immunity when it 
enacted the disabilities act but not the age-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the three cases that sparked the appeals court ruling,  
some faculty members at Florida State University and Florida 
International University sued over alleged age discrimination. They 
said illegal bias was why they lost out on certain salary increases 
given to younger faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second case, prison guard Wellington Dickson said he lost  
out on a promotion because of illegal discrimination based on both 
his age and physical disability, a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third case, two associate professors at the state-run  
University of Montevallo in Alabama alleged that they had been 
wronged because younger faculty members were treated more favorably 
when it came to salaries and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th Circuit court's ruling blocked all the age-bias claims  
from being heard in a federal trial court. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to enforce federal civil rights in state courts is  
unclear, and is an issue now before the Supreme Court in a Maine 
case also expected to be decided by late June.

<P>
	SANIBEL, Fla. (AP) -- A city councilman posted Playgirl-style  
photos of himself on the Internet, angering some residents in this 
conservative seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Reding, 44, said he was looking for companionship and  
sees nothing wrong with the photos, which are digitally altered to 
include a strategically placed white square. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should anybody's personal or private life have to be  
exposed just because they're an elected official,'' he said. 
``There are things in everyone's background that are no one's 
business because they have no effect on the job (they) were elected

	Reding said he has received threatening and hateful e-mail since  
the photos became public last week. 
</P>

	Sanibel and his connection to the town are not mentioned on his  
Web page, but some still are not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be something other people do, but when you're in

the average person,'' said Sanibel native Francis Bailey, a former 
councilman and mayor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Welfare Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With welfare rolls at a 30-year low, President  
Clinton today proposed a package of welfare-to-work proposals meant 
to continue that decline. ``It's good for America to do this,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also called for finding ways to reach those welfare  
recipients who have yet to leave the rolls, as new figures released 
today show that task may be getting tougher, at least in a handful 
of states where dramatic declines of recent years have begun to 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
	In his upcoming budget, the president said he will ask Congress  
to extend, and in some cases expand, programs aimed at encouraging 
businesses to hire people off welfare and helping people get to 
those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not charity,'' Clinton said. ``It's good for families,  
but it's also good for the bottom line and good for the 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the administration announced it will seek $1.3  
billion over five years to restore health and disability benefits 
and food stamps for legal immigrants who lost coverage under the 
1996 welfare overhaul. The proposals will be included in the budget 
Clinton sends to Congress Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1996 law, hundreds of thousands of people lost  
benefits, triggering strong protests from states such as California 
and New York with large blocs of immigrants and ethnic voters. The 
administration and Congress restored some benefits in 1997 and 1998 
and is likely to continue again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he also will ask for $1 billion to continue a  
program aimed at long-term welfare recipients and low-income 
fathers, because the ``sense of pride in being able to support a 
child'' that the program has sparked could be the key to moving 
these groups of people off welfare permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at  
the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But state officials and academics alike long have cautioned  
that, at some point, nearly all the people who can move off welfare 
with relative ease will have left. That will leave those with 
deeper problems like substance abuse, domestic violence and very 
little education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're past the situation where someone comes in who may need a  
little bit of confidence building, who may need a brush-up on 
skills and may need a new battery for the car -- all things we can 
do,'' said John Garlinger of the Kansas Department of Social and 
Rehabilitation Services. ``We are left with the hard-core people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since 1993. But  
by the end of the last fiscal year, healthy quarterly drops of 8 
percent to 10 percent fell to just 1.7 percent, according to 
figures being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, at least eight states, most of which have seen  
incredible drops since 1993, saw reductions slow to a trickle in 
July, August and September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference between the first three quarters of the  
year and the last quarter of the year,'' said Michael Kharfen, a 
Department of Health and Human Services spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they are preparing to serve welfare  
recipients with tougher problems, moving beyond the ``work first'' 
approach that helps recipients look for work and then pushes them 
to take any job they can find. 
</P>
<P>
	Under work first, states do not try to solve every problem or  
get people the education they may need. They simply try to find 
them jobs, reasoning that work experience will help them move up 
the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is not enough for everyone, state officials say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that after that wave of families went off the rolls,  
the somewhat harder work would begin,'' said Joe Quinn, spokesman 
for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last quarter  
of fiscal year 1998 after drops of about 9 percent in previous 
quarters, according to figures being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states seeing dropoffs include Arizona, Connecticut,  
Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, after nearly 
cutting its roles in half, actually saw a 40 percent increase 
during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Seasonal variations may explain some of it. In Massachusetts,  
the rolls always stay higher near September, when the state gives 
clothing vouchers for every child on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget request will include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$430 million to give 75,000 housing vouchers that help people  
on welfare move closer to a new job. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million in transportation money to help people get to  
jobs, often in suburbs not served by public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	--$530 million to extend the tax credit for businesses that hire  
people off welfare.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Olympic Leader Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tom Welch, who led Salt Lake's decade-long  
quest for the Olympics, is now being unfairly blamed for its 
excesses in an ungrateful and naive city, says his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't do anything wrong,'' said attorney Tom Schaffer, who  
has begun talking to reporters while advising the former president 
of the bid and organizing committees to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say something is wrong, to me that means there's a  
line over which you are not supposed to go,'' Schaffer said Monday. 
``There was no line. There were no rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer said he would be surprised by any criminal indictment  
of his client. ``I do not believe that anything ... was done with 
criminal intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department investigators looking into the bid have not  
yet contacted or subpoenaed Welch, Schaffer said. Welch has met for 
several hours on two occasions with the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee's ethics panel, but has spoken to no other investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	An International Olympic Committee investigation found Salt  
Lake's bid committee spent nearly $800,000 on 14 IOC members, 
including travel expenses, scholarships for their children, medical 
care and cash payments in the years leading up to the IOC vote 
giving Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC on Sunday ousted six members, including one who alone  
received $216,000 from Salt Lake. It issued a warning to another 
and continues to investigate three others. Three implicated IOC 
members resigned in the week before the meeting, and one died last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
chairman Robert Garff have been decrying the bid committee's lavish 
spending as below the ethical standards of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bid committee members, including former bid committee  
chairman and SLOC President Frank Joklik, say they didn't know 
Welch and his sidekick during the bid, Dave Johnson, were going 
overboard. Welch was SLOC president from 1995 through mid-1997, 
when he resigned amid spouse-abuse allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC board on Jan. 8 took away Welch's $500,000 pension and  
$10,000-per-month consulting contract, forced Johnson to resign as 
senior vice president, and put two other executives on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of several investigations. 
Joklik resigned, but is staying on until his replacement is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the chief IOC investigator said Sunday that the most he  
could say about Salt Lake bidders was they showed an extra 
``willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how you get votes; you make friends,'' Schaffer said.  
</P>
<P>
	`If you want to gain favor with the people who are going to vote  
to bring world recognition to your city, you can't take them to 
McDonald's for lunch,'' he said. ``That's the way it works in the 
corporate world, the same as it works in the international 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are people acting so shocked that simply because it's  
amateur athletics it doesn't have a corporate spin to it? I find 
the naivete to be ridiculous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer also believes Welch and Johnson are being unfairly  
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took two decent men who did what Salt Lake asked them to  
do and now they're turning them into demons,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Tornado Victims Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEEBE, Ark. (AP) -- The same hands that only days before had  
cradled 2-month-old Kirk McAfee now were clasped in prayer as Mike 
Thomas led the infant's graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't but just a little while ago I held him at the  
church, but God took him back,'' said Thomas, pastor of the 16 
Section Union Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas spoke Sunday against a backdrop of daisies, yellow  
carnations and the stark landscape of an Arkansas winter. The 
infant, who was blown out of his grandmother's home when a tornado 
hit Thursday, was among eight to die in Arkansas and Tennessee 
during the furious storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick McKay dug the little boy's grave with a backhoe.  
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to see all these people you haven't seen in such a  
long time, under these circumstances,'' McKay said as roughly 400 
mourners gathered under bright sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	In Searcy, up to 700 people showed up for the funeral of Wanda  
Wilson, 66, who was killed when her mobile home was knocked over by 
a tornado. Three funerals were scheduled for today, and 
arrangements for two others were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents, meanwhile, struggled to clean up their ravaged  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Terry Wheeler stood on the roof of her apartment  
complex while her 2-year-old son played with a rooftop television 
antenna. No one was in danger of falling -- the roof was on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see the houses is just a nightmare, but to see the people  
climb out of them whole and hearty is such a blessing,'' said Robin 
Loucks, another Little Rock resident, who has lived in the city for 
33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beebe, Kelton Keathley recalled surviving by huddling in a  
bathtub with his daughter, her fiance, a friend, his 90-year-old 
grandmother ``and a little old yellow dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winds estimated at 200 mph ripped the walls from the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all raised up and walked off,'' Keathley said. ``The Lord  
had to be looking after us for us to live through that because it's 
not supposed to happen. We should have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksville, Tenn., the city's 19th century Madison Street  
United Methodist Church was among the hardest hit buildings in the 
region -- its sanctuary destroyed and massive twin spires ripped 
nearly in half. The building was on the National Register of 
Historic places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom, this is sad because the church fell down,'' 5-year-old  
Conner Watts wrote -- with his mother's help -- on an index card and 
read aloud during Sunday service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Doug Norfleet kissed the boy on the cheek and told him  
and the hundreds of church members: ``We're gonna rebuild it.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Warming Up for Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Off the top of his head, Bill Bradley can  
think of two reasons why he would be a better candidate for 
president than Al Gore: He can attract independent voters and he 
has a life outside politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Making his first campaign swing through New Hampshire, site of  
the nation's first presidential primary, the former New Jersey 
senator and Hall of Fame basketball player is trying to answer the 
most critical question of his Democratic presidential campaign: Why 
should primary voters side with him, not the vice president? 
</P>
<P>
	``Because they think I would be a better president and would  
have a better chance of winning,'' Bradley said at a Monday news 
conference in Manchester, N.H., to open the three-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore has the power of the White House behind him; he jets  
across the country aboard Air Force Two and enjoys the support of a 
popular president. In New Hampshire, he stuffed mail boxes full of 
Christmas cards and White House invitations, and raised thousands 
of dollars for Democrats who now owe him big. 
</P>
<P>
	So why does Bradley think he would have a better chance than  
Gore of winning the presidency? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in part because I'd be better able to attract  
independents and Republicans in a general election,'' he said. 
Bradley says he proved during 18 years in the Senate that he can 
draw votes from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore might argue that he also can court GOP and independent  
voters, having served a president who forged the party's centrist 
``third way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter; Bradley has other rationale for his candidacy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been a part of the partisanship that has shaped the  
debate the last couple of years,'' Bradley said. Without saying so, 
Bradley was clearly trying to cast himself as the anti-Washington 
Democrat in a race against the son of a Tennessee senator who has 
never wandered too long from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Gore have ``different personal histories,'' the former  
senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was raised in a small Missouri town, earned a Rhodes  
Scholarship, played in the National Basketball Association for 10 
years, served a diverse state in the Senate and left to lecture and 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on the road 30 years in America as senator, a  
basketball player and writer, a lecturer and a businessman. I had a 
life before I got into politics and a life after I left the 
Senate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It all seemed designed to make Gore pale in comparison, but  
Bradley denied any such motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really running against Al Gore, I'm running because of  
what I want to do ... for the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley says he wants to restore integrity to public office,  
``bring out the best in people,'' help troubled children and ease 
economic woes of working families in what he calls this ``age of 
insecurity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has to win first. And most Democratic operatives say his is a  
longshot bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something Bradley should have done six years ago,''  
said consultant Harold Hodes of New Jersey, a longtime Bradley 
backer now in Gore's camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the vice president has not locked anything up. Bradley  
senses an undercurrent of insecurity among voters and a general 
disgust with anything or anybody related to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people see (Bradley) as a good way to change, to  
clean the slate,'' said Jim Gilmour, a Democratic voter interviewed 
over a bagel in nearby Keene, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democratic voter, Frank Shlauter of Keene, said  
Bradley's chances ``will depend on how much heat Gore takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to turn up the heat, especially if no other  
Democrat enters the race. 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief shoot-around with New Hampshire youths Monday,  
the old pro bent his knees and flicked his Hall of Fame wrist to 
send a basketball arcing toward the hoop. He missed his first few 
shots, watching the ball spin off the rim, before finding his 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball ripped through the net with a whisper.  
</P>
<P>
	Swish!  
</P>
<P>
	Swish! Swish!  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while to warm up,'' Bradley said afterward, a  
warning to competitors in basketball and politics alike.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Remember AP Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Myles Tierney, an Associated Press television  
producer shot to death at 34 by rebels in Sierra Leone, lived his 
life with zest, compassion and a drive to tell the story of a 
troubled continent, colleagues said at a memorial service Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Myles understood people in pain,'' said Miguel Gil Moreno de  
Mora, an Associated Press Television News cameraman who worked with 
Tierney in Africa for two years. ``He cared for them because each 
was an individual to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw them as people, not as a story,'' said AP photographer  
David Guttenfelder, who was with Tierney and AP West African Bureau 
Chief Ian Stewart when rebels opened fire on their car in a 
Freetown street on Jan. 10, instantly killing Tierney. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 32, is recovering in London after undergoing two  
operations to repair damage caused when a bullet pierced his brain. 
Though he can't sit or talk yet, AP International Editor Thomas J. 
Kent said, Stewart wrote a note saying he wanted to cover the 
national elections in Nigeria next month. ``It's my turf,'' the 
injured Stewart wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 AP employees and colleagues, friends and family --  
including Tierney's mother, Hanne Tierney-Wang and his father, 
Myles Tierney -- attended the service at the Newseum/NY in 
Manhattan. The service was broadcast over the Internet to AP 
bureaus around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing any of us can say will make sense of this senseless  
killing,'' Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of the AP, told 
mourners. ``But everything we say will show that Myles' journey was 
not in vain. It was an inspiration and it will remain one for 
generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like so many AP people around the world, he braved danger and  
hardship so that the truth might be known,'' said Donald E. 
Newhouse, president of Advance Publications and chairman of AP's 
board of directors, reading from a board resolution. ``We and those 
we serve are in his eternal debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi later introduced a 10-minute video that showed a  
smiling, joking Tierney, both behind the camera and in front of it. 
It showed him clowning with colleagues, riding past refugees on his 
way to a story and talking with heavily armed young men. 
</P>
<P>
	The video was set to Tierney's favorite music, including songs  
by James Brown and Martha &AMP; the Vandellas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil and Guttenfelder, who suffered cuts from flying glass,  
remembered Tierney as a deeply passionate, lovable and irreverent 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the obituary of a fake saint,'' Gil said, telling  
the crowd that Tierney liked his apartment sloppy, his pockets 
empty and both his beer and women plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	But above all else, Gil said, Tierney was ``naturally good.''  
</P>
<P>
	``His approach to his job and generally to his life,'' Gil said,  
``was to serve others. ... He found happiness in making other 
people happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney, a native of Manhattan, joined the AP's television arm  
in 1996, as a free-lance producer in Africa. He helped set up the 
first television bureau in New York but soon longed to return to 
Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Baker, head of news for APTN, said he was reluctant to  
send Tierney back but eventually relented. ``Not only was he the 
best man for the job,'' Baker said, ``colleagues in Africa called 
me to say Myles was the only man for the job. They trusted him with 
their lives in difficult situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Myles got me in and out of some of the most dangerous places  
on earth,'' Gil said. ``Places where only he could get access and 
where I wouldn't go with anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guttenfelder said Tierney's death ``does not change what he  
stood for or diminish his influence across'' Africa, where he was 
known and loved by everyone from hotel clerks to livery drivers to 
heads of state. ``At first they liked him because he was big, 
laughed loudly and he bought them lots of beer,'' Guttenfelder 
said. But he soon proved himself by going ``right up to the front, 
where the rest of the world was fleeing, where the bad guys were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Africans struggling through war or famine, ``the people with  
the cameras are often the last hope. They think that if they could 
only talk about their suffering, the world would rush to help them. 
Myles understood this role very well,'' Guttenfelder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Urschel, senior vice president of the Freedom Forum and  
president of the Newseum, said Tierney's name will be added to a 
memorial in Washington honoring journalists killed while covering 
stories. The names of 99 journalists will be added to the 934 
existing names in a rededication service in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The memorial is a sobering reminder that in many parts of the  
world today, journalism remains a dangerous profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney's photograph will also be added to the AP's Wall of  
Honor at its world headquarters in New York. Tierney was the 24th 
journalist to die in the line of duty in the organization's 
150-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney's sister, Loren Tierney Mumford, said her family feels  
``incredibly lucky in the midst of this horrendous pain that we got 
to see Myles realize himself so fully and so gloriously in a way 
that so few people get to do, no matter how old they live to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She then dedicated a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay to her  
brother, but not before revealing another flash of Tierney's 
irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was 8, she said, he invented a middle name for himself  
because he didn't have one. It stuck and soon became part of family 
lore. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I'd like to dedicate the following lines to my brother --  
Myles Green Hornet Tierney,'' she said before reading and 
struggling through tears with Millay's lines: 
</P>
<P>
	``My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night;  
</P>
<P>
	``But ah, my foes, oh, my friends -- It gives a lovely light.''

<HEADLINE> Study Shows U.S. Ecosystem Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Scientists have long known that foreign  
plants and animals are damaging various parts of the U.S. 
ecosystem. They just didn't know it's costing the nation about $123 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by David Pimentel, an ecologist at Cornell University,  
estimates that alien weeds such as purple loosestrife are costing 
Americans $35.5 billion annually, insects like fire ants are 
costing $20 billion more and disease-causing organisms are costing 
$6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining economic costs are spread over causes ranging from  
rats and plant diseases to non-native fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take many troublemakers to cause tremendous  
damage,'' Pimentel told The Oregonian in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even animals as familiar as dogs and cats cause huge problems.  
The nation's 63 million domestic cats and 30 million feral cats are 
estimated to kill about 200 million birds each year -- birds that 
would otherwise eat many insect pests. 
</P>
<P>
	At an estimated $30 per pest-eating bird, that amounts to $6  
billion in damage by cats alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dog bites send 800,000 people to emergency rooms annually,  
resulting in about $30 million in medical costs. Wild dogs running 
in packs in Florida, Texas and other states cause an estimated $10 
million a year in livestock losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gypsy moths, elm disease, fire ants and zebra mussels also are  
among other damaging organisms listed in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study confirmed what many Oregon ranchers, farmers and  
fishermen already feared. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state that stretches from ocean to desert, and relies on  
agriculture as its largest single industry, the threat from 
non-native plants and animals is serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful loosestrife takes over native aquatic species in  
wetlands and along streams, removing hiding cover and food for 
birds and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheatgrass on rangelands accelerates the spread and frequency of  
wildfires. Bullfrogs are killing off native turtle species, and the 
green crabs pose a threat to clams, oysters and Dungeness crabs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the economic costs, Pimentel said, nonindigenous  
species are responsible for more than 40 percent of the plants and 
animals that are on the nation's endangered or threatened list. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Pimentel points out that 98 percent of the nation's food  
supply comes from introduced species such as wheat, rice, domestic 
cattle and poultry. Those have a value of about $500 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimentel reported his findings Sunday at the annual meeting of  
the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Anaheim, 
Calif., where he urged policy-makers to devote more resources to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too late to send these organisms back,'' Pimentel said.  
``We will be lucky to control further damage to natural and managed 
ecosystems.''

<HEADLINE> Bears Go With Coach Choice No. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Don't blame Dick Jauron if he's the  
only one in the Chicago Bears' organization not wringing his hands 
over the Dave McGinnis debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Jauron got his first head coaching job out of the  
mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``To want something as badly as we wanted this job, and then  
feel like you're out of it and then suddenly to have an 
opportunity, was very exciting and very draining,'' Jauron said 
Sunday after he was introduced as the new coach. ``I can't tell you 
how good it feels to stand here in front of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Probably about as good as the Bears felt to put the disaster of  
the last 48 hours behind them. The Bears were all set to name 
McGinnis, Arizona's defensive coordinator and a former Chicago 
assistant, as the new head coach Friday, even sending out faxes 
with the announcement and adding him to the team's voice mail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	There was just one problem: McGinnis hadn't even been offered  
the job yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Furious over the premature announcement, he broke off talks and  
decided Saturday the job wasn't for him. That left team president 
Michael McCaskey with an image problem and a coaching vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	By hiring Jauron, Jacksonville's defensive coordinator the past  
four seasons, McCaskey took care of both problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over and done with,'' said Mark Hatley, the team's vice  
president of player personnel who conducted the initial search for 
a new coach. ``I'm excited to have Dick here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron replaces Dave Wannstedt, fired four weeks ago. Terms of  
his multi-year contract were not disclosed. Jauron's hiring also 
closes out an active offseason in which nine NFL teams -- including 
the expansion Cleveland Browns -- had openings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Bears-McGinnis disaster, Jauron said he didn't have  
reservations about taking the job. An assistant for 14 years, he 
wanted to make the jump to head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any control over that situation. It was between  
Dave and the organization,'' Jauron said of the breakdown with 
McGinnis. ``The only thing I wanted to know was where it stood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey said he wanted to talk to a few more people, and then  
he began calling Jauron's friends and former bosses. Mike Holmgren 
had good things to say. So did Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, who worked with Jauron when  
they were assistants under Holmgren in Green Bay, even called from 
Mexico to put in a good word. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to them about Dick's credentials and readiness to  
be a head coach, they couldn't have been more enthusiastic,'' said 
McCaskey, who looked visibly relieved. ``It's the right time and 
he's the right guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron said he's not worried about a backlash from fans who see  
him as the second choice. The Bears have had three straight losing 
seasons, and haven't made the playoffs or sent a player to the Pro 
Bowl since 1994. There were 26,000 no-shows for a home game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jauron can get the Bears winning again, no one's going to  
care if he was the second, third or 10th choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one promise that I will make is that we'll do everything  
we can to be a winner here. Again,'' he said. ``Because this is one 
of the winningest franchises in all of professional sports and one 
of the ones that has the most glorious history of any franchise in 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me great pride to be here.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, 48, was drafted by the Detroit Lions out of Yale in  
1973. As a rookie, he started at strong safety against the Bears 
and intercepted three passes, returning one for a touchdown. His 
167 interception return yards are still a record for a Bears 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Lions waived him in 1978, he was picked up by the  
Cincinnati Bengals and stayed with them until suffering a knee 
injury in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his coaching career in 1985 with the Buffalo Bills, and  
moved to Green Bay the next season. He stayed in Green Bay for nine 
years until Coughlin made him the expansion Jaguars' defensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you get a chance to take over a lot of teams  
that are doing well,'' Jauron said. ``It isn't going to be easy, 
but it's going to be a great challenge.''

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Tornado Victims Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEEBE, Ark. (AP) -- The same hands that only days before had  
cradled 2-month-old Kirk McAfee now were clasped in prayer as Mike 
Thomas led the infant's graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't but just a little while ago I held him at the  
church, but God took him back,'' said Thomas, pastor of the 16 
Section Union Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas spoke Sunday against a backdrop of daisies, yellow  
carnations and the stark landscape of an Arkansas winter. The 
infant, who was blown out of his grandmother's home when a tornado 
hit Thursday, was among eight to die in Arkansas and Tennessee 
during the furious storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick McKay dug the little boy's grave with a backhoe.  
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to see all these people you haven't seen in such a  
long time, under these circumstances,'' McKay said as roughly 400 
mourners gathered under bright sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	In Searcy, up to 700 people showed up for the funeral of Wanda  
Wilson, 66, who was killed when her mobile home was knocked over by 
a tornado. Three funerals were scheduled for today, and 
arrangements for two others were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents, meanwhile, struggled to clean up their ravaged  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Terry Wheeler stood on the roof of her apartment  
complex while her 2-year-old son played with a rooftop television 
antenna. No one was in danger of falling -- the roof was on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see the houses is just a nightmare, but to see the people  
climb out of them whole and hearty is such a blessing,'' said Robin 
Loucks, another Little Rock resident, who has lived in the city for 
33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beebe, Kelton Keathley recalled surviving by huddling in a  
bathtub with his daughter, her fiance, a friend, his 90-year-old 
grandmother ``and a little old yellow dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winds estimated at 200 mph ripped the walls from the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all raised up and walked off,'' Keathley said. ``The Lord  
had to be looking after us for us to live through that because it's 
not supposed to happen. We should have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksville, Tenn., the city's 19th century Madison Street  
United Methodist Church was among the hardest hit buildings in the 
region -- its sanctuary destroyed and massive twin spires ripped 
nearly in half. The building was on the National Register of 
Historic places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom, this is sad because the church fell down,'' 5-year-old  
Conner Watts wrote -- with his mother's help -- on an index card and 
read aloud during Sunday service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Doug Norfleet kissed the boy on the cheek and told him  
and the hundreds of church members: ``We're gonna rebuild it.''

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Posts 27 Percent Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest banking  
company, posted a fourth-quarter operating profit that beat Wall 
Street's expectations even though it was 27 percent below results a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Steep declines in Latin America and investment banking offset  
strong performance in credit cards and consumer lending. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's profits totaled $1.4 billion, or 60 cents a share,  
topping analysts' average estimate of 56 cents a share. The New 
York financial services company reported operating income of $1.9 
billion, or 80 cents a share, in the fourth quarter 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating numbers released today don't include one-time  
charges related to the merger between Citibank and Travelers Group, 
as well severance costs for the elimination of 10,400 jobs 
announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Including those expenses, Citigroup posted net income of $677  
million, or 28 cents a share, down from $1.4 billion, or 59 cents a 
share, for the last three months of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, who share the titles of  
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement said the bank 
had made substantial progress since Citibank and Travelers combined 
their operations three months ago, but said they are not satisfied 
with the company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to achieving significantly higher levels of  
profitability in 1999 and beyond through a combination of business 
growth, stringent expense control, and continued reduction of risk 
exposure,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's stock rose quickly after the opening bell on the New  
York Stock Exchange, and was up $1.06 1/4 at $52.68 3/4 a share in early 
afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, said expenses rose faster than revenues in  
the quarter because of the $650 million needed to fix the Year 2000 
bugs in its computers, as well as changes to its foreign currency 
department to handle the euro, the new, single European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America was also a trouble spot for Citigroup. Profits  
from the area were cut by almost half because of a drop in business 
at Credicard, its Brazilian card affiliate, together with weaker 
credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's Internet banking division, e-Citi, is still losing  
money. In the last three months of 1998, e-Citi lost $43 million as 
the company spent heavily to perfect its technology and increase 
its customer research. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, the New York-based bank reported operating  
profits of $6.3 billion, or $2.66 a share, compared with $7.8 
billion, or $3.18 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time charges, net income totaled $5.8 billion,  
or $2.43 a share, down from $6.7 billion, or $2.74 a share in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Dominates All-Stars Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky got another car, Ken Hitchcock  
finally got a victory and the NHL got the kind of All-Star game it 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition-wise, it was up there,'' coach Lindy Ruff said  
Sunday after his World team lost 8-6 to North America in the 49th 
NHL All-Star game. ``I think they competed at the level they want 
to in this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star-studded midseason game, as usual, produced a lot of  
goal. Gretzky was in the middle of things again with a goal and two 
assists, earning him the All-Star MVP trophy for the third time and 
the car that goes with it -- in this case, a sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it,'' Gretzky said. ``I got a car. How many people go  
to Tampa and get a new car? It was a wonderful weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock also had a great time, finally coaching an All-Star  
team to victory. He was on the losing end as head coach of the 
Western Conference in 1997 and the World All-Stars in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the real winner was the NHL, which has tried to find  
a format to make the games more competitive and more compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wasn't worried about all the goals being scored in  
the '90s -- in fact, NHL officials felt that more scoring would 
spark more interest from the casual fan. The NHL just didn't want 
onesided blowouts like the 16-6 victory for the Wales Conference 
over the Campbell at Montreal in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With the North America team facing a squad of Europeans, the NHL  
might have hit on something. Last season, it was a one-goal game as 
North America beat the World team 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sunday night, both coaches thought the game was just as  
competitive -- even more so, in Hitchcock's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's game was better than last year,'' Hitchcock said.  
``If there's a way we can do this, whether it's East, West, 
whatever, you want the game to be as competitive as it can. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a showcase for our sport. Whatever way we can do it is  
great. But the players are into this. I saw it World side and now I 
see it North American side. They're having fun with this format, so 
why change it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that didn't change was the style of the game,  
which is considerably more wide open than the defensive-minded 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	At the halfway mark, the league was averaging about 5.3 goals a  
game, reflecting a steady decline in scoring during the '90s. That 
hasn't been a problem in All-Star games. The previous nine averaged 
16.5 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was business as usual Sunday, with 14 different players  
scoring and goaltenders anxious to get out of the line of fire. 
Except for Phoenix's Nikolai Khabibulin, who took over in the third 
period and played like something was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was -- his pride.  
</P>
<P>
	`I think goalies take it more seriously than the players on  
defense because you don't want to get embarrassed,'' Khabibulin 
said. ``I mean, you're supposed to take it -- you're supposed to 
think, well, if they score, it's OK. You don't want to get six 
goals scored against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khabibulin was the best goaltender on the ice, stopping 14 of 15  
shots in the third period as the World outscored North America 2-1 
in the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the goaltenders had their problems, including  
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, called the best player in the NHL by 
Gretzky. He faced 19 shots in the first and gave up goals by Mike 
Modano, Luc Robitaille, Paul Kariya and Mark Recchi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went wild,'' said Modano, who had a goal and three  
assists. ``Guys were scoring when you gave it to them. It was nice 
to have some fun out there.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Face Crucial Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With House prosecutors intent on bringing  
Monica Lewinsky to the well of the Senate, senators faced crucial 
votes that abruptly could end the trial or prolong it indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators sitting in judgment of President Clinton agreed Sunday  
that the 67 votes needed to remove him from office are not there. 
They also said they are seeking a way for graceful exit from the 
yearlong scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote this week to allow witnesses, if it fails, could set the  
stage for a final vote on conviction or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.''  
said Sen. Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today she  
is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made that 
decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., also on ABC, said deciding  
against witnesses would allow the Senate to end the trial this 
week. ``Ninety senators have asked 104 questions over two days,'' 
he said. ``There is a growing sense ... that we have enough to make 
the fundamental decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to  
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that the former White House intern did not want and that Senate 
Democrats denounced as an act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts for the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors met for nearly two hours with Ms.  
Lewinsky and her lawyer at the upscale Mayflower Hotel about six 
blocks from the White House. The meeting took place after 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, citing the immunity agreement 
she signed with his office, on Saturday obtained a court order 
requiring her attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found her to be a very personable and impressive young  
woman, and we found that she might be a very helpful witness to the 
Senate if she is called,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said his client had  
been ``extremely truthful'' but said: ``She added nothing to the 
record that is already sitting before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She should not be called to testify, Cacheris said, ``because  
all of her testimony is fully and completely disclosed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Starr watched, said Rep. Asa Hutchinson's 
spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of the 
interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and the entire 
session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors insisted that witnesses were needed to prove  
their case that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in 
trying to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	They said witnesses could clear up contradictions arising in the  
first eight days of the trial, such as who initiated the 
concealment of gifts Clinton gave to Ms. Lewinsky and whether there 
was a tacit understanding that she would lie in the Paula Jones 
case to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats warned that witnesses could extend the trial for  
months and several Republicans said they were skeptical of the need 
for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do proceed (with witnesses), we want to make sure that  
it doesn't turn out to be `The Jerry Springer Show,''' Snowe said 
on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Before moving to the witness issue, the Senate was expected  
today to take up a motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss 
the case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, a stickler for maintaining Senate traditions, has been  
strongly critical of the president's behavior. His decision to come 
out against removal from office was a blow to Republicans who had 
hoped he would be the catalyst for a Democratic shift against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House lawyers and the House prosecutors each have an  
hour to speak on dismissal. Senators then may call a break in the 
trial to debate the issue, either in open or closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the trial would take up the question of whether to depose  
witnesses, the first step to live testimony, before voting on 
dismissal and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors also were expected to make public their  
proposed list of witnesses. It likely would include Clinton's 
friend Vernon Jordan and his personal secretary Betty Curry and 
other White House officials as well as Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris also was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators Sunday. He said he 
was asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky 
scandal was breaking a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who hold a 55-45 majority in the House, appeared  
solidly against dismissal, and some Democrats agreed that it was 
more appropriate to end the trial with a straight vote on the 
charges. With acquittal, the next question would be whether to 
write a censure resolution condemning Clinton for the affair.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Groups To Boycott Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Privacy groups are urging a boycott of all  
products from Intel Corp. in a dispute over new technology that 
allows consumers to be identified as they move across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups planned to announce the boycott today, effective  
until the company agrees to disable the new technology in its 
upcoming line of Pentium III computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even the tamest privacy advocate has failed to condemn  
it,'' said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Inc. of Green 
Brook, N.J., which lobbies on a range of high-tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales  
last year, announced last week that its new chip, to be sold within 
months, will by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and across the Internet to help verify the identity of 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the feature offers a boon for electonic  
commerce, allowing companies and shoppers to feel more secure in 
the transmission of data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its technology is needed to encourage trust in  
Internet sales and also can be used to avoid piracy by preventing a 
single copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But privacy advocates are worried: ``It allows a massive profile  
to be efficiently collected and sold,'' Catlett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Junkbusters organized the boycott with the Washington-based  
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said late Sunday that the company  
has been in talks about its technology for several weeks with 
Junkbusters, and had meetings planned this week with both privacy 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulloy said it would be ``difficult to tell'' the potential  
impact of any boycott of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to making about 85 percent of the world's computer  
processors, Intel also manufactures memory chips plus hardware for 
computer networks, communications and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Catlett called the Pentium III chips that already have been  
produced ``toxic hardware.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should destroy them,'' Catlett said.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of their boycott, organizers intend to unveil a parody  
of the company's ubiquitous ``Intel Inside'' logo. Theirs features 
the same familiar swirl but with the words, ``Big Brother Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., urged Intel on Friday to  
reconsider its plans, ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' Markey is the senior Democrat on the House 
consumer protection subcommittee and active in Internet privacy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement comes at an awkward time for the Clinton  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of state for commerce, was to begin  
negotiations today in Europe -- the same day as the boycott 
announcement -- over a tough new privacy law enacted by the 
15-nation European Union last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron must assure Europeans that the United States has adequate  
privacy protections or risk a prohibition against businesses in 
those 15 countries from disclosing personal information about 
citizens there to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have come at a worse time,'' Catlett said. ``This  
new feature from Intel is really throwing kerosene on the fire of 
the trans-Atlantic privacy negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron warned last week that such a ban would carry ``a very  
adverse impact on the operation of the economies on both sides of 
the Atlantic and could be a very serious blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Privacy Information Center said it will meet  
later this week with the Federal Trade Commission to discuss 
Intel's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has criticized the online industry for its failure to  
protect privacy rights. Last year, the agency successfully pressed 
for a new law that prohibits Web sites from collecting personal 
information from children without parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the FTC also is suing Intel for alleged  
antitrust violations. The trial is set to begin March 9.

<HEADLINE> Kutcher Got New Look for TV Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMANA, Iowa (AP) -- Ashton Kutcher liked the retro look better  
when it was his choice instead of his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutcher, one of the stars of Fox's ``That '70's Show,'' said he  
wore bell bottoms and polyester shirts when he was a model in New 
York. But when he got the job playing Michael Kelso -- a big, dumb 
guy with puka shell necklaces -- he had to change his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to have a different identity than my character, so I  
couldn't wear them any more. I had to buy new clothes. I was kind 
of bummed about that,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutcher, 20, who went to high school in Amana, recalls his jobs  
sweeping up dust at the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and 
working at local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	His Iowa background has made him less tolerant of people he  
meets who grew up in Hollywood's decidedly showier lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're making umpteen thousand dollars a week and they're not  
happy with it,'' he said. ``I'm like, `How can you not be happy?' I 
mean, I was never able to buy a new car. I washed dishes in a 
kitchen in Homestead. I worked in a butcher shop skinning deer, 
jobs like that. You can't believe how ungrateful people can be.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from President Clinton's impeachment trial in the  
Senate on Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate closed its doors to debate an effort by Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss all charges against Clinton and bring his 
impeachment trial to an end. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
claimed enough votes to quash the attempt, and no Democrat disputed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	--By 57-43, the Senate rejected an effort by Democratic Sens. Tom  
Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota to open the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Earlier in open session, House prosecutors pressed their case  
for testimony by Monica Lewinsky and shortened their list of 
witnesses to Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton secretary Betty Currie and a 
third person yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	--The White House announced it would ignore a list of written  
questions submitted by Lott and other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least one stab at bipartisanship was made during the day, as  
GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas met with Democratic Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts on a possible agreement to limit witnesses 
who would be questioned in private before a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	--Republicans ``summarily rejected'' a Democratic proposal to  
bring the trial to an end by Friday with a vote on the articles of 
impeachment themselves. That would have ended any chance of 
witnesses appearing.

<HEADLINE>  Motion To Dismiss Trial Argued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators struggled with the question of  
witnesses, a senior Democrat today introduced a motion asking the 
Senate to dismiss the charges against President Clinton and end his 
impeachment trial. House prosecutors strongly opposed the idea 
while the president's lawyer declared, ``It is time to end it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in the well of the Senate as the members listened  
intently, prosecutors argued it was wrong to end the trial before 
witnesses were even called. The prosecutors signaled they had 
whittled their proposed list to as few as three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to consider the harm he caused, the indignity he  
brought to the institution of the presidency,'' Rep. Charles Canady 
of Florida said in arguing against the long-anticipated motion by 
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Senate Republicans predicted they had 
enough votes to defeat the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., added his plea that senators not  
end the trial just ``because you do not think there are presently 
enough votes for conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's private lawyers, urged  
senators to dismiss the ``defective'' and ``deeply troubling'' 
impeachment articles accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice and 
perjury. She said Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky did not rise to the level of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We submit to you that the moment has arrived where the best  
interests of the nation, the wise prescription of the framers and 
the failure of the managers' proof all point to dismissal. You have 
listened, you have heard. The case cannot be made. It is time to 
end it,'' Ms. Seligman argued. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that, ``impeachment was never meant to be another  
weapon in the arsenal of partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Byrd made his dismissal motion, Republican Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., declared he had enough GOP votes to defeat it. 
``I think that is a short-circuiting of the process that would not 
be fair. The American people would not agree with that,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Republicans rejected a plan that would have brought the  
trial to an end on Friday with no witnesses. The White House 
criticized that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lott and nine other senators submitted 10 written  
questions to the president. The White House has said Clinton would 
not answer them personally, and spokesman James Kennedy said today 
his lawyers also did not plan to respond to them. 
</P>
<P>
	While not attempting to compel Clinton to answer, the Republican  
senators said in a cover letter that ``only President Clinton can 
provide complete answers to these questions because many of them 
concern his state of mind or facts that only he is privy to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators asked whether Ms. Lewinsky was lying when she  
described certain sexual contacts by the president. They also 
inquired about statements the president made to his secretary and 
his aides, and the retrieval of presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said senators would vote Tuesday or Wednesday on the more  
difficult issue of whether to allow House prosecutors to call 
witnesses. As both sides met in private, Lott declined to predict 
the outcome of that later floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	With all 45 Democratic senators united in opposition to  
witnesses, one Republican senator conceded there could be enough 
GOP defections to defeat the plan. Republicans hold a 55-45 
majority in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote  
for witnesses,'' Smith said on CNN. ``I think there is reason to 
wonder whether or not the votes are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecution team, meanwhile, eliminated from its  
potential witness list a number of women mentioned in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case. Among those dropped: Kathleen Willey, 
who accused the president of making a sexual advance near the Oval 
Office. Former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris also was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	One House official, speaking only on condition of anonymity,  
said the prosecutors may ask for only three witnesses: Monica 
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and one of three others -- presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan, White House aides Sidney Blumenthal and John 
Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel on  
Sunday, and her attorney said afterward she had provided no 
information not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
One of her lawyers made clear today she does not want to testify 
from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered every question they asked,'' attorney Jacob Stein  
said. She now wants to avoid being used in ``what cannot be 
anything but an unseemly circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle had spoken in favor of  
``alternative scenario'' that would scrap the votes on dismissal 
and witnesses. He set out a schedule for final arguments and Senate 
deliberations that would culminate in a vote on the articles of 
impeachment themselves on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of the alternative wasn't completely clear. Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he and GOP Sen. Slade Gorton had 
discussed the idea late last week. Separately, Democrats said they 
had handed it to Lott late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came against the backdrop of a widely held  
belief that Clinton will win acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. A 
two-thirds vote would be required to convict and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the topic dominated senators comments in public.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Grams, R-Minn., sounding a position held by most  
conservative Republicans, said he would be inclined to vote for 
witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said.

witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said.

<HEADLINE> Eli Lilly Reaches Prozac Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. and three generic drug  
companies reached a partial settlement of their patent dispute 
involving the antidepressant Prozac, and sent their broader 
disagreement to a federal appeals court in hopes of resolving the 
issue by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced today came in the suit involving Lilly  
and Barr Laboratories, Geneva Pharmaceuticals and Apotex Inc.,which 
have sought to make a generic form of the widely-prescribed drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly agreed to drop claims of willful infringement against the  
three companies, which will share a $4 million payment from Lilly 
for reimbursement of legal expenses and costs related to the 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	By dropping these claims, Lilly was allowing the case to proceed  
to the U.S. Court of Appeals which is now expected to hear the case 
in early 2000.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Giants Scout Hartsfield Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSWELL, Ga. (AP) -- Bob ``Poochie'' Hartsfield, the former  
coordinator of scouting for the San Francisco Giants, died Monday 
following a lengthy kidney illness. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as the Giants' coordinator from 1993-97 and was a  
special assignment scout for the team last year. Living in the 
Atlanta suburb of Woodstock, Hartsfield frequently scouted the 
Atlanta Braves and their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The San Francisco Giants are deeply saddened by the news of  
Bob's passing,'' said Giants senior vice president and general 
manager Brian Sabean. ``Baseball had been his life, and we're all 
going to miss him. He was an outstanding scout and baseball man for 
so many years, but more importantly, he was an outstanding person, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His baseball career spanned 48 years. A former infielder, he  
spent 11 years in the organizations of the Milwaukee-Atlanta Braves 
and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He became a scout in 1963 with the 
Chicago Cubs after a knee injury ended his playing career. 
</P>
<P>
	His career also included managerial stints in the minor leagues  
in the Giants, Houston and Seattle organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartsfield also was a college basketball official for 25 years,  
working for the Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, Metro, Sun Belt and 
Ohio Valley conferences. He also worked three NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his widow, Sandy, and a brother, Roy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Say Iraq Provoked Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American officials said today a U.S. attack on  
an air defense installation in southern Iraq was in response to 
Iraqi provocations, but they could not immediately refute Iraq's 
claim that American missiles struck residential areas, killing 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday said,  
``We're still assessing the site damage'' and cannot say whether 
civilians were hit because ``we don't have any details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Richard Bridges, also a Pentagon spokesman, said there  
was no initial indication that the U.S. planes hit anything other 
than their intended military targets. He said a damage assessment 
was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the Iraqi claim that civilian sites were hit, Sen.  
John McCain, R-Ariz., said, ``To just react to a (surface-to-air 
missile) site is just damn foolishness. Go after command control.'' 
McCain said he had no specific information that command operations 
had been targeted in the latest U.S. action but was to be briefed 
by the Pentagon later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In a busy day over the skies of Iraq, U.S. planes fired on Iraqi  
air defense sites in both northern and southern Iraq. In at least 
one case in the north, Iraq fired a surface-to-air missile at a 
U.S. plane but missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial attacks were northwest of Basra, in southern Iraq,  
where U.S. Air Force and Navy jets fired at an Iraqi surface-to-air 
missile site and ``associated, integrated air-defense systems,'' 
according to a statement from U.S. Central Command headquarters in 
Tampa, Fla., which is in charge of all American forces in the 
Persian Gulf area. The American planes launched their missiles ``in 
response to Iraqi incursions in the no-fly zone,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency reported that civil defense teams  
ferried wounded Iraqis to hospitals and tried to recover bodies 
from the rubble of buildings. A Western reporter in Basra said he 
saw a house that was completely destroyed and three others that 
were damaged. He said he was taken to a hospital where he saw 
severely injured children. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnery Sgt. Frank Leyhew, a Central Command spokesman, said the  
U.S. jets were threatened by Iraqi ground artillery and four Iraqi 
MiG fighters flying in the southern ``no-fly'' zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours later, at about 2 p.m. Iraq time (5 a.m. EST),  
U.S. aircraft patrolling the ``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq 
were targeted and fired upon by at least one Iraqi surface-to-air 
missile and by antiaircraft artillery near the city of Mosel, Lt. 
Col. Jane Rinell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rinell, spokesman for Operation Northern Watch based at Incirlik  
Air Base in Turkey, said that after an Air Force F-15E strike 
aircraft encountered anti-aircraft artillery fire, two other F-15Es 
dropped one laser-guided bomb each on the air defense system. The 
U.S. planes operate from Incirlik. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident near Mosul, a Marine Corps EA-6B  
electronic warfare plane fired a missile at an Iraqi SA-2 
surface-to-air missile installation that ``posed a threat'' to U.S. 
and allied aircraft, Rinell said. Afterward, an Air Force F-16CJ 
plane attacked a different SA-2 surface-to-air missile site that 
also was deemed to pose a threat, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	An assessment of the strikes in the north were under way,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of today's incidents the American airplanes returned  
safely to their bases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. warplanes patrolling the ``no-fly'' zones have been firing  
missiles regularly at Iraqi air defense positions in response to 
being locked onto by radar from the military positions.

<HEADLINE> Rare Closed-Door Session for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two weeks of silence, senators finally  
got their turn to speak Monday at President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. But they chose to do it behind closed doors, rejecting by a 
largely party-line vote a Democratic move to keep the proceedings 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to block a closed session while the Senate debated a  
motion to dismiss the impeachment articles was rejected on a 43-57 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that point, all proceedings in the first two weeks of the  
trial had been open and televised. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators debated in secret a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd,  
D-W.Va., to dismiss the impeachment articles and to end the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The public and news media were ordered to leave the galleries,  
the doors were locked, and the Senate-run television cameras were 
shut off after the Senate rejected the motion by Sens. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to keep the session open. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin and Wellstone complained about the vote, and said they  
would make the same motion every time in the remainder of the 
impeachment case -- assuming the motion to dismiss isn't approved -- 
that the Senate prepares to go into closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on dangerous, dangerous ground,'' Harkin told reporters  
afterwards at an impromptu news conference in front of the main 
doors of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame the public's not invited. The microphones in the  
chamber were paid for by the American people, to paraphrase Ronald 
Reagan,'' said Harkin, referring to a comment Reagan made during a 
1980 primary debate in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine, Kay Bailey Hutchison  
of Texas and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- broke with colleagues 
to join 40 Democrats in voting for the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	But five Democrats -- Max Baucus of Montana, Robert C. Byrd of  
West Virginia, Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkanas, Jay Rockefeller of 
West Virginia and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland -- voted with 52 
majority-party Republicans. Republicans control the chamber 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing of the Senate came as part of the Senate's  
impeachment rules, which provides that ``debate by senators on any 
question is not allowed in open session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Harkin and Wellstone would have sidestepped that  
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that point, the trial had consisted of arguments by the  
two opposing legal teams -- House prosecutors and White House 
defenders -- as well as a question-and-answer period in while 
senators submitted questions in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were prohibited from speaking during these earlier  
phases on threat of imprisonment, according to the rule read at the 
start of each day's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate only rarely has closed-door sessions, and in recent  
times they have almost always dealt with national security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The last closed-door session was April 24, 1997, when the Senate  
debated a chemical weapons treaty, according to Donald Ritchie, the 
associate Senate historian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until 1929, the Senate used to discuss all treaties and  
nominations in closed sessions,'' Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed sessions, however, have been routinely held in  
impeachment proceedings against federal judges. The most recent was 
Nov. 2, 1989, in the impeachment trial of Judge Walter Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	In Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial -- the only previous trial  
of a president -- some of the sessions ``were closed, and some of 
them were open,'' Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the 100 senators, members of both legal teams were  
permitted to attend the closed session. And Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist remained in the chair as the presiding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A transcript was being made, but kept confidential, said Senate  
Historian Richard Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rule dealing with closed-door sessions proclaims:  
``Any senator or officer of the Senate who shall disclose the 
secret or confidential business or proceedings of the Senate shall 
be liable, if a senator, to suffer expulsion from the body; and if 
an officer, to dismissal from the service of the Senate, and to 
punishment for contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin called the Senate vote, ``one that will live in infamy.  
The American people need to have the right to know how and why we 
reach the decisions we do with regards to this impeachment trial. 
Closing the doors I believe is an affront to every American 
taxpayer in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His motion to open the proceedings was not debatable.  
</P>
<P>
	Once Rehnquist ordered the Senate proceedings closed, extra  
armed police officers took their posts at all the entrances to the 
Senate and its galleries.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G's Earnings Up 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s earnings increased 9  
percent during its second fiscal quarter as the consumer product 
company's worldwide sales were up 3 percent. The results matched 
Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were $1.14 billion, or 78  
cents per share, on sales of $9.93 billion, the company report 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First  
Call. 
</P>
<P>
	For the same quarter a year ago, earnings totaled $1.05 billion,  
or 71 cents per share, on sales of $9.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaker currencies, primarily in Asia and Latin America, reduced  
sales by 1 percent during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, earnings totaled $2.31 billion, or $1.58 per  
share, on sales of $19.4 billion. A year ago, earnings were $2.13 
billion, or $1.44 per share, on sales of $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells about 300 product brands in more than 140  
countries. These brands include Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, 
Pantene Pro-V shampoo, Pringles snack chips and Pampers disposable 
diapers. P&AMP;G employs more than 110,000 employees worldwide.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Sinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Stocks traded by foreign investors  
plunged Monday, led by heavy declines in the Hong Kong stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which often heavily influences  
mainland trading sentiment, closed 2.5 percent lower at 9,499.50. 
The index was as much as 4.2 percent lower at midday, amid 
speculation that Beijing might be considering a devaluation of the 
Chinese yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Chinese leaders have promised not to devalue the yuan in the  
near future. The semi-convertible currency is backed by large 
foreign exchange reserves, a strong balance of payments and 
substantial foreign direct investment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the recent devaluation of the Brazilian real has  
prompted concerns. On Sunday, an official Chinese newspaper 
published comments by an economist who said ``devaluation or 
floating of the renminbi (yuan) would not definitely be a bad 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several times last week, top officials restated the Chinese  
government's resolve to keep the yuan's value stable. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, the Shanghai exchange's Class B-share index was off  
0.56 point, or 2.2 percent. In Shenzhen, meanwhile, the B-share 
index shed 1.50 point, or 3.2 percent. B shares are technically 
reserved for overseas investors, but are also traded by local 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yuan strengthened Monday against the U.S. dollar,  
ending the day at 8.2783 per U.S. dollar, a slight rise from last 
week's final quote of 8.2788 yuan and its strongest level since the 
end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the yuan was being bolstered by strong capital  
inflows due to the country's massive trade surplus and foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central bank was watching the market closely, but wasn't  
actively buying or selling dollars, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Hit-Man Atwater Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- His chronically sore shoulders are a testament to  
the intimidating hits he has delivered to wide receivers and 
running backs for the past 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 total tackles ... 12 forced fumbles ... 24  
interceptions ... 89 passes defensed ... and countless warnings: 
Pain zone ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Since entering the league, Denver Broncos safety Steve Atwater  
has started 155 games in the regular season and 13 in the 
postseason, missing only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	But last season and again this season, he failed to post 100  
tackles for the only times in his career, a sure sign that his body 
finally is beginning to wear down. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been selected to his eighth Pro Bowl and his  
third as a starter, Atwater has given increasing thought to his 
future and might opt to retire, producing a leadership void in the 
Broncos' defense similar to the effect of John Elway's expected 
retirement on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to end sometime, but whether or not it's this year,  
I haven't decided,'' Atwater said. ``It would take away from my 
preparation to think about it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his healthier moments, the Broncos' hit man doesn't believe  
he is ready to leave the game. This could be his last season with 
the Broncos, however. Or it might be his last season as a full-time 
starter, because young safeties Eric Brown and George Coghill 
already have seen increased playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said. ``I hope it's not my last year  
with the Broncos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft choice from Arkansas in 1989, Atwater was  
selected to the Pro Bowl his second season, beginning a string of 
seven straight Pro Bowl appearances that set a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the ``smiling assassin'' by former assistant coach  
Charlie Waters because of his sunny off-field disposition and his 
bone-jarring tackling, Atwater established his reputation in his 
second season. That's when he stopped Kansas City's mammoth running 
back, Christian Okoye, with a thunderous collision in a memorable 
Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 6-foot-3, 217-pound Atwater has endured his second  
straight sub-par regular season, he has continued to excel in the 
postseason. To many NFL observers, Atwater's play in last January's 
Super Bowl victory over Green Bay set a standard for free safeties. 
</P>
<P>
	He had six tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and two passes  
defensed. 
</P>
<P>
	His sack of Brett Favre caused a fumble that was recovered by  
Neil Smith, setting up a field goal for a 17-7 lead in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he had one of the game's biggest pass breakups on a  
third-and-8 from the Broncos' 39-yard line early in the fourth 
quarter, knocking away a pass intended for Robert Brooks that would 
have given Green Bay a first down inside the Broncos' 25-yard line 
with the score tied 24-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to get around the ball and make some plays,'' he  
said. ``That's all any player wants, an opportunity to make some 
plays. I'm hoping I can get the opportunity to get around the ball 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much difference in preparing for regular-season  
games and playoff games, except, you know, it's do-or-die. You 
either win or you go home. I'm not ready to go home.''

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Tops Fidelity in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Throughout their decades-long rivalry, Fidelity  
Investments and Vanguard Group have brought markedly different 
investment philosophies to the mutual fund business. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity, the biggest firm in the business, tried to beat the  
market. No. 2 Vanguard tried to ride the market. Fidelity wooed 
investors with its promise of top-flight research; Vanguard 
attracted customers with the lowest fees in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Vanguard's approach paid off. Net inflows into  
Vanguard's retail stock and bond funds totaled $48.9 billion in 
1998, more than four times' Fidelity's total of $11.3 billion, 
according to figures released by Financial Research Corp. on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vanguard has so many top-selling funds, it goes a long way to  
showing what a strong brand they have,'' said David Haywood, an 
analyst with Financial Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing nine of the world's 25 top-selling funds helped  
Vanguard break the all-time record of $43 billion set by Fidelity 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say 23-year-old Vanguard is riding the crest of the  
enormous popularity of funds tied to major market indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Vanguard's outspoken former chairman, John Bogle,  
brought out the personal competitiveness in Fidelity's 
publicity-shy chairman and owner, Edward M. Johnson III. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle enjoyed tweaking Fidelity for its higher fees and  
marketing expenses. He also managed to peddle Vanguard's image as 
an investor-friendly company owned by its funds, and therefore its 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say we're cheap,'' Bogle told Barron's in 1997. ``We're  
putting our shareholders first in line, where they should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity went through a low point in 1996, when many of its  
funds faltered and portfolio managers left in droves. With Vanguard 
nipping at its heels, Fidelity introduced index funds, cut its 
management fees and removed the sales charge from many of its 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity's performance has improved dramatically since mid-1997,  
with the arrival of a new investment manager who worked to retain 
portfolio managers and beefed up research. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Vanguard's stunning year for sales, it still has a way  
to go before it overtakes Fidelity, which had $752.7 billion in 
assets under management as of Dec. 31. Vanguard has $440 billion in 
assets under management. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst said Fidelity has gotten too big to be concerned  
about Vanguard alone, and should pay attention to a wider range of 
financial-services companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidelity has outgrown that universe,'' said Eric Kobren,  
president of the Kobren Insight Group. He noted the discount 
brokerage firm Charles Schwab has eaten away more of the giant 
mutual fund company's market share than has Vanguard.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Mouth the Super Bowl Mantra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Happy to be here? Sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Happy JUST to be here? No way.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the mantra of every Super Bowl team, particularly the  
newcomers to the NFL's title game. So, of course, it was the 
prevalent theme for the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday during their 
first encounter with the absurdity of Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
	As both teams arrived for next Sunday's championship matchup,  
they came with vastly different backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champs from Denver, particularly veterans such as  
John Elway, Steve Atwater, Bill Romanowski and Mark Schlereth, are 
akin to Super Bowl regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	The upstarts from Atlanta, with a few exceptions -- coach Dan  
Reeves, linebacker Cornelius Bennett, safety Eugene Robinson -- are 
novices to the ultimate sporting showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't translate into awe, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think hungry is a word that has characterized us all year  
long,'' said Robinson, who won a championship with Green Bay two 
years ago and lost to Denver last January before signing with 
Atlanta as a free agent. ``We have an appetite to prove to everyone 
how good we are. I think we've been doing that consistently and 
it's not a big surprise to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time we step on the field, we feel we can win and should  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be satisfied at this point would be foolish, but not  
necessarily unnatural. Many first-time Super Bowl qualifiers have 
been overcome by the hype and stress of this week. They showed up 
for kickoff without their `A' game, partly because getting to the 
final game of the season took so much out of them. Or they were 
busy congratulating themselves on winning the conference crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember as far back as the 1970 game, when the Vikings were  
flat against Kansas City. Or as recently as the 1995 Super Bowl, in 
which San Diego was overwhelmed by San Francisco from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons swear there is no chance that will happen to them,  
even if they fit the profile: three decades of general 
underachievement; a rapid turnaround; their best regular season 
ever; a monumental struggle to win the conference title game; being 
placed in the underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of people say we played our Super Bowl last  
week against Minnesota,'' wide receiver Terance Mathis said. ``It's 
almost like people are talking like we have already lost the game, 
and that bothers me a lot. If you know me a lot, you know that 
stuff like that really gets under my skin. I thrive on that, 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will his teammates? Will they have the same drive and intensity  
it takes on football's biggest stage, against a team familiar with 
the glaring spotlight? 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who like the Falcons are 16-2, have little doubt  
that the NFC winners will be ready. They expect no complacency, 
only an exceptional effort from a well-coached, well-balanced 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at them as an underdog,'' cornerback Ray  
Crockett said. ``They have just as much talent as anyone. They have 
gone out and beaten tough teams on the road and this is not even a 
road game for them. This will be an even battle, no underdogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds league MVP Terrell Davis, the most valuable player of  
Denver's Super Bowl victory over Green Bay a year ago: 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who makes up those (betting) lines is not a player.  
Ask the players on this team and they know who they are playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, they do. And the Broncos also know who they are -- champions  
-- and what they must do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tunnel vision,'' said Davis, the NFL''s fourth  
2,000-yard rusher ever. ``What I try to focus on is just trying to 
win the game. With me, I'm trying to go out there and win a 
championship, not repeat. I think when you do that, forgetting 
about anything but your goal, you tend to focus a little bit 
more.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise Slightly / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose slightly today on optimism over  
recent steps to mend ailing banks and on growing expectation 
government measures to boost economic growth will soon begin to 
work. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.34 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.64  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but less than its New York level of 
114.54 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 54.41 points,  
or 0.38 percent, to close at 14,208.81. On Friday, the average 
closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas investors are praising Japan's economic policies,''  
said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of equity trading at Okasan 
Securities. He said investors from abroad are reacting especially 
favorably to progress at Japanese banks in writing off their 
problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about further possible declines in markets in Asia  
and New York will likely cap further gains in Tokyo stocks, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were little changed most of the day following a  
decline in U.S. stock prices Friday when the Dow Jones industrial 
average closed at 9,120.67, down 143.41 from Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices inched higher in the afternoon led by a gain in the  
price of stock futures. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,098.71. The 
TOPIX closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 396.15  
million shares, down from 514.65 million shares Friday. Advancing 
issues outnumbered declines 691 to 433, while 173 stocks were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was higher against the yen today on continued worries  
over the Brazilian currency crisis and speculation the Chinese yuan 
might be devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that the dollar's strength against the yen derived  
from suspicions Brazil's financial woes will hurt Asian markets as 
much as those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency rose as high as 114.83 yen, buoyed in part by  
a report in a Chinese business weekly quoting analysts as saying a 
currency devaluation wouldn't be so bad for China, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged not to devalue their  
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar lost much of that gain, falling to as low as  
114.15 yen, amid worries trade friction between the United States 
and Japan may be increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher, in Tokyo for  
trade talks today, said Japan's trade surplus had grown ``too 
large'' and the United States wanted to see it shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that signs of growing U.S. irritation with Japan's  
huge trade surplus would weigh on the dollar because a stronger yen 
is seen as one way of bringing the surplus down. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 40.1 percent in 1998  
from the previous year to a record-high $121.8 billion, the 
government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 132.70 yen, up from 131.92 yen late  
Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.780 percent from Friday's finish of 1.725 
percent, driving its price down to 100.16 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Greene Has Lofty Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maurice Greene never has been one to lack for  
confidence, and the world's No. 1 sprinter was in his usual form 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world indoor record-holder at 60 meters and world  
outdoor 100-meter champion, said he would go after his indoor mark 
and try to win the world indoor title this year, then defend his 
outdoor title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've set some goals and I'm confident I can achieve them,''  
Greene said by telephone from Los Angeles at the New York Track 
Writers' luncheon. ``I'm going for the record every time I step on 
the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene set the world indoor record of 6.39 seconds at Madrid,  
Spain, last February, and 10 days later broke the Millrose Games 
record of 6.52 with a 6.46 clocking -- the fastest ever in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He will open his 1999 season Friday at a meet in his native  
Kansas, then come to Madison Square Garden for the Millrose Games 
on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 6.40 or 6.43 would be a good time at Millrose,''  
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in February, he will compete in the USA Championships on  
the fast Georgia Dome track at Atlanta, where he expects the record 
to be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record is liable to go -- to the low 6.30s or the high  
6.20s,'' Greene said. ``If it comes out that way, it will be a 
beautiful thing. I believe I can run faster than it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will complete his indoor season in March at the World Indoor  
Championships at Maebashi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene will be spurred on indoors by his training partner, Jon  
Drummond, ranked No. 5 in the world, and outdoors by Drummond and 
another training partner, Ato Boldon, the world 200-meter champion 
from Trinidad and Tobago, who is skipping the indoor season. All 
three train under John Smith, the world record-holder at 440 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has no qualms about running against two of his best  
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tease each other all the time,'' he said. ``A lot goes and  
a lot is said (at training) ... but me and Jon are trying to 
perfect a race. We talk a lot of trash but we also help each other 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond, on the same phone hookup, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not jealous people,'' he said. ``We respect each other.  
On the track, we're at work, doing the same job, spurring each 
other to be the best. With that goal, it's difficult to lose sight 
of what we're trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene began training a couple weeks later than usual for the  
indoor season, because ``I needed to take some time off,'' but he 
doesn't think it will hurt his performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been impressing myself in practice,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Greene's outdoor best was 9.90, .06 seconds off the  
world record of 9.84 by Canada's Donovan Bailey. Greene's fastest 
100-meter time is 9.86, when he won the world title in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't run to break the world record (outdoors),'' Greene  
said. ``That is the mistake I made last year. I will have to run 
after the world record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Greene appears to be continually focused on the records,  
Drummond takes a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look for times,'' he said. ``I want to make sure I'm  
doing things correctly. Then the times will come without the 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond, known as ``The Clown Prince of Track,'' is taking his  
job more seriously now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more mature,'' he said. ``I don't shirk my  
responsibilities. I'm pushing my body to the limit. I don't want to 
get injured. I'm taking it to the edge. I've never said I'm going 
to break the world record.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Blood Flow, Alzheimer Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bits of a natural protein may promote  
Alzheimer's disease by disrupting the flow of blood in tiny vessels 
of the brain, according to a study in the February issue of the 
journal Nature Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	The study provides more evidence that vitamin E and other  
antioxidants may fight the disease, and suggests that finding 
treatments to restore normal blood flow may also pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what causes most Alzheimer's cases. Many  
point to overproduction of natural protein fragments called 
amyloid-beta, which form clumps in the brains of patients. Studies 
show these fragments can kill brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work by neurologist Dr. Constantino Iadecola of the  
University of Minnesota and others suggests amyloid-beta, or 
related fragments, can promote Alzheimer's in a second way: by 
boosting production of harmful substances called oxygen radicals, 
which in turn keep tiny blood vessels from delivering the right 
amounts of blood to brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, senior medical and scientific adviser to  
the Alzheimer's Association, called the work exciting and said it 
reveals ``a very important part of the story'' of what causes the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In the brain, amyloid-beta fragments are clipped from long  
proteins called APP. The researchers studied a strain of mice that 
overproduce APP, which leads to an overproduction of amyloid-beta. 
Mice from this strain eventually develop mental problems resembling 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the mice were studied long before any  
Alzheimer's-type symptoms appeared. Researchers found that 
microscopic blood vessels in the mice brains didn't respond to a 
chemical signal to dilate, which would increase blood flow. In 
normal life that might mean the vessels can't shunt more blood to 
brain cells when they need it, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually that could damage those starved cells, or at least  
make them more vulnerable to damage from other causes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the mice produce other fragments of APP in excess,  
the study can't formally show that amyloid-beta is the cause of the 
brain troubles in the mice, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found two bits of evidence that oxygen radicals  
were involved in the blood vessel problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were able to prevent the abnormality by bathing the  
brain with an antioxidant, which render oxygen radicals harmless. 
In addition, mice that were programmed genetically to overproduce 
an antioxidant in addition to APP didn't show the abnormality in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Iadecola said a 1997 study of Alzheimer patients found that  
vitamin E, an antioxidant, modestly slowed the course of the 
disease.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese IOC Member Got $24K Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
delegate from Sudan ousted in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, 
admitted today that he received $24,000, but insisted it was a 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir told The Associated Press  
that he had accepted the money as a loan to help cover the cost of 
his son's studies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City had proposed paying $1,000 to cover my son's  
monthly study expenses, and we agreed that the money is considered 
a loan and will be repaid on graduation,'' Abdel-Gadir. ``That was 
my condition and that was how it went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had told the IOC about the loan when he answered a  
questionnaire sent by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have explained this to the committee,'' Abdel-Gadir said.  
``But this is an exceptional circumstance and, in such cases, we 
know the reaction would not be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdel-Gadir was ousted Sunday along with five other members in  
an unprecedented housecleaning stemming from the biggest corruption 
scandal in Olympic history. Another delegate also resigned Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Wording Change Killed Lewinsky Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During failed negotiations last year to win  
Monica Lewinsky's cooperation, prosecutors became upset when her 
original lawyers altered language in her offer of testimony that 
affected their obstruction-of-justice case against President 
Clinton, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	The wording change was a factor in killing a proposed immunity  
deal between Lewinsky lawyer William Ginsburg and Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office last February, according to the 
documents, released Monday at the request of The Associated Press 
and other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky eventually replaced Ginsburg with Washington  
attorneys Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, and in her subsequent 
immunity deal she stayed with the weaker amended account given in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In her initial handwritten ``proffer'' to Starr's office Feb. 1,  
Ms. Lewinsky raised serious questions about possible obstruction by 
Clinton, stating that he had told her ``she should say she was 
bringing him letters ... or visiting (Oval Office secretary) Betty 
Currie'' if ever asked why she was with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, a federal judge released documents showing that  
Ms. Lewinsky amended her statement to Starr's office on Feb. 3, 
adding a paragraph that stated the president had made his comments 
to her before she was subpoenaed in Paula Jones' sexual harassment 
lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of Clinton's comments was an important issue to  
Starr's office in determining whether he might have engaged in 
obstruction of justice in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	On receiving the amendment to Ms. Lewinsky's proffer, Starr  
deputy Robert Bittman fired back a letter to Ginsburg saying that 
``some provisions of Ms. Lewinsky's written proffer -- including a 
version we received yesterday with added provisions -- contradict 
other provisions of the document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg responded by asserting that Starr prosecutor Bruce  
Udolf had verbally agreed to the amendment -- as well as to a 
complete immunity deal for Ms. Lewinsky -- in a telephone conference 
late on the evening of Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office denied making a deal and said prosecutors had  
information that was ``inconsistent'' with Ms. Lewinsky's amendment 
that placed Clinton's comments before she was subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue over the timing of Clinton's comments has never been  
previously known publicly as a reason why Starr's office rejected 
Ms. Lewinsky's proposed immunity deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg went to court to try to enforce the proposed immunity  
deal, saying Starr's office had agreed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office replied that the amendment to Ms. Lewinsky's  
handwritten proffer constituted a ``counteroffer'' to which they 
had never agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson on May 1 denied  
Ginsburg's motion to enforce the agreement, saying in the newly 
released court decision that Ms. Lewinsky's amendment ``constituted 
a material change requiring further acceptance'' by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors ``had not proposed'' the amendment ``and had  
never had a chance to discuss or approve Ms. Lewinsky's change in 
the timing of Clinton's statement, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Udolf's oral assent'' to the change ``fell short of the  
requisite acceptance because the evidence ... on this issue failed 
to prove that Mr. Udolf told Mr. Ginsburg'' that Starr's office and 
Ms. Lewinsky ``in fact had a binding deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that the prosecutors had made clear to  
Ginsburg that only Starr had the authority to approve an immunity 
deal for his office, and she noted that Starr was not involved in 
the phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Ms.  
Lewinsky's lawyers have asked Johnson to permit the former White 
House intern to be interviewed by Barbara Walters for ABC's 
``20/20'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of her immunity agreement with Starr, Ms.  
Lewinsky is not permitted to comment to the news media without 
Starr's approval, ``pending the resolution of this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky lawyers are seeking a court hearing Thursday to  
force Starr to lift the restrictions, the Post said, quoting 
unidentified legal sources.

<HEADLINE> Unpredictable Night at Globe Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There was something for everybody  
during the 56th Golden Globes awards, an unpredictable evening that 
set the stage for an unpredictable Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Carrey wasn't making off-color quips, or Jack Nicholson  
wasn't remembering the Globe's less golden moments, Steven 
Spielberg was thanking U.S. fighting men for preserving democracy 
and ending the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of freewheeling ceremony in which Christine  
Lahti could draw laughs by walking on stage with toilet paper stuck 
to her shoe, and Michael J. Fox and Gwenyth Paltrow could bring 
tears to the ballroom crowd with their emotional acceptance 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' won best dramatic film and Spielberg was  
honored for directing the brutally realistic World War II combat 
story, while ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and 
``Elizabeth'' won major awards Sunday at the annual awards from the 
Hollywood Foreign Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globes, traditional Oscar predictors, did little to help  
handicap the Academy Awards race. It was between ``Ryan'' and 
``Shakespeare'' before the Globes, and it's between them still, 
with perhaps a little more push for ``The Truman Show'' and its 
award-winning star Carrey, who barely hid his Oscar aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey jokingly thanked the ``Academy'' for his Globe award,  
which actually was selected by entertainment journalists -- not the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm sorry I was thinking of something else,'' said Carrey,  
named best actor in a dramatic movie, beating out a field that 
included the strong acting of Ian McKellen of ``Gods and 
Monsters,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey's co-star Ed Harris picked up a supporting actor trophy,  
setting the irreverent tone for much of the evening by putting a 
toothpick in his mouth and saying, ``Oh, man, I just got through 
eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen's co-star Lynn Redgrave got a surprise supporting  
actress award as the gruff-but-loving maid in ``Gods and Monsters'' 
and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' was best actor in a musical 
or comedy motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a more serious note, Spielberg, whose film is a major  
contender for an Oscar, recalled ``all the veterans that are out 
there that saved Western civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 
1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage, he said: ``I hope the movie is a way at looking  
back... and saying thanks to all of our grandfathers and fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' won best comedy or musical film and  
picked up awards for star Paltrow -- best actress in a comedy -- and 
for screenplay. Paltrow fought back tears and her voice choked as 
she thanked her parents and her ailing grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchette of ``Elizabeth'' won best dramatic actress for  
her role as the title character in second movie set during the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, the Hollywood Foreign Press  
Association voted ABC's ``The Practice'' as best television drama 
series, and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' won as best television comedy 
series. Both are produced David Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do... and just take every 
day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes are awarded for film and television in what  
can be a more colorful affair than the stodgier Academy Awards. 
Last year, Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a 
winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she showed up as a presenter 
with toilet paper stuck to a shoe.

<HEADLINE>  Unpredictable Night at Globe Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There was something for everybody  
during the 56th Golden Globes awards, an unpredictable evening that 
set the stage for an unpredictable Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Carrey wasn't making off-color quips, or Jack Nicholson  
wasn't remembering the Globe's less golden moments, Steven 
Spielberg was thanking U.S. fighting men for preserving democracy 
and ending the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of freewheeling ceremony in which Christine  
Lahti could draw laughs by walking on stage with toilet paper stuck 
to her shoe, and Michael J. Fox and Gwenyth Paltrow could bring 
tears to the ballroom crowd with their emotional acceptance 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' won best dramatic film and Spielberg was  
honored for directing the brutally realistic World War II combat 
story, while ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and 
``Elizabeth'' won major awards Sunday at the annual awards from the 
Hollywood Foreign Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globes, traditional Oscar predictors, did little to help  
handicap the Academy Awards race. It was between ``Ryan'' and 
``Shakespeare'' before the Globes, and it's between them still, 
with perhaps a little more push for ``The Truman Show'' and its 
award-winning star Carrey, who barely hid his Oscar aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey jokingly thanked the ``Academy'' for his Globe award,  
which actually was selected by entertainment journalists -- not the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm sorry I was thinking of something else,'' said Carrey,  
named best actor in a dramatic movie, beating out a field that 
included the strong acting of Ian McKellen of ``Gods and 
Monsters,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey's co-star Ed Harris picked up a supporting actor trophy,  
setting the irreverent tone for much of the evening by putting a 
toothpick in his mouth and saying, ``Oh, man, I just got through 
eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen's co-star Lynn Redgrave got a surprise supporting  
actress award as the gruff-but-loving maid in ``Gods and Monsters'' 
and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' was best actor in a musical 
or comedy motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a more serious note, Spielberg, whose film is a major  
contender for an Oscar, recalled ``all the veterans that are out 
there that saved Western civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 
1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage, he said: ``I hope the movie is a way at looking  
back... and saying thanks to all of our grandfathers and fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' won best comedy or musical film and  
picked up awards for star Paltrow -- best actress in a comedy -- and 
for screenplay. Paltrow fought back tears and her voice choked as 
she thanked her parents and her ailing grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchette of ``Elizabeth'' won best dramatic actress for  
her role as the title character in second movie set during the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, the Hollywood Foreign Press  
Association voted ABC's ``The Practice'' as best television drama 
series, and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' won as best television comedy 
series. Both are produced David Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do... and just take every 
day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes are awarded for film and television in what  
can be a more colorful affair than the stodgier Academy Awards. 
Last year, Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a 
winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she showed up as a presenter 
with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, he reminisced about the bawdy antics of Joan

<HEADLINE> `PJs' Tests TV's Comic Boundaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The setting is a mostly black inner-city  
housing project afflicted with drugs, guns and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The main character is bumbling but dedicated superintendent  
Thurgood Stubbs, whose world includes his loving wife, Muriel, 
ornery tenants and a pack of scruffy buddies who drink oversized 
bottles of beer. One character is a crack cocaine addict. An 
elderly tenant eats dog food. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of a new Fox animated comedy series, ``The PJs,''  
and although many of the creators -- including Eddie Murphy -- are 
black, some critics such as filmmaker Spike Lee are raising 
questions about whether some laughs are off limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying we're above being made fun of ... but it's  
really hateful, I think, towards black people. Plain and simple,'' 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wilmore, co-creator of ``The PJs,'' sees a double standard  
in the entertainment field. He pointed out that Lee made dramatic 
hay out of black crack addicts in his film ``Jungle Fever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't a satire be given the same respect a drama's  
given?'' Wilmore said. ``How come a rapper can say `Hey, I'm just 
keeping it real, this is my art?' Why can't we say that in 
comedy?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy had no comment on Lee's criticism, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' is the second TV satire to come under fire this  
season. UPN's ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' which 
attempted to mine slavery and the Civil War for humor, was pounded 
by a number of critics, including the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. The low-rated show was quickly 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the stories on ``The PJs'' revolve around themes that  
could take place in any setting, urban or suburban: Stubbs catching 
young tenant Calvin and a friend trying to ditch school, Muriel 
acting as diet police for her chubby husband. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``The PJs'' weaves in harsh reality. In one episode, Stubbs  
and his tenants test a new security door with gunfire. Another 
time, Stubbs carries a TV set out onto the street knowing police 
immediately will suspect him of theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who has criticized other TV comedies for fostering  
stereotypes, white film directors for making what he considers poor 
films about slavery and Quentin Tarantino for racial epithets in 
``Jackie Brown,'' is not alone in criticizing ``The PJs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Los Angeles-area black groups came out against the show  
before it aired, although NAACP officials have reserved judgment, 
saying they are reviewing the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it painted a very salutary picture of  
African-American culture,'' said Jesse Rhines, assistant professor 
of political economy at Rutgers University and author of ``Black 
Film-White Money,'' a history of blacks in movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether or not this series could serve to benefit  
blacks or push blacks toward improving their condition -- except the 
ones who are tied to the program and are profiting from it 
financially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the final vote on ``The PJs'' should rest with viewers,  
Wilmore said: ``Why do black people need Spike Lee to speak for 
them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The PJs'' clearly has youth appeal with the cute and cuddly  
look of its foam doll characters. In its second outing, on Jan. 12, 
it was the highest-rated show among 12- to 17-year-olds, besting 
even WB's teen favorite ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' according to 
ratings from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Among all viewers the series had a robust Jan. 10 debut, with  
more than 12 million homes tuning in. It slipped to about 7 million 
homes in its third airing, on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmore argues that the series is a satire and not just a bid  
for cheap laughs. When Stubbs and his pals are shown drinking big 
bottles of beer, it's to make a point about how alcohol has 
undermined their lives, Wilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is that hateful towards anybody?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Senate Questions Posed to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of questions submitted Monday to the president by Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott and nine other Republican senators: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Charles Ruff argued that you did not commit perjury before  
the Grand Jury because, inter alia, you were never asked: ``Is 
everything you testified to in the Jones deposition true?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is everything you testified to in the Jones deposition true? If  
not, what did you testify that you believe is not truthful? Please 
begin your answer with a yes or no. 
</P>
<P>
	2. It is uncontroverted that you made the following statements  
to Ms. Currie on Jan. 18: ``Monica came on to me, and I never 
touched her, right?'' ``You were always there when Monica was 
there, right?'' ``I was never alone with Monica, right?'' ``You 
could see and hear everything, right?'' ``She wanted to have sex 
with me, and I cannot do that, right?'' At the time you made these 
statements, did you believe them to be true? Please provide an 
answer with respect to each of these statements. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You testified before the grand jury that if the Jones lawyers  
``asked for the gifts (Ms. Lewinsky would) have to give them 
whatever she had, that that's what the law was.'' Do you stand by 
this testimony? If so, how do you explain Ms. Lewinsky's failure to 
follow your advice? 
</P>
<P>
	4. Presidential aide Sydney Blumenthal testified before the  
grand jury that President Clinton told him that ``Ms. Lewinsky came 
at me and made a sexual demand on me''; and that he ``rebuffed 
her''; and Ms. Lewinsky ``was known as the stalker.'' Deputy Chief 
of Staff John Podesta testified before the grand jury that 
President Clinton did not have sex with Ms. Lewinsky ``in any way 
whatsoever'' and provided additional details. You testified before 
the grand jury that ``I said to them things that were true about 
this relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Are Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal's testimony concerning their  
conversations with you accurate? If not, what did you say to your 
aides? If these statements are accurate, do you stand by your 
testimony that your statements to them were truthful? 
</P>
<P>
	5. When asked why, four days after you testified under oath in  
the Jones proceeding, Dick Morris conducted a poll on whether the 
American people would forgive you for committing the crimes of 
perjury and obstruction of justice, your attorney, Mr. Ruff, 
answered, ``I don't have a clue.'' Since your lawyers do not have 
any insights, could you explain why Dick Morris would have 
conducted this poll? Who ordered and paid for this poll? 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by the House of Representatives about this poll, you  
answered that Dick Morris ``volunteered'' to conduct this poll. 
Could you provide additional details as to the context in which Mr. 
Morris ``volunteered'' and the details of any conversation you had 
with Mr. Morris about conducting such a poll or the results of such 
a poll? 
</P>
<P>
	6. Is it your position that Ms. Lewinsky was lying in her grand  
jury testimony, her grand jury deposition, and her FBI interviews, 
when she said you engaged in conduct with her that constituted 
``sexual relations'' even under your narrow interpretation of the 
term in the Jones deposition? Is it your position that she was also 
lying when she gave essentially the same account contemporaneously 
with the occurrence of the events to her friends and counselors? 
</P>
<P>
	7. In your 2 a.m. conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about Betty  
Currie's brother and the possibility of Ms. Lewinsky filing an 
affidavit, did you mention the possibility that she could say she 
was visiting Betty Currie or delivering papers? Why did you mention 
the possibility of filing an affidavit? How would an affidavit from 
Ms. Lewinsky that disclosed the true nature of your relationship 
have helped you achieve your purported objective? 
</P>
<P>
	8. At the end of the Jones deposition, Judge Wright admonished  
the parties that ``this case is subject to a protective order 
regarding all discovery and all parties present, including the 
witness, are not to say anything whatsoever about the questions 
they were asked, the substance of the deposition ... any details, 
and this is extremely important to the court.'' Within hours of 
Judge Wright's admonition to all parties not to discuss details of 
the deposition, did you telephone Betty Currie to ask her to make a 
rare Sunday visit to the Oval Office in which you discussed the 
deposition? If so, was this consistent with Judge Wright's 
protective order? 
</P>
<P>
	9. In her interviews with the Office of the Independent Counsel,  
Ms. Lewinsky stated that on Jan. 5, 1998, you told her about the 
affidavit because you had seen 15 others. Did you mean that you had 
seen previous drafts of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, or did you mean 
that you had seen drafts of other affidavits that were in some way 
connected to the Paula Jones matter? If you meant that you had seen 
drafts of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, who gave them to you to review 
and why were you reviewing them? If you meant that you had seen 
drafts of other affidavits, whose affidavits were they, and why 
were you reviewing them? Did you either personally or through some 
other person participate in any way in the preparation of Monica 
Lewinsky's affidavit? If so, what did you or some other person do? 
Please describe in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	10. When did you first learn that Ms. Lewinsky had not turned  
over the gifts to the Jones lawyers? When did you first learn that 
Ms. Currie was in possession of the gifts? 
</P>

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Prepares for Papal Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Until Sunday, the Trans World Dome was a  
cathedral of Cadillacs, a basilica of Beetles. 
</P>
<P>
	But no more. The St. Louis Automobile Dealer's Association New  
Car Show is suddenly last year's model, ushered out of the 
convention center to make way for the man whose car -- the 
popemobile -- is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul II arrives in St. Louis on Tuesday, and the  
transformation of the Trans World Dome into a massive 
church-for-a-day was just one of a multitude of finishing touches 
under way in an intensely proud city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite an undertaking, all the work that goes into this  
visit,'' said Mary Hendron, spokeswoman for the St. Louis 
Convention and Visitors Convention. ``But it's worth it. What an 
honor this is for the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auto show ended at 6 p.m. Sunday ``and by 6:01 p.m. we were  
moving cars off the showroom. We had 500 vehicles out of here by 
7:30 p.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is scheduled to celebrate Mass at the dome before  
104,000 people on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have less than 30 hours to build everything, set up  
chairs and get everything in place. We'll probably still be working 
on the set when the doors open at 4 a.m. Wednesday,'' said Jim 
McClellan, production manager for the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul is scheduled to arrive at 1 p.m. Tuesday and will be  
greeted by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	That evening, a motorcade will proceed downtown to a youth rally  
at the Kiel Center; in addition to the Mass at the dome, the pope 
will participate in a Wednesday prayer service at the Cathedral 
Basilica of St. Louis before flying home. 
</P>
<P>
	Strict security measures were in place around the city -- several  
streets were blocked off, and interstate exit ramps closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The city for months has been preparing for the visit, the first  
by any pope to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Justin Ballard was arranging television camera risers  
for the media in front of the main stage at Papal Plaza, a 
six-block area where entertainment was scheduled Tuesday. About 
2,500 members of the media were expected for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started at 8 this morning and I'll probably be working  
throughout the night,'' Ballard said. ``Tomorrow I'll miss most of 
the activity. I'll be sleeping. But, I'll be at the dome Wednesday, 
working the lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant owners across the street at Union Station also were  
preparing for the onslaught of visitors. The Key West Cafe, which 
seats 80, is opening five hours early Tuesday and Wednesday to 
serve breakfast for an estimated 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the St. Louis Archdiocese, hundreds of local  
nuns have been praying for good weather. Their prayers seem to have 
been answered: Temperatures were expected to peak in the 50s during 
the papal visit.

<HEADLINE> Central Park Killer Gets 10-Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A teen-ager who fatally stabbed and disemboweled  
a drinking companion in Central Park has been sentenced to up to 10 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Michael Corriero imposed the maximum  
penalty allowed for a juvenile on Christopher Vasquez, 16, 
convicted in December of manslaughter in the death of Michael 
McMorrow, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez blamed the 1997 killing on girlfriend Daphne Abdela, 16.  
His lawyer, Arnold Kriss, said she was out of control and had drug 
and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez said he felt sorry for his family and the McMorrows, and  
said that if he had kept the curfew set by his parents, he would 
not have gotten into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdela pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in March and  
was given the same sentence as Vasquez. Both will be eligible for 
parole in less than two years, but Corriero said Monday that he 
will recommend that Vasquez serve the maximum term. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pulled McMorrow's body from a small lake in the park. He  
had been stabbed 34 times, disemboweled and one of his hands was

	Senators Face Crucial Votes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators face crucial votes that could  
abruptly end President Clinton's impeachment trial or prolong it 
indefinitely. Senators sitting in judgment of Clinton agreed Sunday 
that the 67 votes needed to remove him from office are not there. 
They also said they are seeking a way for graceful exit from the 
yearlong scandal. A vote this week to allow witnesses, if it fails, 
could set the stage for a final vote on conviction or acquittal. 
But House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to 
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that Senate Democrats denounced as an act of desperation.

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Steven Spielberg was named best  
director at the 56th annual Golden Globe Awards Sunday night for 
his World War II drama ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Gwyneth Paltrow of 
``Shakespeare In Love'' and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' were 
honored as best actors in musical or comedy motion pictures, while 
Jack Nicholson was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his 
``outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson 
has been nominated for 14 Globes and won five.

	Clinton Proposing Welfare Package  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing a package of  
welfare-to-work proposals meant to continue that decline. But new 
numbers being released today show the job may be getting tougher, 
at least in a handful of states where the dramatic declines of 
recent years have begun to slow. In his upcoming budget, the 
president will ask Congress to extend, and in some cases expand, 
programs aimed at encouraging businesses to hire people off welfare 
and helping people get to those jobs. He also will ask for $1 
billion to continue a program aimed at long-term welfare recipients 
and low-income fathers.

	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC ousted six members Sunday  
in the biggest corruption scandal in Olympic history. IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch apologized to the world for the Salt Lake 
City scandal but vowed to stay in office and restore the prestige 
of the Olympics. Samaranch said the IOC would broaden its 
investigation to other bids stretching from the games of 1996 to 
2006. But he stressed that Salt Lake would keep the Winter Games 
and Sydney would remain host of the 2000 Summer Games.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. energy giant Enron did nothing to  
stop a brutal campaign in India to crush dissent by a government 
determined to push through its multimillion-dollar power deal, 
according to a Human Rights Watch report. Enron Power Development 
Corp.'s $2.4 billion power project in the western Indian state of 
Maharashtra has been dogged by questions about corruption and 
environmental degradation. The Human Rights Watch report charged 
that the government tried to silence opposition by unleashing 
police to beat protesters and illegally detain leading activists.

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab foreign ministers Sunday refused Iraq's  
demands to strongly condemn U.N. sanctions and last month's 
U.S.-British airstrikes on the country, prompting Iraq to storm out 
of the session. A statement agreed on by the Arab ministers pledged 
to work for the lifting of the sanctions, but only expressed ``deep 
concern at the use of the military option against Iraq,'' instead 
of denouncing the attacks as ``aggression,'' as Baghdad wanted.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Vaccinations Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ILION, N.Y. (AP) -- The families of two Marines are protesting  
the government's plans to vaccinate 2.4 million military personnel 
against anthrax, saying it could lead to long-term health problems 
for their sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Adam Cooper and Bradley Watson, friends who grew  
up together in this town east of Utica, say the military does not 
know enough about the vaccination and its side effects to require 
shots for all its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about 166,000 people have received at least the first in  
a series of six vaccinations against the potentially fatal disease, 
according to Jim Turner, a spokesman for the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner says the vaccine has been around for the last 25 to 30  
years and is safe. ``It's been thoroughly tested. It's 
FDA-approved,'' he told the Utica Observer-Dispatch in Monday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Coopers and Watsons believe the vaccine may not be  
entirely safe. Both families told the Observer-Dispatch they have 
spent many hours researching the effects of the vaccine and believe 
it may be related to what is popularly known as Gulf War syndrome, 
or the variety of illnesses suffered by veterans after the Persian 
Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
	The families have contacted U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert's office  
to protest the vaccination program and are scheduling a town 
meeting here next month to hear from former military personnel who 
have taken the vaccine and some who resigned to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no revolutionary. I'm doing this because my son's life is  
at stake,'' Tim Watson said. ``It's morally wrong. They are using 
our children as guinea pigs. We are not at war. ... This is 
something that could be delayed until further tests are done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the threat of anthrax being used as ``germ warfare,''  
the military announced in 1997 that it would vaccinate all of its 
active and reserve personnel by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson is concerned the anthrax vaccine given to soldiers in the  
Persian Gulf may have led to the problems many have reported 
experiencing in recent years, including lupus, fatigue, headaches, 
dizziness, cancer, infertility and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no hard facts to substantiate any medical problems  
being linked to the anthrax vaccine or any other vaccine soldiers 
were given in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the federal government nor the military acknowledges the  
existence of so-called Gulf War syndrome. But the Department of 
Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, citing the findings 
of a presidential advisory committee, do concede that Gulf War 
veterans suffer an array of unusual medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as there are questions over the safety of the  
vaccination, Al and Mary Cooper say their son will refuse to have 
it administered. It was first manufactured in 1970 and is used by 
veterinarians as well as tannery and wool mill workers to protect 
them against a non-fatal skin form of anthrax. But no human studies 
have been done exposing humans to anthrax spores breathed into the 
lungs, the form of the disease that troops would face in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Cooper, who is stationed in Okinawa, has already been  
demoted twice for refusing the vaccine, his parents say. He's also 
been told he'll be discharged, though the Marine Corps has yet to 
set a date for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said soldiers like Cooper will be disciplined for  
refusing to obey an order. He admitted, though, that the number of 
people refusing to have the vaccine is relatively small -- 72 of the 
1.5 million active duty personnel so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it boils down to refusing a legal order, and people  
are required to follow legal orders,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cooper has opted not to have the vaccine administered,  
Watson has changed his mind, much to the chagrin of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon learning of his son's decision to go ahead with the  
vaccination, Tim Watson, a Vietnam veteran, said he's ``never cried 
so much in his life.''

<HEADLINE>  Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the capital  
murder trial of John William King, one of three men facing the 
death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, wore a bulletproof vest as he was escorted by deputies  
into Jasper County Courthouse. He is accused in the June 7 slaying 
of James Byrd Jr., who was stripped, chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged until his head came off. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 400 county residents randomly selected for  
jury selection showed up, and after initial questioning the pool 
was reduced to 122 people, 21 of them black. The selection process 
is expected to last three weeks, resulting in 12 jurors and two 
alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said many people  
have told him they were reluctant to serve because of the case's 
high profile. Byrd's murder made national news far beyond Jasper, 
an East Texas timber town of 8,000 people just west of the 
Louisiana line. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of you guys,'' he told reporters Sunday.  
``They're afraid of having their picture taken. They're afraid of 
being interviewed. And they're afraid of serving on a big case like 
this with a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	King, an ex-convict once involved in a racist prison gang, wore  
a long-sleeved shirt in the courtroom, covering his heavily 
tattooed arms. His short haircut revealed the trace of a large 
tattoo in the shape of a pentagram on the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he intended to kidnap Byrd and then to kill him will be  
key in the capital murder case -- and, if he is convicted, to 
whether he's sentenced to life in prison or put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 23, whose engraved wrench was found near  
Byrd's body, was the only defendant to give a statement about 
events leading to Byrd's death. But his statement is legally 
inadmissible unless he testifies, and his attorney says he won't 
permit Berry on the stand without a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- King, Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 --  
were roommates who shared an apartment. Berry told officers the 
three men had been drinking on June 6. Late that evening or shortly 
after midnight, the men went out for a ride in Berry's rusty, 1982 
gray Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what Berry says happened after the pickup truck stopped  
to pick up Byrd, who was walking home from his niece's bridal 
shower: 
</P>
<P>
	King objected to giving a ride to Byrd and, after the group  
stopped at a convenience store, drove to an abandoned logging road 
outside town. There, King declared he was ``fixing to scare'' Byrd. 
Berry watched as Brewer and King allegedly beat Byrd into 
unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry fled and King drove after him. After Berry got back in and  
the truck took off, he turned and said he saw Byrd's body bouncing 
behind, fastened to the bumper with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The route they took, a two-mile asphalt stretch of Huff Creek  
Road, was later marked with 75 red spray-painted circles to show 
where police found Byrd's keys, dentures and parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged King, Brewer and Berry with capital murder  
but decided to try the cases separately. King's is the second 
capital murder trial in Jasper County. The only other one was in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Storms Out of Arab Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Iraq's foreign minister stormed out of an  
Arab League debate after its members failed to strongly condemn 
U.N. sanctions and last month's U.S.-British airstrikes against the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf left in anger Sunday  
after a statement agreed upon by the ministers only expressed 
``deep concern at the use of the military option against Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq had hoped the ministers would denounce the attacks as  
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sahhaf said the statement was ``a cover for resuming the  
U.S.-British airstrikes'' and claimed the ministers caved in to 
U.S. pressure and ``plotting'' by Persian Gulf countries, 
especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	For days ahead of the meeting, Baghdad had stepped up its  
rhetoric, accusing Arab governments of buckling to American 
pressure to not push for an easing of the U.N. sanctions in the 
wake of the Dec. 16-19 strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. arms inspectors must confirm that Iraq's suspected weapons  
of mass destruction have been eliminated before economic sanctions 
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the airstrikes, Baghdad said it would never let the  
inspectors return. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has resisted proposals put before the U.N. Security  
Council since then to ease the sanctions and substantially change 
the inspection regime created after the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walkout ... underscores Iraq's isolation in the Arab  
world,'' said State Department spokesman James Foley. ``The United 
States is particularly pleased with the Arab League's rejection of 
Iraq's threats to its neighbors, and to its call on Iraq to improve 
its peaceful intentions toward Kuwait and the other neighboring 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the ministers met, U.S. warplanes patrolling Iraq's  
northern ``no-fly'' zone Sunday attacked Iraqi surface-to-air 
missile sites that had been targeting them in separate incidents, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency reported today that a  
U.S.-British missile attack hit a crowded area in the southern city 
of Basra, killing and wounding civilians and destroying several 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Mike Milord, said  
``there were airstrikes in the south, in the vicinity of Basra, as 
a result of provocation.'' He gave no other details.

<HEADLINE> Estrogen Helps Keep Hearts Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Estrogen supplements not only improve a woman's  
cholesterol levels but also reduce other substances in the blood 
that raise the risk of a heart attack or stroke, according to a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that giving healthy women estrogen or estrogen  
combined with cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with 
reduced inflammatory and clotting factors in the blood, said the 
lead author, Dr. Richard O. Cannon III. 
</P>
<P>
	Such factors contribute to clogging of blood vessels, said  
Cannon, acting chief of the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute's cardiology branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our surprise, estrogen and estrogen combined with  
simvastatin reduced the inflammation and clotting potential,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings appear in Tuesday's Circulation, a journal of the  
American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that hormone replacement therapy, especially  
estrogen, can be used to fend off the ravages of aging and related 
diseases. It has been shown to reduce the ``bad'' low-density 
cholesterol (LDL) and raise the ``good'' high-density cholesterol 
(HDL). But cholesterol is just one of many contributors to vessel 
clogging. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies suggest its benefits even extend to protecting  
against Alzheimer's disease. According to a 1998 study conducted at 
Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, a dwindling number of cells in the 
hippocampus is linked to low estrogen levels. The hippocampus is a 
region of the brain involved with memory. 
</P>
<P>
	But estrogen replacement therapy carries risks, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Studies show it can increase the risk of breast cancer and  
endometrial cancer. That's because the hormone can fuel the rampant 
growth of abnormal cells in some tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	And, elevated levels of the hormone can block the effects of  
tamoxifen, a powerful, but controversial cancer drug that has been 
used for 20 years in advanced cases of breast cancer and other 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the researchers examined cholesterol  
levels, clotting factors and inflammation in blood samples from 28 
women who were an average age of 57 and had relatively high levels 
of LDL. The women received three treatments, each for six weeks: 
estrogen, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin and a 
combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	One test measured plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),  
which blocks the body's ability to dissolve blood clots and is an 
indicator of blood clotting. Another test was for E-selectin, a 
molecule whose levels indicate inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	After estrogen treatment, levels of PAI-1 were reduced by about  
40 percent. With combination treatment, the levels fell 24 percent. 
But the levels were unchanged after simvastatin treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar results occurred for E-selectin. With combination  
treatment and with estrogen treatment alone, E-selectin levels were 
reduced by about 20 percent. With simvastatin alone, the levels 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study is needed, according to one scientist who wasn't  
involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the effect of estrogen on markers of inflammation and  
clotting in the study are encouraging, it's uncertain how these 
results will translate into a reduction in heart attacks and other 
clinical events,'' said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist at 
Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only large-scale test results available are from the Heart  
Estrogen Replacement Study, which looked at women who had a history 
of cardiovascular disease, Manson said. The trials showed that 
women with prior cardiovascular diseases who were treated with 
estrogen and progestin actually showed an increase in heart attacks 
in the first year of treatment.

<HEADLINE> Can Plants, Animals Live in Space? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- For the first time in history, humans are  
making serious plans to carry life to other worlds, but experts 
said Monday it's uncertain whether plants and animals from Earth 
can thrive and evolve on other planets. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long-term habitation of Mars, you'll have to grow crops,  
deal with microbes and so forth,'' said David Morrison of NASA's 
Ames Research Center. ``We have to understand the response of those 
organisms to the different conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms that evolved in the gravity of Earth may not thrive in  
the lighter gravity of the moon or Mars, said NASA's Emily R. 
Morey-Holton. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon and the 
one-third gravity of Mars, fundamental processes of heat convection 
and sedimentation change. Also, the surface tension of water, which 
shatters easily in Earth's gravity, becomes a strong barrier in 
lighter gravity and could affect basic biological functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the effect of these changes,'' said  
Morey-Holton. ``We have to learn if Earth organisms can live and 
evolve in these changed conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Morey-Holton said, researchers found that tadpoles  
hatched in orbit never developed lungs. In the low gravity, the 
surface tension on air bubbles became so strong that the tadpoles 
could not punch through to breath, she said. ``They would hit the 
bubbles and just bounce off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another orbital experiment, a type of mustard plant failed to  
thrive in space because water droplets clustered about the roots, 
blocking absorption of nutrients. Again, the cause is thought to be 
the enhanced surface tension of the water droplets. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in gravity could also affect how genes work and could  
even affect evolution, said Morey-Holton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some researchers are looking for gravity-dependent genes,''  
she said. ``There is concern that in a different gravity some genes 
may fail to turn on while others could shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such actions could dramatically alter a plant or animal or even  
cause lethal changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one orbital experiment, several generations of human kidney  
cells were cultured and researchers have found that the genes in 
the space grown cells changed. Just how the changes would affect 
the cells is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find gravity-sensitive genes, there is no reason why we  
can't have designer organisms that would be viable in the new 
environment,'' said Morey-Holton. In effect, Earth plants or 
animals could be genetically altered so they would thrive in the 
changed conditions of Mars and would then be put on board a 
space-age ark that would carry colonists to the Red Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is planning a series of experiments on the International  
Space Station to find Earth organisms best suited for Mars. Plants 
and animals will be grown through several generations and then 
analyzed for genetic changes, said Morrison.

Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Release of Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether states may block release of police records and other 
government documents to those who would sell the information even 
when the records routinely are released to the news media and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review rulings that struck down such  
a California law as a violation of commercial free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the country, courts have reached conflicting  
rulings on the legitimacy of laws aimed at protecting the privacy 
of people arrested by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts have upheld laws similar to California's in cases from  
Colorado, Louisiana and South Carolina. Courts have struck down 
similar laws in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	California lawmakers amended the state's public records law in  
1996 to limit the release of information on arrested suspects and 
crime victims to those with ``a scholarly, journalistic, political 
or governmental purpose or ... a licensed private investigator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone given such records had to certify that the information  
would ``not be used directly or indirectly to sell a product or 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union Reporting Publishing Corp., which had sold lists of names  
and addresses of arrested people to lawyers, insurance companies 
and driving schools, sued the Los Angeles Police Department over 
its enforcement of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge blocked enforcement of the law, and the  
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not rational,'' the appeals court said last June, ``for  
a statute which purports to advance the governmental interest in 
protecting privacy of arrestees to allow the names and addresses of 
the same to be published in any newspaper ... or magazine in the 
country so long as the information is not used for commercial 
purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the police department  
argued that ``restrictions on the release of government records do 
not violate the First Amendment'' because they merely block access 
and do not restrict commercial speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``California unquestionably could adopt a complete prohibition  
on access to arrestee address records, which would more completely 
protect the privacy of arrestees,'' the appeal said. ``But such a 
prohibition would deprive the press of address information, which 
although it would be constitutional would be inimical to the 
fundamental goals of the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Los Angeles Police Department vs. Union Reporting  
Publishing, 98-678.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Tornado Victims Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEEBE, Ark. (AP) -- The same hands that only days before had  
cradled 2-month-old Kirk McAfee now were clasped in prayer as Mike 
Thomas led the infant's graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't but just a little while ago I held him at the  
church, but God took him back,'' said Thomas, pastor of the 16 
Section Union Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas spoke Sunday against a backdrop of daisies, yellow  
carnations and the stark landscape of an Arkansas winter. The 
infant, who was blown out of his grandmother's home when a tornado 
hit Thursday, was among eight to die in Arkansas and Tennessee 
during the furious storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick McKay dug the little boy's grave with a backhoe.  
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to see all these people you haven't seen in such a  
long time, under these circumstances,'' McKay said as roughly 400 
mourners gathered under bright sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	In Searcy, up to 700 people showed up for the funeral of Wanda  
Wilson, 66, who was killed when her mobile home was knocked over by 
a tornado. Three funerals were scheduled for today, and 
arrangements for two others were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents, meanwhile, struggled to clean up their ravaged  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Terry Wheeler stood on the roof of her apartment  
complex while her 2-year-old son played with a rooftop television 
antenna. No one was in danger of falling -- the roof was on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see the houses is just a nightmare, but to see the people  
climb out of them whole and hearty is such a blessing,'' said Robin 
Loucks, another Little Rock resident, who has lived in the city for 
33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beebe, Kelton Keathley recalled surviving by huddling in a  
bathtub with his daughter, her fiance, a friend, his 90-year-old 
grandmother ``and a little old yellow dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winds estimated at 200 mph ripped the walls from the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all raised up and walked off,'' Keathley said. ``The Lord  
had to be looking after us for us to live through that because it's 
not supposed to happen. We should have been dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksville, Tenn., the city's 19th century Madison Street  
United Methodist Church was among the hardest hit buildings in the 
region -- its sanctuary destroyed and massive twin spires ripped 
nearly in half. The building was on the National Register of 
Historic places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom, this is sad because the church fell down,'' 5-year-old  
Conner Watts wrote -- with his mother's help -- on an index card and 
read aloud during Sunday service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Doug Norfleet kissed the boy on the cheek and told him  
and the hundreds of church members: ``We're gonna rebuild it.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Agrees To Change Its Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just hours after privacy groups began a  
boycott, Intel Corp. reversed itself Monday and said it would 
disable a new technology that helps identify computer users as they 
move across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion  
in sales last year, said it will include software that turns off 
the feature by default in future copies of its Pentium III 
processors, not yet distributed to the world's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also promised to offer the software to owners of  
existing Pentium III chips already in production, making it easy to 
permanently turn off the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can choose to activate the technology, which for  
security reasons would require restarting their computers, Intel 
spokesman Chuck Mulloy said Monday. Intel won't need to redesign 
its chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's concession came only hours after a boycott was announced  
in Washington by privacy groups, who launched a campaign complete 
with a parody of the company's ubiquitous ``Intel Inside'' logo. 
Theirs features the familiar swirl but with the words, ``Big 
Brother Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This acknowledges that consumers want Intel inside their  
computer, not inside their private lives,'' said Rep. Ed Markey, 
D-Mass., who urged Intel last week to reconsider its plans. ``It's 
a great victory for consumers and for the privacy rights of all 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel announced last week that its new Pentium III chip would by  
default transmit its unique serial number internally and to Web 
sites that requested it to help verify a user's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Intel said the feature could be turned off but was  
reactivated whenever the computer was restarted. But on Monday, the 
company said that was a misunderstanding: The Pentium's ability to 
transmit its serial number is, in fact, reactivated, but the 
software ``switch'' still disables the feature until the consumer 
chooses to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the technology offers a boon for electronic  
commerce, allowing companies and shoppers to feel more secure in 
the transmission of sensitive data. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups involved in the boycott said they were  
``delighted that Intel has taken one small step toward respecting 
people's privacy,'' but they said the concession was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have the problem of an ID number, and Web sites can  
force people to disclose that ID number as a condition to get into 
the sites,'' said David Banisar, an attorney with the 
Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``Just 
having a software patch does not resolve the underlying concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy information center organized the boycott with  
Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook, N.J., which lobbies on a range of 
high-tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which last year pressed for a law  
that prohibits Web sites from collecting personal information from 
children without parental permission, said the Intel debate 
``highlights consumer concerns about how confidential is various 
information for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time one of these episodes occurs, it escalates,'' said  
Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau. 
``This will certainly resonate on Capitol Hill and with the 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markey, senior Democrat on the House Commerce consumer  
protection subcommittee, compared the technology's risks to a 
consumer browsing through stores in a shopping mall, with the 
shopkeepers sharing details about the consumer's purchases and 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this decision, Intel limits the amount of information  
that a company can gain access to,'' Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the second-largest chipmaker with  
roughly 8 percent of the market, said it doesn't plan to offer 
similar technology in its processors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a market-driven company, and if consumers were to desire  
something like this, we'd give it consideration,'' spokesman Scott 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to making about 85 percent of the world's computer  
processors, Intel also manufactures memory chips plus hardware for 
computer networks, communications and graphics.

outdoors column for The News Sun in Waukegan and edited Illinois 
Hunter magazine for the Illinois Association of Hunting Preserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Case wrote several wild game and fish cookbooks and taught  
fishing and casting. He also helped initiate the construction of 
the state's Jake Wolf Fish Hatchery southwest of Peoria. 
</P>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Julian R. Goldsmith, a University of Chicago  
scientist who served on the National Science Board, died Saturday 
from complications of leukemia. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldsmith's research led to a better understanding of the  
Earth's crust. His work involved the study of minerals under high 
temperatures and high pressures. He won many awards for his 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as president of the Geochemical Society, the  
Mineralogical Society of America and the Geological Society of 
America. President Lyndon Johnson appointed him to the National 
Science Board, which he served on from 1964 to 1970. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	EAST BROOKFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The Rev. Walter Donald Kring, a  
clergyman who became an authority on Herman Melville, died Jan. 15 
of cardiac arrest. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	He led All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City for 23 years  
before stepping down in 1978. He then became minister at the Eliot 
Church in Natick and retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Kring wrote a three-volume history of All Souls, which started  
as the First Congregational Church in 1819. Among his other works 
were ``Henry Whitney Bellows'' (1979) and ``Herman Melville's 
Religious Journey'' (1997). 
</P>
<P>
	While doing research in 1975 for a biography of a 19th-century  
pastor at All Souls, Kring discovered letters that sparked a debate 
that still continues. The missives seemed to confirm rumors that 
Melville, the ``Moby Dick'' author, had been a wife beater and a 
child abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	Kring pursued Melville studies, including those concerning the  
author's religious leanings, and in 1979 he was elected the 
Melville Society's first nonacademic president.

Square. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, she beat out 300 competitors to sing ``Ten Cents a  
Dance'' in Barbara Stanwyck's film of the same name. Later, she was 
the voice of Jean Harlow in ``Reckless'' and sang for other leading 
ladies whose voices were not considered quite up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	She left Hollywood in 1935 for the ``Socony Sketchbook'' on CBS  
radio and recorded with the Isham Jones Orchestra. She returned and 
was seen on screen in ``Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938,'' in which

best-selling memoir on growing up black before the Civil Rights 
era, died Monday at her suburban New York City home. She was 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany and her sister, Bessie, who died in 1995 at the age  
of 106, wrote ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 
Years,'' with journalist Amy Hill Hearth. The memoir, by turns 
poignant and playful, has become a high school and college text as 
well as a play, ``Having Our Say,'' which ran on Broadway in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany, known as Sadie, was the oldest sister of 10 children  
who grew up in Raleigh, N.C. She and her sister documented the iron 
determination of two black women not only to survive but to thrive. 
In their 20s, both women moved to New York and began successful 
careers -- Sarah as a high school teacher, Bessie as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	After their first success, the sisters and Hearth published the  
``Book of Everyday Wisdom,'' which included such tidbits as ``Why 
life was slower when trains were faster.''

<HEADLINE> Existing Home Sales Soar in Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes soared 13.5 percent in  
1998 to 4.78 million, riding low mortgage rates and American 
prosperity to the best year on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales easily surpassed the previous record, 4.21 million, set  
the previous year, the National Association of Realtors said today. 
The group began tracking sales in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, sales rose 3.1 percent from the month before to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.03 million, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong buying demand pushed the inventory of homes for sale,  
1.58 million, to a record low level -- a 3.8 month supply at the 
December sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuous low interest rates and the healthy economy have  
created a steady flow of buyers moving up to second and third 
homes, and they feel comfortable doing so because there are so many 
first-time buyers in a solid position to buy,'' said Realtors 
President Sharon A. Millett. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have remained  
below 7 percent since mid-June, the longest stretch at such a low 
level in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, last year's unemployment rate, at 4.5 percent, was the  
lowest in 29 years. Plus, strong stock market gains have supplied 
many well-off Americans with the werewithal to buy a larger home or 
vacation house. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists expect home sales to remain strong this year, though  
at something less than 1998's record. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong sale propelled a healthy increase in the value of  
many homes. The median price of an existing home last year, meaning 
half sold for more and half for less, was $130,600, up 5.2 percent 
from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, sales in December were strongest in the West, up 4.9  
percent to an annual rate of 1.07 million. In the Midwest, sales 
increased 4.8 percent to a rate of 1.30 million units; in the 
Northeast, 3 percent to a rate of 690,000, and, in the South, 1 
percent to 1.97 million units.

</P>
<P>
	This week, anyone who lacks star appeal or ties to anyone who  
does won't get in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to fill it with anyone with a $20 bill in  
hand,'' said Theodore, whose club is booked with private soirees, 
including official team parties for the Falcons and the Broncos. 
``We are going to try to keep the club selective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the internationally known Spa at Doral, workers prepare to

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Arrest Hearing Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers seeking to uphold Gen. Augusto Pinochet's  
arrest have picked apart nearly a century of British and 
international law to persuade the House of Lords that heads of 
state lose their immunity from prosecution when they torture 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing in Britain's highest court enters its second week  
today with lawyers for Amnesty International asking the seven-judge 
panel to let Spain's request to extradite the former Chilean 
dictator proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old general was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a  
Spanish warrant alleging he ordered killings, torture and 
kidnapping during his 17-year-regime. The Spanish magistrate 
seeking his extradition said Spaniards were among those slain after 
Pinochet toppled the elected Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people were  
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to send a clear message to the world's torturers and  
death squads that they cannot commit their crimes with impunity,'' 
said David Bull, a director of Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was given permission to intervene on the side of  
British and Spanish prosecutors, who are trying to overturn a Nov. 
25 High Court ruling that gave Pinochet immunity from arrest as a 
former head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain and Britain concluded their arguments last  
week, saying that torture is recognized internationally as a crime 
against humanity for which no one is entitled to evade prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested while recuperating from back surgery  
in London, remains under armed guard at a rented mansion west of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers, who are expected to present their case this week,  
contend that the general's arrest violates British law granting 
heads of state immunity for acts performed while they were in 
office. They will be joined by a lawyer representing Chile, which 
says Pinochet's arrest is a threat to the country's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	The legality of the arrest was decided by the House of Lords  
once before. But the court canceled its own 3-2 decision denying 
Pinochet immunity after one of the judges who ruled against him was 
found to have close links with Amnesty International. The court 
ordered a new hearing before a different panel of judges. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again, the long extradition process will  
begin. But if the law lords agree that he has immunity, Pinochet 
would be free to return to Chile, where he is unlikely to face 
trial because of an amnesty law he passed before relinquishing 
power.

<HEADLINE> Sun Unveils Jini Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Technology that could enable people to turn  
on the heat in their homes while on the road or log into a computer 
network through their television was unveiled Monday by Sun 
Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Jini, officially introduced by Sun CEO Scott McNealy and chief  
scientist Bill Joy at Sun's Worldwide Analyst Conference in San 
Francisco, would let users connect by phone or laptop to any device 
as easily as they might make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	The universal Jini software code lets devices ``talk'' to one  
another, regardless of their operating systems. Someone using a 
device loaded with Jini would connect to a main network, which 
would then issue commands for other devices. 
</P>
<P>
	At first the technology will be used by businesses. One example:  
Laptop computer users could connect to a network in an airport 
lounge and have immediate use of a scanner or printer. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, it could be expanded to home computers and an array of  
appliances, including even ovens and dishwashers, Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, the largest maker of computer workstations, said more than  
30 companies have agreed to integrate the technology into their 
products. They include Xerox, Kodak, Motorola, Sony and America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun began developing Jini in 1994 as an extension of Java, its  
universal programming language. It gave developers access to the 
technology six months ago but began offering its code through the 
company Web site on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Jini products are expected sometime this year, ahead  
of similar technology being developed by Microsoft and Lucent 
Technologies.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were slightly lower at midday,  
pulled down by some earnings reports, but the Nasdaq composite was 
helped higher by a Microsoft stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 10.81 at 9,109.86. The Dow opened lower and got as low as 
9,063.26, down 57 points, before recovering and then retreating a 
second time. On Friday, the Dow lost 143.41 to close at 9,120.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were hanging on to moderate gains. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.71 at 1,225.90. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 8.41 at 2,347.29, 
led by Microsoft, up 5 13/16 at 162 1/16. Microsoft's board 
declared a two-for-one common stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers by 4 to 3 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 319.47 million shares, down 
from 355 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component AT&AMP;T was down 1 15/16 at 86 5/16. The  
telecommunications giant said this morning it earned $1.00 a share 
in the fourth quarter, excluding special items. That was up from 70 
cents a year ago and matched analysts' expectations. But revenues 
were up only 4.8 percent -- not enough, traders said, to justfiy 
AT&AMP;T's lofty stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitztgerald, said he  
was concerned that despite ``extraordinary'' price swings in 
technology shares, they haven't really changed much in the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases, that indicat 1/8es 3/8 some type of top'' to the  
market, Meehan said, suggesting that if technology stocks have 
reached a top, the entire market might have. ``It's very 
disconcerting to see that type of action, considering that there is 
very little in the way of leadership outside of technology 
stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among Dow components, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing  
was up 5 3/8 at 76 11/16. 3M announced earnings of 52 cents a share, 
down 42 percent from 89 cents a year earlier. Sales rose less than 
2 percent. But 3M executives said improving foreign exchange rates, 
further cost reductions and new products will help the company 
continue earnings growth in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Merck was down 3 5/16 at 135 11/16. The drug maker  
warned late Friday that it had suffered a setback in the 
development of a new depression treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.38 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.54 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.53 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government said sales of existing homes soared  
13.5 percent in 1998 to 4.78 million, riding low mortgage rates and 
American prosperity to the best year on record.

<HEADLINE> Seattle To Host Global Trade Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seattle won out over five other U.S. cities  
bidding to be the site for the start of a new round of global trade 
talks involving more than 100 countries, the Clinton administration 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshesfky said Seattle would  
play host for the ``largest trade event ever held in the United 
States and it will inaugurate global negotiations, which will shape 
world trade as we move to the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, to be attended by trade ministers from the 133  
nations that are members of the World Trade Organization, is 
scheduled for Nov. 30 to Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle was among six finalists vying for the WTO ministerial.  
The other five cities were Dallas, Detroit, Denver, San Diego and 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address last week, President Clinton  
said the United States would push for the new round of trade talks 
as a way to counter protectionist forces that have been unleashed 
by the 18-month-old global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton raised the prospect of new trade talks in a speech  
to the WTO last May in Geneva, the administration had until 
recently been split over just how broad the discussions should be, 
fearful they could become bogged down as the last round of 
negotiations did. 
</P>
<P>
	Those discussions, known as the Uruguay Round, dragged on for  
nearly eight years from 1986 until 1994. Europe and Japan were both 
pushing for broader talks and the United States eventually relented 
after receiving assurances that the new negotiations can be 
completed in just three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said the deadline was realistic because countries in  
the WTO have prepared for nearly three years for future trade 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions will focus on lowering tariffs on manufactured  
goods and farm products, as well as lowering other trade barriers 
covering trade in services such as banking and insurance and 
increasing copyright and trademark protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said 40 U.S. cities had expressed an interest  
in being host for the trade discussions. They were narrowed to the 
six finalists. The final decision was based on factors including 
convention facilities, hotel rooms, security arrangements and 
offers of assistance from the city, state and private sector, 
Barshefsky said in a statement announcing the choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Seattle marks the second time the  
administration has chosen the Northwest city for an international 
conference. In 1993, Clinton elevated the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum's annual discussions among foreign and trade 
ministers to a summit in Seattle of leaders of the 18 member 
countries in APEC.

<HEADLINE> Mark McGwire Honored in St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This year's St. Louis Baseball Man of the year  
was a no-brainer: Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king, wrapping up his first visit to town since  
hitting No. 70 on Sept. 27, was honored Monday night by the St. 
Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Cardinals teammates still are shaking their heads at his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most fun year I've ever had, just being a part of  
that,'' pitcher Kent Mercker said. ``It was a blast, and I hope it 
happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire came to town three days before the pope's arrival and  
seemingly created the same sort of stir. During his two-hour 
autograph session Sunday at the team's annual winter charity event, 
fans who weren't lucky enough to have won in a raffle for his 
signature crowded around him just for a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, among the honorees at the  
sold-out dinner, said McGwire's feat wasn't the biggest surprise to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised me is the pitchers kept throwing to him,'' said  
Gibson, now a special assistant to American League president Gene 
Budig. ``I would have challenged him. Maybe I had better control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the dinner was an auction for a signed drawing  
depicting McGwire atop a horse. Among the bidders were wives of the 
Cardinals' owners and Cheryl Smith, wife of Missouri football coach 
Larry Smith, who bowed out at $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing ended up fetching $11,000 from a mystery bidder at  
the back of the room who turned out to be Phil Ozersky, the man who 
caught McGwire's 70th home run ball and turned it into a $2.7 
million profit. 
</P>
<P>
	During a lull in the auction, McGwire stepped in for master of  
ceremonies Bob Costas and got the bidding rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is worth more than the ball,'' McGwire said. ``I touched  
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire signed the picture: ``To Phil, nice catch!''  
</P>
<P>
	The only thing missing from McGwire's visit was a summit meeting  
with Pope John Paul II, who's in town Tuesday and Wednesday. 
McGwire was raised Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's not going to be able to work out,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other headliners at the sold-out dinner, which attracted 2,000  
fans, were New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. Torre was fired by the Cardinals in 1995 
after five years as manager, but his Yankees set a major-league 
record last year with 114 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig was being honored for meritorious service to baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Cardinals players were on the list of award-winners;  
outfielder Ray Lankford for outstanding achievement, catcher Eli 
Marrero as the team's rookie of the year, and new outfielder Eric 
Davis for his comeback from colon cancer. Former Cardinals 
outfielder Brian Jordan, who signed a free-agent deal with Atlanta, 
also was honored for outstanding achievements in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock,  
Indians first baseman Jim Thome, Smith and Missouri players Corby 
Jones and Devin West, bowler Pete Weber, umpire Rich Rieker and 
golfer Bob Goalby. Rieker, who is from St. Louis, was working when 
McGwire hit his first and 70th home runs last season, as well as 
his 400th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who threw a touchdown pass at the Senior Bowl on Sunday,  
felt a little out of place given the baseball theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I shouldn't be here,'' Jones said. ``But hey, I'll take  
it.''

<HEADLINE> Same Plane, But Fares Differ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under the new airline partnerships known as  
code shares, passengers with tickets from Northwest and Continental 
airlines can ride on the same plane and earn frequent flier miles 
redeemable from either airline. 
</P>
<P>
	They may be paying vastly different prices for their tickets,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	An airfare analyst compared the cost of the same seat on the  
same plane and found a nearly $600 difference in the price paid for 
a ticket issued by Continental from the same ticket issued by its 
code share partner for the past year, Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, operator of the Internet-based ``Airfare  
Report,'' said the same kind of gap can be found with all of the 
partners in the nation's new string of code shares, including the 
tandems of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, or American 
Airlines and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	The partner with the higher price depends on discounts or the  
route flown. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler's warning sounds familiar: Buyer beware.  
</P>
<P>
	``Code sharing is so widespread, you better be on your toes. You  
better ask every single time, every single flight, 'Is this a code 
share?' And if so, 'With what airline?' and then ask for the price 
on both of them,'' he said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines began code share partnerships as a means of increasing  
investor return, pooling resources and smoothing out travel for 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airlines generally remain separate entities, they  
exchange frequent flier privileges and club memberships and also 
book tickets so travelers from each partner airline can make 
seamless connections no matter which one issues the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, airlines can help fill up each other's planes and  
also reach areas outside their normal network. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean code share passengers traveling on the same  
plane pay the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	To make his point, Trippler booked six different sets of  
flights, with one ticket from Continental and one from Northwest 
for each. While the flights had different numbers, depending on the 
airline issuing the ticket, they were flown on the same Northwest 
or Continental planes and had the same arrival and departure times. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was in the fares.  
</P>
<P>
	A Feb. 6-12 round trip from Newark to Singapore cost $847.31  
from Northwest, but $1,445.31 from Continental. A Feb. 8-10 round 
trip from Cleveland to Boise, Idaho, cost $406 from Northwest, but 
$1,650 from Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest spokesman said that is exactly how the system is  
supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't coordinate. That would be illegal,'' said airline  
spokesman Jon Austin. ``We are competing to sell tickets. On some 
code shares, that means tickets on the same plane, but that doesn't 
lessen the competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain the discrepancy between the Northwest and  
Continental fares, Austin replied: ``I have no idea. That would be 
asking me to read the mind of the Continental marketing folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents and some consumer groups have fought code shares,  
saying the ``virtual merger'' of airlines will eventually stifle 
competition. More immediately, they say they further complicate the 
already puzzling world of airfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Trippler, a former travel agent, said using a travel agent is  
the best protection against paying different prices for tickets 
from code share partners. Some online travel services also offer 
fares from the perspective of both code share partners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seriously doubt that a Northwest agent is going to spend a  
lot of time checking the same ticket as a Continental fare,'' 
Trippler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the Northwest spokesman, said using a travel agent or  
booking directly with an airline ``is a wholly personal decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I think a travel agent is a wonderful thing; I would  
support people who would want to go that way. On the other hand, 
there are people who book on their own or through the Internet, and 
I support that, too.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senators Send Clinton Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and nine  
other Republican senators sent President Clinton written questions 
Monday on unresolved issues in his impeachment trial, but the White 
House said they won't be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 10 questions touches on a subject the Senate has  
approached warily -- Clinton's assertion that only Monica Lewinsky's 
conduct constituted sexual relations, according to a narrow 
definition approved in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it your position that Ms. Lewinsky was lying ... when she  
said that you engaged in conduct with her that constituted 'sexual 
relations' even under your narrow interpretation of the term ...?'' 
Clinton was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cover letter, the senators acknowledged that Clinton was  
not compelled to respond. But the Republicans took advantage of an 
offer Saturday by White House special counsel Gregory Craig, now 
withdrawn, to answer written questions. 
</P>
<P>
	James Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
said senators had the opportunity to ask Clinton's defense team 
questions on the Senate floor. The cover letter asserted, however, 
that only the president could answer many of the questions because 
they ``concern his state of mind or facts that only he is privy 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questions are valuable, however, because they spotlight  
issues that remain on senators' minds as they wrestle with how to 
conduct the remainder of Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the question on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, the  
senators asked the president about the truthfulness of his 
statements under oath, statements he made to his secretary and his 
aides, the retrieval of his gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, his ``cover 
story'' with the former intern, a poll by political consultant Dick 
Morris and Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators asked Clinton whether he stood by his testimony  
that Ms. Lewinsky would have to turn over his gifts to Mrs. Jones' 
lawyers if they were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	They wanted to know who ``ordered and paid for'' a poll by  
political consultant Morris on whether Americans would forgive the 
president if he committed perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the judge in the Jones case instructed all parties  
not to disclose the substance of their depositions, the senators 
asked Clinton about his call to Oval Office secretary Betty Currie 
the day after his sworn testimony. He asked her to come to work the 
next day, a Sunday, to discuss his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was this consistent with Judge (Susan Webber) Wright's  
protective order?'' Clinton was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit on the Jones case,  
denying a sexual affair, the president was asked: ``Did you either 
personally or through some other person participate in any way in 
the preparation'' of the affidavit?

<HEADLINE> Tanker Crashes in Fla., Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- A diesel tanker carrying 9,000 gallons of  
fuel collided Monday with two cars on a major highway west of Fort 
Lauderdale, killing two and injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
	A tanker on a ramp to Interstate 595 hit a car and exploded into  
flames. The fire was contained within 30 minutes, said Todd LeDuc, 
spokesman for Broward County Fire Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The car hit another car and the tanker rolled over, witnesses  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of the two people killed were not immediately  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanker driver and a 25-year-old woman were injured. The  
driver, 46, was in fair condition and the woman was in serious but 
stable condition, hospital spokesman Chuck Malkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	County crews were checking to ensure the fuel had not  
contaminated the water supply, and a hazardous materials team used 
booms to contain the fuel spill, LeDuc said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Making Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government challenged a senior Microsoft  
executive Monday over his denial that he ever uttered an 
often-quoted phrase about his company's aggression toward a rival, 
that he once promised to ``cut off Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational phrase, which underscores the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft, was attributed by one witness to 
Paul Maritz during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its lawsuit, the government alleges that Microsoft  
included Internet browser software free within its dominant Windows 
operating system to try to ``crush'' Netscape, whose browser was 
much more popular during the mid-1990s and earned tens of millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In a charge central to its case, the government contends that by  
flooding the market with its own free browser, Microsoft cut off 
Netscape's opportunity to earn profits on its software. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, though, flatly denied making the statements in written  
testimony submitted to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies confronted Maritz on  
Monday with his sworn statements from last year. Boies said they 
represent a far less adamant denial than Maritz's current 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible, but I just don't recall it,'' Maritz offered  
during earlier interviews with government lawyers. ``I don't 
believe it's something that I would have said.'' He added that he 
``would be skeptical'' if anyone attributed the comments directly 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Boies, Maritz said he recently reviewed the  
notes of three Intel executives at the 1995 meeting who did not 
remember the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe my testimony to be inconsistent then with what  
I am saying now,'' Maritz said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, it wasn't clear who at Microsoft would have  
said that,'' Maritz testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Intel Vice President Steven McGeady, testified  
previously during the trial that Maritz and others from Microsoft 
met with executives in Oregon to discuss technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful  
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady testified. ``... 
It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air supply. By giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from 
getting off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies quizzed Maritz on Monday whether he ever complained to The  
New York Times, which ran a story in January 1998 based on an 
anonymous interview with McGeady attributing the phrase to Maritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz answered: ``Not to my knowledge.'' But he added that he  
was never named in the Times story and that, ``for a long time, it 
wasn't clear who at Microsoft would have said that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times story clearly names Maritz, and Microsoft  
spokesman Mark Murray said later outside court that the company 
called and complained after the article was published. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys earlier confronted McGeady with his own  
notes about the disputed November 1995 meeting, which don't mention 
Maritz's alleged ``air supply'' comment. They also produced notes 
from two other Intel executives, who also didn't include it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be  
an acceptable business practice,'' McGeady testified. ``It stuck 
out clearly in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, a group vice president at Microsoft, is among the most  
senior executive expected to testify at the trial. He is 
responsible for Microsoft's most important products, including its 
dominant Windows operating system and its profitable Office 
software programs.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Riddler Continues To Stump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WYOMING, Mich. (AP) -- ``Pedaling through tree-lined streets in a  
Missouri mood, seeing a road to pick, I went east and ended it 
right, with 46 at my fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So begins this year's riddle for a treasure hunt that's become  
an annual ritual for thousands in western Michigan, across the 
country and even overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year since 1981, Joe Cramer has bicycled across the  
greater Grand Rapids area in search of the perfect hiding place for 
his medallion: a small, oval marker stamped with the particular 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He releases a riddle in November and then offers a clue each  
month in local newspapers until someone finds the marker. If no one 
solves the riddle by March, new clues are released weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize: a silver cup, coins and other items Cramer pays for  
himself. Plus, of course, bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw my fist up in the air, like `Yes, finally!' when I saw  
it,'' recalls Robert Lyon, 51, of Wyoming, a Grand Rapids suburb. 
He found the medallion on a telephone pole guidewire last March 
after a dozen years of trying to solve the annual riddles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the baffling clues Cramer comes up with are about more than  
just stumping participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 years ago, Cramer lost his memory for three years  
because of carbon-monoxide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible,'' recalls Cramer, now 54. ``I could remember  
how to work, but I couldn't remember my family... I'd go for a walk 
around the block and if I lost sight of my house, I wouldn't know 
where I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Cramer improvised.  
</P>
<P>
	To remember a street named Poinsettia, for example, Cramer would  
think ``book'' as in ``read.'' He would then think of the color 
red, and finally the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Cramer's memory eventually returned. Yet instead of forgetting  
what he describes as his ``real odd way of thinking,'' he used it 
to fashion clues for treasure hunts, first for his kids in the 
backyard and then for adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants use maps to find and then physically pick up the  
markers, which means prizewinners are almost always from Michigan. 
Still, that hasn't stopped people from further afield from playing. 
About 11,000 people sent him self-addressed stamped envelopes 
seeking clues for this year's puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who solve the puzzle qualify for a special ``Winner's  
Circle'' riddle, which Cramer tries to make even more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
	Cramer says one woman broke down crying in his office because  
she couldn't solve the riddle, but he offers no special assistance 
to anyone -- not even his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried one riddle about seven or eight years ago, and I  
wasn't even close,'' says Sandie Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Curiosity and obsessiveness are characteristics all the winners  
share, according to Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might be a little hyper,'' he says. ``They're always at  
the puzzle, even on their breaks. They don't sleep well. They take 
great pleasure in working it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 9-year-old won the contest in 1991, after he accidentally  
found the marker while playing at a park near his home. The oldest 
winner: a 91-year-old woman who snuck out of a nursing home to play 
in 1990, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The marker has been found every year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a certain amount of luck involved in  
winning,'' says Kathy McRae, 46, who cracked the puzzle two years 
in a row with the help of her family. ``We have seven children and 
it's nice to have stuff they can put their ideas in on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the contest's 18th riddle, and Cramer has no plans to  
stop making puzzles anytime soon, lest he forget about his own 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so very grateful I got my memory back. I can't express  
it,'' he says. ``I lost it all and got it back.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 3M 4Q Profits Fall 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.'s  
profit tumbled 42 percent in the fourth quarter, but beat Wall 
Street expectations and sent the company's stock price higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfavorable currency exchange rates and weakness in the Asian  
economy were cited Monday for the earnings decline. Sales were up 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive L.D. DeSimone said 3M expects to  
resume earnings growth in 1999 ``driven by new products, greater 
productivity gains and tight expense controls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, also known as 3M, earned $211 million, or 52 cents  
a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $366 million, or 
89 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales edged up 1.9 percent to $3.79 billion from $3.71 billion  
in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were depressed by a $99 million charge for  
restructuring and a $38 million charge for debt refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding onetime charges, its earnings were 86 cents a share.  
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 80 cents a share 
on average. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 3M shares closed up  
$3.81 1/4 at $75.12 1/2 -- a rise of more than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Scotch brand tape and Post-it Notes said currency  
effects reduced earnings by about 5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales growth was affected by continued weakness in  
Asia Pacific economies and by economic slowdown in Latin America 
and parts of Europe. In addition, the company deliberately slowed 
factory production in the fourth quarter to bring inventory levels 
into better alignment with demand, reducing inventories by about 9 
percent from the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	3M is continuing its effort to cut 4,500 jobs, about 6 percent  
of its worldwide work force, by the end of 1999. About 2,000 jobs 
were cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, 3M earned $1.18 billion, or $2.88 per share,  
compared with $2.12 billion, or $5.06 per share, in 1997. Sales 
totaled $15.02 billion, compared with $15.07 billion.

<HEADLINE> Oakland A's Sign Outfielder Raines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Free agent outfielder Tim Raines, the  
only member of the World Series champion New York Yankees not 
re-signed by the team, has agreed to a one-year contract with the 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines will get $600,000 plus a bonus of $50,000 if he is named  
an All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old hit .290 in 109 games with the Yankees, who won  
an AL-record 114 games last season. He walked 55 times for a .395 
on-base percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, a 20-year veteran with a .296 career average, leads all  
active players with 112 triples, and ranks second with 1,528 runs 
scored and 803 stolen bases. He ranks fourth with 1,264 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raines will definitely be a welcome addition in the A's  
clubhouse this season,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ``He knows what 
it takes to win and he'll show the youngsters the way to go. It 
will be nice to have his bat in the lineup or on the bench to use 
in key situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines made his debut in Montreal in 1979 and was a seven-time  
All-Star with the Expos. His best overall season was in 1987 when 
he hit .330 with 68 RBI, 18 home runs, 90 walks, 50 steals and 123 
runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 season, Raines was traded to the White Sox. He  
spent five seasons in Chicago before being dealt to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines averaged .299 in three seasons with the Yankees.

	Dismissal of Clinton Case Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate closed its doors today to debate a  
Democratic attempt to dismiss all charges against President Clinton 
and bring his impeachment trial to an end. The senators deliberated 
into the night in a rare secret session. An attempt by two 
Democrats to open debate was rejected by a vote of 57-43. 
Meanwhile, House prosecutors pressed their case for testimony by 
Monica Lewinsky and a shortened list of additional witnesses. House 
Republicans are expected to produce a formal proposal for witnesses 
tomorrow, to be voted on after the Democratic attempt to dismiss 
the charges. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Won't Answer Senate Questions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said today that President  
Clinton won't answer written questions on issues in his impeachment 
trial sent to him by Republican senators. In a letter, the senators 
had acknowledged that Clinton was not compelled to respond. James 
Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office, said 
senators had the opportunity to ask Clinton's defense team 
questions on the Senate floor. The letter asserted, however, that 
only the president could answer many of the questions.

	87 Killed in Colombia Quake  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At least 87 people were killed and  
nearly 850 injured when an earthquake struck western Colombia 
today. The early afternoon quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6, 
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. Its 
epicenter was located in western Valle del Cauca state, 140 miles 
from the capital, Bogota. The death and damage toll appeared to be 
highest in Armenia, Pereira, and Calarca -- three cities near the 
epicenter. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Admits Iraq Missile Mistake  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes targeting Iraqi air defense  
installations apparently misfired today and at least one missile 
may have resulted in civilian deaths, Pentagon officials said. Gen. 
Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, said 
it was premature to consider whether an official apology would be 
appropriate in the event that the United States confirms its 
missiles caused civilian casualties. In Iraq, Basra governor Ahmed 
Ibrahim Hamash said two American aircraft fired five missiles that 
killed 11 people and injured 59. 

</P>
<P>
	$3 Billion Sought for New Embassies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, concerned about  
security shortcomings at U.S. diplomatic missions, is expected to 
seek $3 billion for the construction of new embassies between 2001 
and 2005, a senior official said today. The official said the 
figure precedes a State Department-appointed panel recommendation 
earlier this month that $14 billion be spent over 10 years to 
overcome security deficiencies. The panel was appointed after the 
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last August. 

</P>
<P>
	Jordan's King Names Successor  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan announced today that King Hussein's  
oldest son would replace the king's brother, Hassan, as future 
successor to the throne. A royal decree reported by the state-run 
Petra News Agency named Abdullah, 36, as crown prince. Sources say 
the king removed Hassan, the successor since 1965, because of 
unhappiness over his brother's actions as regent during Hussein's 
six-month absence for cancer treatment. 

</P>
<P>
	Court Rejects Census Method  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled today that the 2000  
census cannot use statistical sampling, a decision making it more 
likely millions of people will be left out. The 5-4 ruling requires 
the traditional nose count to determine how many members of 
Congress each state should have. 

</P>
<P>
	Health Care Costs Seen Rising  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A survey of employers predicts the cost of  
providing health benefits for workers will rise 9 percent this 
year, the biggest increase in seven years. In 1998, health benefits 
costs rose 6.1 percent, Mercer said. Employers blamed the increases 
on rising premiums charged by health plans and skyrocketing drug 
costs. To deal with rising costs, employers are continuing to drop 
coverage for retirees and are reducing drug benefits for some 
active workers.

	Dow Rises 82.65  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated all day and ended mostly  
higher. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 82.65 at 9,203.32. Declining issues on 
the New York Stock Exchange led advancers 1,552-1,460. The Nasdaq 
was up 30.23 to 2,369.11.

choice for No. 1 in The Associated Press women's basketball poll 
today. Purdue (16-1), Louisiana Tech (15-2) and Georgia (18-1) held 
the next three places, with Purdue and Louisiana Tech getting one 
first-place vote apiece.

<HEADLINE> Estrogen Helps Keep Hearts Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Estrogen supplements not only improve a woman's  
cholesterol levels but reduce other substances in the blood that 
raise the risk of a heart attack or stroke, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that giving healthy women estrogen or estrogen  
combined with cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with 
reduced inflammatory and clotting factors in the blood, said Dr. 
Richard Cannon III, the lead author of the study in today's issue 
of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Such factors contribute to the clogging of blood vessels, said  
Cannon, acting chief of the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute's cardiology branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that hormone replacement therapy, especially  
estrogen, can help fend off the ravages of aging and related 
diseases. It has been shown to reduce the ``bad'' low-density 
cholesterol (LDL) and raise the ``good'' high-density cholesterol 
(HDL). But cholesterol is just one of many contributors to vessel 
clogging. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies suggest its benefits even extend to protecting  
against Alzheimer's disease. According to a 1998 study at Mt. Sinai 
Hospital in New York, a dwindling number of cells in the 
hippocampus is linked to low estrogen levels. The hippocampus is a 
region of the brain involved with memory. 
</P>
<P>
	But estrogen replacement therapy carries risks, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Studies show it can increase the risk of breast cancer and  
endometrial cancer because the hormone can fuel the rampant growth 
of abnormal cells in some tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	And, elevated levels of the hormone can block the effects of  
tamoxifen, a powerful but controversial cancer drug that has been 
used for 20 years in advanced cases of breast cancer and other 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the researchers examined cholesterol  
levels, clotting factors and inflammation in blood samples from 28 
women who were an average age of 57 and had relatively high levels 
of LDL. The women received three treatments, each for six weeks: 
estrogen, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin and a 
combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	One test measured plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),  
which blocks the body's ability to dissolve blood clots and is an 
indicator of blood clotting. Another test was for E-selectin, a 
molecule whose levels indicate inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	After estrogen treatment, levels of PAI-1 were reduced by about  
40 percent. With combination treatment, the levels fell 24 percent. 
But the levels were unchanged after simvastatin treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar results occurred for E-selectin. With combination  
treatment and with estrogen treatment alone, E-selectin levels were 
reduced by about 20 percent. With simvastatin alone, the levels 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study is needed, according to one scientist who wasn't  
involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the effect of estrogen on markers of inflammation and  
clotting in the study are encouraging, it's uncertain how these 
results will translate into a reduction in heart attacks and other 
clinical events,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at 
Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only large-scale test results available are from the Heart  
Estrogen Replacement Study, which looked at women who had a history 
of cardiovascular disease, Manson said. The trials showed that 
women with prior cardiovascular diseases who were treated with 
estrogen and progestin actually showed an increase in heart attacks 
in the first year of treatment.

<HEADLINE> Times Restaurant Critic to Gourmet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ruth Reichl, The New York Times restaurant  
critic who became so influential that her photo was posted in the 
kitchens of top eateries, is becoming editor in chief of Gourmet 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reichl, who started at the Times in 1993, will leave at the  
end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a little girl, I'd pick up Gourmet and read about  
the good life,'' she said in a statement. ``I've been reading the 
magazine ever since, but the notion of what makes life good has 
changed a lot since then. I'm thrilled to have the challenge of 
expanding the definition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times has not yet named Ms. Reichl's replacement. She  
replaces Gail Zweigenthal, who has been editor in chief at Gourmet 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruth has brought the art of food writing into the modern  
age,'' said James Truman, editorial director for Conde Nast, which 
publishes Gourmet. ``Through her criticism, which is passionate, 
sophisticated, and completely down to earth, she has helped to 
change the way people think about eating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reichl previously owned a restaurant in California, wrote  
for magazines and was food editor for the Los Angeles Times. She 
has written two books, including a critically acclaimed memoir, 
``Tender to the Bone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike her more formal predecessors, Ms. Reichl's columns are  
quirky first-person accounts that are as likely to include 
overheard conversations as poetic descriptions of food. 
</P>
<P>
	She often wears disguises -- wigs, makeup, fake fingernails and  
jewelry -- to make sure she doesn't get special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after joining the Times, Ms. Reichl made a splash by  
writing about two different experiences she had at Le Cirque -- when 
she went as a nobody, then as herself. 
</P>
<P>
	On the latter visit, the restaurant's owner told her: ``The king  
of Spain is waiting in the bar, but your table is ready.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Criticized for Firing Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The firing of the editor of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association over a sex survey published to 
coincide with President Clinton's impeachment trial has brought a 
chorus of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial posted on the Internet over the weekend, the  
editor of the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet said 
AMA Executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. should 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson ``brutally treated an internationally respected editor  
and brought the AMA to what most observers thought was impossible: 
a new and sinking low in its history,'' wrote The Lancet's editor, 
Dr. Richard Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former editors of at least seven other medical  
journals have also denounced the Chicago-based AMA for firing Dr. 
George Lundberg on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson criticized Lundberg for publishing a survey in JAMA  
that showed 59 percent of college students questioned did not 
consider oral-genital contact to be sex. Anderson felt the survey 
inappropriately interjected JAMA into the debate surrounding the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA Chairman Randolph Smoak called Horton's demand for  
Anderson's resignation ``very irresponsible'' and said the AMA 
stood by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not know the details that led to this decision,''  
Smoak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg was editor of JAMA for 17 years.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Lundberg said he was ``enormously gratified by  
the outpouring of support.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Goes On Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A respected Baptist preacher was a con man  
who looked people in the eye and smoothly swindled millions to 
finance a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons ``led two totally different lives. He led  
one public life ... but there was a second side, a hidden side to 
Henry J. Lyons, a side that caused him to be brought here to this 
seat,'' Assistant State Attorney Robert Lewis said in opening 
statements at Lyons' racketeering and grand theft trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Lyons, president of the National Baptist  
Convention USA, said he is a humble leader who acted as 
``gatekeeper'' for a powerful black church organization being 
courted by white businessmen. Now, he is being held accountable for 
their failures, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His endorsement of their product was more important than  
Michael Jordan's,'' defense lawyer Grady Irvin said of one company 
seeking to market credit cards to the convention. ``They wanted 
access from the gatekeeper and they were willing to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Lyons' and co-defendant Bernice Edwards' deals failed to  
profit the corporations, said Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	People came to ... the gatekeeper ... and he did the best that  
he could,'' Irvin said. ``He may have made mistakes, but that's not 
a crime. And that's the untold story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 56, and Ms. Edwards, 42, are charged with racketeering,  
accused of devising elaborate schemes to divert more than $4 
million intended for the convention to buy expensive homes, diamond 
jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft for allegedly stealing  
$250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money 
intended to rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed that man because he was so smooth, appeared to  
be so sincere, made eye contact, appeared to have nothing but the 
National Baptist Convention's interests as his motivator,'' Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' lawyers maintain the money was in an account for the  
black churches, and he simply hadn't distributed it when the 
charges came down. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has survived attempts to oust him as president of the  
National Baptist Convention, but has lost much of his power and 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the pulpit, he wielded political clout as leader of a group  
that claimed to have 8.5 million members -- making it the largest 
black church organization in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons faces a similar trial on 54 federal charges of bank fraud,  
wire fraud, extortion and money laundering. He has proclaimed 
innocence in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and federal cases center in large part on Lyons' and  
Ms. Edwards' dealings with the world's second-largest funeral 
company, The Loewen Group, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wanted to attract customers in the black community,  
where people traditionally seek out independent black funeral 
directors. Lyons was to deliver black Baptists and the convention 
would receive 33 percent of sales through commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, prosecutors say, just $187,600 of Loewen's money went  
to market cemetery plots, while more than $1.6 million went to 
Lyons, his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, Lyons' alleged mistress and the convention's former  
public relations director, had asked that their cases be tried 
separately -- partly because she'd hoped Lyons could testify on her 
behalf -- but that motion was denied.

<HEADLINE> Navy Rape-Murder Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Seven men charged in a gang rape and slaying  
of a newly married Navy wife all stabbed the victim to ensure that 
each of them would be equally culpable, a defendant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danial J. Williams said he and his friends agreed that if each  
of them raped and stabbed Michelle Moore-Bosko, they would be less 
inclined to implicate the others if ever charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 26, of Owosso, Mich., pleaded guilty to rape and  
murder Friday in a deal that spares him a possible death sentence. 
Four others are scheduled for trial next month; two are expected to 
plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will be sentenced to life in prison without  
parole, told prosecutors he had become obsessed with Ms. 
Moore-Bosko, 18, who lived in the same apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 8, 1997, according to Williams, the seven barged into  
her apartment, took turns raping her while others held her down and 
covered her mouth, all stabbed her and Williams then strangled her. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven were active in the Navy or had recently left the  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bosko, 19, found his wife's body on July 9 when he  
returned home from a week-long Navy cruise.

<HEADLINE> Top Pick Leaves Italy for Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi's great European adventure ended  
after only six games, three weeks ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick in the NBA draft was released Monday from his  
contract with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League, freeing him to 
join the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center arrived in Italy on Jan. 5, joining Kinder  
about 24 hours before the NBA and its players agreed to a deal that 
ended the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was to pay Olowokandi $600,000 and keep him with  
Kinder until Feb. 15, but a club source, speaking on the condition 
he not be identified, said the team decided to let him go now to 
save money and because he failed to make the expected impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was time to leave and head to the team that drafted  
me,'' the 23-year-old center said. ``I learned my basketball in the 
United States, and I'm ready for my transition from college ball to 
the NBA, which is what I always wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will leave Bologna by the end of the week and head to  
California. The Clippers opened training camp Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can be with the Clippers ASAP. I don't intend to  
waste any time,'' Olowokandi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 7.7 points and 5.8 rebounds in six games with Kinder  
as his playing time steadily dwindled. He was slowed at times by 
tendinitis in his right knee, and lamented that the team rarely 
used him as a focal point on offense 
</P>
<P>
	Three other players also jumped to Europe right before the  
lockout was resolved: Vlade Divac, Arvydas Sabonis and Vinny Del 
Negro. Last week, Divac signed with the Sacramento Kings and 
Sabonis rejoined the Portland Trail Blazers. Del Negro is still 
with TeamSystem Bologna of the Italian League, but an escape clause 
allows him to leave after Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, who was born in Nigeria and raised in England,  
played just five minutes Sunday in Kinder's 84-67 win over 
first-place Varese. 
</P>
<P>
	``After yesterday's game, I just felt it was time to leave,'' he  
said. ``They had pushed me to stay. But they have their team and 
it's time for me to go back to my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi played at Pacific, where his averages went from 4.0  
points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.32 blocks in his first season to 22.2, 
11.2 and 2.88 in his third and last year, prompting the Clippers to 
take him with the first overall pick in June's draft.

<HEADLINE> Starr Seeks To Seal Secret Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr has asked a judge to  
bar an indicted figure in the Kathleen Willey investigation from 
disclosing secret investigative materials her lawyers receive in 
preparing for her trial, saying the release of the materials could 
seriously jeopardize his ongoing probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr requested the protective order in the case of Julie Hiatt  
Steele, a Richmond, Va., woman charged with obstruction of justice 
and making up a false story that cast doubt on Mrs. Willey's 
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton. Ms. 
Steele was indicted earlier this month and denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government still has pending criminal investigations  
related'' to the Monica Lewinsky controversy, Starr told the court 
in seeking the protective order. ``Disclosure of some of the 
discovery materials the government may provide poses a substantial 
risk of impeding and influencing those investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also argued that ``some of the discovery materials are  
sensitive, and disclosure beyond that necessary to prepare a 
defense could impact the interests of the parties in this indicted 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor was not more specific about which aspects of his  
investigation might be adversely affected by any disclosures. He 
requested that secret materials shared with Ms. Steele during the 
discovery process of her trial be restricted only to her defense 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's motion noted that Ms. Steele's lawyers refused  
to voluntarily agree to the restriction. Nancy Luque, one of Ms. 
Steele's lawyers, declined comment Monday on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was indicted earlier this month by a grand jury in  
Alexandria, Va., on three counts of obstruction of justice and one 
count of false statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing  
a false affidavit in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against 
Clinton, lying to two grand juries and attempting to influence the 
testimony of other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers had used Ms. Steele's testimony in an  
effort to cast doubt on the credibility of Mrs. Willey, a former 
White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance toward her in the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies Mrs. Willey's accusation, which became a focus of  
Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In his testimony in the 
Jones lawsuit, the president said Mrs. Willey ``was not telling the 
truth'' and that her credibility had been ``pretty well 
shattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment notes that a lawyer for Clinton approached Ms.  
Steele in January 1998 to get her to file the affidavit and that 
she initially refused, then changed her mind. Ms. Steele eventually 
filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit alleging that Mrs. Willey 
never told her about the alleged advance as she had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr alleged the affidavit and Ms. Steele's subsequent  
testimony before two federal grand juries were false. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele ``well knew and believed'' Mrs. Willey had told her  
about the alleged sexual advance shortly after it happened and 
``even related information about Mrs. Willey's account of the 
incident to several of defendant Steele's friends'' as early as 
1993, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also charged that Ms. Steele ``repeatedly  
attempted'' to convince two friends that she hadn't told them about 
the Willey incident, even though she had. At the time, one of the 
friends was being sought by FBI agents for questioning.

<HEADLINE> 87 Dead in Colombia Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An earthquake struck western Colombia on  
Monday, killing at least 87 people and injuring nearly 850 as it 
toppled buildings across the country's coffee-growing heartland, 
police and radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The early afternoon quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6,  
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. Its 
epicenter was located in western Valle del Cauca state, 140 miles 
west of the capital, Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The death and damage toll appeared to be highest in Armenia,  
Pereira and Calarca -- three cities near the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center of Calarca doesn't exist. Only the hospital was  
left standing,'' truck driver Jose Marcos told Radionet radio from 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Calarca, 90 miles west of Bogota, at least 30 people died and  
250 were injured, RCN reported, citing local morgue officials in 
the town of 50,000. Several aftershocks were felt there but it was 
not clear if they added to the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Armenia had at least 50 dead and more than 500 injured,  
according to the Colombian Red Cross. Radio reports put the death 
toll there as high as 100. Radio reports said several buildings on 
the city's main plaza, including a bank and the police barracks, 
had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to measure this crisis,'' said the mayor of  
Armenia, Alvaro Pulido, adding that thousands of people had been 
left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood and medical supplies were being rushed from Bogota to  
hospitals in the disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports in Pereira and Armenia were shut down, and officials  
said the control tower at the Armenia airport had tumbled to the 
ground. Landslides caused by the earthquake closed several major 
highways, including the roads connecting Armenia, Pereira and 
Calarca with Bogota, federal highway officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Argentine soccer players said to be members of the Colombian  
professional club Atletico Quindio were reported among those 
trapped in the ruins of a hotel in downtown Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel receptionist told Caracol radio she heard three men in  
the rubble call out for help and then go silent. One city hospital 
alone had received more than 500 injured, RCN radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Television footage showed residents frantically trying to  
extract victims trapped below the debris of a fallen building in 
the city, the capital of Quindio state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pereira, a city of 550,000 people and capital of Risaralda  
state, at least seven people died and 70 were injured, police said. 
Mayor Luis Alberto Duque declared a 12-hour curfew to aid rescue 
efforts and said the death toll was likely to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 houses were damaged and some crumbled beneath the  
impact of the powerful temblor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images from Pereira showed several demolished  
buildings, a taxi flattened under fallen debris and the body of a 
woman trapped under the rubble. Firefighters battled blazes and 
smoke billowed from burning buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Offices and apartments rattled and swayed in Bogota, where the  
quake was felt for about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	President Andres Pastrana delayed a trip to Europe and was  
flying by helicopter from the capital to Pereira, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake was felt in most of the country.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Panel Expels 6 Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
is hoping that the unprecedented ouster of some of its top 
officials will help restore the credibility of the world's largest 
sporting event after its biggest ethics scandal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said he hopes the  
housecleaning and the continuing investigation will repair the 
Olympics' tainted image and placate corporate sponsors who finance 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning, not the end of our work,'' Samaranch  
said Sunday. ``I am certain that the Olympic movement will emerge 
from the crisis stronger than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch took no personal responsibility for the improper  
behavior of IOC members accused of soliciting cash payments and 
other favors in exchange for selecting Salt Lake City as the site 
for 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But he apologized and pledged to root out misconduct once and  
for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not have happened,'' he said. ``I am sorry. I hope  
the decisions we made today will demonstrate our resolve to never 
let this happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also said he would not resign but will seek a vote of  
confidence at a special IOC meeting March 17-18. That same 
gathering will consider whether the ouster of six members should be 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	With its future at stake, the International Olympic Committee  
acted swiftly and decisively Sunday in ousting the members. Three 
others have resigned, raising to nine the number of delegates 
purged so far for alleged misconduct in Salt Lake City's winning 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said three other members -- including a senior executive  
board official and contender for the IOC presidency -- remain under 
investigation and could also face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	An inquiry found that eight IOC members had pocketed more than  
$440,000 in cash and excessive gifts and services. One, Jean-Claude 
Ganga of the Republic of Congo, received more than $216,000, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch urged the six to ``accept their fate'' and quit. But  
several have declared they intend to resist expulsion, including 
Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not include the payments made to the three  
members who resigned, two still under investigation and one who 
died. If those members are included, IOC Vice President Dick Pound 
said he believed the total is close to $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound said the members were not guilty of bribery or  
criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we saw in most cases was an exercise in bad  
judgment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The members recommended for expulsion were Ganga, Agustin Arroyo  
of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita 
of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthonius Geesink of the Netherlands was issued a warning.  
</P>
<P>
	David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland resigned Sunday. Finland's  
Pirjo Haeggman and Libya's Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi resigned last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under investigation were Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the  
Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said those three could also be expelled.  
</P>
<P>
	The threat of sanctions against Kim and Smirnov could trigger a  
nasty political battle in the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is one of the most powerful figures in the IOC. A senior  
executive board member, he has been considered one of the leading 
candidates to succeed Samaranch when his final term expires in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake  
scandal. Other inquiries -- some potentially more damaging -- are 
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice 
Department and FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would broaden its investigation to  
examine allegations of misconduct in other bids stretching from the 
games of 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed the 2000 Summer Games would proceed in Sydney,  
Australia, and that Salt Lake would keep its games, despite the 
scandal that now encompasses both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympics chief John Coates disclosed last week that  
he offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the 
night before Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes in the 1993 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the offer was not a bribe but part of an assistance  
program for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would send two top officials to Sydney to look  
into the controversy. But he said no formal investigation had been 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced the creation of an ethics commission, composed  
mainly of independent officials outside the IOC, to police the way 
the committee and its members do business. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also recommended a radical change in the selection  
process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to 
bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be 
selected this June by a 15-person body rather than the full 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure for future Olympic selections will be decided  
after the 2006 vote.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Real Slips on Semi-Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency slipped further  
Monday as the country's biggest market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The real ended the day 1.79 to the dollar, down from 1.71 on  
Friday. But there was little trading because of a local holiday in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and financial center. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange ended the day down 0.7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders said an unidentified foreign bank bought  
dollars early Monday, pushing the real's value lower. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, the Central Bank let the real float against the  
dollar after four years of spending its reserves to keep the 
currency strong and inflation down. Since the devaluations began, 
the real has lost 32 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was prompted by the outflow of dollars, as  
investors lost confidence in Brazil's ability to fix its economy. 
More than $45 billion have left the country since August. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expected the dollar drain to stop after the  
devaluation, but it didn't. About $7.5 billion has left the country 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses have raised speculation that the government might  
restrict the remittances of dollars. But a top official on Monday 
said that wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There no chance the government will use currency controls,''  
National Treasury chief Eduardo Guimaraes said in an interview with 
the Estado news agency.

<HEADLINE>  After 70, What's Next for McGwire? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The pressure already is on Mark McGwire to top  
himself, now that even his own manager has raised the bar of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa predicted at a weekend  
luncheon that McGwire could hit 75 home runs next season. In 
private he maintained he was kidding, but he certainly seemed 
serious enough when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-five, his number, times three, is 75. And I think  
that's what he's going to do this year,'' La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, La Russa wondered how many home runs baseball's  
premier slugger could have belted last season if only he hadn't 
also drawn a National League-record 162 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on whether they pitch to him,'' La Russa said.  
``If they give him enough at-bats, the sky is the limit with Mac. 
Are they going to give him enough at bats? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's such a good hitter that he has a chance to do amazing  
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lofty prediction didn't bother McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love challenges,'' he said. ``I think we all know he was  
joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, like La Russa, he proceeded to consider the possibilities.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I look back at last year and look at the numbers, 162  
walks and I hit 70 home runs, I mean, I amaze myself,'' McGwire 
said. ``I'm in awe that I did what I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``One hundred sixty-two walks is a lot of walks, that's not a  
lot of pitches to hit. Everybody thought getting to 60 or 61 would 
be a feat and I can only imagine the pressure to go 10 more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was the headline attraction at the team's ``Winter  
Warmup'' charity fundraising event for fans, signing about 250 
autographs for lucky raffle winners and attracting a huge crowd of 
onlookers throughout the two-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some stars who sign like robots, McGwire also took the  
time to chat with his admirers, especially the children. He said 
he's always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a second to look somebody in the eye and say `Thank  
you, and how's your day,' '' McGwire said. ``It goes a long ways. 
The kids were so cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he hasn't changed since his record-smashing year  
but his life has. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I can't go anywhere without being recognized,'' he  
said. ``I thought it would be sort of easy living in Southern 
California and getting away with it, but it turns out no. It's been 
an interesting winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's had a lot of fun, too. A highlight of his time off was  
appearing on ``The Late Show With David Letterman,'' where he 
appeared more jittery than at any time during his record chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I was a little amped,'' McGwire said with a chuckle. ``I  
was nervous. You're out of your element, you know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other highlights were visits with actors Robin Williams and Sean  
Pean, and an acting stint on an episode of ``Mad About You'' that 
airs Feb. 22. He's always been a big fan of the show and a bonus 
was a screen kiss with co-star Helen Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be persuaded to do it, because it wasn't my cup of  
tea,'' McGwire said. ``But I got to kiss Helen, so what the heck? I 
didn't mess up. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen teammates and former Cardinals players,  
including Hall of Famers Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Red 
Schoendienst, signed autographs to raise money for the team's 
charity, Cardinal Care. The event is expect to top last year's 
total of $267,000.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo To Close 4 Frito-Lay Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frito-Lay is closing four of its oldest  
production plants and is expanding five others while parent PepsiCo 
Inc. is swapping bottling operations with its biggest independent 
bottler. 
</P>
<P>
	Both moves announced Monday are designed to make the soft drink  
and snack food conglomerate more competitive by increasing 
productivity at Frito-Lay and creating bottlers big enough to serve 
sprawling retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Frito-Lay plants being closed over the next six to  
eight months employ 850 people, Frito-Lay executives said. They are 
in Chamblee, Ga., Salisbury, N.C., Jackson, Miss., and Marlborough, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Lay's, Doritos and Tostitos chips will expand  
capacity at five other plants in a move that could add 400 jobs 
there. Those plants are in Lynchburg, Va., Jonesboro, Ark., 
Fayetteville, Tenn., Perry, Ga., and Killingly, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The net impact would be to reduce Frito-Lay's domestic work  
force of about 40,000 people by about 450 jobs, or a bit more than 
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will result in a charge of about $120 million before  
taxes over two quarters against PepsiCo earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo, the Purchase, N.Y.-based conglomerate that owns the  
nation's second-largest soft drink company as well as the biggest 
snack food maker, also announced Monday it is swapping bottling 
operations with its biggest independent bottler, Whitman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get rights to bottle Pepsi products in several  
Midwestern states and in Eastern Europe in exchange for a 
combination of cash, stock and bottling rights in Virginia, West 
Virginia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottling deal continued PepsiCo's efforts to consolidate  
bottling of Pepsi-Cola products at a smaller number of large 
bottling businesses. The bigger bottlers are expected to serve 
expanding retail customers better. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo plans to sell a majority stake in its company-owned  
bottling business, which accounts for about 54 percent of the 
volume of Pepsi-Cola products sold domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	That would free PepsiCo to focus on marketing its beverages and  
selling concentrate to the bottlers. Coca-Cola Co., the soft drink 
industry leader, has used that organizational setup for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman is its biggest independent bottler, accounting for about  
12 percent of Pepsi's domestic sales volume. After the deal 
announced Monday, it would handle about 17 percent of U.S. Pepsi 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get PepsiCo bottling territories in Illinois,  
Indiana, Missouri and Ohio as well as in the Czech Republic, the 
Slovak Republic, Hungary and Poland. Those businesses generated 
$720 million in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo will get about $300 million in cash, stock representing  
about a 35 percent stake in Whitman and bottling operations in 
Marion, Va., Princeton, W. Va., and St. Petersburg, Russia, with 
combined 1998 revenue of about $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo currently owns 20 percent of Whitman's bottling  
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerate also announced Monday that it expects to report  
next week that it earned 24 cents a share in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That reflects a gain of 19 cents a share due to its November  
settlement of a tax case with the Internal Revenue Service 
involving its soft drink concrentrate operations in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	That gain will be nearly offset by charges of 17 cents a share  
in the quarter for the costs that Russia's economic crisis has had 
on its business there, the first part of the Frito-Lay plant 
realignments and the costs of separating its soft drink concentrate 
and bottling operations in North America.

<HEADLINE> Infomercial Guru, Wife, Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An infomercial con artist and his wife were  
sentenced Monday to 24 years in prison each for swindling customers 
with a get-rich-quick real estate scheme promising no debts, lower 
taxes and early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	William J. McCorkle and his wife, Chantal, were sentenced for  
fraud and money laundering stemming from a scheme worth more than 
$72 million in sales of videotapes, books and seminars promising a 
business partnership that would never exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of federal guidelines, their sentences were harsher than  
if they'd been found guilty of second-degree murder or raping a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge acknowledged that fact, but said she found no  
compelling reason to deviate from the guidelines established by 
Congress. The couple could have each received more than 31 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is troubling. The defendants are young. They have no  
prior record of any consequence,'' U.S. District Judge Patricia 
Fawsett said. ``This is an extremely stiff sentence. It gives me 
great pause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 24-year, four-month sentences, McCorkle, 32,  
and Mrs. McCorkle, 30, were ordered to perform 50 hours of 
community service when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
	The boyish-looking McCorkle was a familiar face to viewers of  
late-night television. In 28-minute infomercials, he would talk 
enthusiastically about how he had gone from a poor child who was 
once evicted from his family's home to a real-estate millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	With a near evangelistic zeal, he claimed he could help  
customers ``Pay off your debts, lower your taxes and retire in two 
years or less ...'' Viewers saw the fruits of his wealth: yacht, 
luxury home, helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle's companies sold videos and pamphlets that promised to  
teach customers how to make money on foreclosed real estate. 
Federal prosecutors said McCorkle misled customers and refused to 
issue refunds when they were dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it has identified 1,124 people who put their  
faith in McCorkle, who four times failed an exam for his real 
estate license. Before starting his telemarketing businesses in 
1990, he worked as a busboy and exotic dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of McCorkle's associates also were sentenced to five years  
each for fraud conspiracy.

<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Point guard Bobby Hurley, who  
led Duke to consecutive NCAA titles in the early 1990s, was waived 
by the Vancouver Grizzlies on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired in a four-player deal that sent Otis Thorpe to  
Sacramento last Feb. 18, Hurley played in 27 of the Grizzlies final 
30 games of the season, averaging 4.5 points and 17 minutes a game. 
Not fitting into the team's plans, the 27-year-old from New Jersey 
had not even been invited to training camp last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley, a five-year NBA veteran, suffered life-threatening  
injuries in a two-car accident during his rookie season with the 
Kings. Hurley had eight hours of surgery to repair a torn trachea. 
He also suffered injuries to his ribs, right knee, left shoulder

<HEADLINE> Bullet Trains' U.S. Future in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida had what seemed to be a visionary plan  
to reduce airport crowding and traffic congestion: Build a 200-mph 
train that would whisk tourists and the like between Orlando, Tampa 
and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's new governor, Jeb Bush, killed the project nine  
days after taking office. The move cast doubt not only on the 
future of high-speed rail in Florida, but also in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day, the General Accounting Office told Congress  
that most of the 10 other high-speed corridors under development in 
the United States ``have not determined their funding sources'' -- a 
stop, look and listen warning for high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 include the Gulf Coast, the Texas Triangle, Midwest  
corridors between Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and Minneapolis, plus 
similar tracks through California, the Southeast, upstate New York 
and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors concluded: ``These systems may be an effective  
alternative in corridors where travel is increasing and it is 
difficult to expand highway and airport capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, high-speed rail systems are costly, and thus  
ridership levels may not be high enough in the United States for 
systems to cover their costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exception is in the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak will  
begin operating 150-mph trains between Boston, New York and 
Washington in October. Amtrak expects its high-speed trains to help 
revive the financially strapped national railroad, as well as 
provide momentum for the proposed systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-speed rail is not just a metropolitan solution; it is a  
solution also for my part of the country,'' John Robert Smith, 
mayor of Meridian, Miss., and a member of Amtrak's board of 
directors, said last year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed trains are typically defined as those capable of  
traveling more than 125 mph. They achieve those speeds either with 
special tracks and locomotives or through technology allowing 
trains to tilt into existing curves. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, France and Germany, three nations with long rail  
histories, have taken the lead in developing such systems. When 
France opened its first TGV line between Paris and Lyon in the late 
1980s, the internal French airline, Air Inter, had to cut back on 
its service because the 180-mph TGV was faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, when a 175-mph InterCity Express train crashed near  
Eschede, Germany, killing 101 people, it was a blow to the national 
psyche. The trains were viewed as a symbol of German innovation and 
over their 10-year history had become an integral part of the 
country's travel network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida project was to have mirrored such foreign  
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a deal in 1996 with Florida  
Overland eXpress, a private consortium. It planned to run 
French-designed trains on new tracks that would cross existing 
obstacles with underpasses and overpasses, instead of traditional 
grade crossings. The project carried a price tag of up to $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush questioned the projected ridership and whether the routes  
might lead to unwelcome development around the Everglades. His 
biggest concern, though, was money. The state had already committed 
to $28 million to the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are better alternatives for $70 million per year  
compounded at 4 percent,'' the newly elected governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Chettle, spokeswoman for the Washington-based High Speed  
Ground Transportation Association, said Bush's decision shows why 
if high-speed rail is to spread across the United States, it will 
have to be done in increments. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, that means straightening track curves, rebuilding  
existing stations and buying trains with higher top speeds -- 
exactly what Amtrak is doing in the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to set lawmakers at ease, because it is not the big  
chunk of money they so often see advertised. It may not be the 
wisest use of money and actually lead to higher costs, but it seems 
to be the most palatable,'' Chettle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department is encouraging the approach by  
designating routes as ``high-speed rail corridors,'' making them 
eligible for special development money. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater is traveling to the Midwest this week to make such a 
designation for the line between Chicago and Indianapolis. Amtrak 
currently makes one run a day between the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the GAO's dire assessment, rail advocates believe  
high-speed trains can flourish in the United States, given the 
right approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is not really all or nothing,''  
said Amtrak spokesman John Wolf. ``If you use an incremental 
approach and build on existing rights of way in partnership with 
states and private businesses and freight railroads, we believe it 
will work.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Seeks To Seal Secret Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr is asking a court to  
prevent a woman indicted in the Kathleen Willey investigation from 
disclosing secret materials provided to her lawyers. Starr argues 
the release of the materials could jeopardize his broader 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr requested the protective order in the case of Julie Hiatt  
Steele, a Richmond, Va., woman charged with obstructing justice and 
making up a false story that cast doubt on Mrs. Willey's allegation 
of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was indicted earlier this month and denied the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government still has pending criminal investigations  
related'' to the Monica Lewinsky controversy, Starr told the court 
in seeking the protective order. ``Disclosure of some of the 
discovery materials the government may provide poses a substantial 
risk of impeding and influencing those investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was not specific as to what aspects of his investigation  
might be adversely affected, but said ``disclosure beyond that 
necessary to prepare a defense could impact the interests of the 
parties in this indicted case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's motion said Ms. Steele's lawyers refused to  
voluntarily agree to the restriction. Nancy Luque, one of Ms. 
Steele's lawyers, declined comment Monday on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was indicted earlier this month by a grand jury in  
Alexandria, Va., on three counts of obstruction of justice and one 
count of false statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing  
a false affidavit in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against 
Clinton, lying to two grand juries and attempting to influence the 
testimony of other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers had used Ms. Steele's testimony in an  
effort to cast doubt on the credibility of Mrs. Willey, a former 
White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance toward her in the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies Mrs. Willey's accusation, which became a focus of  
Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In his testimony in the 
Jones lawsuit, the president said Mrs. Willey ``was not telling the 
truth'' and that her credibility had been ``pretty well 
shattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that a lawyer for Clinton approached Ms.  
Steele in January 1998 to get her to file the affidavit and that 
she initially refused, then changed her mind. Ms. Steele eventually 
filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit claiming Mrs. Willey never 
told her about the alleged advance as she had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleged the affidavit and Ms. Steele's subsequent  
testimony before two federal grand juries were false. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele ``well knew and believed'' Mrs. Willey had told her  
about the alleged sexual advance shortly after it happened and 
``even related information about Mrs. Willey's account of the 
incident'' to several of her friends as early as 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also charged that Ms. Steele ``repeatedly  
attempted'' to convince two friends that she hadn't told them about 
the Willey incident, even though she had. At the time, one of the 
friends was being sought by FBI agents for questioning.

<HEADLINE> Top 5 Same in AP Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The top five teams in the AP college basketball poll remained  
the same today, while Ohio State returned to the Top 25 with an 
impressive jump and Florida made its first appearance in the 
rankings in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (17-0), the only remaining unbeaten team in Division  
I, held the No. 1 spot for the ninth consecutive week. The Huskies, 
who beat Miami in overtime and Seton Hall last week, received 54 
first-place votes and 1,755 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (19-1), which beat Clemson and was also extended into  
overtime by St. John's, was second with the 17 other No. 1 votes 
and 1,719 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, Maryland Cincinnati, all of whom went 2-0 last week,  
held third through fifth from last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky and Auburn switched places from last week at Nos. 6 and  
7 after the Wildcats handed the Tigers their first loss of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, which beat Iowa and Indiana last week, jumped  
three places to eighth and was followed by St. John's and North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA led the Second Ten and was followed by Wisconsin, Arizona,  
Purdue, Ohio State, Iowa, Syracuse, New Mexico, Minnesota and 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the rankings were Arkansas, Kansas,  
Miami, Texas Christian and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State (13-5), which had been ranked all season, fell  
from 23rd after splitting Big 12 games with Baylor and Texas, 
losing the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville (10-5), which had entered the Top 25 for the first  
this season last week, fell from 24th after losing home games to 
Cincinnati and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (15-5) jumped back in at No. 15 after 29-point wins  
over Purdue and Minnesota. The Buckeyes, who entered the Top 25 for 
the first times in six years two weeks ago, then fell right out, 
gave the Big Ten seven teams in the rankings, matching the record 
they set in 1993 and matched two weeks ago. The Atlantic Coast 
Conference had seven teams for two weeks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Big Ten teams are Michigan State, Wisconsin, Purdue,  
Iowa, Minnesota and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>

the Gators reached the Final Four. Following a 30-point loss to 
Duke, the Gators have won nine of 11, the losses being to Kentucky 
and Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida gives the Southeastern Conference four ranked teams --  
Kentucky, Auburn and Arkansas, -- joining the Big East -- 
Connecticut, St. John's, Syracuse and Miami -- behind the Big Ten.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Battle Bogus Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Sharon Carr is the first to admit she should have  
known better. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City business owner spent $300 on a pair of Oakley  
prescription glasses only to learn the lenses were fake. The store 
went out of business and Ms. Carr, who has spent 22 years battling 
counterfeiting, was out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were something, such as a certificate of  
authenticity, some piece that went along with my glasses, I would 
know I am getting the real thing,'' said Ms. Carr, whose company, 
Sharon Carr Associates, markets anti-counterfeiting techniques to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	As the counterfeiting industry grows, businesses have begun  
adopting techniques developed in the battle against bogus money to 
protect their products, ranging from watermarks and graphics to 
inks and special packaging, Ms. Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an airline may use a nearly indiscernible graphic  
to authenticate a ticket or boarding pass. A medical company may 
add a harmless chemical to medicine or add complex colors and 
materials to packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know you need to do it because everything is getting  
knocked off,'' Ms. Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing when we're talking about a (bogus) Disney video  
at a flea market,'' she said. ``It's another thing when you're 
talking about health and safety or luxury goods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business owners and executives are gathering this week in San  
Francisco to discuss anticounterfeiting methods at the Product 
Counterfeiting Protection Conference, sponsored by Denver-based 
Reconnaissance International and the International 
Anticounterfeiting Coalition, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also will feature the first global  
anticounterfeiting awards to recognize business efforts to battle 
bogus products. 
</P>
<P>
	International Chamber of Commerce statistics estimate that  
counterfeiting accounts for an estimated $200 billion a year in 
lost business worldwide, which is equal to about 5 percent of the 
world's output. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of fakes is limited only by imagination: airplane  
parts, jeans, shampoo, T-shirts, videotapes, computer equipment and 
ski products among other items, according to Lewis Kontnik of 
Reconnaissance International, an anticounterfeiting consultant 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also are health and safety products that are being  
copied illegally. For example, a bogus cough syrup led to deaths in 
Haiti, birth-control pills caused a dozen or more Brazilian women 
to become pregnant and counterfeit Viagra was confiscated in 
Vietnam in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crime has become so overwhelming, it's hard to describe  
to people who don't see it every day,'' said Barbara Kolsun, 
chairwoman of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Counterfeiting has become an organized crime problem,'' she  
said. ``Very, very few people actually go to jail for selling 
counterfeit products, I think, because judges don't yet perceive it 
as a serious enough problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They perceive it as a victimless crime. No one has been  
physically hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Abbott, coalition managing director, said businesses are  
spending millions of dollars to prevent counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies no longer bury their heads in the sand on this  
issue. They come out in front by and large and they take on those 
who would undermine consumer confidence in their products,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to adopting authentication techniques, companies are  
forming trade groups and lobbying governments to stiffen penalties 
against counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramona DuBose, a spokeswoman for Glaxo Wellcome, said her  
company works to make its product and packaging unique so it cannot 
be copied by counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
	Zantac, for example, is a five-sided, peach pill in the United  
States market. ``You can look it up in the Physicians Desk 
Reference and see what the tablets are supposed to look like,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as serious for the company as it is for the  
patients,'' she said of counterfeits. ``We're talking about 
medicine here, and a lot of these are medicines people take on a 
chronic basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said the business efforts are paying off; yet,  
counterfeiting continues to boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like spraying for roaches. Often times, you can clear  
them out of an area and they will scurry into another,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson To Cut 11,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Swedish telecommunications company LM  
Ericsson will eliminate about 11,000 jobs -- more than 10 percent of 
its worldwide work force -- over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts announced Monday are being made due to rapid  
technological developments and to new ways of working. But cuts 
have been widely expected since December when chief executive 
Sven-Christer Nilsson said revenue and profit for 1998 would be 
below market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Full details of where the job cuts would take place were not  
available, but the company said 3,300 of them would be in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson is one of the world's leading makers of cellular  
telephones and equipment for wired and mobile phone networks. It 
also has a large division for data and telecom networks. It employs 
104,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Nilsson said Ericsson has been hit hard by the  
Asian financial crisis, especially in its public networks business, 
but that its mobile phone business also was suffering. In recent 
months, demand has been highest for the most basic models of mobile 
phones, which have lower profit margins.

                      *Rev. Walter Donald Kring    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST BROOKFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The Rev. Walter Donald Kring, a  
clergyman who became an authority on Herman Melville, died of 
cardiac arrest Jan. 15. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Kring led All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City for 23  
years before stepping down in 1978. He then became minister at the 
Eliot Church in Natick and retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Kring wrote a three-volume history of All Souls, which started  
as the First Congregational Church in 1819. Among his other works 
were ``Henry Whitney Bellows'' (1979) and ``Herman Melville's 
Religious Journey'' (1997). 
</P>
<P>
	While doing research in 1975 for a biography of a 19th-century  
pastor at All Souls, Kring discovered letters that sparked a debate 
that continues today. The missives seemed to confirm rumors that 
Melville, the ``Moby Dick'' author, had been a wife beater and a 
child abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	Kring pursued Melville studies, including those concerning the  
author's religious leanings, and in 1979 he was elected the 
Melville Society's first nonacademic president. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Lord Lewin    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former British defense chief Lord Lewin, who  
masterminded Britain's defeat of Argentina in the Falklands Islands 
war, died Saturday of stomach cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin, who as military commander was a key member of former  
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Falklands War Cabinet, is widely 
regarded as persuading Thatcher to order the sinking of the 
Argentine cruiser Belgrano during the 1982 conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 600 Argentine sailors were killed, the majority of the  
1,000 killed during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin, who had a distinguished record as a young officer in  
World War II, was the head of the Royal Navy from 1977 to 1979, and 
then Britain's overall military chief. 
</P>
<P>
	After retirement in 1982 following the Falklands victory, he was  
given the title of Lord. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Thomas Clifton Mann    	
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Thomas Clifton Mann, former U.S. ambassador  
to Mexico and El Salvador, died Saturday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann was appointed U.S. ambassador to El Salvador by President  
Dwight D. Eisenhower and served from 1955-57. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower later appointed Mann to be assistant secretary of  
economic affairs and in 1960, assistant secretary of inter-American 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Mann the U.S. ambassador to  
Mexico. He served until 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson 
named him assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, special 
assistant to the president and coordinator of the Alliance for 
Progress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Mann was appointed undersecretary of state for economic  
affairs. When he left government service in 1966, Johnson presented 
him with the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1967 until his retirement in 1971, Mann was president of  
the Automobile Manufacturer's Association.

</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Rev. John Osteen, founder of one of the  
city's largest and most diverse churches and a popular television 
pastor, died of a heart attack Saturday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen headed Lakewood Church, a congregation that boasts 15,000  
members who worship in a contemporary 8,200-seat sanctuary. His 
local and international broadcasts attracted thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen dropped out of high school in his hometown of Fort Worth.  
In his biography, he said he began seriously thinking about God 
after leaving a nightclub in 1939. Six weeks later, he was 
preaching in Paris, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen's television programs are seen in 100 countries. Around  
Houston, his church is best known for the thousands of cars that 
bear bumper stickers proclaiming Lakewood ``An Oasis of Love.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jay Pritzker, founder and chairman of the Hyatt  
Hotel chain whose interest in architecture led to the creation of 
the Pritzker Architecture Prize, died of a heart attack Saturday. 
He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker was among the richest people in the nation. Last year,  
Forbes magazine ranked him the 20th richest American with a fortune 
of $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he acquired with his brother the Colson Corp., a small  
Ohio metal goods manufacturer, which later evolved into the Marmon 
Corp. It is now parent to about 100 companies that make everything 
from railroad cars to aluminum forgings for missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Pritzker founded the Hyatt Corp., a chain of about 200  
resorts and hotels, which had revenues of about $4 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker and his brother Robert Pritzker gave $70 million in  
donations in 1996, according to a list compiled by Fortune 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the board of trustees at the University of Chicago and  
was chairman of the Pritzker Foundation.

<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Newspaper editor and activist Robert S.  
Van Fleet, died Saturday of pancreatic cancer. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Fleet, essayist and activist in AIDS and in other civic  
issues and causes, retired in 1986 as a vice president/news 
services of Ottaway Newspapers. 
</P>

	During 35 years as a journalist, Van Fleet reported on local,  
state and national politics and government. He was also an editor, 
a teacher of journalism, author of a textbook on reporting and 
writing, and a newspaper executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported for the Middletown Times Herald and, when  
Middletown's two daily newspapers merged in 1960, he became the 
surviving paper's managing editor. Three years later he was named 
to the corporate staff of the parent company, serving as Ottaway 
News Service chief for the 22 newspapers in the Ottaway Group and 
then as assistant vice president and vice president in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Fleet was clerk of the Middletown Common Council and was the  
campaign manager for Mayor Louis V. Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	He was national vice president of the Mencken Society of  
Baltimore, an association of scholars who study and preserve the 
writings of journalist Henry L. Mencken.

<HEADLINE> First US Hand Transplant Performed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Surgeons have performed the first hand  
transplant in the United States, replacing the left hand of a New 
Jersey man. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplant began at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at Louisville Jewish  
Hospital, spokeswoman Kim Freeman said today. She did not say when 
it was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient was identified as Matthew David Scott, 37, of  
Absecon, N.J., who lost his hand in December 1985 in a blast from 
an M-80 fiecracker. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said Scott, who was using a prosthetic arm, is  
clinical coordinator for Virtua Health System in Gibbsboro, N.J., 
and assistant director at the School of Paramedic Science, Camden 
County College, in Blackwood, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Warren C. Breidenbach led the surgical team, according to  
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the surgery was successful, Freeman said that won't be  
known for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patient is still asleep and in recovery,'' Freeman said  
earlier this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September in Lyon, France, an international team of doctors  
transplanted a hand to a 48-year-old New Zealand man in a 13-hour 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	That patient, Clint Hallam, lost part of his right arm in a  
prison workshop accident in New Zealand in 1984. He was serving a 
sentence for fraud. More recently, he faced potential fraud charges 
in Australia, but police said earlier this month that the case 
likely would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	While surgeons have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents for years, they had never been able to 
successfully transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living 
recipient. At least one attempt at a hand transplant was made 
overseas in the 1960s, but the patient's body rejected the hand 
after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans to attempt a hand transplant in Kentucky were  
disclosed even before the French operation was undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Louisville School of Medicine Human Studies  
Committee and Jewish Hospital Institutional Review Board granted 
approval to the plan last year after researching the idea for more 
than three years and analyzing the findings of an international 
symposium on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some surgeons and medical ethicists have raised  
questions about the risks of transplanting a non-vital organ such 
as a hand. Recipients of any transplant must take powerful 
anti-rejection drugs meant to keep the body from trying to destroy 
the foreign tissue. The drugs increase the risk of infection, 
cancer and death.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins, at least temporarily,  
have withdrawn their request that a federal bankruptcy judge 
reconsider a ban that prohibits management from shopping the team 
to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Manion, the latest lawyer to oversee the Penguins'  
bankruptcy, said any public fight with Civic Arena management firm 
SMG would be counterproductive while negotiations to restructure 
the team's lease continue. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman calls the Penguins' lease at the  
37-year-old Civic Arena ``probably the least favorable in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins argue the lease was a major reason why they sought  
bankruptcy protection in October, and they are hoping that U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will order it to be rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said at the NHL all-star game in Tampa that the league  
wants to keep the Penguins in Pittsburgh, but that a new arena 
needs to be built. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said two groups have contacted the NHL with an interest  
in buying the Penguins and keeping them in Pittsburgh, but he did 
not identify the groups. He also would not say if retired Penguins 
star Mario Lemieux is involved in either group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the Penguins' largest unsecured creditor, is owed $28.7  
million in deferred compensation as part of the $42 million, 
seven-year contract he signed in 1993. The contract was 
renegotiated several times before Lemieux retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Manion said his next step is to work on the Civic Arena lease  
with SMG but, if efforts to end the Penguins' financial troubles 
aren't solved in bankruptcy court, then relocation may be the only 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see if there's some city that wants to put out a lot of  
money to take over the team,'' Manion said. ``If they're not there, 
then we're at the end of the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins apparently are about $125 million in debt, or more  
than the franchise's total value.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Dominates All-Stars Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky got another car, Ken Hitchcock  
finally got a victory and the NHL got the kind of All-Star game it 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition-wise, it was up there,'' coach Lindy Ruff said  
Sunday after his World team lost 8-6 to North America in the 49th 
NHL All-Star game. ``I think they competed at the level they want 
to in this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star-studded midseason game, as usual, produced a lot of  
goal. Gretzky was in the middle of things again with a goal and two 
assists, earning him the All-Star MVP trophy for the third time and 
the car that goes with it -- in this case, a sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it,'' Gretzky said. ``I got a car. How many people go  
to Tampa and get a new car? It was a wonderful weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock also had a great time, finally coaching an All-Star  
team to victory. He was on the losing end as head coach of the 
Western Conference in 1997 and the World All-Stars in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the real winner was the NHL, which has tried to find  
a format to make the games more competitive and more compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wasn't worried about all the goals being scored in  
the '90s -- in fact, NHL officials felt that more scoring would 
spark more interest from the casual fan. The NHL just didn't want 
onesided blowouts like the 16-6 victory for the Wales Conference 
over the Campbell at Montreal in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With the North America team facing a squad of Europeans, the NHL  
might have hit on something. Last season, it was a one-goal game as 
North America beat the World team 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sunday night, both coaches thought the game was just as  
competitive -- even more so, in Hitchcock's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's game was better than last year,'' Hitchcock said.  
``If there's a way we can do this, whether it's East, West, 
whatever, you want the game to be as competitive as it can. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a showcase for our sport. Whatever way we can do it is  
great. But the players are into this. I saw it World side and now I 
see it North American side. They're having fun with this format, so 
why change it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that didn't change was the style of the game,  
which is considerably more wide open than the defensive-minded 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	At the halfway mark, the league was averaging about 5.3 goals a  
game, reflecting a steady decline in scoring during the '90s. That 
hasn't been a problem in All-Star games. The previous nine averaged 
16.5 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was business as usual Sunday, with 14 different players  
scoring and goaltenders anxious to get out of the line of fire. 
Except for Phoenix's Nikolai Khabibulin, who took over in the third 
period and played like something was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was -- his pride.  
</P>
<P>
	`I think goalies take it more seriously than the players on  
defense because you don't want to get embarrassed,'' Khabibulin 
said. ``I mean, you're supposed to take it -- you're supposed to 
think, well, if they score, it's OK. You don't want to get six 
goals scored against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khabibulin was the best goaltender on the ice, stopping 14 of 15  
shots in the third period as the World outscored North America 2-1 
in the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the goaltenders had their problems, including  
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, called the best player in the NHL by 
Gretzky. He faced 19 shots in the first and gave up goals by Mike 
Modano, Luc Robitaille, Paul Kariya and Mark Recchi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went wild,'' said Modano, who had a goal and three  
assists. ``Guys were scoring when you gave it to them. It was nice 
to have some fun out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bourque, Rob Blake and Darryl Sydor also scored for North  
America. Mats Sundin had a goal and three assists for the World 
team, while Marco Sturm, Teemu Selanne, Pavol Demitra, Mattias 
Ohlund and Sergei Zubov also scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's goal extended his All-Star record to 13 in 18 games  
and his two assists gave him 12, tying him with four other players 
for the career record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice weekend,'' Gretzky said. ``I think we all had a  
lot of fun.''

<HEADLINE> Arco, Chevron Earnings Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Plunging crude oil prices hammered profits at Atlantic Richfield  
Co. and Chevron Corp. in the fourth quarter. The low prices have 
reduced profits for four consecutive quarters, contributing to weak 
full-year reports from both companies. 

</P>
<P>
 *Atlantic Richfield Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield Co. said Monday it lost $794 million, or  
$2.47 per share, during the fourth quarter after asset writedowns 
and restructuring charges forced by weak demand and historically 
low crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reflect a one-time charge of $864 million to  
covering the cost of layoffs and other restructuring expenses and a 
writedown of the estimated value of oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $382  
million, or $1.17 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the special charges, Arco earned $70 million, or 22 cents  
per share, for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
expected Arco to earn 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $2.71 billion, compared to $3.48 billion in the  
fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco was forced to take the hefty asset writedown because  
declining oil prices, which fell $7 per barrel during 1998, reduced 
the value of untapped crude oil and natural gas. Arco previously 
had estimated the charge for the writedown and restructuring at 
$890 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Arco reported net income of $452 million, or $1.40  
per share, down from $1.77 billion, or $5.41 per share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike R. Bowlin, Arco's chairman and chief executive, blamed the  
company's problems on a worldwide decline in crude prices resulting 
from weakened demand brought on by the Asian economic crisis and a 
relatively mild winter that undercut the market for heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question this was a bad year for oils,'' Bowlin  
said. ``We started the year with oil prices in the high teens and 
saw them drop to an $11 average in December, a 30-year low when 
adjusted for inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arco officials have said the company will eliminate 1,200 jobs  
as part of a two-year cost-cutting campaign designed to save $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco shares fell $1.06 1/4 to close at $58.93 3/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *Chevron Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly earnings at Chevron Corp. plunged 51 percent to $431  
million, or 66 cents a share, the company said Monday, blaming low 
crude oil prices and the economic recession in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's fourth quarter, Chevron earned $875 million, or  
$1.33 cents per diluted share. Revenue was down 29 percent at $7.3 
billion for the fourth quarter of 1998, compared to $10.3 billion 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Chevron's net income was $1.98 billion, or  
$3.01 per share, on revenues of $30.6 billion. In 1997, Chevron 
earned $3.26 billion, or $4.95 per share, on revenue of $42 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron said that in addition to the low oil prices, economic  
downturns abroad -- particularly in Asia -- had a major impact on the 
company's earnings, particularly on Caltex, a 50 percent-owned 
affiliate. Foreign currency losses were $81 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1998, compared with a gain of $205 million for the same 
period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Repairing damage to a refinery in Pascagoula, Miss., shut down  
by Hurricane Georges, also cost Chevron some fourth-quarter 
profits, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chevron slipped 12 1/2 cents to close at $79.87 1/2 on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Central Park Killer Gets 10-Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A teen-ager who fatally stabbed and gutted a  
drinking companion in Central Park was sentenced to up to 10 years 
in prison Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Michael Corriero imposed the maximum  
penalty allowed for a juvenile on Christopher Vasquez, 16, 
convicted in December of manslaughter in the death of Michael 
McMorrow, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez blamed the May 23, 1997, killing on girlfriend Daphne  
Abdela, 16. His lawyer, Arnold Kriss, said she was out of control 
and had drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez said he felt sorry for his family and the McMorrows, and  
said that if he had kept the curfew set by his parents, he would 
not have gotten into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdela pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in March and  
was given the same sentence as Vasquez. Both will be eligible for 
parole in less than two years, but Corriero said he will recommend 
that Vasquez serve the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pulled McMorrow's body from a small lake in the park. He  
had been stabbed 34 times, disemboweled, and one of his hands was 
nearly severed. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez and Abdela were found washing blood off each other in a  
bathtub in the custodians' wash room in the nearby luxury apartment 
building where the girl lived with her parents.

<HEADLINE> Eli Lilly Reaches Prozac Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. paid $4 million for some  
peace of mind about Prozac on Monday, agreeing to a partial 
settlement of legal disputes with three generic drug companies that 
want to make cheaper versions of the world's favorite 
antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
	However, other disputes remain and the three challengers are  
taking these to a federal appeals court, hoping a victory there 
will allow them to sell generic Prozac prior to its patent 
expirations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, however, Monday's deal leaves Lilly as the  
sole maker of Prozac in the United States. It was announced less 
than an hour before a federal judge was to hear opening arguments 
in a trial that was to decide whether Lilly's patents on Prozac 
should be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 3 1/2 years, generic drug makers Barr Laboratories  
Inc., Geneva Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Apotex Inc. have all 
requested approval from the Food and Drug Administration to make 
generic Prozac. They claimed Lilly violated patent laws and thus 
relinquished its right to the patents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, which introduced Prozac in the United States in 1988,  
denied the charge and filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the 
companies of patent infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are Lilly's patent on fluoxetine, the active ingredient  
in Prozac, which expires in February 2001, and a second patent on 
how Prozac works, due to expire in December 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original applications, the generic drug companies  
alleged that Lilly's patents are invalid because it fraudulently 
withheld data or gave misleading information when filing for the 
two patents. The companies also challenged whether Lilly provided 
enough information on the 2003 patent. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, those claims are withdrawn.  
</P>
<P>
	However, a second set of claims still remains unresolved. These  
involve the generic drugmakers' contention that Lilly is improperly 
holding two patents for the same idea and that Lilly failed to 
disclose the best way to make Prozac, as required by law. A federal 
judge dismissed those claims earlier this month, but the generic 
drugmakers plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead litigant among the generic companies, Barr Laboratories  
Inc. of Pomona, N.Y., said it settled portions of the case so it 
can concentrate on the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all recognized that getting to the appeals court as fast as  
possible was in our best interest,'' said Paul Bisaro, Barr's 
senior vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly officials contend that the dismissals of U.S. District  
Judge Sarah Evans Barker will not be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe Judge Barker's ruling will be upheld,''  
Lilly spokesman Ed West said. ``It is theoretically possible but 
unlikely that Barr could win the case outright at the Court of 
Appeals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Lilly loses the appeal, further appeals could tie the  
case up for years, delaying the introduction of generic versions of 
Prozac that could be discounted 20 percent or more below Lilly's 
price. The drug is expected to bring $2.5 billion in U.S. sales 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big victory for Lilly,'' said independent industry  
analyst Hemant K. Shah. ``Even in the worst case, they still have a 
two- or three-year delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Eli Lilly rose $6 to $86.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Barr fell $2.75 to $40.87 3/4 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and Geneva, a Colorado-based unit of the Swiss drug giant  
Novartis AG, and Toronto-based Apotex Inc., were to split the $4 
million settlement to cover legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Generic competition already has cut into Prozac sales overseas,  
causing a drop of more than 14 percent from a high of $627.4 
million in 1995 to $538.1 million in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Shanahan Talks Practice, Not Reeves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In an NFL version of ``don't ask, don't tell,''  
Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan discussed his team's first 
practice during Super Bowl week and other mundane matters, while 
assiduously avoiding any touchy-feely issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Such as you-know-what.  
</P>
<P>
	Scared off by Shanahan's testy responses the day before to  
questions about his rocky relationship with Atlanta coach Dan 
Reeves, the media asked only two questions pertaining to Reeves 
during Monday night's media session. 
</P>
<P>
	One was in reference to whether his team could take advantage of  
any personality traits of Reeves in the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We concern ourselves more about our football team,'' Shanahan  
said. ``We're not a team that puts stuff on the bulletin board, we 
don't talk about the other team. We look at film and we talk about 
the strengths of the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm more concerned about our team. If we take more pride  
in how we execute rather than all the other things about the other 
team, then I think we have a much better chance at success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also was asked to assess the job Reeves has done in  
rebuilding the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan has done a great job since he's come in,'' Shanahan said.  
``I believe they started off last season 1-7, but he kept the team 
intact and found a way to end the season like he did. And then to 
come in with the type of year they've had this season, you've got a 
lot of people doing a lot of good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos coach spent most of the remainder of the 15-minute  
session praising fullback Howard Griffith, his offensive line, 
safety Steve Atwater, running back Terrell Davis and Atlanta 
running back Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	His team practiced for one hour, 25 minutes without pads at the  
Miami Dolphins practice facility in Davie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a good practice today,'' he said.  
``Offensively, we ran 25 plays. Defensively, we ran 25 plays. We 
did a little of our two-minute offense. Basically, our practice was 
a review of what we did last Thursday, Friday and Saturday, to kind 
of get back in the swing of things after a day off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan and his staff installed the game plan last week.  
</P>
<P>
	A stickler for crisp, mistake-free practices, Shanahan called  
last Friday's workout in Denver ``average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a lot better practice with fewer mistakes,'' he  
said. ``Our scout team had to be a little bit more explosive, a 
little bit quicker, so our players would get used to practicing at 
game speed. And I thought we had that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, at the Super Bowl in San Diego, a helicopter from a  
local TV station hovered over a Broncos' practice for nearly 15 
minutes, creating security concerns. On Monday, an unidentified 
helicopter flew over the Broncos' practice field but continued on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We almost shot it down,'' Shanahan joked.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Processing Plant Recalls Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A meat processing plant is voluntarily  
recalling all frankfurter and lunch combination products it 
produced since July 6 because they may be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign  
countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's 
Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria 
monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was shut down for sanitary reasons by the USDA on Dec.  
31. A person answering the telephone at the plant Monday said no 
one could comment about the scale of the recall. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of brand names are included in the recall but the key  
to discovering potentially contaminated product is in coding on the 
packages. Only meats with the codes ``EST 13529'' or ``EST-P 
13529'' on the product package are subject to the recall. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no cases of illness have been linked to the recalled  
products, the USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected bacterium is found in soil and water. An estimated  
1,100 people in the United States become seriously ill each year 
from eating food contaminated with Listeria. Listeriosis affects 
primarily pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune 
systems.

<HEADLINE> Couple Killer Sentenced to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- In 1985, Ernest Ireland killed a young  
couple and buried them in his basement, along with the baseball bat 
he bludgeoned them with. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 13 years, he lived in that house,'' prosecutor Cary Shill  
said. ``You'd think that the presence of the remains would haunt 
him. But he lived his life like nothing happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was ordered Monday to pay the price. A judge sentenced  
him to consecutive life prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes went undetected until last June. The new owner of  
Ireland's former home, a peach-colored bungalow at 402 Ireland 
Avenue in Northfield -- the street was named after Ireland's family 
-- found a wallet, a baseball bat and human remains while digging in 
the dirt-floor basement. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were those of Barry Dallman, 21, a music store  
deliveryman. The discovery led to a weeklong excavation, which 
unearthed the bones of Victoria Lynn Welsh, 14, Dallman's 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland admitted he shot Dallman three times and bludgeoned both  
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive remains unclear. Ireland said the attack began with  
an argument between Dallman and one of Ireland's acquaintances, 
Morris Buhr, 48. Buhr, who is jailed in New York on unrelated 
charges, has not been charged in the murders, but Shill said he 
remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia's Gazprom Begins Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's largest company, the natural-gas monopoly  
Gazprom, has started massive layoffs that could total more than 
35,000 people, a senior executive confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Yezhov, a spokesman for Gazprom Chairman Rem Vyakhirev,  
said the reductions would likely amount to 10 percent of the 
company's workforce of 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company hasn't made a final decision on the scale of  
the cuts, but added they had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Yezhov first revealed the plans in an interview with the Moscow  
Times newspaper Saturday. Then, he also said some subsidiaries 
might be merged to cut administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Gazprom executives have said the company had a  
substantial loss in 1998, because of the sharp fall in European gas 
prices and Russia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	James Henderson, oil and gas analyst at the Moscow-based  
investment bank MFK Renaissance, said the announcement was no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom was established in the early 1990's on the foundation of  
the former Soviet Natural Gas Ministry and inherited an extensive 
web of non-production units, ranging from schools and hospitals to 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	A part of the cuts will likely be made through sales of  
production units, with many of the workers in question possibly 
rehired as contractors, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom's prospects this year don't look any better than last  
year, when the company is thought to have posted a loss of around 
$2 billion, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas price is affected by the world oil prices, which have  
hit their lowest in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom has also been hurt by a decline in Russian demand that  
has followed the country's crash in industrial production since the 
Soviet collapse in 1991. After briefly stabilizing in 1997, the 
economy again contracted sharply in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom makes the bulk of its earnings through sales to Western  
Europe. On the domestic market, most of the gas monopoly's 
customers fail to pay their bills.

<HEADLINE> Court: FCC Can Set Phone Price Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reinstated federal  
rules aimed at quickly opening the $110 billion local telephone 
market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in splintered voting, said a 1996 law lets the  
Federal Communications Commission set pricing rules for 
long-distance companies and others that want to start offering 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a big, although not complete, victory for the  
government's goal of speedily letting customers nationwide choose 
their local phone company much as they now can choose a 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had argued that such competition will  
happen sooner if price rules are set by the federal government 
rather than by each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators and companies that now monopolize local phone  
service had said the pricing rules must be set by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the Federal  
Communications Commission has general jurisdiction to implement the 
local-competition provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

<HEADLINE>  Unpredictable Night at Globe Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There was something for everybody  
during the 56th Golden Globes awards, an unpredictable evening that 
set the stage for an unpredictable Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Carrey wasn't making off-color quips, or Jack Nicholson  
wasn't remembering the Globe's less golden moments, Steven 
Spielberg was thanking U.S. fighting men for preserving democracy 
and ending the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of freewheeling ceremony in which Christine  
Lahti could draw laughs by walking on stage with toilet paper stuck 
to her shoe, and Michael J. Fox and Gwenyth Paltrow could bring 
tears to the ballroom crowd with their emotional acceptance 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' won best dramatic film and Spielberg was  
honored for directing the brutally realistic World War II combat 
story, while ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and 
``Elizabeth'' won major awards Sunday at the annual awards from the 
Hollywood Foreign Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globes, traditional Oscar predictors, did little to help  
handicap the Academy Awards race. It was between ``Ryan'' and 
``Shakespeare'' before the Globes, and it's between them still, 
with perhaps a little more push for ``The Truman Show'' and its 
award-winning star Carrey, who barely hid his Oscar aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey jokingly thanked the ``Academy'' for his Globe award,  
which actually was selected by entertainment journalists -- not the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm sorry I was thinking of something else,'' said Carrey,  
named best actor in a dramatic movie, beating out a field that 
included the strong acting of Ian McKellen of ``Gods and 
Monsters,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey's co-star Ed Harris picked up a supporting actor trophy,  
setting the irreverent tone for much of the evening by putting a 
toothpick in his mouth and saying, ``Oh, man, I just got through 
eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKellen's co-star Lynn Redgrave got a surprise supporting  
actress award as the gruff-but-loving maid in ``Gods and Monsters'' 
and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' was best actor in a musical 
or comedy motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a more serious note, Spielberg, whose film is a major  
contender for an Oscar, recalled ``all the veterans that are out 
there that saved Western civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 
1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage, he said: ``I hope the movie is a way at looking  
back... and saying thanks to all of our grandfathers and fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' won best comedy or musical film and  
picked up awards for star Paltrow -- best actress in a comedy -- and 
for screenplay. Paltrow fought back tears and her voice choked as 
she thanked her parents and her ailing grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchette of ``Elizabeth'' won best dramatic actress for  
her role as the title character in second movie set during the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, the Hollywood Foreign Press  
Association voted ABC's ``The Practice'' as best television drama 
series, and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' won as best television comedy 
series. Both are produced David Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do... and just take every 
day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes are awarded for film and television in what  
can be a more colorful affair than the stodgier Academy Awards. 
Last year, Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a 
winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she showed up as a presenter 
with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, he reminisced about the bawdy antics of Joan  
Crawford and Rita Hayworth in bygone Golden Globe awards. ''I like 
fun. What can I say?'' Nicholson said.

<HEADLINE> Couple Killer Sentenced to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- For 13 years, Ernest Ireland got away  
with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in  
prison for killing a young couple in 1985 and burying them in his 
basement along with the baseball bat he bludgeoned them with. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 13 years, he lived in that house,'' prosecutor Cary Shill  
said. ``You'd think that the presence of the remains would haunt 
him. But he lived his life like nothing happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes went undetected until last June. The new owner of  
Ireland's former home, a peach-colored bungalow at 402 Ireland 
Avenue in Northfield -- the street was named after Ireland's family 
-- found a wallet, a baseball bat and human remains while digging in 
the dirt-floor basement. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were those of Barry Dallman, 21, a music store  
deliveryman. An excavation unearthed the bones of Victoria Welsh, 
14, Dallman's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with two counts of murder, Ireland admitted he shot  
Dallman three times and bludgeoned both of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive remains unclear. Ireland said the attack began with  
an argument between Dallman and one of Ireland's acquaintances, 
Morris Buhr, 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhr, who is jailed in New York on unrelated charges, has not  
been charged in the murders, but Shill said he remains under 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Faces Risk at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last thing Monica Lewinsky wants to do is  
give House prosecutors dramatic new information for their case 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	She would risk losing her immunity from prosecution if she  
changed her story about her relationship with the president, 
lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her entire immunity agreement is dependent on her having told  
the truth the first time,'' Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Fox said 
in an interview Monday. ``She obviously has this sword hanging over 
her head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lawyer Howard Pearl said Lewinsky's immunity agreement  
is ``very specifically on the line,'' as underscored by last 
weekend's federal court order that cited the agreement in requiring 
her to submit to an interview by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with three House prosecutors for almost two  
hours Sunday as they sought information to jump-start their bid to 
oust Clinton for what he did to hide his affair with the former 
White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward the prosecutors pronounced the meeting productive.  
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very 
helpful witness to the Senate if called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her lawyers hope the Senate will decide not to call her as a  
witness or seek a sworn statement from her. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Sunday's interview, her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said  
she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting before 
the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's other attorney, Jacob Stein, said Monday she  
fully cooperated with House prosecutors but wants to avoid 
testifying in the Senate. ``She now has a compelling personal 
interest in avoiding her use by others into what cannot be anything 
but an unseemly circus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That compelling interest, other lawyers said, is avoiding the  
risk of saying something that might lead Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr to try to revoke her immunity agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, Ms. Lewinsky promised to testify before a federal  
grand jury or any ``congressional proceedings'' such as an 
impeachment trial. In exchange, Starr promised not to prosecute Ms. 
Lewinsky over her testimony or her affidavit in which she denied an 
affair with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr can ask a court to cancel the immunity agreement if it  
determines Ms. Lewinsky ``has intentionally given false, incomplete 
or misleading information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement gives Ms. Lewinsky an incentive to stay close to  
her prior testimony in the case, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro, a former federal prosecutor,  
said that to avoid trouble, Ms. Lewinsky needs to ``keep her story 
straight and tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If she remembers something differently, Nicastro said, she'd  
better have a ``good explanation why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Gregory Joseph said Ms. Lewinsky could add new  
information as long as it was consistent with her earlier 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expects her to use the exact words,'' Joseph said, but  
he added, ``She cannot vary in any meaningful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said her lawyers likely would go over her previous testimony  
with her so it would be fresh in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as she's got the immunity agreement she's in great  
shape,'' Fox said. But he added, ``Every time you open your mouth 
you put yourself at a little bit of risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl, a former federal prosecutor, said Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers  
could ask the Senate for a separate grant of immunity, either to 
make doubly certain of her protection for Senate testimony or 
simply to create one more obstacle to calling her as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The harder they make the road ... the better'' for their  
effort to keep Ms. Lewinsky from testifying, Pearl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in today's editions that  
Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson to permit the former White House intern to be 
interviewed by Barbara Walters for ABC's ``20/20'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of her immunity agreement with Starr, Ms.  
Lewinsky is not permitted to comment to the news media without 
Starr's approval, ``pending the resolution of this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky lawyers are seeking a court hearing Thursday to  
force Starr to lift the restrictions, the Post said, quoting 
unidentified legal sources.

<HEADLINE> More Signings in the NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Brent Barry is no Michael Jordan, but he'll have to do for now.  
</P>
<P>
	Barry, a free-agent guard, joined the Chicago Bulls Monday,  
signing a six-year, $27 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The former NBA slam dunk champion and son of Hall of Famer Rick  
Barry, averaged 9.6 points per game in three seasons with the Los 
Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does play well in Chicago, then they think they've got  
the next Michael Jordan,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also renounced the rights to forward Scott Burrell.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft  
from Pacific University, was released from his contract with Kinder 
Bologna of the Italian League and will join the Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center had signed with Kinder about 24 hours before  
the NBA and its players agreed recently to end the owners' lockout. 
Olowokandi's deal with Kinder bound him to the club until Feb. 15, 
but the team reportedly decided to release him and save money 
because he had averaged only 7.7 points and 5.6 rebounds in six 
games in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Steve Nash, acquired in a draft-day trade from Phoenix,  
signed a six-year contract extension with the Dallas Mavericks that 
reportedly is worth $18 million 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Hurley, a five-year NBA veteran, who suffered  
life-threatening injuries in a two-car accident in his rookie 
season with the Sacramento Kings, was waived by the Vancouver 
Grizzlies. The Grizzlies had acquired Hurley, a former Duke star, 
in a four-player deal with Sacramento last Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns re-signed free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford  
Robinson. First-round draft pick Pat Garrity remains unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers signed rookie guard Bonzi Wells to a  
three-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed. Wells, 
drafted out of Ball State, was acquired from the Detroit Pistons 
last week for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other guards -- James Blackwell, Ernest Hall and Damian  
Owens -- were cut by Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players were cut by the Atlanta Hawks -- former Georgia  
Tech star Brian Oliver; Mitch Henderson, a rookie from Princeton, 
and Jason Lawson, a reserve last season with Orlando.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Mexico newspaper's bid to gain access to  
documents detailing costs of providing court-appointed lawyers for 
22 alleged members of an Albuquerque street gang linked to murder 
and drug trafficking failed in the Supreme Court today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that blocked  
access to most of the court-sealed fee, cost and expense documents 
sought by the Albuquerque Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	In denying access, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
last July that the newspaper had no constitutional right to that 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the paper's lawyers said that  
ruling wrongly ``interferes with the right of the people to be 
informed about happenings in the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1964 law, the Criminal Justice Act, guarantees that  
defendants in federal criminal trials will have lawyers appointed 
to help them if they cannot afford to hire their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Most such representation is handled by public defenders, but  
some of that work goes to private lawyers who bill the trial court 
for their work under rates provided for in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1996 trial of the 22 alleged members of the ``Sureno  
13'' street gang, the Albuquerque newspaper sought access to all 
the paperwork related to compensating and reimbursing the 
defendants' court-appointed private lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ordered that those documents remain sealed until  
the trial ended and every convicted defendant had been sentenced. 
At the time, three of the alleged gang members faced possible death 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper appealed, seeking immediate access. The defendants  
also appealed, seeking to block access permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th Circuit court ruled all the documents except certain  
vouchers and the raw payment totals paid to such lawyers be 
permanently sealed, noting that the newspaper could not hope to get 
any cost and expense information from Justice Department 
prosecutors or from the federal public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also ruled that the sought-after information  
was not ``trial documents in any accepted sense of that term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's appeal said other appeals courts have found a  
First Amendment right to such materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the  
press. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is The Albuquerque Journal vs. Gonzales, 98-831.

<HEADLINE> LucasVarity Wary of Federal Mogul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- British auto parts maker LucasVarity PLC shunned  
Federal Mogul Corp.'s $6.5 billion cash-and-stock takeover offer 
and announced Monday it was in talks for an all-cash deal with a 
third party. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity, which wants to move its headquarters from London to  
the United States, has been negotiating with several U.S. auto 
parts companies, including TRW Inc. and Tenneco Inc. But Federal 
Mogul on Monday tried to muscle in with an unsolicited offer so big 
that the LucasVarity board would have to accept or face pressure 
from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the LucasVarity board disclosed it was holding  
``advanced discussions with a third party'' on an all-cash bid. 
While it said there was no guarantee there would be a deal, 
LucasVarity said it could have an announcement later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While LucasVarity did not identify the suitor, there were  
reports it was TRW. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Tenneco and TRW are looking for means of disposing of  
their automotive operations on a tax-efficient basis and merging it 
with another company is a smart way to do that,'' said Jonathan 
Rouner, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston in New 
York, who heads the firm's automotive mergers and acquisition 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW spokesman Jay McCaffrey, said ``We're not commenting on the  
reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Mogul, based in Southfield, Mich., offered 280 pence a  
share, or $4.64, to be paid half in cash and half in stock. The 
company has been on an acquisition spree for years and is so 
burdened with debt that it cannot afford an all-cash offer, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity, the world's No. 2 car brake manufacturer, rebuffed  
Federal Mogul's request to look over the company's operations in 
advance of a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Snell, Federal Mogul's chairman and chief executive  
officer, in a letter to his counterparts at LucasVarity, said, 
``I'm genuinely disappointed and surprised at your decision not to 
allow us to proceed with due diligence on LucasVarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the LucasVarity disclosed a third party was in talks  
about a takeover, the company's shares were soaring on prospects of 
a bidding war. The U.S. shares of LucasVarity rose 14 percent, or 
by $5.16 3/4, to close at $41.41 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where. Federal Mogul fell $1.43 3/4 to $61.81 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Has His Day in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dustin Hoffman not only had his day in court,  
he liked it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to flatter the judge because it looks like you're  
flattering the judge,'' the actor said Monday. ``But the experience 
was very enjoyable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge last week awarded Hoffman $1.5 million in a  
non-jury trial. Hoffman had sued Los Angeles Magazine, which 
published a computer-altered image of the actor in a designer 
evening gown and heels without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman was praised by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian as  
``one of our country's greatest living treasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to Xerox what he said and put it on each of my kids'  
pillows,'' Hoffman told reporters at his lawyer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said he was concerned about how the movie industry  
perceived the photo: ``The industry knows that there's a certain 
plane, if you will, of actors who don't do commercials. ... It 
signals a decline in your career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on damages is expected Thursday.

<HEADLINE> McCartney Takes Issue With Lyrics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Paul McCartney is looking for some parental  
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Beatle took out newspaper ads Monday ridiculing a  
``parental guidance'' warning that was slapped on his late wife 
Linda's new album because there is an obscenity in one song. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tongue-in-cheek ads headlined, ``Parents! We need your  
guidance,'' McCartney calls on parents to listen to the song, ``The 
Light Comes from Within,'' and decide ``whether your children will 
be morally corrupted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song on Linda McCartney's posthumously released album,  
``Wide Prairie'' has been banned from television and radio in 
Britain, a move Paul McCartney calls the ``nannying and playsafe 
attitude that is infecting the record business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song was recorded last March, a month before Linda McCartney  
died of breast cancer at age 56.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Olympic Leader Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tom Welch, who led Salt Lake's decade-long  
quest for the Olympics, is now being unfairly blamed for its 
excesses in an ungrateful and naive city, says his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't do anything wrong,'' said attorney Tom Schaffer, who  
has begun talking to reporters while advising the former president 
of the bid and organizing committees to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say something is wrong, to me that means there's a  
line over which you are not supposed to go,'' Schaffer said Monday. 
``There was no line. There were no rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer said he would be surprised by any criminal indictment  
of his client. ``I do not believe that anything ... was done with 
criminal intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department investigators looking into the bid have not  
yet contacted or subpoenaed Welch, Schaffer said. Welch has met for 
several hours on two occasions with the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee's ethics panel, but has spoken to no other investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	An International Olympic Committee investigation found Salt  
Lake's bid committee spent nearly $800,000 on 14 IOC members, 
including travel expenses, scholarships for their children, medical 
care and cash payments in the years leading up to the IOC vote 
giving Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC on Sunday ousted six members, including one who alone  
received $216,000 from Salt Lake. It issued a warning to another 
and continues to investigate three others. Three implicated IOC 
members resigned in the week before the meeting, and one died last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
chairman Robert Garff have been decrying the bid committee's lavish 
spending as below the ethical standards of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bid committee members, including former bid committee  
chairman and SLOC President Frank Joklik, say they didn't know 
Welch and his sidekick during the bid, Dave Johnson, were going 
overboard. Welch was SLOC president from 1995 through mid-1997, 
when he resigned amid spouse-abuse allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC board on Jan. 8 took away Welch's $500,000 pension and  
$10,000-per-month consulting contract, forced Johnson to resign as 
senior vice president, and put two other executives on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of several investigations. 
Joklik resigned, but is staying on until his replacement is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the chief IOC investigator said Sunday that the most he  
could say about Salt Lake bidders was they showed an extra 
``willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how you get votes; you make friends,'' Schaffer said.  
</P>
<P>
	`If you want to gain favor with the people who are going to vote  
to bring world recognition to your city, you can't take them to 
McDonald's for lunch,'' he said. ``That's the way it works in the 
corporate world, the same as it works in the international 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are people acting so shocked that simply because it's  
amateur athletics it doesn't have a corporate spin to it? I find 
the naivete to be ridiculous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer also believes Welch and Johnson are being unfairly  
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took two decent men who did what Salt Lake asked them to  
do and now they're turning them into demons,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Say Lewinsky Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a critical juncture in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky 
for almost two hours on Sunday and asserted her testimony would 
help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts from the former intern by Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky told the prosecutors Sunday that Mrs. Currie made  
calls from the White House to Ms. Lewinsky prior to going to Ms. 
Lewinsky's apartment later in the day to pick up the subpoenaed 
presents, another source said. The calls apparently were not 
logged. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern and Currie disagree over which of them  
initiated the pickup and, before Sunday, House prosecutors had only 
referred to a one-minute cellular call from Mrs. Currie to Ms. 
Lewinsky to substantiate Ms. Lewinsky's account. Presidential 
lawyers have suggested that the one-minute call was too short a 
time to have arranged the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview triggered partisan convulsions even before it was  
held and by Sunday morning, even three Republican senators said 
they wanted a swift end to the case. Two of them expressed hope for 
a conclusion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When the interview ended, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris,  
said she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting 
before the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all three House managers who participated in the interview  
called the session productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe she would be a witness that would help them  
determine the truth, and that's what we are all endeavoring to do 
during this process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very helpful 
witness to the Senate if called.'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., 
characterized the former White House intern as ``impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cacheris said his client ``was candid, forthright and extremely  
truthful'' but he insisted that anything she would tell the Senate 
would cover familiar ground. He urged the managers to tell their 
colleagues that it is unnecessary to call Ms. Lewinsky as a 
witness, so that her ``long nightmare'' could end. 
</P>
<P>
	The three congressmen were especially interested in presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan's effort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky and in 
Oval Office secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of Clinton's gifts 
to Ms. Lewinsky, said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the job search and the gift retrieval were  
undertaken to thwart lawyers for Paula Jones, who wanted Ms. 
Lewinsky to testify in the Jones civil lawsuit and also subpoenaed 
the presidential gifts. The White House denies any connection 
between the Jones case, on the one hand, and the job hunt and the 
gift transfer on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues involve some of the most contested evidence before  
the Senate. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mrs. Currie initiated the 
transfer of the presents, and the House prosecutors concluded that 
Clinton put her up to it. Mrs. Currie has testified that Ms. 
Lewinsky initiated the transfer, although she said she had a fuzzy 
memory about some details of telephone conversations she had with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In another key conflict, Ms. Lewinsky testified on one occasion  
that when she asked Clinton what to do with the gifts, he asked her 
to ``Let me think about it.'' On some nine other occasions, she 
couldn't recall any reaction from the president to her question. 
</P>
<P>
	On the job search, the House team insisted that the effort by  
Jordan became intense within a week after Ms. Lewinsky appeared on 
the Jones witness list. Jordan has denied there was any connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr watched, said 
Hutchinson spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of 
the interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and that 
the entire session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors were set to meet Monday, the deadline for  
submitting a witness list to the Senate. Senators will debate 
whether to call witnesses before taking two votes: first on a 
motion to dismiss the case and then on the decision to take 
depositions of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama sought a fast conclusion 
to the trial. Snowe even predicted, ``I think we will reach a 
conclusion by the end of this week'' with a ``chance to vote up or 
down on the articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said both parties should agree on a final vote and ``get  
to it ... promptly.'' Added Shelby: ``Let's close this thing out. 
Let's vote on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also indicated they wanted to talk to  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky in her 
job search. Hutchinson said he met with Jordan's lawyer ``laying 
the groundwork ... in the eventuality that he is called as witness. 
And hopefully, I'll be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators. He said he was 
asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky scandal 
was breaking a year ago. House managers, in presenting their case 
to the Senate, said Clinton's state of mind was important when he 
asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion of his conduct with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his office  
took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Chief Sees More Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's chief executive is predicting more  
hardship for the territory this year, but he dampened speculation 
that China might devalue its currency and cause more problems for 
Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. No. No,'' Tung Chee-hwa said when asked whether he thought  
the Chinese government might devalue the yuan in light of fresh 
turmoil in world financial markets, especially in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always speculation,'' Hong Kong's top official said in  
an interview with American journalists. ``We have the means to 
defend ourselves and we will defend ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tung said that whatever happens, Hong Kong would not delink its  
dollar from the U.S. dollar, which he said helps maintain some 
stability. ``It is in Hong Kong's own interest that we must 
maintain the linked exchange rate. ... I know it is the right 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tung said Hong Kong is struggling to recover from a  
deep recession, caused partly by the Asian financial crisis that 
began about 18 months ago when Thailand's currency took a dive. 
Like other Asian countries, Hong Kong's export market was hurt by 
the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Hong Kong's economy shrunk 5 percent last year and  
unemployment rose from 2 percent to 5.8 percent while property 
values fell about 50 percent to 60 percent in an overbuilt market, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tung suggested unemployment will likely continue rising in Hong  
Kong during 1999 as property values fall further and stocks remain 
volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us underestimated (the financial crisis) would have  
such widespread implications,'' Tung said. ``There has been an 
enormous correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't specifically say when there will be a recovery,'' he  
said. ``1999 is going to be a difficult year for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former British colony, Hong Kong became a special  
administrative region of China on July 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tung's comments came on a day when most Asian stock markets  
closed sharply lower after being rattled by a report in an official 
Chinese newspaper suggesting a devaluation might not be harmful. 
The newspaper published comments by an economist who said 
``devaluation or floating of the renminbi (yuan) would not 
definitely be a bad thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, a spokesman for the People's Bank of China said the  
report did not represent the view of the central bank. Chinese 
officials, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu 
Rongi, have said China won't devalue its currency now. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, market jitters sent Hong Kong share prices  
tumbling. The Hang Seng Index fell 239.02 points, or 2.5 percent, 
closing at 9,499.50. In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index 
plunged 80.73 points, or 5.5 percent, to close at 1,398.02. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
fell 110.90 points, or 5.4 percent, to 1951.44, extending its 
losses to a third day in a row to wipe out its gains so far this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Clancy Can't Envision Clinton Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Clancy has thought up some wild scenarios  
for his novels, but he wouldn't even try selling the 
Clinton-Lewinsky story to a publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too implausible,'' Clancy said. ``I have trouble  
understanding the self-destructive personality of Clinton. He 
doesn't just thrive on chaos -- he genuinely loves chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan was more Clancy's type of president.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are 250 million people whom your decisions will affect --  
you better have a strong sense of what's right and what's wrong,'' 
he said in the Jan. 29-31 edition of USA Weekend. ``Unfortunately, 
we live in a country where that's no longer the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clancy has written 10 novels and lives in an estate on  
Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. This week ABC is airing ``Tom Clancy's 
Net Force,'' a two-part movie about FBI agents who police the 
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Brain Blood Flow, Alzheimer Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rogue bits of a natural protein may promote  
Alzheimer's disease by disrupting the flow of blood in tiny vessels 
of the brain, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study provides more evidence that vitamin E and other  
antioxidants may fight the disease, and suggests that finding 
treatments to restore normal blood flow may also pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what causes most cases of Alzheimer's.  
Many point to overproduction of natural protein fragments called 
amyloid-beta, which form clumps in the brains of patients. Studies 
show these fragments can kill brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work suggests amyloid-beta, or related fragments, can  
promote Alzheimer's in a second way: by boosting production of 
harmful substances called oxygen radicals, which in turn keep tiny 
blood vessels from delivering the right amounts of blood to brain 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is presented in the February issue of the journal  
Nature Neuroscience by neurologist Dr. Constantino Iadecola of the 
University of Minnesota with colleagues there and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, senior medical and scientific adviser to  
the Alzheimer's Association, called the work exciting and said it 
reveals ``a very important part of the story'' of what causes the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In the brain, amyloid-beta fragments are clipped from long  
proteins called APP. The researchers studied a strain of mice that 
overproduce APP, which leads to an overproduction of amyloid-beta. 
Mice from this strain eventually develop mental problems resembling 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, the mice were studied long before any  
Alzheimer's-type symptoms appeared. Researchers found that 
microscopic blood vessels in the mice brains didn't respond to a 
chemical signal to dilate, which would increase blood flow. In 
normal life that might mean the vessels can't shunt more blood to 
brain cells when they need it, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually that could damage those starved cells, or at least  
make them more vulnerable to damage from other causes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the mice produce other fragments of APP in excess,  
the study can't formally show that amyloid-beta is the cause of the 
brain troubles in the mice, Iadecola said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found two bits of evidence that oxygen radicals  
were involved in the blood vessel problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were able to prevent the abnormality by bathing the  
brain with an antioxidant, which render oxygen radicals harmless. 
In addition, mice that were programmed genetically to overproduce 
an antioxidant in addition to APP didn't show the abnormality in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Iadecola said a 1997 study of Alzheimer patients found that  
vitamin E, an antioxidant, modestly slowed the course of the 
disease.

<HEADLINE> Amoco To Sell Low-Sulfur Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The oil giant BP Amoco will soon start selling a  
low-sulfur gasoline in 40 cities worldwide within two years as part 
of an effort to cut vehicle pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman John Browne said up to 16 of those cities will be in  
the United States, specifically identifying Detroit and Chicago. 
The low-sulfur gasoline will start selling in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction in the sulfur level will vary from city to city.  
</P>
<P>
	Browne, speaking to business leaders, did not specify if the  
reductions would involve bringing all brands below the current 
industry low of 200 parts per million for Amoco Ultimate. In the 40 
cities, the low-sulfur gasoline will not be in all brands, but in a 
specific brand, such as Amoco Ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said eventually the company intends to reduce sulfur  
parts per million to meet or exceed the 2005 European goal of 50 
ppm. The industry average is 350 ppm, with a cap per gallon of 
1,000 ppm, according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, which has 14,000 gas stations in the United States,  
intends to completely convert to lower-sulfur fuel within three to 
five years, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversion process involves setting up refineries to  
specifically produce gasoline with lower-level sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say the move isn't unexpected.  
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Terreson, of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said a  
fragmented and competitive refining industry has contributed to low 
gas prices. As a result, consumers have been getting more 
environmentally friendly fuel without a boost in cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a pretty coordinated effort ... to improve the  
quality of air'' by the auto industry and oil companies, Terreson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows last year's announcement by BP that it intended  
to reduce emissions from refineries, oil fields and petrochemical 
plants by 10 percent by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	And in December, a dozen states urged the Environmental  
Protection Agency to require low-sulfur gasoline nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of providing reduced sulfur fuel is unclear, Browne  
said. But Susan Hahn, of the American Petroleum Institute, said the 
gasoline will cost more because the refining industry will have to 
invest about $3 billion in new processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's decision drew praise from President Clinton. ``By  
using the latest technology to custom-tailor fuels to address the 
unique pollution concerns of these cities, the company will help 
produce cleaner, healthier air for millions of people worldwide,'' 
Clinton said in a statement released by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups, which have called for significant  
reductions in sulfur, gave a mixed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no substitute for national clean gasoline standards --  
no substitute for national standards to remove most of the sulfur 
for gasoline,'' said Clean Air Trust executive director Frank 
O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
	While he praised BP Amoco's effort, he said high sulfur levels,  
which cause vehicles to emit higher levels of smog-forming 
pollutants, are ``a national problem and we need a national 
solution.''

<HEADLINE> Sugar Beet Leaders Seek Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. (AP) -- Sugar beet industry leaders believe  
they can lure farmers back to the crop a year after one of the 
worst seasons in North Platte Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the industry is not back to full health, growers and  
processors point to encouraging signs that the last decade's beet 
crisis may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent sugar prices have been strong and stable, promising to  
put an extra $2 to $3 per ton in the pockets of beet growers by the 
time the 1998 beet crop is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Scottsbluff-based Western Sugar Co. and Holly  
Sugar Corp.'s plant in Torrington, Wyo., said their growers planted 
a combined 60,000 acres in 1998, the lowest in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Early feedback suggests Holly's acreage will rebound from last  
year's 19,000 acres, said Rick Griffith, the plant's agricultural 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some farmers who were out of the business for a  
couple of years and are asking for information about beets,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Sugar hopes to add 15,000 acres to the 40,357 planted  
last year by their growers, said Owen Palm, a vice president for 
the firm's parent company, Tate &AMP; Lyle LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides stronger prices, improvements in pest management may win  
back even more farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Results from test plots throughout the valley have boosted  
confidence that the right seeds will ward off yield-killing 
diseases. Genetically-engineered seeds and new chemical also are 
being developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a low sugar content in last fall's crop, aggressive  
spraying for diseases such as leaf spot helped lift yields to near 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	With new pesticides, ``we think we have a good handle on what  
the potential of this crop can be,'' Palm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of Western Sugar's growers group in the valley said  
ongoing contract talks may decide how many farmers return. Western 
Sugar is working with growers in four states on a new contract, 
which must be approved before beet acres can be signed up for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the company's willing to give a little more, we may have a  
few more acres,'' said Randy Hoff of rural Mitchell, president of 
the Nebraska Non-Stock Sugarbeet Growers Association. ``If they're 
not, it's doubtful that it will change much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, depressed markets for corn and other crops may make  
farmers more willing to grow beets, said Dave Hinman of Wheatland, 
Wyo., president of the Platte Valley Wyo-Braska Sugar Beet Growers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the corn prices being what they are and Freedom to Farm  
(the 1996 federal farm bill), you don't have to plant corn to be in 
the program,'' said Hinman, whose group is affiliated with Holly's 
Torrington plant.

<HEADLINE> Canadian's Execution To Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A Canadian awaiting execution in Texas has failed  
in his attempt to have the U.S. Supreme Court consider whether his 
case violated international law. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court refused Monday to hear the appeal of Joseph  
Stanley Faulder, clearing the way for him to receive a new 
execution date. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, a Canadian delegation led by Parliament member  
Art Hanger concluded that the country should drop efforts to block 
his execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he has, indeed, received due process. More than due  
process, actually,'' said Hanger, a Calgary member of the 
conservative Reform Party. ``Now the time has come ... that he just 
be executed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After pleas by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, U.S.  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright unsuccessfully sought a 
reprieve for Faulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder would be the first Canadian executed in the United  
States since 1952. Anti-death penalty advocates and Canadian 
diplomats have lobbied for a commuted sentence for Faulder. Canada 
does not have capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder, 61, of Jasper, Alberta, received a stay from the  
Supreme Court on Dec. 10, minutes before his scheduled execution 
for the 1975 death of Inez Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Faulder argued that Texas authorities violated  
international law allowing suspects to have access to diplomats 
from their home country. The attorneys, Sandra Babcock and Kurt 
Sauer, did not return calls Monday from The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> A St. Louis Homecoming for Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A tide of history has passed under the Eads  
Bridge since Karol Wojtyla dropped by St. Louis 30 years ago, a 
vigorous Polish cardinal bent on improving his English on his first 
visit to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, including himself, even dreamed he would be returning as  
Pope John Paul II, the 263rd successor of Peter and among the dozen 
longest reigning pontiffs in the 2,000 years of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then a Polish priest friend had suggested he might find his  
warmest welcome in any U.S. diocese that had a fellow cardinal. So 
the tourist from Krakow ascended the Sears Tower in Chicago, 
witnessed the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, went 
canoeing on a seminary lake near Detroit and took his first 
helicopter ride to a shrine outside Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Parishioners at St. Stanislaus Kostka church here fed him spicy  
Polish sausages and took him down to the banks of the Mississippi 
where he saw Eero Saarinen's soaring 630-foot steel arch and his 
music-loving ears heard a riverboat calliope pump out ``St. Louie 
Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three decades since have witnessed dramatic changes in his  
life and the world that he came to regard as his home parish. He 
has visited more than 100 countries in a half million miles of 
relentless travel to every corner of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been seen live by more people in more places than any  
statesman, rock star or sports idol like Pele or Michael Jordan or 
Mark McGuire. A third of Ireland's and half of Poland's population 
came out to see him. Five million knelt for his blessing on a dusty 
field in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	But his influence has been more wide-ranging than all his  
travels. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opinion of Czech President Vaclav Havel, Henry Kissinger,  
Margaret Thatcher and many others, this head of the 109-acre 
Vatican state was the key player in dooming European Communism and 
bringing down the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	As a mediator, he averted a war between Chile and Argentina.  
</P>
<P>
	``Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' a book he found time to  
write on planes, led The New York Times bestseller list and was a 
runaway success in 21 languages. 
</P>
<P>
	He brought about the first revised Catholic Catechism since the  
Council of Trent in the 16th century. The U.S. edition sold an 
astonishing 2 million copies in hardback. 
</P>
<P>
	He was Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1994. He was ``Man of  
the Century'' in Jonathan Kwitny's biography. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-year reign, he has battled the Jesuits and the Mafia. He  
has taken on the United Nations, defeating a proposal at a Cairo 
population conference that he perceived as a worldwide endorsement 
of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had historic meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev, who asked  
for his blessing; Fidel Castro, who for once hung up his jungle 
fatigues and wore a dark business suit; Yasser Arafat, Kurt 
Waldheim, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, and four U.S. 
presidents including Bill Clinton, whom he will be meeting for the 
fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's last Communist boss, recently  
admitted ``my legs were trembling and my knees knocking together'' 
when he met the man largely responsible for his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The bearer of the white leather passport Vaticano No. 1 has  
flown the French Concord from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion to 
Zambia, wept at Auschwitz and Hiroshima, prayed at Gandhi's shrine 
on the banks of the Ganges. 
</P>
<P>
	On perhaps his shortest journey, he crossed the Tiber and become  
the first pope to visit Rome's main synagogue. ``A 2 kilometer 
trip,'' remarked Rabbi Elio Toaff, ``that took 2,000 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times the welcome mat has been a bit frayed. John Paul II got  
a frosty reception from Holland's liberal Catholics, had to thunder 
``silencio'' when Communist hecklers interrupted his homily in 
Nicaragua and was jeered by gays in San Francisco chanting ``curb 
your dogma'' and ``pope go homo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A remarkable linguist, he is fluent in eight languages and has  
trained himself to deliver sermons and greetings in a couple of 
dozen more, including Japanese and Swahili, by bringing in a 
missionary as a tutor before embarking on a trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling ceaselessly for two decades in the shoes of the  
Fisherman has taken its toll. John Paul has survived an assassin's 
bullet fired from less than 20 feet, undergone surgery to remove an 
orange-sized precancerous tumor, had a hip replacement after a 
bathroom fall and now shows the slurred speech and trembling, 
crippling symptoms of Parkinson's disease (though the Vatican has 
not commented on any possible illness). 
</P>
<P>
	But just when he seems to be slumping in his chair from sheer  
fatigue, almost dozing, he is still capable of igniting the old 
charisma. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds, especially youth groups, seem to rejuvenate him. He can  
still mesmerize audiences with the deep baritone delivery that the 
actor Sir John Gielgud praised for its pace, timing and dramatic 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago when parishioners from St. Stanislaus Kostka  
church attended a private audience in the papal apartment, the 
pontiff almost forgot his first visit to St. Louis. Then he 
remembered those sausages, redolent with garlic and pepper, made by 
local Polish butcher Thaddeus Piekutowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted, the butcher's son now presiding at the grinder, has just  
delivered 50 more pounds of those sausages to Archbishop Justin 
Rigali's residence to welcome back a beloved tourist.

<HEADLINE> Paroled Child Rapist Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A year ago, David S. Kelley assured wary parents  
in the suburb of Northboro they had no reason to worry: He had 
served his time for child molestation and had registered as a sex 
offender as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, Kelley was arraigned on charges he raped a little  
boy in town, raising questions about the usefulness of registration 
laws that have been enacted across the country. He pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing the sex offender registry information does is  
provide notification that you have somebody with that disposition 
living among you,'' Northboro Police Chief Kenneth Hutchins said. 
``It doesn't provide a guarantee that the person won't commit 
another sex offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he moved to Northboro, about 30 miles west of Boston,  
Kelley, 43, assured residents he no longer posed a threat to 
children because of intensive therapy received in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Released in 1996 after serving 10 years for child rape, Kelley  
was classified by the state as the most serious type of sexual 
predator. The classification means he is considered a high risk to 
repeat his offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no reason to worry,'' Kelley told the MetroWest  
Daily News at the time. ``I stay away from kids. I stay away from 
everybody. I work nights. I sleep days. I don't want this brought 
up again. I've done my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That argument is often cited by civil liberties activists who  
say that after time is served -- no matter how unsavory the crime -- 
a former convict has a constitutional right to pursue a normal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Murphy, a former Middlesex County prosecutor who  
specializes in child abuse cases, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not: Did he serve his time?'' she said. ``The  
issue is: Does he continue to pose a risk to defenseless 
children?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many pedophiles, getting out of jail does not ease the  
compulsion to hurt children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that people who molest children tend to be  
recidivists,'' Murphy said. ``It's very rare to find a one-time 
offender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley was charged with raping a 4-year-old boy in town. He was  
ordered held without bail after pleading innocent to charges of 
child rape and molestation. Prosecutors said the attack happened 
last week at a home. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  
Police declined to offer details on the recent allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In January last year, concerned parents raised the issue of  
Kelley's prison release at a meeting with school officials when 
they learned Kelley's mother lived near a local elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the questions was whether we would consider putting up  
a fence around the school,'' recalled Robert Melican, 
superintendent of Northboro/Southboro schools. ``That's the sad 
part about it. Something happens, and you wonder if you could've 
done something different. It's just a travesty.''

<HEADLINE> ADM CEO Andreas Retires at 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- In 28 years as chairman of the board of  
Archer Daniels Midland Co., Dwayne Andreas transformed a regional 
grain processor into an agribusiness giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, 80, is retiring, ADM announced Monday. He will become  
chairman emeritus and will remain on the board. His nephew Allen 
Andreas, the company's chief executive officer, will be chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't be surprised when an 80-year-old executive  
retires, but I was a bit here. I thought he might die in his boots. 
His life has been this company,'' said John McMillin, an analyst 
with Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwayne Andreas' savvy use of political connections is credited  
for much of the company's growth, but he also headed ADM when it 
was rocked by a price-fixing scandal that likely took an emotional 
toll, McMillin said. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Michael was thought to be a potential heir to the  
chairmanship before he and two former employees were convicted last 
fall on federal price-fixing charges. They are scheduled to be 
sentenced Feb. 26. Michael Andreas is now on leave as an executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM also pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in 1996 and paid  
$100 million in federal fines for fixing prices for the feed 
additive lysine and citric acid. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe caused Dwayne Andreas to be the target of increasing  
criticism from shareholders and others for his iron-fisted control 
of ADM, which included putting close friends and relatives both on 
the board of directors and in top executive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Andreas, 55, joined the company in 1973 and has served as  
treasurer, vice president-Europe and special counsel to the 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillin said large shareholders feel that Allen Andreas is open  
to them having more input in the direction of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Messick, a professor of business ethics at  
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management 
said, ``it's kind of a pity he is to be followed by another family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a publicly owned company that has been run like a family  
operation for a very long time and that's probably not in the best 
interest of shareholders,'' Messick said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, ADM's stock rose 18 3/4  
cents to close at $15.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwayne Andreas joined ADM in 1966 and was elected chairman and  
CEO in 1970. At the time, ADM owned 40 processing plans and 
employed less than 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now employs 23,000 worldwide, owns 274 processing  
plants and had net sales in 1998 of more than $16 billion, company 
officials said. ADM produces everything from soybean oil to 
high-fructose corn syrup to cocoa powder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Peltzman, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate  
School of Business who specializes in antitrust and government 
regulation, said he doubted the price-fixing scandal will 
overshadow what Andreas helped ADM accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a successful business. Whatever you think of the  
man, you have to give Andreas a lot of credit for it. His main 
success was his ability to play Washington politics as much as the 
business side,'' Peltzman said.

<P>
	Leonard Teitelbaum, a managing director with Merrill Lynch  
Global Securities who follows ADM, said he believes Dwayne Andreas 
will continue to cast a long shadow at ADM -- offering advice, 
opinions and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think this man is going to go down and captain his  
shuffleboard team in Florida, you can forget about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Ex-Wife Asks for Leniency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- The ex-wife of a prominent attorney  
convicted of killing his mistress asked Monday that the man's life 
be spared, for the sake of their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to stand by my man. I'm here to stand by my  
daughters,'' said Kay Ryan. She adopted her maiden name last year 
after divorcing Thomas Capano and ending a 26-year marriage that 
produced four children and was -- by Capano's own admission -- marked 
by numerous infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Capano, a  
former state prosecutor and high-profile political adviser. He was 
convicted of murdering Anne Marie Fahey, the governor's scheduling 
secretary, and dumping her body at sea in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers are asking the jury to recommend that Superior  
Court Judge William Swain Lee give Capano life in prison without 
parole, instead of the death penalty. The hearing is expected to 
last through the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Capano's trial began in late October, Ms. Ryan has been a  
frequent visitor to the courtroom, often accompanying her teen-age 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Capano killed Ms. Fahey because she wanted to  
end their secret, three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am as repulsed by his vile actions and behavior as most of  
you here in this courtroom,'' Ms. Ryan said. But, she added, ``for 
everything he has done, he has been a loving father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's lawyers say that even in jail, Capano can give support  
to his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's youngest daughter, Alexandria, 13, said that even with  
her father in jail, he can still offer encouragement and she can 
communicate with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still there as much as he can be and we need that,'' she  
said, her voice breaking as she spoke to the jury. ``He's still our 
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's other three daughters were also expected to testify  
this week.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Currency, China Affect Soy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures plummeted more than 8 cents Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade on news of heanlthy doses of rain in South 
America and reports that China may devalue its currency as Brazil 
did earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, prices for crude and heating oil futures fell,  
as did cotton, sugar and cocoa futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the soybean and grain traders were responding, in  
large part, to reports of heavy rains in Argentina and Brazil over 
the weekend. Topsoil moisture was reported to be particularly good 
in Argentina, where dryness has threatened summer crops, including 
soybeans and corn. More rain could mean bigger crops, which would 
drive prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a drying trend in South America for about the last  
three weeks,'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. 
Commodities Inc. ``This is the first measurable precipitation we've 
gotten.... 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what really put us into contract lows today from the  
get-go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roose said soybean and grains also are continuing to feel  
pressure from Brazilian government's decision to devalue the real 
on Jan. 12. Analysts say there is concern that China will follow 
suit in an attempt to spur exports of such crops as soybeans and 
cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``That continues to be an overhead fear,'' Roose said of the  
possibility that China will devalue its currency, the yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, soybeans for March delivery fell 8 1/4 cents to  
$5.17 1/2 a bushel; March wheat fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; 
March corn fell 3/4 cents to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; and March oats fell 1/2 
cent to $1.06 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and heating oil futures gave back some of the gains from  
last week's surge on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices had 
been bolstered by an unexpected drop in heating oil supplies due to 
the cold snap earlier in the month. But forecasters are calling for 
warmer weather in the upper Midwest in the next two weeks, meaning 
heating oil consumption will likely be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, crude for March delivery fell 25 cents to  
$12.44 a barrel; February heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 32.15 cents 
a gallon; February unleaded gasoline fell .70 cent to 34.83 cents a 
gallon; and February natural gas fell .64 cent to $1.714 per 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in trading on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York, technical factors coupled with jitters about Brazil and China 
contributed to a sharp drop in cotton futures prices. March cotton 
fell 1.17 cents to 57.37 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, you're looking at a worldwide situation here where  
our economy is doing great, but everybody else is struggling, so 
that's going to be a big factor down the road,'' said Sid Love, a 
cotton analyst based in Kansas City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the continued fall for sugar futures prices also  
tied to the economy in Brazil, the world's largest sugar grower. 
But they say that, while Brazil is the fourth-largest cocoa 
producer, the continued fall of cocoa futures is tied more to a 
lack of demand from chocolate producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for March delivery fell .13 cent to a contract-low  
6.97 cents a pound. March cocoa fell $7 to $1,310 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Re-Sign Alan Henderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Free agent forward Alan Henderson returned to  
practice with the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday after signing a 
seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks president Stan Kasten refused to disclose the terms of the  
contract, which was signed late Saturday. The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said it was believed to be for $45 million and 
include an option to reopen the deal after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any question this is where I wanted to play,''  
Henderson said at the Hawks' fourth practice to prepare for the 
lockout-shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``And what I appreciated from their standpoint is, they never  
gave me a deadline, never said, `Well, if you don't sign by 
such-and-such a date, we're going after somebody else,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 26, is entering his fourth NBA season. He was  
selected by the Hawks in the first round (16th pick overall) out of 
Indiana in the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he averaged 17.8 points and seven rebounds after  
joining the starting lineup in place of Christian Laettner when 
Laettner became ill with a high fever Feb. 10 in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson appeared winded during the workout Sunday at Life  
University in suburban Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be caught up to everybody else in a couple of days,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Balanchine Gets Ballet Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The late choreographer George Balanchine was  
toasted on his 95th birthday by Mikhail Baryshnikov, one-time 
member of the New York City Ballet, and Peter Martins, the 
company's ballet master in chief, and a ballet was premiered in 
Balanchine's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, to commemorate the birthday of the man who founded  
the New York City Ballet, Martins promised a new ballet on all his 
birthdays. Balanchine died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, to honor that promise, the New York City Ballet  
premiered ``Walton Cello Concerto,'' choreographed by Martins. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Walton,'' Balanchine's neoclassical style is evident in  
Martins' moves. And the similarity of styles was easily seen as 
Balanchine's ``Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' ended the evening at the 
New York State Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The excellent Damian Woetzel, fine as a soloist and considerate  
as a partner, has sections of the ballet with Miranda Weese and 
with Alexandra Ansanelli. Weese, wearing green, was a lyrical and 
graceful sylph in introspective musical passages. Ansanelli, 
wearing red, generally danced the fast portions of the music, full 
of fire and pizzazz. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem Martins faced was his choice of music. The ``Walton  
Cello Concerto'' changes mood too often for a smooth ballet. The 
thread of the dance was often broken by a drastic change in music 
tempo, which the choreographer followed. When both ballerinas were 
dancing with Woetzel and the music abruptly became fast, Martins 
hurled all of them into manic spins. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick Zlotkin played the cello solo and Hugo Fiorato  
conducted the New York City Ballet Orchestra. The evening began 
with Jerome Robbins' ``2 &AMP; 3 Part Inventions'' to piano music of 
Bach. Nancy McDill was soloist. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the evening's performance,Martins came on stage to  
announce a toast ``to a great man who continuously gives us all so 
much pleasure, and I'm sure will forever.'' Martins asked 
Baryshnikov to say ``Happy Birthday'' in Russian to celebrate both 
Balanchine and the New York City Ballet, which is celebrating its 
50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Then both men took swigs of Russian vodka.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Leader Seeks New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A national leader in the anti-abortion  
movement has questioned the wisdom of his organization's scheduled 
reunion in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert Schenck, who helped organize the massive  
``Spring of Life'' abortion protests in Buffalo in 1992, said he 
will not take part in the reunion in the wake of the fatal shooting 
of a doctor who performed abortions here. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenck said the days of the Operation Rescue-type  
demonstrations have passed and asked local anti-abortion leaders to 
consider calling off the reunion of the protests that placed him in 
the national spotlight seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new time, it calls for new methods,'' Schenck told  
The Buffalo News on Sunday. ``We cannot revisit the past. Perhaps 
we ought to be clearing the slate and making a whole new agenda for 
the pro-life movement. Peaceful pro-life dissent is always 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schenck said new strategies for the anti-abortion movement could  
include encouraging stricter government regulation of abortion 
providers, and helping women who have suffered complications during 
abortions to file suit. He said the number of public-interest law 
firms that represent women injured while undergoing abortions is on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenck's comments came the day after first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton announced a plan to counter abortion clinic violence and 
three months after the Oct. 23 sniper shooting of Dr. Barnett 
Slepian. 
</P>
<P>
	Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who performed  
abortions, was struck by a bullet fired through his kitchen window 
in the suburb of Amherst. The killer is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have already communicated my concerns to the local pro-life  
leadership,'' Schenck said. ``It's their decision. I'm not going to 
participate.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Census Can't Use Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 2000 census cannot be adjusted to make up  
for an expected undercount of minorities, the Supreme Court said 
today, ruling for taxpayers who challenged the Clinton 
administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal census law bars use of statistical methods intended  
to make the national population count more nearly accurate, the 
justices said in a divided ruling that could have a major effect on 
money and votes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	When the census law was amended in 1976, ``At no point ... did a  
single member of Congress suggest that the amendments would so 
fundamentally change the manner in which the (Census) Bureau could 
calculate the population for purposes of apportionment,'' Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said ``it tests the limits of reason'' to suggest that  
Congress would have been silent in enacting ``what would arguably 
be the single most significant change in the method of conducting 
the decennial census since its inception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusting the census likely would have helped Democrats because  
minorities and inner-city residents, who tend to vote Democratic, 
made up a large share of the estimated 4 million people missed by 
the 1990 count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose adjusting the numbers to make up for that  
undercount because people who tend to vote Republican also are more 
likely to voluntarily respond to the census. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining O'Connor's decision that adjusting the census figures is  
unlawful were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices 
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,  
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who said the federal 
census law did not bar the government from adjusting the figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Census counts have been imperfect since Thomas Jefferson oversaw  
the first one in 1790. All sides acknowledge that census-takers 
cannot expect to find every American. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in today's case was whether the government may use  
modern statistical knowledge to estimate how many people were 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' of the  
nation's population every 10 years to help divide the 435 members 
of the House of Representatives among the states. Census figures 
also are used to draw congressional, state and local voting 
districts, and to hand out $180 billion in federal funds each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower courts ruled the government's proposal unlawful last  
year, saying a federal census law barred adjustment of census 
figures used for dividing the House members among the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration lawyers contended the government has  
estimated at least part of the population in each census since 
1940, but acknowledged the new plan was a significant change. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republicans' lawyers said the Constitution and federal  
census law allow only a one-by-one head count. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said that because the census law barred the use of  
statistical sampling, the high court was not deciding whether such 
methods would violate the Constitution's ``actual enumeration'' 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's census plans were challenged by taxpayers in  
six states -- Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- who said adjusting the census would 
cost them federal money and political power. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans also sued, saying the Constitution and federal  
census law allow only a one-by-one head count. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court said the taxpayers had legal standing to sue,  
and today's ruling was based on their case. The Republicans' appeal 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court had aimed for an early decision in the case to  
give the government time to plan for the census, scheduled for 
April 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The census is conducted by mail, and about two-thirds of  
Americans return their forms. Census workers then begin knocking on 
doors to find the rest, but that does not always work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's plan would use those traditional  
methods to find 90 percent of Americans, then use a separate survey 
of 750,000 people across the country as a ``quality check'' to 
decide where people were overcounted or undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled the Bush administration  
could decide not to adjust the 1990 census figures even though a 
disproportionate share of those undercounted were minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the high court said the Clinton administration cannot  
decide to adjust the figures when it wants to. 
</P>
<P>
	The census law ``directly prohibits the use of sampling in the  
determination of population for purposes of apportionment,'' 
O'Connor wrote. ``When Congress amended ... (the law) in 1976, it 
did not in doing so alter the longstanding prohibition on the use 
of sampling in matters relating to apportionment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because today's ruling only bars the use of adjusted census  
figures for allocating House members among the states, the 
government might still be able to use adjusted numbers for drawing 
election districts and doling out federal aid. However, Congress 
could refuse to pay for creating a second set of figures for those 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in his State of the Union address, President Clinton  
said, ``Since every person in America counts, every American ought 
to be counted. We need a census that uses most modern scientific 
methods to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Stevens wrote, ``The Census Act ... unambiguously  
authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to use sampling procedures 
when taking the decennial census.'' He also contended the 
Constitution allowed use of such methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the government's appeal were cities including New York,  
Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and others that said they would lose 
if the figures were not adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Department of Commerce vs. House of  
Representatives, 98-404, and Clinton vs. Glavin, 98-564.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise Slightly / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose slightly today on optimism over  
recent steps to mend ailing banks and on growing expectation 
government measures to boost economic growth will soon begin to 
work. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.34 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.64  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but less than its New York level of 
114.54 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 54.41 points,  
or 0.38 percent, to close at 14,208.81. On Friday, the average 
closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas investors are praising Japan's economic policies,''  
said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of equity trading at Okasan 
Securities. He said investors from abroad are reacting especially 
favorably to progress at Japanese banks in writing off their 
problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about further possible declines in markets in Asia  
and New York will likely cap further gains in Tokyo stocks, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were little changed most of the day following a  
decline in U.S. stock prices Friday when the Dow Jones industrial 
average closed at 9,120.67, down 143.41 from Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices inched higher in the afternoon led by a gain in the  
price of stock futures. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,098.71. The 
TOPIX closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 396.15  
million shares, down from 514.65 million shares Friday. Advancing 
issues outnumbered declines 691 to 433, while 173 stocks were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was higher against the yen today on continued worries  
over the Brazilian currency crisis and speculation the Chinese yuan 
might be devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that the dollar's strength against the yen derived  
from suspicions Brazil's financial woes will hurt Asian markets as 
much as those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency rose as high as 114.83 yen, buoyed in part by  
a report in a Chinese business weekly quoting analysts as saying a 
currency devaluation wouldn't be so bad for China, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged not to devalue their  
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar lost much of that gain, falling to as low as  
114.15 yen, amid worries trade friction between the United States 
and Japan may be increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher, in Tokyo for  
trade talks today, said Japan's trade surplus had grown ``too 
large'' and the United States wanted to see it shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that signs of growing U.S. irritation with Japan's  
huge trade surplus would weigh on the dollar because a stronger yen 
is seen as one way of bringing the surplus down. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 40.1 percent in 1998  
from the previous year to a record-high $121.8 billion, the 
government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 132.70 yen, up from 131.92 yen late  
Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.780 percent from Friday's finish of 1.725 
percent, driving its price down to 100.16 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Web Porn Age Checks Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Age-verification systems required under a  
federal law designed to keep online pornography away from children 
would be inexpensive, secure and simple to run, a computer expert 
testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan R. Olsen Jr. contradicted testimony given last week by  
computer experts and Web site operators who said such systems would 
increase costs and decrease traffic to their pages, effectively 
putting them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that encryption systems, which encode credit  
card numbers to foil online theft, are good enough that consumers 
should not worry about becoming victims of fraud any more than they 
would when using their cards in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I wanted to steal a credit card, I'd become a waiter in a  
restaurant,'' said Olsen, a computer professor at Brigham Young 
University who testified for the Justice Department about the Child 
Online Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the law, which  
would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number 
or some other access code as proof of age before allowing users to 
view material deemed harmful to minors. President Clinton signed 
the law last year, but U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. 
temporarily blocked its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed is expected to decide by Feb. 1 whether a more permanent  
delay should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The law's supporters say it is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. The ACLU, however, contends the law 
violates the First Amendment and claims mainstream sites may 
inadvertently be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU last week argued that parts of the hearing should be  
closed to the public to protect some Web sites from releasing 
proprietary information. Several news organizations filed a motion 
to keep the hearing open. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed ruled Monday that no part of the proceeding would be  
closed. Instead, he said the information would be allowed as 
evidence but not openly discussed in court, with the sensitive 
material kept under seal.

<HEADLINE> Feds Report December Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The timing of Social Security payments caused  
the federal government to record a $5.4 billion deficit in 
December, compared with a $13.6 billion surplus a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The December deficit caused an increased deficit for the first  
quarter of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1. The deficit for the 
first three months of the year totaled $55 billion, up 39 percent 
from the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, the Treasury 
Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that Social Security payments, normally scheduled to be  
mailed Jan. 3, which fell on a Sunday, were instead sent on Dec. 
31. That raised Social Security spending to $66.4 billion in 
December, compared with $35.6 billion a year earlier, and pushed 
total spending to a monthly record of $184.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Clinton administration forecast a budget  
surplus for all of fiscal 1999 of $76 billion, up from $70.2 
billion in 1998. That surplus was the first since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some private economists are more pessimistic about  
economic growth this year than government forecasters and believe 
the surplus could slip to about $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth of individual income-tax payments is slowing pretty  
significantly and corporate payments are down,'' said economist 
James Glassman of Chase Securities Inc. ``That's not surprising 
since corporate profits have taken a hit this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate tax payments from October through December totaled  
$47.6 billion, down 7.1 percent from the same period a year 
earlier. Individual income-tax payments during the quarter were up 
6.4 percent from a year earlier to $187.6 billion. But individual 
payments had increased 12.4 percent in fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Welfare Reduced More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging it is getting tougher to clear  
public assistance rolls, President Clinton appealed Monday for 
corporations to help ``deal with the remaining people on welfare'' 
by hiring and training with their needs in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a welfare-to-work ceremony as his  
administration released new figures that reflect both a 30-year low 
in welfare caseloads and some slowing of welfare declines in a few 
states. He proposed expanding or extending programs that have 
proven successful to address those mired in the most persistent 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his proposals were spending $150 million in fiscal 2000 to  
provide job training and other support for fathers, $430 million 
for housing vouchers and another $150 million for transporting 
potential workers from inner cities to suburbs, where jobs tend to 
be more abundant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any excuse not to do it,'' Clinton said. ``With  
a continually growing economy, businesses have to reach wider to 
get new talent. ... We have to see this as an opportunity to make 
permanent gains in dealing with the welfare challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
said Clinton's proposal runs counter to the trend indicated by the 
dropping caseloads and the existing $7 billion in block grants at 
states' disposal to help those remaining on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives of the poor and needy have been improved greatly,''  
Archer said. ``Now is not the time to abandon what has worked to go 
back to the failed system of throwing money at a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at  
the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. At 
the same time, some states saw welfare reductions slow during July, 
August and September, according to figures released Monday by the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, which had cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since  
1993, showed only a 1.7 percent decline in the quarter ending Sept. 
30. In Arkansas, the rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last 
quarter of fiscal 1998, after declines of about 9 percent in 
previous quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states seeing drop-offs included Arizona, Connecticut,  
Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, after nearly 
cutting its roles in half, saw a 40 percent increase during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the figures mean reform efforts have reached a  
point where the problem has become most stubborn, and special, 
targeted action must be taken to get these people into the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not charity,'' Clinton said. ``It is good for America  
to do this, and it will work because most people are good people 
and they want to do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Rosas, of St. Paul, Minn., said through a program  
targeting fathers he was able to find a better job and begin 
computer technology training, as well as resume support payments 
that keep his 12-year-old son Ricardo off welfare. He told Clinton 
fewer children would be on welfare if more of this type of help 
were available to their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've met many fathers in the program, and I know there are  
many more out there who have situations similar to, or worse than, 
my own,'' Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said this could be accomplished easily if businesses  
respond to the human needs that have become obstacles to work for 
many on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human nature will rise to the level of possibility if given  
the opportunity and the guidance and the support,'' Clinton said. 
``We must ensure that we go to the next step, that we deal with the 
remaining people on welfare, and that we do it recognizing that it 
is a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton issued his appeal, Vice President Al Gore went to  
California to announce a plan to seek $1.3 billion over five years 
to restore health and disability benefits and food stamps for legal 
immigrants who lost coverage under the 1996 welfare overhaul. The 
plan will be part of the budget Clinton sends to Congress on Feb. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of people lost benefits under the 1996  
law, triggering strong protest from states with large blocs of 
immigrants and ethnic voters, such as California and New York. The 
administration and Congress restored some of the lost benefits in 
1997 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic  
civil rights group, said the proposals were ``a good move 
politically on the part of the Clinton administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 cutoff ``graphically illustrated what people perceived  
to be the intransigence and mean-spiritedness of Congress,'' said 
spokeswoman Lisa Navarrete. ``This puts the ball back in the court 
of Congress to say, 'We are not going to do this.'''

<HEADLINE> `Big Play Ray' No Slouch With Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Big Play Ray? No doubt about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Mouth Ray? That fits, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's shutting down Randy Moss or guaranteeing a Super  
Bowl victory for the Atlanta Falcons, Ray Buchanan puts a 
bull's-eye on his chest every day and stands willingly in front of 
the firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the consummate NFL cornerback, a star student in Deion  
101. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I fear is God,'' Buchanan preaches to the  
assembled congregation. ``Everybody else is a pea in the pod.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Deion Sanders, Buchanan combines superior athletic skills  
with a steadfast arrogance that he's the best. When he looks across 
the line and sees someone like Moss or Jerry Rice, not a bit of 
trepidation creeps into Buchanan's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can go out there and cut you with a butter knife and find  
out you bleed, then I know you're human,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a Pro Bowler who ranked second in the NFC with seven  
interceptions, stirred up a tempest last week when he guaranteed a 
victory Sunday over the Denver Broncos, a la Joe Namath 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While it was clear he was goaded into making the prediction by  
Cris Collinsworth during an appearance on HBO's ``Inside the NFL,'' 
Buchanan refuses to distance himself from his inflammatory words. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I did say it, it was out of fun,'' he said Monday. ``But  
once you get in the boxing ring, you're not going to back away from 
a fight. That's the situation I'm in now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl-savvy Broncos were stunned that someone would  
actually go on record with such a bold prediction, no matter what 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you crazy?'' defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``If you  
don't have confidence going out there, you're going to get yourself 
killed. But to speak your mind and say you guarantee a win, that's 
a little deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan spoke with equal confidence before the NFC  
championship game against Minnesota, viewing the Vikings' 
high-scoring offense with downright disdain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons started out with Buchanan matched one-on-one against  
Cris Carter, while the other cornerback, Michael Booker, covered 
Moss with help from safety Eugene Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't work as the Vikings scored on their four  
possessions, including a touchdown pass to Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember vividly in the game when I came up to him and said,  
`Man, that Randy Moss cat is fast,''' Booker recalled. ``Ray says, 
`He ain't that fast! I can take him!' I couldn't believe it. He 
really wanted to play Randy Moss man-to-man all over that field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan got his wish, working more and more against Moss. The  
Vikings' rookie managed only one catch for 4 yards after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always goes out there with a sense of arrogance that he  
can't be beat,'' Booker said in admiration. ``And if he does get 
beat, he's going too come back and make a play right after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Falcons had in mind two years ago when they  
lured Buchanan away from the Indianapolis Colts with a four-year, 
$13 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves recognized right away that the secondary was  
the team's most pressing need. The Falcons surrendered an NFL 
record for passing yards in 1995 and had been looking for a decent 
coverage cornerback ever since Sanders left following the '93 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can cover anybody in this league one-on-one,,'' defensive  
coordinator Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of Buchanan allows the Falcons to be more flexible  
in their defensive schemes. They can bring strong safety William 
White closer to the line to help against the run. They can call 
more blitzes without fear of Buchanan getting beat downfield. They 
can allow Robinson to float to Booker's side of the field, helping 
out the second-year cornerback who's still perfecting his coverage 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan compensates for his lack of height -- he's only 5-foot-9  
-- by always seeming to be in the right position. 
</P>
<P>
	``His balance and body control is outstanding,'' Brooks said.  
``He has great explosion out of the break. Once he sees what a 
receiver is going to do, he can plant and drive on it as quick as 
anybody in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, on yeah, he's got the requisite bravado to play the  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't play corner in this league with a lack of  
confidence,'' Brooks said. ``If you do, you're going to get your 
brains beat out because you'll be worrying, `Oh, I hope they don't 
throw to my side.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray is sitting back there going, `Throw it to my side. I'm  
going to get a pick and I'm going to score.'''

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Retailer J. Peterman on Monday sought  
Bankruptcy Court protection from its creditors. The catalog 
company, whose nostalgic, high-priced clothing and accessories have 
inspired imitation as well as satire on the ``Seinfeld'' television 
comedy series, complained of poor holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Lexington was to consider motions  
in the filing on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,  
which enables a company to keep operating under a court's 
supervision while it develops a plan for returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The holiday season in catalog was soft,'' which caused  
inventory overstocks, John Peterman, the company's founder, told 
WKYT-TV in Lexington. Lawyers for the company told the station 
there were no immediate plans to close any of the company's 13 
stores or to lay off any of its 600 employees, 400 of whom work in 
Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the company by The Associated Press were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman started his business in 1987 with a catalog that became  
noted for its quirky copy, which featured extended personal musings 
about the retro-style clothing and accessories offered for sale. 
The marketing approach was imitated by other retailers and become 
the target of satire by the top-rated television comedy 
``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the show's final three seasons, ending last May, the  
character Elaine worked for J. Peterman, whose headquarters were 
relocated to New York for the show's purposes. There, she was 
terrorized by a fictional version of John Peterman (played by 
character actor John O'Hurley), who delivered spacy monologues 
about his world travels, ramblings that echoed the catalog's copy. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Peterman, a much more straightforward businessman,  
professed to enjoy the joke and decided early last year to 
capitalize on the ``Seinfeld'' notoriety with a retail rollout that 
included plans for 50 stores and 20 catalog outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives were recruited from J. Crew, Calvin Klein and The  
Gap, $10 million was raised from private investors and plans were 
made to target upscale markets. 
</P>
<P>
	By last month, though, the company had laid off 20 people at its  
Lexington headquarters and put a freeze on new store openings 
through mid-1999. Peterman blamed worldwide financial upheaval and 
uncertainty surrounding the impeachment of President Clinton for 
slower-than-expected sales in the catalog business and said the 
company was experiencing ``growing pains.''

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Drop / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures fell in early dealings  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say traders have been particularly worried about rains  
over the weekend in Brazil and Argentina, which could relieve 
dryness that has threatened summer crops there -- particularly 
soybeans and corn. A bigger supply generally means lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also say there is concern that China may be exporting  
soybeans and devaluing its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for March delivery fell 2 1/2 cents  
to $2.68 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; 
March oats fell 1 3/4 cents to $1.05 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 7 1/4 
cents to $5.18 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .02 cent to 63.17 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .28 cent to 74.35 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell .55 cent to 43.10 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell 3 cents to 55.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Truants Face Jail in Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The parents of nine students were summoned to  
court Monday for failing to get their children to attend school 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	The court appearances were the end result of a long process in  
which school officials encouraged, cajoled and finally threatened 
parents of chronically absent children. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman's husband is in jail, leaving her to work full time to  
support the son she hopes will go to school after she leaves the 
house early each morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mother reluctantly admitted her daughter stays home from  
school to help her when she is sick. 
</P>
<P>
	These were two of the explanations the city judge heard.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every day she gets up and they talk, and she asks him if he's  
going to school,'' attorney Susan Land told District Judge 
Charlotte M. Cooksey, explaining the difficulty her client, Helen 
Pazdzioko, has in getting her son Michael to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says yes and she goes to work... There's not much more she  
can do other than quit her job and go to school with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooksey said something has to be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``It can be solved in a way you and your son like, but it has to  
be solved,'' the judge told Mrs. Pazdzioko and her son, who said he 
skipped school because he was ``picked on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Pazdzioko was among four parents found guilty Monday. Four  
others had their cases postponed so they could find attorneys, and 
a warrant was issued for the ninth, who could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine face up to 30 days in prison, a $500 fine, and the loss  
of custody of their children if they continue to miss school. No 
one was sentenced yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are the worst among a group of 48 singled out by  
school officials from among the 750 students at Canton Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The program already appears to be working. Attendance, while  
still slightly below the state average, rose from 88.4 percent 
during the fall of 1997, to 91.2 percent this fall at the school, 
which has students in grades 6, 7 and 8.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Sues Paper Over Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A reporter says he was illegally fired by a  
legal newspaper for refusing to write a ``hit piece'' on a local 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a damage suit against publishers of The Recorder, Martin  
Kassman said he and other reporters were ordered last spring to 
write profiles of the best and worst judge in the courts they 
covered, based on interviews with lawyers and the reporters' own 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassman, an attorney who reported on civil cases in San  
Francisco Superior and Municipal courts, said he picked a ``best'' 
judge but decided no judge was bad enough to be rated the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he couldn't talk his bosses out of doing the article and  
was fired when he refused to write it. Another reporter wrote the 
article, which ran as part of a series last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassman said The Recorder wanted him to write a ``hit piece''  
and ``pandered to lurid curiosity by deliberately predetermining to 
malign one judge from each of five courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kassman, in a lawsuit filed last month, is suing for an  
undetermined amount for emotional distress, loss of income and 
benefits and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Graham, now The Recorder's editor in chief, said Monday  
that legal counsel had advised him not to comment.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in School Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A bus taking students home from  
elementary school ran a stop sign and crashed into a semitrailer 
Monday, killing two children and the truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like it didn't see the stop sign,'' said Rebecca Clark,  
23, who was driving behind the truck. ``The bus hit right behind 
the semi's cab. It's the worst thing I ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, carrying between 20 and 25 children from two magnet  
schools, rolled at least once and ended up on its side with its 
front end badly damaged, said Pete Kersey, spokesman for the Indian 
River County Sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students were thrown around inside the bus rather severely,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tractor-trailer also rolled over at least once and went into  
a deep ditch, Kersey said. 
</P>
<P>
	One child and the truck driver were dead at the scene. A second  
child died later at the hospital. The bus driver was seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Four students were in stable condition at a hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine students and the bus driver were taken to another hospital,  
where three children were being admitted. Their injuries ranged 
from cuts and bruises to concussions and one fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	A tow truck driver and several other motorists helped pull  
students off the bus. Some injured students got out through hatches 
in the bus.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Optimistic on Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The U.S. Embassy in Singapore said Monday the  
island-state's economic growth in 1999 will likely hit the top end 
of the government's forecast, ``and possibly exceed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Singapore government has forecast that the economy in 1999  
will hover between a 1 percent decline and 1 percent growth after 
expanding 1.3 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the Singapore economy will be burdened in 1999 by  
problems beyond its borders, the embassy report said that 
``nonetheless, we believe that Singapore's strong domestic 
fundamentals, and market-oriented and pro-business policies will 
stand its well-diversified economy in good stead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy report said that although Asian financial markets  
have rebounded over the past few months, the impact of the regional 
economic crisis has yet to be felt entirely on the real economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Singapore economy will continue to be burdened in 1999 by  
problems outside its borders that arose from the Asian financial 
crisis,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These include massive unemployment, excess capacities,  
liquidity constraints, diminished wealth, collapsed demand, high 
corporate debt and withered confidence in the crisis-hit countries 
of the region, many of which are key trading and economic partners 
of Singapore,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recession in Japan, as well as slower growth expected for the  
United States could add to the problems faced by the Singapore 
economy, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government report said increased public spending and a  
government program to cut business costs by 10.5 billion Singapore 
dollars ($6.28 billion), as well as declining interest rates and a 
program of financial sector reforms pushed by the government, 
``should encourage investment, support employment, and boost 
overall competitiveness.''

<HEADLINE>  Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the capital  
murder trial of John William King, one of three men facing the 
death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, wore a bulletproof vest as he was escorted by deputies  
into Jasper County Courthouse. He is accused in the June 7 slaying 
of James Byrd Jr., who was stripped, chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged until his head came off. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 400 county residents randomly selected for  
jury selection showed up, and after initial questioning the pool 
was reduced to 122 people, 21 of them black. The selection process 
is expected to last three weeks, resulting in 12 jurors and two 
alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said many people  
have told him they were reluctant to serve because of the case's 
high profile. Byrd's murder made national news far beyond Jasper, 
an East Texas timber town of 8,000 people just west of the 
Louisiana line. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of you guys,'' he told reporters Sunday.  
``They're afraid of having their picture taken. They're afraid of 
being interviewed. And they're afraid of serving on a big case like 
this with a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	King, an ex-convict once involved in a racist prison gang, wore  
a long-sleeved shirt in the courtroom, covering his heavily 
tattooed arms. His short haircut revealed the trace of a large 
tattoo in the shape of a pentagram on the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he intended to kidnap Byrd and then to kill him will be  
key in the capital murder case -- and, if he is convicted, to 
whether he's sentenced to life in prison or put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 23, whose engraved wrench was found near  
Byrd's body, was the only defendant to give a statement about 
events leading to Byrd's death. But his statement is legally 
inadmissible unless he testifies, and his attorney says he won't 
permit Berry on the stand without a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- King, Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 --  
were roommates who shared an apartment. Berry told officers the 
three men had been drinking on June 6. Late that evening or shortly 
after midnight, the men went out for a ride in Berry's rusty, 1982 
gray Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what Berry says happened after the pickup truck stopped  
to pick up Byrd, who was walking home from his niece's bridal 
shower: 
</P>
<P>
	King objected to giving a ride to Byrd and, after the group  
stopped at a convenience store, drove to an abandoned logging road 
outside town. There, King declared he was ``fixing to scare'' Byrd. 
Berry watched as Brewer and King allegedly beat Byrd into 
unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry fled and King drove after him. After Berry got back in and  
the truck took off, he turned and said he saw Byrd's body bouncing 
behind, fastened to the bumper with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The route they took, a two-mile asphalt stretch of Huff Creek  
Road, was later marked with 75 red spray-painted circles to show 
where police found Byrd's keys, dentures and parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged King, Brewer and Berry with capital murder  
but decided to try the cases separately. King's is the second 
capital murder trial in Jasper County. The only other one was in 
1992.

<HEADLINE>  Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>

<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the capital  
murder trial of John William King, one of three men facing the 
death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, wore a bulletproof vest as he was escorted by deputies

<HEADLINE> Amoco To Sell Low-Sulfur Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Motorists in Detroit, Chicago and 38 other cities  
worldwide could be filling up with low-sulfur gasoline at BP Amoco 
stations within two years in a new program that is seeking to 
reduce vehicle pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulfur level reductions will vary from city to city, BP Amoco  
chairman John Browne said Monday while speaking at the Economic 
Club of Detroit luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really going to depend on the individual site,'' and  
their environmental needs, said Thomas Koch, director of 
environmental and corporate communications of BP America. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne did not specify if the reductions would involve bringing  
all brands below the current industry low of 200 parts per million 
for Amoco Ultimate. In the 40 cities, the low-sulfur gasoline will 
not be in all brands, but in a specific brand, such as Amoco 
Ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will eventually expand to all 27,000 BP Amoco  
stations, including 14,000 located in the United States, over the 
next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversion process involves setting up refineries to  
specifically produce gasoline with lower-level sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said eventually the company intends to reduce sulfur  
parts per million to meet or exceed the 2005 European goal of 50 
ppm. The industry average is 350 ppm, with a cap per gallon of 
1,000 ppm, according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement drew praise from President Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	``By using the latest technology to custom-tailor fuels to  
address the unique pollution concerns of these cities, the company 
will help produce cleaner, healthier air for millions of people 
worldwide,'' Clinton said in a statement released by the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say the move isn't unexpected.  
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Terreson, of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said a  
fragmented and competitive refining industry has contributed to low 
gas prices. As a result, consumers have been getting more 
environmentally friendly fuel without a boost in cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a pretty coordinated effort ... to improve the  
quality of air'' by the auto industry and oil companies, Terreson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows last year's announcement by BP that it intended  
to reduce emissions from refineries, oil fields and petrochemical 
plants by 10 percent by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	And in December, a dozen states urged the Environmental  
Protection Agency to require low-sulfur gasoline nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of providing reduced sulfur fuel is unclear, Browne  
said. But Susan Hahn of the American Petroleum Institute said the 
gasoline will cost more because the refining industry will have to 
invest about $3 billion in new processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups, which have called for significant  
reductions in sulfur, gave a mixed reaction to Browne's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no substitute for national clean gasoline standards --  
no substitute for national standards to remove most of the sulfur 
for gasoline,'' said Clean Air Trust executive director Frank 
O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
	While he praised BP Amoco's effort, he said high sulfur levels,  
which cause vehicles to emit higher levels of smog-forming 
pollutants, are ``a national problem and we need a national 
solution.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel To Look Into Babbitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are looking into Interior Secretary  
Bruce Babbitt's recent overhaul of the office that is in charge of 
straightening out $3 billion in Indian trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., chairman of the Senate  
Indian Affairs Committee, has given Babbitt until Sunday to explain 
his action and plans to hold a hearing on the matter ``sooner 
rather than later,'' committee spokesman Chris Changery said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Homan, a presidential appointee who was in charge of the  
trust office, resigned Jan. 7 after Babbitt ordered the 
reorganization. Homan, a former bank executive and federal bank 
regulator, wasn't consulted about the overhaul and accused Babbitt 
of undermining his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's action came the week before U.S. District Judge Royce  
Lamberth opened a contempt hearing into the Interior Department's 
delay in turning over trust records sought by Indians who sued the 
government over its admitted mismanagement of the funds. Lamberth 
is not expected to decide for several weeks whether to hold Babbitt 
in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Homan was appointed to his post in 1995 under a set of  
congressionally ordered reforms, and the trust office's advisory 
board accused Babbitt of making him a scapegoat for the 
department's problems in producing the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's reorganization order put one of Homan's assistants in  
charge of developing the new accounting system and replaced the 
official in charge of record keeping. During the contempt hearing, 
a Justice Department lawyer defended the reorganization, saying 
Babbitt is ``in trouble here and he's entitled to try and fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., raised questions about  
the overhaul in separate letters to Babbitt recently. Campbell said 
the reorganization would ``lead to a serious diminution'' of the 
trust office. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds include 300,000 accounts held by individual Indians  
worth $500 million and another 2,000 tribal accounts.

<HEADLINE> Government Officials Arrive in Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTT BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- Nations that pledged 40 years ago  
to devote Antarctica to peace and science are finally holding their 
first meeting on the frozen continent, allowing officials to admire 
its untouched beauty while discussing how to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24 officials from Antarctic Treaty nations who arrived today  
will spend several days touring the region and will look for ways 
to protect it from human harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great opportunity to discuss some of the real problems  
that the Antarctic is going to face in the future,'' said 
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meetings will focus on environmental problems, fishing  
disputes and the boom in tourism -- which brings 15,000 people a 
year to Antarctica, mostly from cruise ships that fly helicopters 
inland. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is the pressing issue of illegal fishing in the  
Southern Ocean, where at least 70 ships are plundering the area's 
toothfish and selling it for huge profits each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are some ways we need to extend international  
scrutiny in order to preserve wildlife, prevent pollution and 
protect the highest, driest and coldest part of earth, so be it,'' 
said Michael Meacher, Britain's environment minister. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, officials at Scott Base, New Zealand's Antarctic  
outpost, have been working to prepare for the officials' visit to 
the only continent in the world that contains no countries and no 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate them, Scott Base had to move out its own  
scientists and put their work on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the visiting ministers will sleep at Scott Base. Others  
are staying at the nearby, and much larger, U.S. McMurdo Base. Both 
outposts are located on Ross Island, which sits at the bottom of 
the Antarctic's gigantic Ross Ice Shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a crash course Sunday on the Antarctic in  
Christchurch, New Zealand, and trying on their new polar outfits, 
the officials traveled to the region aboard two Royal New Zealand 
air force C130 Hercules aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scott Base, the VIPs will sleep in small, basic rooms and use  
communal washrooms. The remaining base officials will sleep outside 
in portable huts facing out across the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	During their two-day visit, the ministers will meet at McMurdo  
station and listen to a host of scientists speak about Antarctica's 
climate, ecosystem and human heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also will spend much of their time touring the region  
by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	One stop will take them to a nearby hut that was used by English  
explorer Robert F. Scott, who died in 1912 on his return from an 
unsuccessful attempt to be the first man to reach the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's sleeping bag still lies on his bunk. A stuffed emperor  
penguin is stretched out on his desk. Vintage copies of ``The 
Illustrated London News'' are on the desk, along with books, test 
tubes and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the carefully preserved building, the freeze-dried  
carcass of a sled dog is still chained to the back door, left 
behind after an expedition by Scott and his men. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ``must-see'' for the ministers will be Dry Valleys, an  
important environmental laboratory region in the mountains outside 
McMurdo. No rain has fallen there for millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The mummified carcasses of seals that lost their way and waddled  
inland into the valleys can be found on the valley floor. And the 
wind is so strong there that it carves the region's rocks into 
pyramid shapes called ``ventifacts.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the Senate impeachment trial Monday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have argued that this power, the power of  
impeachment and removal, is a positive power granted by the 
Constitution to maintain the integrity of government, a power to 
preserve, protect and strengthen our constitutional system against 
the misconduct of officials that would subvert, undermine or weaken 
the institutions of our government.'' -- Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the Senate, as you consider the motion to dismiss,  
I ask you to pause and to reflect on the consequences of the 
standard advocated by the president's lawyers. Consider the 
consequences for the system of justice of allowing the president's 
dangerous example of lawlessness to stand. Consider the 
consequences for the presidency itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respectfully submit to you the standard advocated by  
President Clinton's lawyers will debase and degrade the institution 
of the presidency.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what our individual judgments may be concerning  
President Clinton, it is clear that he is one of the most 
intellectually gifted and politically skilled men to hold the 
office of president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was raised to this great eminence, the most powerful office  
in the greatest nation in the history of the world, an unparalleled 
opportunity, honor and privilege. And in this position of eminence 
and honor, and in this position of trust, what did he do? He made a 
series of choices that has brought us to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the choice to violate the law. And he made that choice  
repeatedly. He knew what he was doing. He reflected on it. Perhaps 
he struggled with his conscience. But when the time came to decide, 
he deliberately and willfully chose to violate the laws of this 
land. He chose to turn his back on the very law he was sworn to 
uphold. He chose to turn his back on his solemn oath of office. He 
chose to turn his back on his constitutional duty.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have asked of us: Where is the compassion, where is the  
spirit of forgiveness? Now, let me say that I for one believe in 
forgiveness. Without forgiveness, what hope would there be for any 
of us? But forgiveness requires repentance. It requires contrition. 
And so I must ask: Where is the repentance? Where is the 
contrition?'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Such lawless conduct by the president does immeasurably more  
to subvert public respect for the law than does the misconduct of 
any federal judge or any other federal official.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the Constitution that requires you or  
allows you to set a lower standard of integrity for the president 
than the standard you have set for other officials who have been 
convicted and removed by your solemn action.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I submit to you that the  
president's lawyers, honorable as they are, are simply wrong. They 
advocate an arbitrary standard that would insulate the president 
from the proper accountability for his misconduct under our 
Constitution. Our Constitution does not establish a lower standard 
of integrity for the president of the United States.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``So, how does the president handle witnesses in the judicial  
system that are a danger to him? He wanted to make sure that they 
were taken care and cooperative in concealing the truth from the 
courts.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``And so we see a pattern develop. When it comes to a witness,  
whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Betty Currie, the choice is made, 
the president encouraged the witness to lie and the president chose 
to impede the administration of justice rather than assuring that 
the laws be faithfully executed.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no particular rules of civil or criminal procedure  
that you must follow. The Constitution has freed you from that. It 
has wisely placed in your hands alone the ability to make a sound 
judgment in the manner you think best, for the reasons you think 
best, based on your wisdom and experience as to what is best for 
this nation at this moment in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We submit to you that the moment has arrived where the best  
interests of the nation, the wise prescription of the framers, and 
the failure of the managers' proof all point to dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have listened, you have heard -- the case cannot be made.''  
-- Nicole Seligman, President Clinton's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to end it. '' -- Seligman.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``For absent an element of immediate danger to the state, a  
danger of such magnitude that it cannot await resolution by the 
electorate in the normal cycle, the framers intended restraint. 
There is no such danger to the state here.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment was never meant to be just another weapon in the  
arsenal of partisanship. By definition, a partisan split like that 
which accompanied these articles from the House of Representatives 
creates doubt that makes plain the constitutional error of the 
course that we are on.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If reasonable people can disagree, we suggest to you that  
reasonable senators should dismiss. The constitutional standard for 
impeachment is not met here.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the managers have with great ingenuity spun out theories  
of wrongdoing that they have advanced repeatedly, persistently, 
passionately. But mere repetition, no matter how dogged, cannot 
create a reality where there is none.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Any question, any doubt must be resolved in favor of the  
electoral will, for it is the will of the people -- the people who 
have all sovereignty in our law -- that in the end is the foundation 
of our democracy.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Our argument today is a simple one: Ordinary civil and  
criminal wrongs may be addressed through ordinary civil and 
criminal processes. 
</P>
<P>
	``And ordinary political wrongs may be addressed at the ballot  
box or by public opinion. Only the most serious public misconduct, 
aggravated abuses of executive power, are meant to be addressed 
through exercise of the presidential impeachment power.'' -- 
Seligman.

<HEADLINE> Airline Alliance To Start Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Five airlines including American Airlines and  
British Airways announced a global marketing, ticketing and 
frequent flyer alliance that will begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines, British Airways, Hong Kong-based Cathay  
Pacific, Canadian Airlines and Australia's Qantas reported their 
``oneworld'' alliance will offer linked frequent flyer programs, a 
frequent flyer card common to all five airlines, smoother transfers 
for passengers and a range of round-the world fares. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling said oneworld will be  
able to offer ``benefits of scale that we could not contemplate as 
individual airlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finnair, which said it would join after the five announced the  
alliance Sept. 21, will introduce oneworld services later this 
year, the airlines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliances are becoming increasingly common in the international  
aviation industry where it is not feasible for even leading 
airlines to cover the entire globe single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of the alliance gives the airline industry a second  
big global linkup, rivaling the Star alliance which includes United 
Airlines, Germany's Lufthansa, Sweden's SAS, Air Canada, Brazil's 
Varig, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Continental Airlines said it was discussing forming  
a new global marketing alliance with four other airlines, 
Northwest, KLM, Air France and Alitalia.

flights. The routes affected were between Kansai International 
Airport in western Japan and the Chinese cities of Hong Kong and 
Guangzhou as well as between Tokyo's Narita airport and Seoul, 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeda said negotiations between management and union  
representatives were being held intermittently, but no agreement 
had yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new wage system, introduced from Jan. 1 as part of  
company cost-cutting measures, the wages of pilots and flight 
engineers have been cut by 3 percent from previous levels, Takeda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless a compromise is reached, the union has threatened to  
stage another 24-hour strike on Wednesday, Takeda said.

<HEADLINE> Medicare HMO Info Now on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To help consumers comparison shop, Medicare is  
posting new information on the Internet about private health plans 
that enroll elderly and disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of information people get from a trusted  
friend or neighbor. It's also health plans providing information 
about themselves,'' Medicare Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Included are results of a consumer satisfaction survey, mailed  
about a year ago and answered by about 100,000 people who use 
Medicare health plans nationwide. They responded to questions such 
as whether it's easy to communicate with their plan's doctors or 
get referrals to specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have left Medicare plans because of dissatisfaction  
or for other reasons were not questioned, however. DeParle said 
additional surveys will collect responses from those people 
starting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans themselves provided additional, independently-audited  
data, including what percentage of people received certain 
preventative screenings or treatments for which they were eligible, 
including mammograms for breast cancer detection and beta blocker 
drugs for heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Medicare has published only a rundown of health plan  
benefits and out-of-pocket fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Online, consumers can enter their zip code to get a comparison  
of most plans available in their area. Some newer and very small 
health plans are not yet included, but will be added in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	People who don't have access to the Internet may be able to get  
printouts of the information from local agencies on aging, senior 
citizen groups or state insurance counseling services. Next fall, 
Medicare will mail it, in new booklets, to all beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 percent of Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries so far  
have chosen to enroll in private health plans, known as health 
maintenance organizations or HMOs. In many parts of the country 
there are several to pick from, while in other places none operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans get a fixed fee from the government to provide all the  
care a patient needs. By contrast, Medicare directly pays 
individual medical bills for other beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reflects on Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton opened the White House Monday night to a discussion 
of what the momentous millennium event meant 1000 years ago and 
what it might mean just 300-some days from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by two scholars in religion and history, the Clintons put  
aside the Y2K bug and champagne toasts to ask more philosophical 
questions about why the date has significance for much of the 
Western world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find some way of organizing our thoughts and our  
plans against the mysteries of time and timelessness,'' said the 
president to an East Room audience that included some of the 
nation's foremost theologians and scholars of medieval history. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Natalie Zemon Davis, a specialist in the culture of  
early modern Europe, captured the mood of the first millennium, 
which she said spread over several decades before and after the 
actual event. While the period around 1000 A.D. prompted many 
doomsayers to predict the apocalypse, it also inspired some 
movements toward peace and social change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our dreammaking capacity, our capacity to imagine, can give  
birth to the good as well as the bad,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton noted that in the stories of people at the dawn of  
this millennium ``we hear our own fears and hopes that what we do 
will matter today and tomorrow,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaping centuries ahead, Professor Martin E. Marty, one of the  
leading interpreters of American religion, discussed how the fast 
approaching 2000 will affect humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be seeking meaning with new intensity at this time,''  
said Marty, who directs the Public Religion Project at the 
University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty said some people will still have apocalyptic visions, both  
religious and secular, with people fearing complete chaos caused by 
such phenomena as the millennium bug. Others will see the 
millennium as a time for progressive change, engaging in 
``realistic hope'' for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling himself ``a walking apostle of hope,'' Clinton said the  
lessons of the last millennium are evidence that ``ordinary people, 
even a long time ago, can make a difference toward a good end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event was part of the White House's Millennium Evenings.

<HEADLINE> Canadian's Execution To Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear  
the case of a Canadian on death row, the same day a delegation from 
his native Canada urged their country not to interfere with the 
Texas judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Joseph Stanley Faulder, convicted of killing a  
75-year-old east Texas woman in 1975, have argued that Texas 
authorities violated international law allowing suspects to have 
access to diplomats from their home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas officials say that, though they knew Faulder once served  
prison time in Canada, he did not tell them he was a citizen there. 
It took 15 years for his family, who thought he was long dead, and 
the Canadian government to find him in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Faulder still has another appeal pending, the non-action  
by the Supreme Court clears the way for his trial judge to set a 
new execution date. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder, 61, of Jasper, Alberta, received a stay from the  
Supreme Court on Dec. 10, minutes before his scheduled execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very disappointing ruling. Amnesty International  
believes the case raises significant legal issues which merits 
review by the Supreme Court,'' said Mark Warren, who follows U.S. 
cases in Amnesty International's office in Ottawa, Canada's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to attorneys who represent Faulder were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, a Canadian delegation led by parliament member Art  
Hanger wrapped up a five-day Texas visit by telling reporters that 
their country should stop interfering in Faulder's case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he has, indeed, received due process,'' said Hanger, a  
Calgary member of the conservative Reform Party. ``Now the time has 
come ... that he just be executed.''

<HEADLINE> Carmen Electra Discusses New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- For Carmen Electra, the question is  
whether being known as a sexpot is a good or a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	First it happened on MTV's ``Singled Out,'' then on ``Baywatch''  
and now on WB's new ``Hyperion Bay,'' on which Electra plays the 
vice president of her father's computer company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's a curse or a compliment,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	This time viewers will see less skin -- at least initially.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wear business suits and my hair in styles I don't  
necessarily like,'' she says in Monday's USA Today. ``I wouldn't 
wear my hair like that -- in a bun, completely pulled back -- but 
it's right for the character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Playboy model also is wrestling with controversy over  
her recent wedding to Dennis Rodman. Rodman's manager initially 
said the Chicago Bull was drunk during the wedding and would seek 
an annulment, but the couple is still married. They live in 
separate homes, but Electra says they're still in love. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis makes sure you have a good time,'' she said. ``He has a  
good heart.''

<HEADLINE> High Court Defeats Pension Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, in a ruling that could  
affect the 33 million American workers and retirees who participate 
in defined-benefit pension plans, today killed a lawsuit by five 
retired employees over what they say was a $1.2 billion surplus in 
their employer's contributory pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that Hughes Aircraft Co. did not  
violate a federal pension-protecting law when it chose to stop 
contributing to the pension fund because of the large surplus 
already built up. 
</P>
<P>
	The key issue underlying the case was whether pension plan  
participants -- and not the employers who operate and partially fund 
them -- are entitled to control such surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  
(ERISA) requires that some surpluses be distributed to covered 
employees when a pension plan is terminated. The five Hughes 
retirees had argued that by stopping its contributions in 1991, 
Hughes had effectively terminated one plan and begun another. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Arizona rejected that argument but the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the retirees' 1992 lawsuit 
and ruled that a trial should be held to determine whether the 
company, now part of General Motors Corp., violated ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the nation's highest court today, Justice Clarence  
Thomas said the 9th Circuit court was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the retirees' claims ``proceed on the erroneous  
assumption that they had an interest in the plan's surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas noted that the 1991 amendment Hughes made to the pension  
plan ``did not affect the rights of pre-existing plan participants 
and Hughes did not use the surplus for its own benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like tens of thousands of employers, Hughes sponsored a pension  
plan that guaranteed its participants of a fixed level of benefits 
at retirement regardless of the plan's investment successes or 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Hughes switched to a two-tier pension system. New  
participants no longer make contributions and are entitled to 
lesser benefits on retirement. Hughes employees who retired before 
1991 continue to receive the higher level of benefits, and 
employees who were with the company before 1991 and still have not 
retired could choose between the contributory and noncontributory 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 lawsuit had accused the company of shortchanging  
retirees who had contributed to their pensions by using the pension 
surplus for the benefit of new employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Hughes Aircraft Co. vs. Jacobson, 97-1287.

	GOP Rejects Dems Trial Offer  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans have ``summarily rejected''  
a Democratic proposal that called for a final vote Friday on 
impeachment charges against President Clinton. The Democratic plan 
would not have allowed for witnesses, which the GOP has pushed hard 
for. The Senate later today will discuss options in the trial: Call 
witnesses, or call it off. The first order of business when the 
Senate reconvenes at 1 p.m. EST is a motion to dismiss the charges, 
which will be introduced by influential Democratic Sen. Robert 
Byrd. Then senators will debate whether to call witnesses, a move 
that could extend the trial as much as several months.

	US Jets Attack Iraqi Defense Sites  
</P>
<P>
	BAHGDAD, Iraq (AP) -- American warplanes attacked air defense  
installations in northern and southern Iraq today in a series of 
incidents that Iraqi officials said included missile strikes on 
residential areas that killed several civilians. A Pentagon 
spokesman said officials had no initial indication that the U.S. 
planes hit anything other than their intended military targets. 
Defense officials said U.S. Air Force and Navy jets fired at an 
Iraqi surface-to-air missile site ``in response to Iraqi incursions 
in the no-fly zone,'' it said. A Central Command spokesman said the 
U.S. jets were threatened by Iraqi ground artillery and four Iraqi 
MiG fighters.

	Court: Census Can't Use Estimates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today ruled that the 2000  
census cannot be adjusted to make up for an expected undercount of 
minorities. The federal census law bars use of statistical methods 
intended to make the national population count more nearly 
accurate, the justices said in a ruling that could have a major 
effect on money and votes nationwide. Adjusting the census likely 
would have helped Democrats because minorities and inner-city 
residents, who tend to vote Democratic, made up a large share of 
the estimated 4 million people missed by the 1990 count.

	Court: FCC Can Set Phone Price Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reinstated federal  
rules aimed at quickly opening the $110 billion local telephone 
market to competition. The court said a 1996 law lets the Federal 
Communications Commission set pricing rules for long-distance 
companies and others that want to start offering local phone 
service. The ruling is a big victory for the government's goal of 
speedily letting customers nationwide choose their local phone 
company much as they now can choose a long-distance company.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Clinton Disrespected Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Former President George Bush worries about  
Bill Clinton's apparent ``lack of respect'' for the presidency, but 
is optimistic any embarrassment to the country will be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried to stay out of all the Washington mess,'' Bush  
said at the end of a keynote address to the Safari Club 
International's 27th annual hunters' convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I must confess I have been deeply concerned by what  
appears to be a lack of respect for the office I was so very proud 
to hold,'' he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidency -- just let me tell you this, because you  
probably worry about all this just as I do. Just as my sons and my 
daughter do. And as Barbara does,'' Bush told the crowd of big-game 
hunters and conservationists at the Reno Hilton Hotel-Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is strong and it is resilient. And the presidency,  
the office of the presidency, is strong and it is resilient,'' he 
said. ``The trials of the present will soon pass away and once 
again our country will be respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made no direct reference to impeachment.  
</P>
<P>
	But retired Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf, a lifetime member of the  
club, drew a raucous standing ovation by introducing Bush as ``a 
man of unimpeachable integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``And a man of great moral courage, my commander in chief,  
George Bush,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two worked the crowd earlier in the day at one of the  
largest trophy hunting conventions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of President Clinton flowed just as freely as the  
praise and admiration for Bush and his sons, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 
and George W. Bush, the Republican governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartzkopf and the elder Bush were met by strong support for a  
presidential bid in 2000 by the newly re-elected Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes from good stock,'' said Robert Charlton, a knifemaker  
from Tyner, N.C., selling his goods at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd certainly like to see him run if he's anything like his  
dad,'' said Bradford Williams, a sculptor from Belfry, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton is a pretty trashy individual,'' said Kenny  
Jarrett, who owns a rifle company and a farm and hunting plantation 
in Jackson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he'd 'fessed up about it all, it probably would have gone  
away. But he perjured himself. If I'd done that, I'd be sitting in 
the jailhouse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who talked briefly with the ex-president Saturday, said  
Bush ``and Barbara are such a decent all-American couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his boys are going to be players on the national scene  
in the near future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Have No Bananas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union failed  
Monday to agree on a compromise aimed at defusing a dispute over 
bananas before it escalates into a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have a deal,'' said EU Ambassador Roderick Abbott as  
he emerged from a 1 1/2-hour afternoon negotiating session with his 
U.S. counterpart, Rita Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	The two ambassadors then rejoined a meeting of the 133-member  
World Trade Organization that was to take up the U.S. request for 
approval of $520 million in sanctions on EU imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But two Caribbean nations that side with the EU, Dominica and  
St. Lucia, used a procedural maneuver to reject the agenda, thus 
postponing a vote on the sanctions. The meeting will reconvene 
Tuesday morning in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
said the EU was behind the delaying maneuver to reject the WTO 
agenda. She said the United States would continue to push its case 
for sanctions on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely dismayed that the EU would jeopardize the  
operation of the WTO in this way,'' Barshesfsky said in a 
statement. ``Fortunately, we will have another opportunity tomorrow 
to see if the EU will reconsider this drastic step and permit the 
WTO meeting to proceed. I certainly hope it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Latin American countries claim the EU's  
trade policy on bananas violates global trading rules because it 
favors producers in former European colonies. The EU rejects the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott and Hayes were discussing a compromise offered by World  
Trade Organization Director-General Renato Ruggiero, which called 
for a panel looking at the new EU banana import system to also 
consider whether the proposed U.S. sanctions are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	George Williams, trade ambassador for Dominica, said the  
blocking of the agenda represented small countries standing up 
against big ones. It was the only way to stop sanctions being 
approved before it was proved the EU was in the wrong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, spokesman for EU trade commissioner Sir Leon  
Brittan, told reporters in Brussels, ``We have absolutely no desire 
for a clash with the United States or an escalation of this 
dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out the possibility that the EU would retaliate by  
imposing its own sanctions, saying Europe would seek a solution 
through the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it is ready to sit down with the EU  
at any time to discuss the matter, but the EU says it will not 
negotiate while the threat of sanctions hangs over its head.

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower  
Monday, rattled by renewed fears that China might devalue its 
currency following a Chinese newspaper report that suggested such a 
devaluation would not be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, jitters over the newspaper report sent the key  
Straits Times Index plunging 80.73 points, or 5.5 percent, to close 
at 1,398.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Asian sell-off was triggered by a report in the  
Sunday Business Weekly edition of Beijing's official China Daily 
that quoted analysts as saying that Brazil's currency troubles 
won't hurt China's economy much. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the Brazilian action to float the currency indicated  
that a devaluation of the Chinese yuan would not ``definitely be a 
bad thing and may not trigger the fresh round of currency 
devaluation that has been feared by most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, a spokesman for the People's Bank of China said  
Monday that the newspaper report did not represent the view of the 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the report China seemed to be quite determined to  
maintain the stability (of the yuan). But now people are 
speculating that the central government may be going to change its 
policy,'' said Dickson Au, a trader at Sassoon Securities Ltd. in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong share prices also tumbled. The Hang Seng Index fell  
239.02 points, or 2.5 percent, closing at 9,499.50. On Friday, the 
index had slumped 310.05 point. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares closed lower, pushed down by renewed regional  
currency jitters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
fell 110.90 points, or 5.4 percent, to 1951.44, extending its 
losses to a third day in a row to wipe out its gains so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where shares  
rose slightly on optimism over recent steps to mend ailing banks 
and on growing expectation government measures to boost economic 
growth will soon begin to work. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cendant Corp. Sues Ernst &AMP; Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Cendant Corp. filed a lawsuit Monday against  
accounting giant Ernst &AMP; Young, accusing it of negligently failing 
to detect bogus revenues that decimated the franchiser's stock and 
prompted a massive investor lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant is seeking unspecified damages from Ernst &AMP; Young for  
the money it lost in the accounting scandal at former CUC 
International Inc., one of the companies that merged to create 
Cendant in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parsippany-based franchiser of brand names like Ramada, Avis  
and Century 21 has lost $20 billion of its market value since 
revealing the ``accounting irregularities'' last April. Ten 
directors associated with CUC have resigned and investors have 
filed one of the largest class-action lawsuits in history in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant said it would also seek to have Ernst &AMP; Young pay any  
damages it may have to pay in the investors' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst &AMP; Young said it would countersue Cendant. Spokesman Don  
Howarth said the firm is ``outraged that Cendant would seek to 
blame Ernst &AMP; Young for Cendant's own fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As the victim of Cendant's fraud, we intend to vindicate our  
good name,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report of Cendant's own audit committee, issued last summer,  
detailed how CUC officials tried to hide the fraud from Ernst &AMP; 
Young auditors, Howarth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst &AMP; Young had represented CUC, the Stamford, Conn.-based  
company that sold memberships to clubs like Shoppers Advantage, 
AutoVantage and PrivacyGuard, since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	It audited financial statements the company issued between 1995  
and 1997, statements Cendant was forced to reissue after learning 
that CUC had invented much of its revenues during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors should have been able to see the fraud by merely  
reconciling the firm's cash reserves with sales and revenue 
figures, said the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm should also have known that HFS Inc., the  
Parsippany-based company that merged with CUC, was heavily relying 
on the statements because of its merger discussions, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials don't believe Ernst &AMP; Young accountants knew  
of the fraud, sources familiar with the situation told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But four people chiefly responsible for reporting financial  
results at CUC are former Ernst &AMP; Young employees, the sources 
said. They include chief financial officer Cosmo Corigliano, who 
was fired after the revelations of widespread fraud; former CUC 
controller Anne Pember, Kevin Kearney and Mary Sattler. 
</P>
<P>
	Corigliano and Pember, who Cendant has said gave orders to  
employees to falsify numbers, worked in the accounting firm's 
Stamford, Conn., offices, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth called it ``absurd to allege that Ernst &AMP; Young did  
something wrong just because several Cendant financial people 
worked at Ernst &AMP; Young 10 to 15 years ago.''

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower  
Monday, rattled by renewed fears that China might devalue its 
currency following a Chinese newspaper report that suggested such a 
devaluation would not be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, jitters over the newspaper report sent the key  
Straits Times Index plunging 80.73 points, or 5.5 percent, to close 
at 1,398.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Asian sell-off was triggered by a report in the  
Sunday Business Weekly edition of Beijing's official China Daily 
that quoted analysts as saying that Brazil's currency troubles 
won't hurt China's economy much. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the Brazilian action to float the currency indicated  
that a devaluation of the Chinese yuan would not ``definitely be a 
bad thing and may not trigger the fresh round of currency 
devaluation that has been feared by most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, a spokesman for the People's Bank of China said  
Monday that the newspaper report did not represent the view of the 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the report China seemed to be quite determined to  
maintain the stability (of the yuan). But now people are 
speculating that the central government may be going to change its 
policy,'' said Dickson Au, a trader at Sassoon Securities Ltd. in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong share prices also tumbled. The Hang Seng Index fell  
239.02 points, or 2.5 percent, closing at 9,499.50. On Friday, the 
index had slumped 310.05 point. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares closed lower, pushed down by renewed regional  
currency jitters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
fell 110.90 points, or 5.4 percent, to 1951.44, extending its 
losses to a third day in a row to wipe out its gains so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where shares  
rose slightly on optimism over recent steps to mend ailing banks 
and on growing expectation government measures to boost economic 
growth will soon begin to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 54.41 points,  
or 0.38 percent, to close at 14,208.81. On Friday, the average

<HEADLINE> ADM's Dwayne Andreas Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Dwayne Andreas, the well-connected longtime  
chairman of the Archer Daniels Midland Co., has stepped down from 
the position, company officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, 80, headed the agribusiness giant's board for 28 years  
and is credited with building the corporation into a major player 
in the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the board's request, he will serve as chairman emeritus and  
will remain a member of the board, which will now be chaired by 
Allen Andreas, his nephew and the company's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwayne Andreas' son, Michael -- on leave as an executive vice  
president -- was thought to be a potential heir to the chairmanship 
before he and two former employees were convicted last fall on 
federal price-fixing charges. They have yet to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwayne Andreas joined ADM in 1966 and was elected chairman and  
CEO in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now employs 23,000 worldwide and owns 274 processing  
plants. Net sales in 1998 were more than $16 billion, company 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> McCartney Takes Issue With Lyrics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Paul McCartney is looking for some parental  
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Beatle took out newspaper ads Monday ridiculing a  
``parental guidance'' warning that was slapped on his late wife 
Linda's new album because there is an obscenity in one song. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tongue-in-cheek ads headlined, ``Parents! We need your  
guidance,'' McCartney calls on parents to listen to the song, ``The 
Light Comes from Within,'' and decide ``whether your children will 
be morally corrupted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song on Linda McCartney's posthumously released album,  
``Wide Prairie'' has been banned from television and radio in 
Britain, a move Paul McCartney calls the ``nannying and playsafe 
attitude that is infecting the record business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song was recorded last March, a month before Linda McCartney  
died of breast cancer at age 56.

<HEADLINE> Met Revives 'Simon Boccanegra' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Simon Boccanegra'' is that rare Verdi opera  
where the baritone gets the big death scene while the soprano and 
tenor survive and get each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily, the Metropolitan Opera had a fine new baritone on hand  
for the title role Monday night when it revived the opera, one of 
Verdi's most musically rewarding but dramatically muddled works. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandru Agache, a Romanian who has sung to great acclaim for  
the past decade in Europe, made an overdue house debut as the 
doleful doge of Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Agache has an imposing voice that filled the Met with a warm,  
well-focused sound, only occasionally sounding as if pressed to his 
limit. He brought the requisite eloquence to his famous plea for 
peace to the raging factions in the Council scene (``Plebe! 
Patrizi!). 
</P>
<P>
	His encounter with his long-lost child, Amelia -- one of Verdi's  
most tender father-daughter duets -- was less effective, with a 
slightly strained final high note on the word ``Figlia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem in that scene was some unsteadiness on the  
part of soprano Karita Mattila, who nearly tripped during her 
entrance down a flight of stairs and took awhile to recover. In 
later scenes, however, she sounded radiant. 
</P>
<P>
	The tenor, who definitely gets third billing in this opera, was  
Placido Domingo, the only holdover from four years ago when this 
handsome production by Giancarlo del Monaco was new. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo remains at age 57 a marvel, still able to caress a  
phrase or soar heroically over an ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major roles in the opera are for Boccanegra's  
dark-voiced enemies. Robert Scandiuzzi made effective use of his 
cavernous bass as the patrician Fiesco; baritone Haijing Fu as the 
plebian Paolo frequently sounded out of his depth. 
</P>
<P>
	James Levine conducted a chorus and orchestra that sounded  
surprisingly out of synch at times, as if perhaps a bit 
underrehearsed.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Jumps 40.1 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world soared in 1998  
to a record high, the government said Monday, reflecting Japanese 
consumers' reluctance to spend amid Japan's worst recession in 
decades, cutting demand for imports and making Japanese 
manufacturers more reliant on sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement prompted immediate reaction from a top U.S.  
trade official who said Washington wants to reverse the recent 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus rose 40.1 percent in 1998 from the  
previous year to 13.9 trillion yen, or $121.8 billion, the Finance 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's surplus with the United States increased as well,  
rising 33.4 percent to $58.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that isn't sustainable,'' Deputy U.S. Trade  
Representative Richard Fisher said. ``We're obviously interested in 
having these numbers reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus for 1998 topped the old largest annual surplus of  
$120.4 billion set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and  
other trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its 
weak economy and spurring demand for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, in Tokyo to meet with Japanese government officials,  
said Japan must also improve access to its markets for foreign 
companies to shrink the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's talks with representative from the Ministry of  
International Trade and Industry and the agricultural ministry were 
expected to focus another sensitive issue: Tokyo's increasing steel 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	For the whole of 1998, U.S.-bound steel exports soared 91.2  
percent to $3.6 billion. On a volume basis, they were up a sharp 
166.6 percent at 6.9 million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	For December, however, steel exports fell for the first time in  
33 months, meaning that Japan may have averted the imposition of 
U.S. anti-dumping penalties. Steel exports to the United States 
fell 20.8 percent and were down 14.9 percent in terms of volume. 
</P>
<P>
	A Finance Ministry official briefing reporters said the pace of  
overall growth in the trade surplus should stabilize, although the 
ministry needs to monitor changes in the level of the surplus in 
the medium term. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are unlikely to grow rapidly due to weak shipments to  
other Asian countries, while imports should begin rising if a 
series of policy measures the government has taken succeed in 
bolstering the domestic economy, the official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, exports fell 0.6 percent to $440.7 billion because of  
sluggish exports of semiconductor-related electronic products and 
office equipment, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports tumbled 10.5 percent to $319.6 billion, mainly due to  
steep declines in global oil and gas prices and partly because of 
poor demand for wood products used to build housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time both exports and imports declined in a calendar  
year was 1993, the official said.

<P>
	Excerpts from the Senate impeachment trial Monday, as  
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree that there might be extreme cases where private  
conduct would so paralyze the president's ability to govern that 
the impeachment power must be exercised, where the certainty of 
guilt and the gravity of the charge would leave no choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``But charges arising out of the president's efforts to keep an  
admittedly wrongful relationship secret are by no analysis of that 
caliber.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is punishment the House managers seek, they are in the  
wrong place, in the wrong job, at the wrong time, and for the wrong 
reasons.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``An indictment against any American drafted like these articles  
could not go near the jury. It would be dismissed and no lesser 
standard should apply here.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury testimony must be read as a whole. What did the  
president convey during that testimony? Certainly not that he was 
standing behind every word in the Jones deposition as the whole 
truth. He spent four hours in the grand jury explaining that 
testimony, adding to it, clarifying it, discussing the confusing 
deposition questions and answers, and pointing out his efforts to 
be literally truthful, if not forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Explaining what he had tried to do, the line he had tried to  
walk, however successfully or unsuccessfully, he laid it all out.'' 
-- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't believe this body should remove the president, or  
if you believe that no amount of requestioning witnesses or 
torturing facts will change enough minds to garner the two-thirds 
majority necessary to remove the president, or if you simply have 
heard enough to make up your mind, then the time to end this is 
now.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has expressed many times how very sorry he is  
for what he did and for what he said. He knows full well that his 
failings have landed us in this place. And he is doing all he can 
to set right what he has done wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``But an entire nation, indeed the world, is now looking to this  
body, to this chamber, to this floor, for sound judgment, and we 
are asking you not to answer a serious personal wrong with a 
grievous constitutional wrong.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask you to end this case now so that a sense of  
proportionality can be put back into a process that seems long ago 
to have lost all sense of proportionality. We also ask you to end 
the case now so those family members and others who did no wrong 
can be spared further public embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we also ask you to end this case now so that the poisonous  
arrows of partisanship can be buried and the will of the people can 
be done, allowing of you to spend your full days on the most 
pressing issues of the country.'' -- Seligman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My name has been brought up a couple of times about whether or  
not reasonable people can disagree with me and still be reasonable 
about what we should do in this case. I have told you the best I 
can there's no doubt these are high crimes in my opinion. And this 
is a hard decision for our country, but when I first spoke to you, 
I thought we'd be better off if Bill Clinton left office. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I want the chance to prove to you why. Give me a chance to  
prove to you why I believe that; why my colleagues voted our 
conscience to get this case to where it should be, not swept under 
a rug, but in a trial to disposition. I have lost no sleep worrying 
about the fact that Bill Clinton may have to be removed from office 
because of his conduct. I have lost tons of sleep thinking he may 
get away with what he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the question was: Could you disagree with Lindsey Graham  
and be a good American in essence? Absolutely.'' -- Rep. Lindsey 
Graham, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if you will listen to our  
case, if you let us explain why we have lost no sleep asking for 
this president to be removed and why we voted to get it here, and 
you disagree with me at the end of the day, I will never, ever say 
you don't love your country as much as I do. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what that statement was meant to convey, and it will  
convey that until I am dead and gone.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Electing somebody should not distance them from common decency  
and the rule of law to the point that when it's all over with, you 
don't know what you've got left in this country. Is that what you 
want to do in this case -- just to save this man; to ignore the 
facts; to have a different legal standard; to make excuses that are 
bleeding this country dry? The effect of this case is hurting us 
more than we will ever, ever know. Don't dismiss this case. Find 
out who our president is. Come to the conclusion not that it was 
just bad behavior. It was illegal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Tell us what's right. Tell us what's wrong. Give us some  
guidance. Under our Constitution, you don't impeach people at the 
ballot box. You trust the United States Senate. And I am willing to 
do that. Rise to the occasion for the good of the nation.'' -- 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is -- this motion to dismiss3/8 -- is a legal way of  
saying ``so what'' to the charges that we've levied here.'' -- Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope some Democrats would support a rejection of this  
motion, difficult as it is, because I don't think this whole sad, 
sad drama will end, we will never get it behind us until you vote 
up or down on the articles, and when you do, however you vote, 
we'll all collect our papers, bow from the waist, thank you for 
your courtesy, and leave, and go gently into the night.'' -- Hyde.

<HEADLINE> GOP Considers Impeachment Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Senate Republicans joined Democrats on  
Monday in calling for an exit strategy for President Clinton's 
perjury and obstruction trial, but the GOP remained deeply divided 
over how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal gaining attention among Republicans would allow the  
senators to find Clinton guilty of the charges but would not remove 
him from office. Democrats questioned whether the idea was 
constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	As the third week of trial commenced with polls showing a public  
that wants the proceedings ending with Clinton still in office, 
several GOP senators stuck staunchly to their belief that the 
president should be removed. They insisted that witnesses be called 
to substantiate charges of perjury and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are weary of this thing,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,  
R-Okla, who wants to see witnesses called to address discrepancies 
in testimony. ``All of us would like to see it terminate before too 
long but we want to do it correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, such as Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama, raised concerns about 
calling witnesses. At a closed GOP caucus meeting, Republicans 
discussed ways to bring the proceedings to an end as early as this 
week, according to two GOP officials who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott confirmed that  
Republican leaders were seriously considering a plan by Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine, to allow the Senate to find Clinton guilty 
without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would prevent Clinton from emerging from the trial  
unscathed if the 67 votes needed for his conviction don't 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that is not meeting a great deal of opposition in  
the Republican caucus,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the proposal violates the Constitution, which  
gives the Senate a choice of either acquitting or convicting and 
removing a president it finds guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no historical precedent that ``the Senate could  
convict...without removal,'' said Daschle spokeswoman Ranit 
Schmelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats had problems with pronouncing Clinton guilty of  
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to adopt support for conclusions we don't agree  
with,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Czwartacki said the proposals would not violate the  
constitution because the Senate would act on the Collins motion 
before voting on the articles of impeachment, not as part of the 
trial but as a non-binding resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials cited the proposal as one of several they were  
seeking to bridge deep gaps within their own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters that the long strategy meetings were an  
effort to ``save time,'' but that eventually, the proceedings 
should end with an up-or-down vote on the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process calls for us to go through what the Constitution  
and the rules provide, and that is to go to conclusion with a final 
debate and votes on the articles of impeachment,'' he said. ``I 
don't think anybody's come up with an idea, or justification, for 
anything short of that.''

<HEADLINE> $4B Sought To Combat Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Kyoto climate treaty remains in  
limbo, the Clinton administration in its upcoming budget will 
propose $4 billion in spending and tax breaks, a third more than 
this year, to help address the threat of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said Monday the initiative represents  
``significant new investments ... to accelerate our aggressive, 
common-sense efforts to meet the challenge of global warming'' 
while providing other environmental benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The package of climate-related proposals includes for the first  
time a $200 million ``clean air partnership fund'' that will funnel 
grants to state and local governments to reduce greenhouse gases, 
mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, according to an 
outline of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior White House official said the money, which in many  
cases will be tied to promises of state matching funds, can be used 
for a wide variety of programs from retrofitting buildings to 
purchasing more fuel-efficient or cleaner burning vehicles. Some of 
the funds would be used to promote public-private partnerships to 
reduce greenhouse gases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative will be part of the fiscal 2000 budget President  
Clinton will send to Congress next month. Clinton alluded to the 
clean air fund in his State of the Union address last week, but 
provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The climate package, which includes sharp increases in spending  
to promote energy efficiency, is likely to meet strong opposition 
from congressional Republicans who have accused the administration 
of trying to implement the Kyoto climate agreement before it is 
even considered by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials deny any such intent.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the programs are fully justified on the basis of being  
good energy policy and good economic policy, said a senior White 
House official who has been closely involved in global warming 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said in a statement that while the administration would  
``continue to work on the diplomatic front to achieve a truly 
global response'' to the threat of global warming, ``we are firmly 
committed to stepping up our efforts at home as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it has no plans to send the Kyoto  
protocol, which calls for the United States to roll back greenhouse 
gases by 2008-2012, to Congress any time soon. Opponents of the 
agreement doubt whether global warming is real and say compliance 
with the treaty would cost the U.S. economy too much. They say they 
are confident they have the votes to kill the treaty should it be 
submitted for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the administration argues that actions should  
be taken to promote ``common sense'' initiatives to reduce the flow 
of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, into the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why President Clinton and I are proposing a record $4  
billion for expanded research and other programs to better 
understand and protect our climate and for tax incentives for 
consumers and businesses to purchase energy-efficient cars, homes 
and appliances,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the clean air fund, the administration package  
includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.4 billion in spending for research and development into more  
energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy programs such as 
solar and wind power, a 34 percent increase over such spending this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--$105 million, more than double the current levels, for research  
into how agriculture and forests can offset greenhouse gas 
emissions by absorbing carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax credits for purchase of ultra-energy-efficient homes or  
energy-efficient equipment, or for the purchase of electric, hybrid 
or fuel cell vehicles expected to begin hitting showrooms over the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	--$122 million to spur technology for cleaner burning, coal-fired  
power plants.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Announces 2-1 Stock Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. announced a 2-for-1 stock  
split Monday, prompting a sharp rise in the share price. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock rose $5.62 1/2 a share to close at $161.87 1/2 in  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The split would take effect March 12 if shareholders approve an  
increase in the company's authorized common stock. Microsoft, the 
world's largest computer software company, had 2.5 billion shares 
outstanding as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The split would be the eighth since Microsoft went public on  
March 13, 1986. The last split, also 2-for-1, was Feb. 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory B. Maffei, chief financial officer, said the split would  
make Microsoft stock more affordable to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	An investor who bought 100 shares of Microsoft when the stock  
went public in 1986 would now have 7,200 shares, or 14,400 after 
the coming stock split. If purchased at the opening day closing 
price of $28 a share, or $2,800, the stock would be worth nearly 
$1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Company founder Bill Gates, who had 515.8 million shares of  
Microsoft stock as of September, has seen the value of his holdings 
rise to more than $82 billion. Gates also has substantial 
investments outside of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Microsoft reported second-quarter profits well above  
analysts' estimates, racking up a 72 percent increase in net 
earnings as strong growth in personal computer shipments boosted 
demand for its software.

<HEADLINE>  Bodies of 5 Kosovo Albanians Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAKOVINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bullet-riddled bodies of five  
more ethnic Albanians -- two of them children -- were found Monday, 
fueling tensions at a time when diplomats admit being stymied about 
how to end the crisis in Kosovo peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, two boys and one woman appeared to have been shot  
at close range on a tractor-trailer that was returning from a 
cornfield off the main road through Rakovina, a village 35 miles 
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The grisly discoveries came 10 days after 45 ethnic Albanians  
were allegedly massacred in the Kosovo village of Racak. The Racak 
slaughter was the highest toll since government troops ambushed and 
killed 36 Kosovo Albanians as they tried to illegally cross the 
border Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials have renewed the threat of airstrikes, saying the  
likelihood of allied military action was real unless the Yugoslav 
government halts its crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest evidence of stepped-up preparations, the French  
Navy said the aircraft carrier Foch was leaving Toulon on Monday 
for the Adriatic Sea. It was expected to be in place by early 
Wednesday, the Navy said, and ready to participate in strikes on 
Serb and Yugoslav targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians form about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million  
people, and the vast majority favor independence. More than 2,000 
people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed since Yugoslav 
and Serb forces launched an offensive against Kosovo separatists 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
	International peace monitors told reporters they discovered the  
bodies of the five ethnic Albanians shortly after sunrise while 
conducting a routine patrol near Rakovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies identified by locals as a husband and his wife were  
found slumped in the cab of the tractor. Half the man's head was 
blown away. Empty shell casings littered the ground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	On the trailer, piled with hay and grain, lay the bodies of a  
father and his two sons, about 10 and 12 years old. The faces of 
all three were disfigured beyond recognition. All five were wearing 
civilian clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman of the international monitors, said it  
appeared the victims had been shot with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, quoting  
unidentified local residents, said Serb police fired at the victims 
from an armored vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Serb Media Center claimed the village was  
controlled by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for 
independence from Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb center also reported that separatists ambushed a police  
patrol Monday 15 miles west of Pristina. Police returned fire and 
wounded one attacker, who was taken to a hospital in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Finnish forensic team investigating the  
Jan. 15 slayings in Racak said the team would not release its 
findings until it completes its report in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Helena Ranta said it was too early to tell when the team would  
finish its work in Pristina, where it is examining 40 of the 45 
bodies found in a gully in the southern Kosovo village. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, admitted  
Monday that diplomats are running out of ideas for peace after both 
Serb and ethnic Albanian politicians rejected a series of American 
proposals for the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are heading to a situation where we have to come up  
with some very good ideas, strong ideas and to see some rapid 
implementation,'' Hill told reporters after meeting the leading 
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova. ``We cannot allow this 
process to go on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, foreign ministers from the European Union  
focused on Kosovo at their regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the breaches in the cease-fire and we want to  
avoid the potential of future atrocities,'' British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to achieve first is that people on the ground  
abandon violence,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of 
Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Brussels, ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations met  
Monday to work on a two-pronged plan that prepared for airstrikes 
while seeking a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	A foreign ministers' meeting of the Contact Group -- Britain,  
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- is expected 
by week's end, possibly in London.

independence from Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb center also reported that separatists ambushed a police  
patrol Monday 15 miles west of Pristina. Police returned fire and 
wounded one attacker, who was taken to a hospital in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Finnish forensic team investigating the  
Jan. 15 slayings in Racak said the team would not release its 
findings until it completes its report in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Helena Ranta said it was too early to tell when the team would  
finish its work in Pristina, where it is examining 40 of the 45 
bodies found in a gully in the southern Kosovo village. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, admitted  
Monday that diplomats are running out of ideas for peace after both 
Serb and ethnic Albanian politicians rejected a series of American 
proposals for the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are heading to a situation where we have to come up  
with some very good ideas, strong ideas and to see some rapid 
implementation,'' Hill told reporters after meeting the leading 
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova. ``We cannot allow this 
process to go on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, foreign ministers from the European Union  
focused on Kosovo at their regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the breaches in the cease-fire and we want to  
avoid the potential of future atrocities,'' British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to achieve first is that people on the ground  
abandon violence,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of 
Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Brussels, ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations met  
Monday to work on a two-pronged plan that prepared for airstrikes 
while seeking a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	A foreign ministers' meeting of the Contact Group -- Britain,  
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- is expected 
by week's end, possibly in London.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grain Futures Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures fell Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market was responding, in large part, to  
reports of big rains in Brazil and Argentina over the weekend. 
Topsoil moisture was reported to be good, particularly in 
Argentina, where dryness has threatened summer crops, including 
soybeans and corn. More rain could mean bigger crops, which would 
drive prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is concern among traders over reports that China will  
be devaluing its currency. News that China plans to export soybeans 
put even more pressure on soybean futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 3/4 cents to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.06 3/4 a bushel; and March soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.17 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .05 cent to 63.20 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 74.52 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose .77 cent to 44.42 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell the limit 3 cents to 55.75 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A 19-year-old man who for nearly a year  
maintained his innocence in the ax murders of a minister and his 
wife has pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Brightman will spend 65 years in prison for killing the  
Rev. C. Frederick Mathias and his wife, Cleta, in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Brightman had claimed he was helping a friend burglarize the  
Mathias home when they returned. He told police he handed an ax to 
Sean Rich, who used it to kill the pair. Rich was 15 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark Inman said Brightman had a change of heart  
over the weekend as he faced trial. Brightman will be sentenced in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias was found face down in the family room near the  
Christmas tree, hands bound. His wife was found in a pool of blood 
about 10 feet away with her hands bound, and their pet cat had been 
kicked to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had found little to link Rich to the slayings because of  
a fire apparently set to cover the killers' tracks. But members of 
the Northminster Presbyterian Church said Rich had been involved in 
the theft of money from the church and had been confronted by 
Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of burglary, confinement, arson, battery, theft and  
cruelty to an animal against Brightman were dropped on the 
condition that he testify against Rich when his murder trial starts 
Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Dad Suspected in Sons' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A father suspected of butchering his two young  
sons and stashing their bodies in a basement is being held on $10 
million bail -- double the amount sought by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Short, 49, has been held since Friday on charges of  
endangering the boys' welfare by not taking them to school -- a 
charge brought before the bodies were found. Police spokesman Sgt. 
Cory Cuneo confirmed that he is a suspect in their killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard, 7, and John, 3, were reported missing Jan. 13 by their  
mother, Jolanta Short, 38, after Short took the children from their 
Queens apartment. He told her they were safe and staying with 
relatives, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested two days later for allegedly endangering the  
boys' welfare, but was freed on $10,000 bail. He was arrested again 
Friday for failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' bodies were found Saturday in the basement of a  
Manhattan apartment building Short manages, stashed among 
maintenance equipment, said Chief of Detectives William Allee. 
Short also manages four other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old died after being hit so hard on the head that he  
suffered skull fractures and brain injuries, according to a 
spokeswoman for the city's medical examiner. The older boy died 
from multiple sharp-weapon chop wounds on the head and neck, 
possibly from an ax or a crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a horror when you see children like that,'' said  
Allee. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors of the Shorts recalled the boys as playful and polite.  
</P>
<P>
	``The father seemed devoted to the kids, and the kids seemed  
really well-adjusted,'' said Adrian Van Caneghem, a former 
Greenwich Village neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former neighbor, Jose Acosta, said he couldn't believe  
the boys had been savagely killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brothers were so happy all the time, jumping and  
smiling,'' Acosta said. ``They seemed like such a happy family.''

</P>
<P>
	``The reality of being in a trial finally sank in,'' Inman said.  
``Now he has a chance to get out of prison before he dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims and members of their Northminster  
Presbyterian Church had not expected the guilty plea, church 
spokesman Mark Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were as surprised as anyone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mathias was found face down in the family room near the  
Christmas tree, hands bound, the ax handle sticking out of his 
head. His wife was found in a pool of blood about 10 feet away with 
her hands bound, and their pet cat had been kicked to death.

<P>
	Police had found little to link Rich to the slayings because of  
a fire apparently set to cover the killers' tracks. Gray said 
firefighters may have inadvertently washed away evidence while 
putting out the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspected Rich a day after the murders after interviews  
with church members revealed he had been involved in the theft of 
money from the church and had been confronted by Mathias.

cruelty to an animal against Brightman were dropped in the plea 
agreement on the condition that he testify against Rich when his

<HEADLINE> Serial Murder Video Played in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The videotaped words of the defendant  
in a mass torture-slaying case were played back to jurors as one of 
California's most expensive homicide cases entered its final 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
	State attorney Sharlene Honnaka reran videotapes of bound female  
victims for the jury, emphasizing Charles Ng's presence and his 
comments to show he helped his survivalist pal Leonard Lake carry 
out 12 killings in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and stuff like the rest of them,'' Ng tells a tied  
and terrified Brenda O'Connor. ``It won't do you no good. We're 
pretty cold-hearted.'' She disappeared in April 1985 along with her 
1-year-old son, the boy's father and a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began in October, the defense has been trying to  
blame the murders on Lake, who left behind rambling writings on his 
plans to keep sex slaves, capturing females to dominate and 
torture, men to steal their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake committed suicide in 1985 after he was arrested following a  
shoplifting incident; he was driving a car that had belonged to 
victim Paul Cosner. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lake and Ng lured their prey to Lake's cabin at  
Wilseyville in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Ng, arrested in Canada 
in 1985, fought extradition for five years. The tapes were made at 
the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles Ng and Leonard Lake together intended for these 12  
people to die, if they each performed acts to further that goal, 
then they are equally guilty in the eyes of the law,'' Honnaka said 
in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	She displayed a list of each victim: seven men, three women and  
two baby boys. Human remains were found buried at or near the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's defenders were to present their closing arguments Monday or  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the jury entered, Ng had attorney Lewis Clapp read a  
letter demanding that his attorneys be replaced, a move that would 
have further delayed the 16-year case. Ng has at times acted as his 
own attorney, irking prosecutors who maintained that he was 
stalling to avoid a possible death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told Ng his attorneys had been doing their best to try  
to save him from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The final taxpayer bill for the case has been estimated at $14  
million.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Seek To Solve Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union were  
locked in talks today aimed at defusing a dispute over bananas 
before it escalates into a trade war, trade officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were closeted in discussions even as they were  
supposed to be attending a gathering of the 133-member World Trade 
Organization. On the agenda of that meeting was the U.S. request 
for approval of $520 million in sanctions on EU imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was eventually adjourned for five hours with no sign  
of U.S. or EU delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Latin American countries claim the EU's  
trade policy on bananas continues to violate global trading rules 
because it favors producers in former European colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU rejects the claim, saying it has complied with a 1997  
judgment by the WTO dispute panel. A WTO panel has yet to rule on 
the EU's claim of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States has been pressing ahead with its sanctions  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a compromise suggested by WTO Director-General Renato  
Ruggiero, the panel looking at the new EU banana import system will 
also consider whether the proposed U.S. sanctions are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, spokesman for EU trade commissioner Sir Leon  
Brittan, told reporters in Brussels that the compromise was ``a 
fair proposal which we are supporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out the possibility that the EU would retaliate by  
imposing its own sanctions, saying Europe would seek a solution 
through the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have absolutely no desire for a clash with the United  
States or an escalation of this dispute,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said the planned U.S. sanctions would affect people who  
had nothing to do with bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,  
said the compromise would give both parties a bit of breathing 
space to see if they can resolve their underlying differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it is ready to sit down with the EU  
at any time to discuss the matter, but the EU says it will not 
negotiate while the threat of sanctions hangs over its head.

<HEADLINE> Jim Brady To Greet Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Like Pope John Paul II, Jim Brady survived an  
assailant's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope and the one-time presidential press secretary are to  
meet on Tuesday, when Brady joins President Clinton's entourage in 
welcoming the pontiff to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady came to town early to campaign against a state ballot  
measure that would legalize the carrying of concealed guns. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 states allow concealed guns. But on April 6, Missouri  
will become the first state to submit the question to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	While opponents of Proposition B would love to persuade the pope  
to come out against the measure, Brady, who is Roman Catholic, said 
Monday that he won't impose on the pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be bad form to do that,'' said Brady, who was  
President Reagan's press secretary and is a native of nearby 
Centralia, Ill. ``I'm sure he has his agenda, and I'm sure he'll 
stick to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Martin, director of the Human Rights Office of the  
Archdiocese of St. Louis, said of the pope: ``It's likely he will 
say something about the issue of violence and gun violence. But I 
doubt he will say something specific about Proposition B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was put on the ballot by the Legislature to bypass a  
promised veto from Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure say allowing hidden guns will make  
criminals think twice before advancing on a potential victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Police Officers Association, representing about  
1,300 members of the force, is backing the measure. Sgt. John J. 
Johnson, the association's president, said, ``Other states that 
have passed right-to-carry laws have not experienced the carnage 
that opponents predict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brady said: ``More guns, and particularly concealed guns,  
just mean more trouble. Proposition B is so poorly written it would 
literally allow convicted criminals to carry hidden Uzi pistols 
into bars, stadiums and onto school property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within a two-month period in 1981, gunfire from would-be  
assassins nearly killed both Brady and the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, now 58, was shot in the head when John Hinckley tried to  
kill Reagan on March 30, 1981. Brady's wounds left him in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope was seriously wounded on May 13, 1981, when he was shot  
by Mehmet Ali Agca in St. Peter's Square in Rome. The attack left 
the pontiff hospitalized for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady and his wife, Sarah, eventually launched a national  
campaign to reduce gun violence. Their efforts helped lead to the 
federal Brady Law, which required a waiting period and background 
check on handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady was invited by Clinton to meet the pope.  
</P>
<P>
	``From altar boy to meeting the leader of the pack,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Mayor Admits `Excesses' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Acknowledging ``excesses'' in his city's bid for  
the 1998 Winter Olympics, Nagano's mayor admitted Monday that IOC 
officials received free trips to the ancient capital of Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, we were the ones who were asking to be chosen.  
It's rather difficult to turn down the requests from IOC members 
who wanted to tour Kyoto,'' Mayor Tasuku Tsukada said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada denied wrongdoing by Nagano bidders and couldn't recall  
any demands for cash or valuable goods by IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I wasn't in a position to know everything,'' Tsukada said.  
``In some areas, there were excesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano bid officials say they wined and dined the 62 visiting  
International Olympic Committee officials, sometimes with geisha, 
during their 1989-1991 bid. They also said they gave an expensive 
painting and sword to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidders also have said they burned expense records in a city  
incinerator in 1992, less than a year after Nagano was awarded the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Tsukada had said he couldn't remember whether IOC  
officials traveled to Kyoto, a tourist spot some 150 miles from 
Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	A round-trip ticket on the bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto  
costs $230. IOC officials, with the exception of Samaranch, are 
forbidden to accept gifts of more than $150. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials' air and train fares, as well as hotel costs, were  
routinely paid by Nagano and other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC -- which has said that recent bid cities, including  
Nagano, also will be investigated -- recommended Sunday that six IOC 
members be purged from its board in the largest corruption scandal 
in the history of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A special inquiry found eight IOC members had pocketed more than  
$440,000 in cash and excessive gifts and services during Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, a grass-roots Nagano group demanded that the IOC be  
dismantled. Masao Ezawa, leader of the Anti-Olympics People's 
Network, also called for an outside investigation of the IOC's 
finances.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Shares Plunge Amid Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan shares plunged more than 3 percent  
Monday, amid concerns that a possible devaluation of the Chinese 
currency could trigger a fresh bout of turmoil in Asia's financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange shed  
195.74 points, or 3.14 percent, to close at 6,033.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are becoming increasingly concerned that Brazil's  
financial problems are putting heavy pressure on China to devaluate 
its yuan, dealers said. The speculation gained strength after an 
official Chinese newspaper in Beijing suggested over the weekend 
that such a devaluation might not be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan government's stock stabilization fund of $8.7 billion  
offered only token resistance to the selling on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a sharp fall of China's yuan could spark another  
wave of currency devaluations because other Asian countries might 
find it necessary to devalue their own currencies to boost their 
own exports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taiwanese officials said if the Chinese yuan should drop in  
value, the decline would be mild. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Economics Minister Lin Yih-fu said he believed China would  
resist a sharp yuan devaluation -- which could increase the costs of 
imports and hurt exports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lin said uncertainties about the yuan's value have already  
forced many Taiwanese companies to halt investment in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan is one of China's largest foreign investors, with  
investment totaling $30 billion.

<HEADLINE> Eli Lilly Reaches Prozac Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. spent $4 million for some  
peace of mind about Prozac Monday, but the payment that settled 
part of a patent dispute doesn't help consumers hoping to get a 
cheaper version of the antidepressant soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly agreed to a partial settlement with three generic drug  
companies in a lawsuit over two U.S. patents for Prozac, the 
best-selling treatment for depression, bulimia, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder and other maladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the agreement means Lilly should have more time to  
be the sole marketer of Prozac in the United States. Without 
competition from generic drug makers, Lilly can continue to charge 
about $60 a month for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced less than an hour before a federal judge  
was to hear opening arguments in Lilly's three-year legal battle to 
block generic competition for Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead litigant among the generic companies, Barr Laboratories  
Inc. of Pomona, N.Y., said it settled so it can concentrate on a 
federal appeal of the strongest portions of its patent challenge. 
U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker threw out those arguments 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Bisaro, Barr's senior vice president and general counsel,  
said Barr was taking a calculated risk in abandoning a trial. He 
said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 
Washington, which hears all appeals of patent cases, would have to 
hear the case anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all recognized that getting to the appeals court as fast as  
possible was in our best interest,'' Bisaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy could save Barr a year in bringing generic Prozac  
to the U.S. market, Bisaro said. In its best-case scenario, Barr 
could have it on the market by the end of next year, or three years 
before Lilly's last patent on the case would expire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lilly officials contend that is unlikely to happen, and  
analysts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe Judge Barker's ruling will be upheld,''  
Lilly spokesman Ed West said. ``It is theoretically possible but 
unlikely that Barr could win the case outright at the Court of 
Appeals. As a matter of law, it is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said the settlement puts to rest half the patent claims  
Barr and its co-defendant, Geneva Pharmaceuticals Inc., can argue 
on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel even more confident now than we did before regarding  
our position,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Lilly loses in the next round, further appeals could tie  
the case up for years, delaying the introduction of generic 
versions of Prozac that would be discounted 20 percent of more 
below Lilly's price. The drug is expected to bring $2.5 billion in 
U.S. sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big victory for Lilly,'' said independent industry  
analyst Hemant K. Shah. ``Even in the worst case, they still have a 
two- or three- year delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Eli Lilly rose $6 to $84.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Barr fell $2.75 to $40.88 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and Geneva, a Colorado-based unit of the Swiss drug giant  
Novartis AG, had sought approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration to sell generic versions of Prozac, alleging Lilly's 
patents were invalid. Lilly sued Barr for patent infringment in 
February 1996 and Geneva in 1997, and the cases were consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker on Jan. 12 threw out two of the four claims against the  
Prozac patent. Those claims dealt with double-patenting, or whether 
Lilly should be allowed to hold two patents for the same idea, and 
whether Lilly had disclosed the best method to make Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly's patent on fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac,  
expires in February 2001. A second patent on how Prozac works 
expires in December 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly will pay the $4 million to Barr, Geneva and a third  
co-defendant, Toronto-based Apotex Inc., to reimburse their legal 
expenses. Apotex's chairman and CEO, Bernard C. Sherman, is a 
director and former majority owner of Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	Generic competition already has cut into Prozac sales overseas,  
causing a drop of more than 14 percent from a high of $627.4 
million in 1995 to $538.1 million in 1997. Lilly is expected to 
announce year-end figures for 1998 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Saks of Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York, estimated the  
first generic version of Prozac on the U.S. market will be 
discounted 20 percent to 30 percent below Lilly's price. The entry 
of other generic versions will drive prices down further. 
</P>
<P>
	``The candy store is still open, but decidedly, Barr is still  
looking uphill,'' Saks said. ``They'll be there when the patent 
runs out anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the patent issues covered by the out-of-court  
settlement, Barr and Geneva alleged Lilly fraudulently withheld 
data or gave misleading information on its two Prozac patents. The 
other claim they have agreed not to pursue is whether Lilly 
provided enough information on the 2003 patent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly has patent infringement lawsuits pending against three  
other generic drug manufacturers.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. today reported a 58 percent rise in  
fourth-quarter profit, benefiting from cost cuts and strong demand 
for its mobile-phone services. The profit increase, which matched 
Wall Street forecasts, came despite another drop in the 
telecommunications giant's long-distance phone sales, which 
continue to be hit by competition from lower-cost providers of 
service. AT&AMP;T said it earned $2 billion, or $1.12 a share on a 
diluted basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That was up from 
$1.26 billion, or 70 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago

The results for the most recent quarter included one-time gains of 
$172 million for the sale of a New Zealand unit. Shares of 
BellSouth tumbled 11 percent, or $5.06 1/4, to $43 on the New York

phone companies.

<HEADLINE> Workers Paid While Factory Rebuilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANGERFIELD, N.Y. (AP) -- When the Titan Homes factory was closed  
by a fire last week, 200 workers were without jobs -- but, to their 
surprise, they found they still had an employer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire caused $4.5 million in damage to the modular home  
factory outside the city of Utica. On Friday, when workers went to 
get what they expected to be their last checks, they found they 
were still on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said employees will continue to be paid,  
including all benefits, until the factory reopens, probably in late 
May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard of a company doing this,'' said Leroy Pomeroy, a  
plumber with a wife and two sons. ``The relief of all the people 
there was tremendous. These guys were expecting the worst,'' he 
told the Syracuse newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan general manager Jack Ireton-Hewitt said, ``Not only is it  
the right, responsible thing to do, from a corporate point of view, 
it's also good business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He explained that keeping the trained workforce on standby will  
help the factory reopen faster. Titan plans to replace the 
525-by-200 foot factory with a larger building and larger work. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, fire destroyed the family-owned Malden Mills  
Industries complex in Lawrence, Mass. The loss was put at $300 
million, all covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, owner Aaron Feuerstein pledged to keep all his  
employees on the payroll and rebuild in the economically depressed 
city. On Sept. 21, 1997, Malden Mills dedicated a new plant, and 
all but a few dozen of the 1,400 employees returned.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Founder May Stay at AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- America Online Inc. will reportedly  
make Marc Andreessen, the 27-year-old cofounder of Netscape 
Communications Corp., chief technology officer once it completes 
its acquisition of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The move should help prevent a brain-drain at Netscape, where  
before the merger, engineers disdained Dulles, Va.-based AOL as 
technologically unsophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, who was in charge of software development at  
Netscape, will report to AOL Chairman and Chief Executive Steve 
Case, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape spokeswoman Patti Pierson declined comment Monday, as  
did AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's essential for Netscape to have one of their  
favorite leaders near the top at AOL,'' said Stan Dolbert, a group 
director at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's real 
important from a talent retention point of view, and it also sends 
a strong signal that AOL is going to try to understand the 
technology, not just be a technology user.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen helped create the Internet browser that made the  
World Wide Web so popular. He's expected to play a major role in 
keeping talent and bolstering morale at Netscape, which will 
continue working on Internet software as a division of AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape agreed in November to be purchased by AOL for stock  
then valued at $4.2 billion. Andreessen's status hinges on 
completion of the deal, the newspaper's sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have said the deal should be completed early this  
spring. The U.S. Department of Justice is checking the deal 
closely, since it could have an impact on the antitrust trial of 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Though AOL has become a success by selling its simple-to-use  
service to the masses, Netscape was needed for the Internet 
expertise it brings to competition with Microsoft, Yahoo! Inc. and 
Excite Inc., which has agreed to be purchased by At Home Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a certain amount of sense that AOL would not throw  
such an asset out the door,'' said Jim Balderston at Zona Research 
Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. ``The point to remember is that he 
does not have management and operational responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has some value in evangelizing the Internet message  
to the populace,'' Balderston added. ``Is he going to lead AOL in a 
new direction? I don't think so. That's Steve Case's job. 
Andreessen will contribute his two cents and Case will listen or he 
won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen co-founded Netscape in 1994 with James Clark and the  
company made popular an Internet browser developed by Andreessen 
and some classmates from the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen dropped his disdain for AOL after concluding that  
Silicon Valley companies weren't paying enough attention to what 
average consumers want. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa  
Clara, Calif., said Adreessen's position at Netscape was ``largely 
ceremonial. If it's the same kind of thing at AOL, that would be 
consistent with (critical) comments he made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enderle criticized Andreessen's ``people skills'' and said that  
could pose a problem for AOL. However, he said Case is ``relatively 
astute, and I find it hard to believe he would pick somebody for 
the role who lacks some of the fundamental skills to make it a 
success.''

<HEADLINE> Top Pick Gets OK To Join Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the  
NBA draft, was released from his contract with Kinder Bologna of 
the Italian League today, freeing him to join the Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center arrived in Italy three weeks ago, signing  
with Kinder about 24 hours before the NBA and its players came to 
terms on a deal that ended the owners' lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal bound Olowokandi to Kinder until Feb. 15, but a club  
source said the team decided to let him go now to save money and 
because he had failed to make the expected impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi appeared in six games with Kinder, averaging 7.7  
points and 5.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by tendinitis in his right knee, he played just five  
minutes Sunday in Kinder's 84-67 victory over first-place Varese. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Olowokandi in Bologna were unsuccessful. In an  
interview earlier this month, he was glum about his first taste of 
pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to force anything down anybody's throat,''  
Olowokandi said at the time, ``but usually when you're the top 
pick, they build a team around you. They start from scratch. Over 
here ... their actions, the plays being drawn up, are not 
indicative of me being a top pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowakandi played college ball at Pacific where his average went  
from 4.0 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.32 blocks in his first season 
to 22.2, 11.2 and 2.88 in his third and last year, prompting the 
Clippers to take him with the first overall pick in June's draft. 
Including his stint in Italy, he has played 83 games of organized 
ball.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the city at the center of the Olympics'  
biggest scandal, Salt Lake organizers say they are saddened by the 
wrongdoing uncovered by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report detailed on Sunday, Salt Lake's Olympic  
bid committee spent $440,710 on eight IOC members, including 
$216,000 to Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo. He and five 
other IOC members who were the recipients of the Salt Lake bid 
committee's largesse were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound, who  
led the investigation into the payments, said Salt Lake's bid 
committee simply showed ``a willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we saw amounted to a quid pro quo, the purchase and  
sale of a vote,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report, which did not include bid committee payments to  
the three members who resigned, one who died and two still under 
investigation, was issued at the end of a soul-wrenching weekend at 
the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled president Juan Antonio Samaranch apologized to the  
citizens of Salt Lake and said action against the six IOC members 
was taken to end ``the ugliest chapter'' ever for the world's 
biggest sports event, which in the last two decades has also become 
a billion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members were not accused of bribery or criminal conduct, but  
actions that broke the IOC oath and brought disrepute to the IOC, 
Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Olympic organizers on Sunday called Samaranch's  
apology ``brave'' and in turn apologized to the residents of Utah 
for some overzealous bid committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff praised the ``speed and efficiency'' with which IOC  
investigated the matter, decided to investigate other cities' bids 
and came up with reforms for the way bid cities are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does validate what we have said all along: that these  
problems didn't start here but we hope they end here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff and Frank Joklik, the president of SLOC who has resigned  
but remains on the job while his successor is sought, declined to 
talk about details of the report issued in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	And they refused to talk about matters still under investigation  
by SLOC's outside ethics panel, the U.S. Justice Department and the 
United States Olympic Committee. Utah's attorney general also plans 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik did say, however, that SLOC is ``not aware of any  
criminal conduct having been involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the ethics panel's report would be completed before  
Feb. 11, and he promised to take ``decisive action'' against anyone 
found to have acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot change the past but we can have an enormous impact  
on the future,'' Garff said. ``All of our efforts are dedicated to 
creating a new and better Olympic era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee will re-evaluate its ethics policies,  
find new chief executive and chief operating officers, solidify 
sponsor support and restore public confidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign Jan. 8,  
the same day former bid and organizing president Tom Welch was 
stripped of his pension and consulting contract. Two others, senior 
vice president of marketing and legal affairs Kelly Flint and 
licensing director Rod Hamson, were placed on paid leave while the 
investigations are underway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado Springs, Colo., United States Olympic Committee  
president William Hybl praised the decision to oust the six IOC 
members and said his committee could have done a better job 
overseeing the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?' 
The answer is yes, you can always do a better job,'' Hybl said at a 
USOC news conference. ``I can assure you in the future we're going 
to do better,'' he said. ``The presence of the USOC should be to 
ensure that these types of practices don't go on with the bidding 
cities. We need to make sure it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One section of the IOC report seemed to indicate Joklik had  
progressed from defending the bid committee's payments via its NOC 
(National Olympic Committees) program to saying on Jan. 8 that he 
knew nothing about the lavish spending. He was the volunteer 
chairman of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report notes that when the commission met Dec. 11 with  
Joklik, Johnson and Flint, ``They defended the program and took the 
position that the payments were not connected with the bid and that 
there was no quid pro quo pertaining to them, i.e., no promise of 
support for the bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The evident connection with the bidding process and the date  
profile of the payments were, however, inescapable,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NOC program was established in late 1991 or early 1992 after  
Salt Lake lost its bid for the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not clear exactly to what degree the existence of the  
program was known by the bid committee as a whole, although we are 
advised by SLOC that it appears as a line item in the audited 
financial statements of the bid committee,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Taylor Offers No Apologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor has no apologies and no remorse for  
the drug and personal problems that could jeopardize his election 
this week to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize for anything,'' Taylor said Monday in a  
conference call with reporters, some of whom are on the Hall of 
Fame voting panel. ``There are some things in all our lives we wish 
we could change. Unfortunately, we can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past is the past. I can't worry about it. I can't dwell on  
it. There are consequences for every choice you make. Every day of 
my life, I've known there are consequences. From when I was a 
little boy and learned right from wrong, you know there's 
consequences for everything you do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the choices I made. When my days are over  
I'll have to answer for everything I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's playing career was interrupted by a four-game  
suspension in 1988 when he tested positive for drugs. Since 
retiring, he has been arrested twice on drug charges, pleaded 
guilty to filing false federal tax returns and declared bankrupcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified before a grand jury investigating organized  
crime, his driver's license was suspended for outstanding parking 
tickets, and he received three summonses for leaving the scene of 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the baseball Hall of Fame, there is no citizenship  
criteria for election to Canton. The bylaws of the Pro Football 
shrine speak only of a nominee's achievements and contributions as 
a player, coach or contributor in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	That would seem to include Taylor, one of the most dominant  
linebackers in the game for 13 seasons. And he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the bylaws, it should be a no-brainer,'' he said.  
``If you start going by off-the-field problems, you might have to 
kick out half the people in that Hall of Fame right now. I leave my 
Hall of Fame fate up to the voters. If I don't get in, I don't get 
in. That's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be elected, a candidate needs 80 percent of the vote from  
those present at Saturday's election. If all 36 electors show up, 
Taylor would need votes from 29 of them. A minimum of four and 
maximum of seven of the 15 finalists will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a first-year candidate, knows there will be some  
opposition because of his history, which includes a number of drug 
rehabilitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of life,'' he said. ``Everybody can't be as perfect  
as everybody in that room. We make our choices and they have 
consequences. If my consequences mean not going to the Hall of 
Fame, you guys decide. I'm not losing sleep over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be there. I expect to be there. If you want to say  
LT had problems, I'm guilty. If you want to say LT had controversy, 
guilty. If you want to say there will be more controversy, guilty. 
I have that problem. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're asking me to apologize or be remorseful for what  
I've done, I can't do that. I can't tell you what I would have done 
or could have done. I thank God I'm alive and able to have this 
conversation. There are some things I'd like to change but I can't 
change. I'm happy with who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor is in south Florida this week, filming an Oliver Stone  
football movie titled ``On Any Given Sunday.'' He expects to return 
Sunday to New Jersey, where his son is to undergo knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Costs Seen Rising 9 Pct. in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A survey of employers predicts the cost of  
providing health benefits for workers will rise 9 percent this 
year, the biggest increase in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, covering 4,200 employers, was conducted by the  
consulting firm William M. Mercer. In 1998, health benefits costs 
rose 6.1 percent, Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers blamed the increases on rising premiums charged by  
health plans and skyrocketing drug costs. To deal with rising 
costs, employers are continuing to drop coverage for retirees and 
are reducing drug benefits for some active workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the percentage of companies with 500 or more workers  
providing health benefits retirees over age 65 fell to 36 percent, 
down from 46 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As for active workers, about one-third of employers said they  
cut prescription drug benefits, either by reducing choice of 
certain drugs or asking workers to pick up a higher share of the 
costs. In come cases, workers have been paying higher 
``co-payments'' on each prescription they buy. Co-payments that 
used to average $5 or $10 per prescription can now be as high as 
$20 or even $40. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying the higher benefit costs is the fact that health  
plans are facing a profit squeeze due to their inability to pull 
the reins in on rising health costs. Those plans are now passing on 
their higher costs to employers, and this, in turn affects 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer study found the average health benefit cost per  
employee was $4,164 last year, the first time it topped $4,000. The 
average cost varied widely, from a low of $3,438 in the South to 
$4,340 per employee in the Northeast, the study found. The regional 
differences were attributed to the impact of health maintenance 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs require that patients choose doctors only from those in a  
network of physicians who have agreed to accept lower fees. HMOs 
closely monitor care and require that a primary care physician 
approve all care by specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found costs rising in all three major types of health  
plans-- HMOs, preferred provider organizations and traditional 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Preferred provider organizations or PPOs are a less restrictive  
form of managed care in which consumers pay less if they use 
doctors in the network, but they don't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	The PPO has become the dominant form of health insurance in the  
last five years, rising from 27 percent of employees in 1993 to 40 
percent in 1998, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have increased from 19 percent in 1993 to 29 percent last  
year. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush: Clinton Disrespected Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Former President George Bush worries about  
Bill Clinton's apparent ``lack of respect'' for the presidency, but 
is optimistic any embarrassment to the country will be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried to stay out of all the Washington mess,'' Bush  
said at the end of a keynote address to the Safari Club 
International's 27th annual hunters' convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I must confess I have been deeply concerned by what  
appears to be a lack of respect for the office I was so very proud 
to hold,'' he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidency -- just let me tell you this, because you  
probably worry about all this just as I do. Just as my sons and my 
daughter do. And as Barbara does,'' Bush told the crowd of big-game 
hunters and conservationists at the Reno Hilton Hotel-Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is strong and it is resilient. And the presidency,  
the office of the presidency, is strong and it is resilient,'' he 
said. ``The trials of the present will soon pass away and once 
again our country will be respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made no direct reference to impeachment.  
</P>
<P>
	But retired Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf, a lifetime member of the  
club, drew a raucous standing ovation by introducing Bush as ``a 
man of unimpeachable integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``And a man of great moral courage, my commander in chief,  
George Bush,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two worked the crowd earlier in the day at one of the  
largest trophy hunting conventions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of President Clinton flowed just as freely as the  
praise and admiration for Bush and his sons, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 
and George W. Bush, the Republican governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartzkopf and the elder Bush were met by strong support for a  
presidential bid in 2000 by the newly re-elected Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes from good stock,'' said Robert Charlton, a knifemaker  
from Tyner, N.C., selling his goods at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd certainly like to see him run if he's anything like his  
dad,'' said Bradford Williams, a sculptor from Belfry, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Clinton is a pretty trashy individual,'' said Kenny  
Jarrett, who owns a rifle company and a farm and hunting plantation 
in Jackson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he'd 'fessed up about it all, it probably would have gone  
away. But he perjured himself. If I'd done that, I'd be sitting in 
the jailhouse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who talked briefly with the ex-president Saturday, said  
Bush ``and Barbara are such a decent all-American couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his boys are going to be players on the national scene  
in the near future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  After Shooting 59, Duval Thinks Big  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- So he shot a 59. David Duval's talking  
about getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a scary thought for those on the PGA Tour who might  
have some notion of winning a tournament or two themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval provided one of those magic moments Sunday when he closed  
with a 59 to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. He compared his 
record-tying round to pitching a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's rarer. Only two other players in PGA Tour history  
reached 59 -- Al Geiberger in Memphis, Tenn., in 1977 and Chip Beck 
in Las Vegas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had 11 birdies, six pars and an eagle on the final hole to  
end the day at 13-under. The astonishing round carried him to 
victory after he began the day seven strokes off the lead. Steve 
Pate finished one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is 27 years old and has won nine times. However, he has  
yet to win a major and he's intent on changing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have told everybody before I certainly want to be the best  
at some point in my career, and if I am considered that now, I am 
flattered and excited,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still have to keep trying to improve. Got to keep trying  
to get better and try to add some U.S. Opens and PGAs and such to 
my resume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's nine wins have come in his last 28 tournaments,  
including a victory in his only other outing this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Mercedes Championships by nine shots this month, and  
he wound up both that event and the 90-hole Hope at 26-under. That 
makes him 56-under for two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	And the money is adding up. After setting a PGA Tour earnings  
record with $2,591,031 last year, he already has won $1,008,000 in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval acknowledges that his closing round over the 6,950-yard  
Arnold Palmer Course at PGA West was about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestling approach shots within a few feet of the pin most of the  
day, Duval made the turn with a 5-under 31. He then bettered that 
with a 28 on the back, finishing with an 8-foot eagle putt on No. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	His 10-footer on No. 14 was the longest birdie putt he made, and  
his longest par putt was from 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably can't play any better than that,'' he said. ``But  
overall, I hope I can still improve. That is one of my big goals 
still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first four days of the Hope, Duval was just one of the  
guys, with cards of 70, 71, 64 and 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played an exceptional round of golf, something that doesn't  
happen very often. I was way behind and in essence in a position 
that I couldn't win the golf tournament,'' he said. ``But as it 
turns out, I have to shoot 59 and I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 59 and the win didn't translate to No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	The world golf rankings released Monday in London had Tiger  
Woods remaining at No. 1, although Duval did move up one spot by 
winning the Hope. He got no points for his 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wins this week, he can't help but go to No. 1, whatever  
Tiger does,'' said Tony Greer, who administers the weekly rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was the only top-10 player in the Hope field, meaning he  
did not earn as many points as he could have. The field for this 
week's Phoenix Open -- which features Duval, Woods, Vijay Singh and 
Jim Furyk -- is much stronger.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Monday rejected a motion that

<HEADLINE> Dolphins LB Thomas Mugged in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas came back  
from a New York trip sporting stitches, saying he was mugged while 
in the city for a charity appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Jets beat us twice. I got beat again when I was  
on the road a couple of days ago,'' said Thomas, who got five 
stitches in his upper lip and various bruises during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was in good spirits as he recalled the attack, even  
joking that he knew there was little chance anybody would step in 
to assist him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't help me out mainly I guess because I'm down here  
from Miami,'' he said. ``I play for the Dolphins. They're big-time 
Jets fans over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro linebacker was in New York to appear at a Hunter's  
Hope fund-raiser last Wednesday, sponsored by former Buffalo 
quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's Hope raises money for research to find a cure for  
Krabbe's Disease. Kelly's son, Hunter, was diagnosed with the 
disease in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have asked ... just ask me next time,'' Thomas  
said. ``I'll give you my wallet. It doesn't mean anything to me.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Rape, Murder Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- All seven men charged in a July 1997 gang  
rape and slaying of a newly married Navy wife also stabbed the 
victim to ensure that each of them would be equally culpable, one 
of the defendants said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danial J. Williams said he and his friends agreed that if each  
of them raped and stabbed Michelle Moore-Bosko, they would be less 
inclined to implicate the others if ever charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 26, of Owosso, Mich., said he was the architect of the  
alleged scheme. He told his chilling tale Friday in a plea deal 
that spared him a possible death sentence. Four others are 
scheduled for trial next month, and two plan to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will be sentenced to life in prison without parole  
on the murder and rape conviction, told prosecutors he had become 
obsessed with Ms. Moore-Bosko, 18, who lived in the same apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 8, 1997, according to Williams' statement, the seven  
barged into Ms. Moore-Bosko's apartment, took turns raping her 
while others held her down and covered her mouth, all stabbed her 
and Williams then strangled her. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven defendants were active in the Navy or had recently  
left the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore-Bosko and her husband, William Bosko, 19, had eloped  
three months earlier. Bosko found his wife's body on July 9 when he 
returned home from a week-long Navy cruise.

<HEADLINE> Bill Favors Satellite TV Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite TV companies would be allowed to  
provide local TV broadcasts under a bill introduced Monday in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would help direct-broadcast satellite, or DBS,  
companies such as DirecTV and EchoStar better compete against cable 
TV companies, which already may carry local TV programs on their 
systems, the bill's sponsors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is being sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Sen. Conrad Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require DBS companies eventually to carry on  
their systems all local TV stations in a given market. And, it 
would direct the Federal Communications Commission to implement 
certain rules designed to protect local TV stations from losing 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The adoption of these rules, however, would have to be approved  
by two-thirds of the FCC's five members, not a simple majority as 
is currently required for rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill does not contain provisions -- as a a draft bill did --  
that loosen national TV ownership limits for broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is designed to work with another measure offered last  
week by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that provides 
DBMS companies with the copyright licenses they need to carry local 
TV stations.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip As Stocks Improve / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 *With BC-Bonds-Glance    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped Monday as a rising stock  
market robbed U.S. Treasury securities of some of their appeal as 
safe haven investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.11 percent from 5.07 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks swung around during the day but ended higher. The Dow  
Jones industrial average gained 82.65 points to close at 9,203.32. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/16 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were off 7/32 point to 5/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.39 
point to 1,320.60 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.42 percent as the  
discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 4.32 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.43 percent, as the discount was unchanged from late 
Friday at 4.28 percent. One-year yields were 4.45 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.01 percentage point to 4.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5 percent from 4.63 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 3/16 from 125 5/32. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.13 percent from 5.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Steel Exports to U.S. Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese steel exports to the United States soared  
in 1998, but fell in December for the first time in nearly three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mounting sales of Japanese steel in the United States have  
fanned U.S.-Japan trade tensions and led to threats of trade 
penalties against Tokyo unless the exports dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report Monday, the Japan Finance Ministry said U.S.-bound  
steel exports soared 91.2 percent to $3.6 billion. On a volume 
basis, they were up sharply 166.6 percent at 6.9 million metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	For December, however, steel exports fell for the first time in  
33 months. Steel exports to the United States fell 20.8 percent to 
$207.3 million compared to the same month a year earlier, and 
volume fell 14.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the drop in December could allow Japan to avert  
U.S. trade penalties for now. Washington has said it would monitor 
monthly changes in exports, particularly during December, before 
deciding whether to impose anti-dumping penalties or go to the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they survived,'' said Matthew Poggi, an economist at  
Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. pressure against Japan to cut its surplus is likely to  
remain steady, because the overall surplus isn't likely to begin 
shrinking for another few months, when the effects of the yen's 
surge begin to be felt, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Political pressure in the U.S. is building, not only against  
Japan but against other countries as well, because of the huge 
increase in the U.S. trade deficit,'' Poggi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 40.1 percent  
in 1998 from the previous year to a record $121.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the capital  
murder trial of John William King, one of three men facing the 
death penalty in the dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, wore a bulletproof vest as he was escorted by deputies  
into Jasper County Courthouse. He is accused in the June 7 slaying 
of James Byrd Jr., who was stripped, chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged until his head came off. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 400 county residents randomly selected for  
jury selection showed up, and after initial questioning the pool 
was reduced to 122 people, 21 of them black. The selection process 
is expected to last three weeks, resulting in 12 jurors and two 
alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said many people  
have told him they were reluctant to serve because of the case's 
high profile. Byrd's murder made national news far beyond Jasper, 
an East Texas timber town of 8,000 people just west of the 
Louisiana line. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of you guys,'' he told reporters Sunday.  
``They're afraid of having their picture taken. They're afraid of 
being interviewed. And they're afraid of serving on a big case like 
this with a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	King, an ex-convict once involved in a racist prison gang, wore  
a long-sleeved shirt in the courtroom, covering his heavily 
tattooed arms. His short haircut revealed the trace of a large 
tattoo in the shape of a pentagram on the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he intended to kidnap Byrd and then to kill him will be  
key in the capital murder case -- and, if he is convicted, to 
whether he's sentenced to life in prison or put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 23, whose engraved wrench was found near  
Byrd's body, was the only defendant to give a statement about 
events leading to Byrd's death. But his statement is legally 
inadmissible unless he testifies, and his attorney says he won't 
permit Berry on the stand without a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- King, Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 --  
were roommates who shared an apartment. Berry told officers the 
three men had been drinking on June 6. Late that evening or shortly 
after midnight, the men went out for a ride in Berry's rusty, 1982 
gray Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what Berry says happened after the pickup truck stopped  
to pick up Byrd, who was walking home from his niece's bridal 
shower: 
</P>
<P>
	King objected to giving a ride to Byrd and, after the group  
stopped at a convenience store, drove to an abandoned logging road 
outside town. There, King declared he was ``fixing to scare'' Byrd. 
Berry watched as Brewer and King allegedly beat Byrd into 
unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry fled and King drove after him. After Berry got back in and  
the truck took off, he turned and said he saw Byrd's body bouncing 
behind, fastened to the bumper with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The route they took, a two-mile asphalt stretch of Huff Creek  
Road, was later marked with 75 red spray-painted circles to show 
where police found Byrd's keys, dentures and parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged King, Brewer and Berry with capital murder  
but decided to try the cases separately. King's is the second 
capital murder trial in Jasper County. The only other one was in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> UConn Tops Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida coach Billy Donovan wants his team to focus on January  
instead of March. Still, the Gators play like a team that expects 
to be around for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (14-3) made its first appearance in The Associated Press  
poll in four years Monday, using convincing victories over LSU and 
Tennessee to slide in at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	It was yet another accomplishment for a team that relies on four  
highly touted freshmen and was expected to need at least a season 
to acclimate itself to big-time college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be recognized,'' Donovan said. ``But I'm more  
concerned about winning. It's nothing to embrace, nothing to get 
overly excited about. It's just a lot of people's opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the poll, Connecticut (17-0) held the No. 1 spot  
for the ninth consecutive week. The Huskies, who finished the week 
as the only undefeated team in Division I, received 54 first-place 
votes and 1,755 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (19-1), which beat Clemson and was extended into overtime  
by St. John's, was second with the 17 other No. 1 votes and 1,719 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, Maryland and Cincinnati, all going 2-0 last week, held  
third through fifth from last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky and Auburn switched places from last week at Nos. 6 and  
7 after the Wildcats handed Cliff Ellis' team its first loss of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State jumped three places to eighth and was followed by  
St. John's and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA was No. 11 and followed by Wisconsin, Arizona, Purdue, Ohio  
State, Iowa, Syracuse, New Mexico, Minnesota and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the rankings were Arkansas, Kansas,  
Miami, Texas Christian and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	This marks Florida's first appearance in the poll since Jan. 31,  
1995, the season after Lon Kruger took the Gators on a surprise 
trip to the Final Four. Florida made the tournament in 1994-95, as 
well, but Kruger left for Illinois a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Donovan has come aboard, Florida has taken on a dramatic  
up-tempo look. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, the Gators completed a 2-1 road trip with a  
77-58 victory at LSU. Returning home Saturday, they threw the 
full-court press on Tennessee for all 40 minutes in a 93-72 blowout 
and showed that they, not the Volunteers, could be the best young 
team in the Southeastern Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest question coming into this year was how our team  
would handle the SEC, going from one game to next and being 
focused,'' Donovan said. ``I'm not worried about them physically. 
It's mentally, being prepared, bringing their best every single 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led in scoring by freshmen Udonis Haslem (13.5 points per game),  
Mike Miller (13.1) and Teddy Dupay (11.6), Florida has outpaced 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators press and run, a style Donovan learned under Rick  
Pitino -- first while playing at Providence, then as an assistant 
coach at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our style of play,'' Dupay said after the victory over  
Tennessee. ``That's why we came to Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Florida's next four games are at home, beginning  
Wednesday against Alabama. A few more wins will surely put the 
Gators in contention for an NCAA tournament spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was reminded that the last time Florida was ranked, they  
went on road and lost by 23 to Mississippi State,'' Donovan said. 
``To me, I'm more concerned about playing Alabama than being ranked 
in the Top 25. That's nice. When you win, those things come. But 
the focus has got to be on putting ourselves in a position to 
win.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor: DiMaggio's Health Is Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio was watching NBC when the network  
reported he had died, a friend said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was livid,'' said Morris Engelberg, who was with the New  
York Yankee great when the erroneous report was broadcast Sunday 
night. ``Then I made him laugh. I said, `Joe, we must be in heaven 
together.''' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said a technician in the network's New York control room  
inadvertently sent the erroneous report during the ``Dateline NBC'' 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came on as a ``crawl,'' or words running at the  
bottom of the television screen, at about 7:30 p.m. EST: ``This is 
an NBC News Special Report. Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio has died 
at his Florida home. He was 84 years old and had.'' The message was 
then cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC ran another crawl about 20 minutes later, saying its  
previous report was inaccurate. ``Mr. DiMaggio remains in stable 
condition at his Florida home,'' the report said, running over a 
taped Katie Couric interview with actress Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just hit the wrong button,'' network spokesman Cory Shields  
said of the technician. Shields would not identify the technician. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said he and DiMaggio happened to be watching a video  
of a movie, ``Gunfight at the OK Corral,'' and had just stopped the 
tape when the report was aired. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who has lung cancer, was released last week from  
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., after spending 99 
days in intensive care. He is too weak to undergo chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC employee had typed the report and stored it in NBC's  
computer earlier in the day after reading a New York Daily News 
report that DiMaggio was in grave condition. The report quoted a 
source as saying DiMaggio had been released from the hospital 
because there was nothing else that could be done for him. 
Engelberg called the report ``absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is DiMaggio not dead, he is not in hopeless condition,  
his doctor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is progressing nicely since his discharge from Memorial  
Regional Hospital one week ago,'' Dr. Earl Barron said in a 
statement faxed to The Associated Press. ``Over the weekend, his 
physical therapy has progressed to the point that he is walking. 
Reports of his condition worsening are not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was trying to reach DiMaggio's family to apologize, Shields  
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the erroneous NBC report was only sent out live on East  
Coast stations, some affiliates in the Midwest or West may have 
also picked up the report and ran it, Shields said.

<HEADLINE> Union Membership Rises by 100,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Union membership rose by more than 100,000 in  
1998, an increase over the previous year that the AFL-CIO 
attributed to more aggressive organizing. At the same time, the 
percentage of workers represented by organized labor slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Monday that union membership grew  
from 16.1 million to 16.2 million last year. At the same time, the 
share of the workforce belonging to unions declined from 14.1 
percent to 13.9 percent, reflecting population growth and an 
overall expansion in the workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the least the percentage has fallen for the past five  
years. In 1994, there were 16.7 million union members, which 
reflected 15.5 percent of the workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO said the raw increase in membership reflects  
membership drives such as those that brought United Airlines 
workers into the International Association of Machinists last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new data confirms that today's unions are on the right  
track,'' said the labor federation's president, John Sweeney. 
``We're reaching out and growing, especially in the communities 
where working families most benefit from unionization.''

<HEADLINE> All-American, Actor Wedemeyer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Herman Wedemeyer, an All-American running back  
who later became a regular on ``Hawaii Five-0,'' died Monday. He 
was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer died at noon at The Queen's Medical Center. The cause  
of death was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer appeared in the popular TV series from 1971-80,  
playing the role of Edward D. ``Duke'' Lukela. He appeared in more 
than 300 episodes, calling it ``a fascinating experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from St. Louis High School, he went to St.  
Mary's College in California, where he made the 1945 AP All-America 
team. The elusive running back was known as ``Squirmin' Herman'' 
and the ``Hula-hipped Hawaiian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grantland Rice called Wedemeyer the most outstanding football  
player of 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the National Football Foundation College Hall  
of Fame and the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a veteran of the Naval Air Corps.  
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer made headlines in New York in 1946 when St. Mary's  
played Fordham at the Polo Grounds. He was playing safety when 
Fordham quick-kicked the football over his head. He retreated back 
to his own 25-yard line to field the punt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw all 11 of their guys coming at me,'' he recalled in a  
1996 interview. ``They were going to kill me. I said to myself, `To 
heck with that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Wedemeyer punted the ball back, the ball rolling dead on  
Fordham's 15-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	He also threw an 80-yard touchdown in the 1946 Sugar Bowl  
against Oklahoma A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer was a first-round draft pick of the Los Angeles Dons  
of the All America Football Conference but an injury cut short his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer returned to Hawaii, where he had a successful business  
career and entered politics. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Honolulu City Council as a Republican in  
1968, and then elected to the state House of Representatives as a 
Democrat in 1970. He won re-election in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an avid golfer and a member of the Waialae Country Club,  
where he was a longtime volunteer with the Hawaiian Open golf 
tournament. For years, Wedemeyer announced the names of the golfers 
as they approached the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on survivors were not immediately available.

	The credit card company earned $530 million, or $1.16 a share,  
just as Wall Street analysts had predicted. American Express earned 
$493 million, or $1.04 a share, in the final quarter of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Vols No. 1 in Women's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee remained the overwhelming choice for No. 1 in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll Monday, and was one of 
just two teams that held the same position as last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The other was Old Dominion, which stayed at No. 12 in the poll  
that underwent considerable shuffling and featured the return of 
three teams that were ranked earlier: Boston College, Kansas and UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (17-1) received 39 of 41 first-place votes and 1,023  
points from a national media panel to lead the poll for the third 
straight week. The Lady Vols beat Old Dominion and Florida last 
week to run their winning streak to 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (16-1), Louisiana Tech (15-2) and Georgia (18-1) held the  
next three places, with Purdue and Louisiana Tech getting one 
first-place vote apiece. All three moved up one spot after 
Connecticut (16-3) lost two of three games during the week and fell 
from second to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, which has four key players sidelined by injuries,  
lost at Louisiana Tech, beat Miami and lost at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State (20-1) jumped two places to sixth, and was  
followed by Notre Dame, UCLA, Duke and Texas Tech, which fell four 
spots after losing at Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (18-0), the nation's only unbeaten Division I  
team, climbed two places to 11th. Then it was Old Dominion, 
Rutgers, North Carolina and Clemson, followed by Iowa State, Auburn 
and Tulane. Ohio State and Virginia tied for 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were Penn State, Boston College, Alabama, Kansas  
and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (15-3) gained its first national ranking at No.  
25 three weeks ago, moved up to 21st the following week and then 
dropped out after losing two straight. The Eagles beat Providence 
last week before knocking off UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) was missing from the Top 25 for just one week. The  
Jayhawks dropped out after a 20-point loss to Nebraska and they 
lost at Colorado last week before handing Texas Tech its first Big 
12 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	UC Santa Barbara (13-3) was ranked the first two weeks of the  
season, reaching No. 22, then fell out after an overtime loss to 
Wisconsin. The Gauchos are now on an eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, Nebraska and Oregon dropped out. Florida, which had  
been 21st, lost to Tennessee and LSU. Nebraska, last week's No. 23 
team, lost to Colorado, while Oregon split, losing to Arizona and 
beating Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon was 25th last week, its only appearance in the rankings  
this season. Florida had been ranked all season and Nebraska had 
been in all but the preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane made the biggest jump in the poll, going from 24th to  
18th after winning three games. North Carolina lost to Duke and 
Georgia Tech last week, and fell from seventh to 14th, the biggest 
drop within the poll.

president? We wish we could say yes, but it's not possible. Some 
big fish ... still swim in the Olympic bowl. Samaranch didn't ... 
uproot this disease at birth. Now he has an enormous task before 
him: saving the Olympics, and his own presidency, from a horrible 
end.'' --editorial, Gazzetta dello Sport

The worst culprits hide behind tinted glass and security cordons in 
Lausanne ... Juan Antonio Samaranch's dysfunctional Olympic family 
cannot be trusted to purge itself ... the Swiss government, on 
whose soil the IOC trade, should close the organization down 
pending an investigation by ministers and the police.'' -- The Daily

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Leaders Applaud IOC Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the city at the center of the Olympics'  
biggest scandal, Salt Lake organizers say they are saddened by the 
wrongdoing uncovered by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report detailed on Sunday, Salt Lake's Olympic  
bid committee spent $440,710 on eight IOC members, including 
$216,000 to Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo. He and five 
other IOC members who were the recipients of the Salt Lake bid 
committee's largesse were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound, who  
led the investigation into the payments, said Salt Lake's bid 
committee simply showed ``a willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we saw amounted to a quid pro quo, the purchase and  
sale of a vote,'' Pound said. 
</P>

	The IOC report, which did not include bid committee payments to  
the three members who resigned, one who died and two still under 
investigation, was issued at the end of a soul-wrenching weekend at 
the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled president Juan Antonio Samaranch apologized to the  
citizens of Salt Lake and said action against the six IOC members 
was taken to end ``the ugliest chapter'' ever for the world's 
biggest sports event, which in the last two decades has also become 
a billion-dollar business.

	IOC members were not accused of bribery or criminal conduct, but  
actions that broke the IOC oath and brought disrepute to the IOC, 
Pound said.

	Salt Lake Olympic organizers on Sunday called Samaranch's  
apology ``brave'' and in turn apologized to the residents of Utah 
for some overzealous bid committee members.

Feb. 11, and he promised to take ``decisive action'' against anyone 
found to have acted improperly.

the same day former bid and organizing president Tom Welch was 
stripped of his pension and consulting contract. Two others, senior 
vice president of marketing and legal affairs Kelly Flint and 
licensing director Rod Hamson, were placed on paid leave while the 
investigations are underway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado Springs, Colo., United States Olympic Committee  
president William Hybl praised the decision to oust the six IOC 
members and said his committee could have done a better job 
overseeing the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?' 
The answer is yes, you can always do a better job,'' Hybl said at a 
USOC news conference. ``I can assure you in the future we're going 
to do better,'' he said. ``The presence of the USOC should be to 
ensure that these types of practices don't go on with the bidding 
cities. We need to make sure it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One section of the IOC report seemed to indicate Joklik had  
progressed from defending the bid committee's payments via its NOC 
(National Olympic Committees) program to saying on Jan. 8 that he 
knew nothing about the lavish spending. He was the volunteer 
chairman of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report notes that when the commission met Dec. 11 with  
Joklik, Johnson and Flint, ``They defended the program and took the 
position that the payments were not connected with the bid and that 
there was no quid pro quo pertaining to them, i.e., no promise of 
support for the bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The evident connection with the bidding process and the date  
profile of the payments were, however, inescapable,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NOC program was established in late 1991 or early 1992 after  
Salt Lake lost its bid for the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not clear exactly to what degree the existence of the  
program was known by the bid committee as a whole, although we are 
advised by SLOC that it appears as a line item in the audited 
financial statements of the bid committee,'' the report said.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the city at the center of the Olympics'  
biggest scandal, Salt Lake organizers say they are saddened by the 
wrongdoing uncovered by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report detailed on Sunday, Salt Lake's Olympic  
bid committee spent $440,710 on eight IOC members, including 
$216,000 to Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo. He and five 
other IOC members who were the recipients of the Salt Lake bid 
committee's largesse were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound, who  
led the investigation into the payments, said Salt Lake's bid 
committee simply showed ``a willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we saw amounted to a quid pro quo, the purchase and  
sale of a vote,'' Pound said.

<HEADLINE> Occidental To Cut Capital Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. will cut capital  
spending more than 60 percent to $350 million during 1999, becoming 
the latest major oil company to announce big budget cuts to offset 
a year-long slump in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental's capital budget will drop from $1 billion spent in  
1998, reflecting weak demand and historically low crude oil prices 
that have left companies worldwide struggling to reduce expenses, 
the company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies that have cut capital spending this year include  
Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp. and two other Los Angeles-based oil 
producers, Unocal Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital expenditures include money spent on construction, new  
equipment and other development. 
</P>
<P>
	When adjusted for inflation, domestic U.S. oil prices are at  
their lowest level since the Great Depression, averaging less than 
$8 per barrel during the month of December, according to the 
American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Occidental announced a two-year, $200 million  
cost-cutting program that includes the elimination of more than 
1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and gas production will remain roughly at last year's level  
of 320 barrels of oil and 703 million cubic feet of natural gas. 
Dividends also were expected to remain at about 1998 levels, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, the company said it would sharply reduce drilling  
in the Elk Hills oil field near Bakersfield, Calif. The company had 
planned to drill 100 new wells in Elk Hills, which was set aside as 
a military oil reserve until last year. Occidental purchased a 78 
percent share of the field for $3.65 billion last year. Chevron 
controls the other 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is curtailing activity, Occidental remains committed  
to developing the 73-square-mile reserve, one of the nation's 
largest oil fields with about 670 million barrels of oil and 1.9 
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, said Ray R. Irani, Occidental's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect prices and demand to remain relatively flat  
during 1999.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bill Interest Rates Mixed / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.305 percent, up from 4.280 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.280 percent, down from 4.310 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Jan. 11, when the  
bills sold for 4.390 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Oct. 26, 1998, when the rate was 4.155 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.412 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,891.20 and 4.436 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,783.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.49 
percent last week from 4.51 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Davis Wants To Write for Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMERVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- After a long career as an actor,  
81-year-old Ossie Davis wants to get back to what drew him to show 
business in the first place -- writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to write for the theater,'' Davis said at a National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People meeting in his 
hometown Saturday. ``It was the thing I loved and wanted to do. I 
left home to go to school to do that. I'm still trying to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has written only one Broadway play -- the 1970 musical  
``Purlie,'' which was nominated for a Tony. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had several plays produced off-Broadway, but is better  
known as an actor. He was nominated for a Tony in 1958 for 
``Jamaica'' and appeared in a string of movies, including ``Do The 
Right Thing'' and ``Grumpy Old Men.'' He has also been on the TV 
series ``Evening Shade.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes 82.65 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices girated all day Monday but ended  
mostly higher, after investors picked apart the nuances of 
divergent earnings reports and forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 82.65 points to  
9,203.32, about 70 points of that in the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index sank 57 points in morning trading, turned  
around and surged 50 points, dropped back a second time and rose 
again in the last hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 30.23 to  
2,369.11 as Microsoft, a high-profile component, rose 5 5/8 to 161 7/8. 
Microsoft announced a two-for-one stock split Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 added 8.76 to 1,233.95.  
</P>
<P>
	A number of Dow components moved on earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T reported fourth-quarter earnings on target with estimates  
but cautioned analysts to lower their expectations for the first 
quarter. It finished 1 3/8 higher at 85 5/8, after being lower most of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 3 13/16 to 75 1/8. 3M's  
operating earnings beat analyst estimates, although they were lower 
than the fourth quarter of 1997. 3M executives said improving 
foreign exchange rates, further cost reductions and new products 
will help the company continue earnings growth in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express added 2 3/4 to 101 1/4, after the company met analyst  
profit expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, another Dow component, rose 1 5/8 to 53 1/4, even after  
reporting lower operating earnings. The results topped estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble dropped 1 11/16 to 83 5/8. The personal-products  
manufacturer met targets for its second-quarter earnings, but 
suggested third-quarter earnings might disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among Dow components, Merck declined 1 1/2 to 137 1/2. The drug  
maker warned Friday that it had suffered a setback in the 
development of a new depression treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is encouraging that a number of companies are managing to  
produce decent earnings on practically no revenue gains,'' 
prudential Securities' Chief Investment Strategist Greg Smith wrote 
in a report Monday.. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said he  
didn't see how earnings could remain healthy without decent revenue 
growth, and called the market's overall trend weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Hill, an earnings analyst at First Call Corp., said,  
``We know technology companies are going to do well in the first 
and second quarter. We know the momentum is there for those 
companies. The momentum is there for building and retail companies, 
where it's U.S.-consumer spending related. 
</P>
<P>
	``But where you have multinationals, food, beverage, personal  
care, being affected by overseas events, the picture is much less 
clear,'' Hill said. ``Do you buy diapers in a developing country if 
the economy gets tough? Do you drink Coke instead of water?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a slim lead on advancers in the end, after  
overtaking them in early afternoon. Volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange was moderate at 722.69 million shares, down from Friday's 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other major indexes, the NYSE composite index rose 2.31 to  
586.06 , and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.32 
to 706.01. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.33 to 
422.11. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas markets, stocks in Tokyo gained 0.38 percent, London  
rose 0.34 percent, Paris added 0.78 percent, but the DAX index in

<HEADLINE> ESPN To Honor O.J. Simpson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- ESPN will air a 30-minute documentary  
honoring O.J. Simpson as one of the 50 greatest North American 
athletes of the 20th century, despite his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the Heisman Trophy winner in his senior year at the  
University of Southern California, had an 11-year professional 
career. He was the first NFL player to run for more than 2,000 
yards in a single season, in 1973, and finished his career with 
11,236 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said Monday that the special, to be broadcast Friday, will  
take note of the allegations that Simpson killed his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and a companion, Ronald Goldman. Although 
acquitted of criminal charges, Simpson was found liable for their 
deaths in a separate civil proceeding, a decision he is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	But panelists voting on the 50 greatest athletes were asked to  
consider athletic prowess alone, the network said. ESPN also said 
nearly 60 percent of ESPN Web site users said they believed Simpson 
was one of the greatest athletes of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those interviewed for the Simpson program were author  
George Plimpton and former NFL defensive end Deacon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was guilty and you just can't get that out of your  
mind,'' Plimpton told the program. ``If he were in prison, 
actually, serving out his term, I think one would begin to think of 
him more as a football player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Simpson's predicament should not overshadow the  
quality of his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he did outside the game has anything to do with his  
contributions to the sport, not one iota,'' Jones said. ``Now, if 
you hate him over here for what he was accused of, you understand, 
then hate him over here, but over here you have to give him his 
dues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson is the second athlete to be honored in the 50-part  
series. Tennis great Chris Evert was first.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Is Disconnected From Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Washington is gripped by the impeachment  
drama, President Clinton is in a different place. Greeting Pope 
John Paul II in St. Louis. Inspecting tornado damage back home in 
Arkansas. Offering encouragement to women who have moved from 
welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
	As his lawyers passionately argue his case in the Senate trial,  
there is nothing but silence from the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House mantra is that Clinton is busy doing the  
people's business while Congress is locked up in a partisan debate. 
The president treats impeachment as if it were a political sideshow 
unimportant to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the president going to be impeached?'' Secretary of Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was asked at a press 
briefing Monday. ``Not until after we finish welfare reform,'' 
Shalala responded jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to wring his hands in public or fret about his future,  
Clinton is following a strategy that plays to the sentiment of 
Americans who are tired of the impeachment process and want 
Washington to pay attention to problems on Main Street, not 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the public view that the trial is crazy and it ought to  
end and he ought to stay in office, it would be lunacy for him to 
be doing anything other than he is doing,'' said Thomas Mann, 
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons, other than a booming economy, that the  
public gives for wanting this man to stay in office is that he 
continues to show up every day and do the job,'' Mann said. ``What 
could he possibly do differently? Should he go off on spiritual 
retreat? Should he be apologizing more every day? Should he be 
hiding himself in the private quarters of the White House?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a year ago on Jan. 21 that the Lewinsky scandal exploded  
onto the front page. It was widely believed that Clinton's strong 
poll ratings would collapse in the face of embarrassing 
disclosures. Instead, his poll numbers climbed, and none of the 
controversy over the last 12 months has dented his enviable job 
approval ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his spokesman, Clinton has been too busy to watch  
his Senate trial, except for the emotional closing argument by his 
fellow Arkansan, former Sen. Dale Bumpers. Even there, Clinton was 
portrayed as detached from the grave legal implications. Clinton 
was interested in how Bumpers approached the assignment. ``He's 
obviously a longtime fan of the oratory skills of Sen. Bumpers,'' 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a night-and-day contrast between the stern rhetoric of  
Republican prosecutors in Clinton's trial and the president's own 
almost carefree words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,'' the president said in  
opening a welfare speech Monday in the newly renamed presidential 
hall of the Old Executive Office Building. ``This is a good way to 
start the day, isn't it? We're all going to feel better when we 
leave here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later on Capitol Hill, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., struck  
a different chord. ``I ask you to consider the harm he caused, the 
indignity he brought to the institution of the presidency,'' Canady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say Clinton has compartmentalized his  
problems, pushing them back into a corner of his brain while he 
devotes most of his energy to his job. ``The vast majority of his 
time is focused in on business that you see, in preparing for 
events and policy discussions,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, over the past year of the Lewinsky soap opera, Clinton  
confidants have described a president who, in private, is angry, 
frustrated and feels victimized by the intense investigation of his 
private life that forced him to acknowledge a sexual relationship 
he tried so hard to conceal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I presume in his private moments he is in agony, he's pained,  
he's angered'' Mann said. ``I assume there is a human being that 
hosts all of those natural human sentiments. There's just no point 
in sharing those with the country.''

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Saw His False-Death Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nobody was more surprised than Joe DiMaggio when he saw a  
television report that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was livid,'' his lawyer and neighbor Morris Engelberg said  
Monday. ``Then I made him laugh. I said, `Joe, we must be in heaven 
together.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The two were watching a tape of ``Gunfight at the OK Corral'' --  
DiMaggio's favorite Western -- at the baseball great's home in 
Hollywood, Fla., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	They happened to stop the tape just when the report appeared as  
a ``crawl'' across the screen during ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC ran another crawl about 20 minutes later, saying its  
previous report was inaccurate. The network later said a technician 
in the New York control room inadvertently sent the item. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC delivered an apology to DiMaggio to Engelberg's office on  
Monday, spokesman Cory Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, recovering from pneumonia and lung cancer surgery on  
Oct. 12, already was upset by a story in the New York Daily News 
that described him as bedridden and in grave condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead doctor on the team that treated the 84-year-old Hall  
Famer during his 99-day hospital stay disputed the Daily News 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is progressing nicely since his discharge from Memorial  
Regional Hospital one week ago,'' Dr. Earl Barron said in a 
statement to The Associated Press. ``Over the weekend, his physical 
therapy has progressed to the point that he is walking. Reports of 
his condition worsening are not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg, who lives next door to DiMaggio and visits him at  
least once a day, called the newspaper report ``absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's walking. He's taking therapy.'' Engelberg said. ``And he  
will be at opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said last week when DiMaggio  
was discharged from the hospital, ``Joe will certainly toss out the 
first ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees open their home schedule April 9 with a day game  
against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my goal now -- to have Joe at opening day,'' Engelberg  
said. ``My first goal was to have him get out of the hospital, and 
that happened. A lot of people didn't think it would. He's 
miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner had wanted DiMaggio to throw out the ceremonial  
first pitch at last fall's World Series, but DiMaggio was in the 
hospital by then.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T 4Q Profits Rise 58 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. posted a 58 percent rise in  
fourth-quarter profit Monday and outlined a strategy to shore up 
its weaknesses. The new sales targets are two lucrative groups of 
customers: Large businesses needing advanced telecommunications and 
consumers seeking personalized packages of services, from mobile 
phones to Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though AT&AMP;T's profit report met Wall Street forecasts, the  
company is under pressure to branch out into new high-growth areas. 
Sales of long-distance phone service, its biggest business, remain 
weak. The nation's largest telephone company managed to overcome a 
3.6 percent drop in long-distance revenue in the fourth quarter 
mostly by cost cuts, strong demand for its mobile-phone services 
and by one-time accounting gains. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T stock, the most widely held in the nation, initially sank  
after the figures were disclosed, but ended the day with a gain of 
1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In its bid to win new business customers, AT&AMP;T's is offering to  
integrate employees' voice, data and Internet traffic onto a single 
system of communications. The AT&AMP;T network uses an Internet-based 
method of transmission that costs less than other methods and 
carries information more efficiently, resulting in fewer 
bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials broadly outlined the plan Monday but said they'd  
release more details at a trade show announcement on Tuesday. The 
plan is intended to help the company fight back against rivals like 
MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. that already are pitching such 
services to business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T has not caught up to the competition,'' said Jeffrey  
Kagan, an independent industry consultant based outside Atlanta. 
``They're throwing their hat into the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also began advertising a new service geared to  
consumers who want the convenience of paying for different AT&AMP;T 
services, from Internet access to mobile-phone service, on a single 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	While customers won't be given a discount for buying more than  
one AT&AMP;T service, the idea is to attract technology-oriented 
customers, who are most likely to make lots of phone calls and 
spend many hours a week on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's quarterly results underscore its need to seek new revenue  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., said it earned $2.0  
billion, or $1.12 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That 
was up from a profit of $1.26 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But revenue rose only 4.8 percent to $13.53 billion from $12.90  
billion as rival low-cost providers of long-distance service 
continued to eat away at AT&AMP;T's main business. AT&AMP;T still has most 
of its sales in shrinking long-distance phone service, which has 
seen a spate of nimble competitors spring up in recent years to 
lure away Ma Bell's customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials said the company expects revenue to improve this  
year, growing by between 5 percent and 7 percent in 1999. Profit, 
on a per-share basis, is expected to grow by about a third in the 
current quarter and by 20 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T stock fell nearly 4 percent before rebounding to close with  
a gain of $1.37 1/2 at $89.62 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's quarterly results got a big help from its wireless  
services sales, which grew 25 percent to $1.51 billion, amid strong 
demand for its new Digital One Rate promotion, a pricing package 
that charges users from 11 cents to 15 cents a minute, no matter 
where they are calling from. AT&AMP;T signed more than 850,000 Digital 
One subscribers since introducing the plan in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from business services, which includes long-distance and  
data transmission services, grew 4.7 percent, or $259 million, to 
$5.74 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also strengthened results by cutting overhead costs by 14.4  
percent, or $516 million, in the period. Roughly 20,000 employees, 
or more than 15 percent of its workforce, accepted an early 
retirement offer in 1999, nearly double the company's initial 
expectations when it announced the plan a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that their cost-cutting has been very  
successful in offsetting the slow revenue growth,'' said Frank 
Governali, an analyst with CS First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, AT&AMP;T's profit grew to $6.40 billion, or $3.55 a  
share, from $4.42 billion, or $2.47 a share in 1997. Revenue rose 
to $53.22 billion from $51.58 billion.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Killing Family of 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Police investigating the stranglings of  
a pregnant woman and her three children arrested a man believed to 
be the father of the unborn child on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Ivan DeLong, 34, of the nearby city of Joplin, was  
arrested Sunday afternoon and charged with five counts of 
first-degree murder -- including that of Erin Vanderhoef's 
40-week-old female fetus, who the medical examiner says would have 
been born healthy. Her mother planned to name her Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLong was being held without bond in the city jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators declined to speculate on a motive for the  
killings, which likely happened last Tuesday morning. Police said 
only that Ms. Vanderhoef, 36, and her three children -- Darlene, 8; 
Chris, 10; and Jimmy, 11 -- were strangled with a fabric or 
rope-like item. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found by a 16-year-old neighbor who had gone to  
the home to borrow a cup of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Vanderhoef's family and friends prepared for funeral  
services today, police continued to gather evidence to reconstruct 
events leading up to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have an awful lot of work to do to prepare the case  
for the prosecutor,'' Springfield Police Chief Lynn Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds came to a Springfield funeral home Sunday, filing past  
the five open caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they catch the person who did this and I hope they hurt  
them,'' said Phyllis Shields, who was there with a friend's 
daughter who went to school with Ms. Vanderhoef's children. ``That 
baby -- that little, tiny baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joplin is 70 miles southwest of Springfield.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Washington Newsman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alvin M. Silverman, who spent 35 years with  
The Cleveland Plain Dealer and eventually headed its Washington 
bureau, died Monday of heart failure in his Washington home. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 87.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bud'' Silverman was a native of Louisville, Ky., where his  
father played major league baseball. He grew up in Cleveland, where 
he sold newspapers as a young man before becoming a sportswriter 
for The Plain Dealer in 1930. In this position, he befriended 
then-high school track star Jesse Owens and followed the athlete to 
his gold medal performance at the Olympic Games in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman kept close ties with his hometown teams even after  
becoming a political reporter, traveling with the Cleveland Indians 
when they won the World Series in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	During his time at the paper, Silverman also served as political  
columnist, city editor and statehouse correspondent. He came to 
Washington in 1957 as a bureau chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed ``Silver'' by President John F. Kennedy, Silverman was  
among the reporters traveling with the president when Kennedy was 
assassinated in Dallas in November 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to create a public relations company, the  
Pearl-Silverman Agency, where he served as a consultant to a number 
of clients, particularly labor organizations. He also authored the 
1965 book, ``The American Newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and a daughter.  
Memorial services were planned for Thursday in Washington.

<HEADLINE> After Shooting 59, Duval Thinks Big  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- So he shot a 59. David Duval's talking  
about getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a scary thought for those on the PGA Tour who might  
have some notion of winning a tournament or two themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval provided one of those magic moments Sunday when he closed  
with a 59 to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. He compared his 
record-tying round to pitching a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's rarer. Only two other players in PGA Tour history  
reached 59 -- Al Geiberger in Memphis, Tenn., in 1977 and Chip Beck 
in Las Vegas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had 11 birdies, six pars and an eagle on the final hole to  
end the day at 13-under. The astonishing round carried him to 
victory after he began the day seven strokes off the lead. Steve 
Pate finished one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is 27 years old and has won nine times. However, he has  
yet to win a major and he's intent on changing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have told everybody before I certainly want to be the best  
at some point in my career, and if I am considered that now, I am 
flattered and excited,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still have to keep trying to improve. Got to keep trying  
to get better and try to add some U.S. Opens and PGAs and such to 
my resume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's nine wins have come in his last 28 tournaments,  
including a victory in his only other outing this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Mercedes Championships by nine shots this month, and  
he wound up both that event and the 90-hole Hope at 26-under. That 
makes him 56-under for two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	And the money is adding up. After setting a PGA Tour earnings  
record with $2,591,031 last year, he already has won $1,008,000 in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval acknowledges that his closing round over the 6,950-yard  
Arnold Palmer Course at PGA West was about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestling approach shots within a few feet of the pin most of the  
day, Duval made the turn with a 5-under 31. He then bettered that 
with a 28 on the back, finishing with an 8-foot eagle putt on No. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	His 10-footer on No. 14 was the longest birdie putt he made, and  
his longest par putt was from 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably can't play any better than that,'' he said. ``But  
overall, I hope I can still improve. That is one of my big goals 
still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first four days of the Hope, Duval was just one of the  
guys, with cards of 70, 71, 64 and 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played an exceptional round of golf, something that doesn't  
happen very often. I was way behind and in essence in a position 
that I couldn't win the golf tournament,'' he said. ``But as it 
turns out, I have to shoot 59 and I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 59 and the win didn't translate to No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	The world golf rankings released Monday in London had Tiger  
Woods remaining at No. 1, although Duval did move up one spot by 
winning the Hope. He got no points for his 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wins this week, he can't help but go to No. 1, whatever  
Tiger does,'' said Tony Greer, who administers the weekly rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was the only top-10 player in the Hope field, meaning he  
did not earn as many points as he could have. The field for this 
week's Phoenix Open -- which features Duval, Woods, Vijay Singh and 
Jim Furyk -- is much stronger.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Coach Tired of Feud Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It was about as close as Mike Shanahan, a master of  
self-control, comes to losing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three hours after his team's arrival at the Super Bowl, the  
Denver Broncos coach issued a warning to the media: Any more 
questions about his relationship with Atlanta Falcons coach Dan 
Reeves will be met with icy stares and testy retorts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first of six scheduled sessions with the media this week,  
Shanahan grew increasingly angry Sunday night when he was asked on 
three occasions about that rocky relationship. Shanahan, formerly 
the Broncos' offensive coordinator under Reeves, was fired by 
Reeves in January 1992 for alleged insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and Shanahan rehashed the issues separately last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Reeves apologized for stirring up bitter  
feelings about the longstanding feud with Shanahan and Broncos 
quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the apology, Shanahan said, ``I'm glad it's over.  
The emphasis should be on the players on our team, and as far as 
I'm concerned it's over with and we can get ready to play the Super 
Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Shanahan was asked if Reeves' comment a week ago caught  
him off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I'm not going to have a response this  
week,'' he said. ``It's over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when asked to elaborate on his comment last Thursday  
that he believed his relationship with Reeves was irreparably 
damaged, Shanahan snapped, ``Well, let me make this clear, maybe I 
didn't make this clear. What I'm talking about right now is about 
the Denver Broncos, or if you want to talk about the Atlanta 
Falcons. We're not going to get into my past relationship with Dan. 
We addressed that last week and now we move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Broncos were a happy bunch after their arrival at  
Fort Lauderdale International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But of the half dozen players who addressed the media at an  
interview session Sunday night, not one was heard to say the 
obligatory greeting, ``We're happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most, they expected to be here.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is why we worked so hard since last April,'' cornerback  
Ray Crockett said. ``We got here last year and won it, and that 
made us even hungrier to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are making their sixth Super Bowl appearance, but  
their first as defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Their team charter, with a Broncos logo and ``1998 AFC  
Champions'' emblazoned on the sides, arrived in warm, sunny 
weather, unlike the cool, rainy conditions earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few Broncos fans were on hand for the arrival at a remote  
area of the airport. The Broncos immediately boarded four buses and 
were escorted from the tarmac by Broward County sheriff's vehicles 
to their hotel, where more fans had already staked out the 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' first four Super Bowl trips -- after the 1977, 1986,  
1987 and 1989 seasons -- ended in losses, by increasingly large 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of those games, the Broncos were overmatched, and in  
those appearances during the '80s, Elway represented virtually 
their entire offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``John needed to pass for 500 yards in order for him to win  
those (last three) games against the Giants, Redskins and 49ers,'' 
Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``In essence, all the Broncos 
had on offense was John Elway, and he had to play way above even 
his own standards in order for the Broncos to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in their fifth trip, last year at San Diego, the Broncos  
brought a different package. Terrell Davis was a force at running 
back, preventing opponents from loading up against their star 
passer. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns, earning MVP  
honors, as the Broncos beat the favored Green Bay Packers 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Elway and Davis return to the Super Bowl in what likely  
will be the final game of Elway's brilliant 16-year career, a 
career that has seen him record more victories than any starting 
quarterback in NFL history (148) and join Dan Marino as the only 
50,000-yard passers in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 38-year-old Elway fading from the scene, Davis has  
taken center stage. He rushed for 2,008 yards this season -- only 
the fourth back in NFL history to reach the 2,000-yard plateau -- 
and was the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love for John to win the MVP if this is his last  
game, throwing for 400 yards or whatever,'' Sharpe said. ``But our 
bread and butter is Terrell.''

<HEADLINE> Coach Reeves Rattles Some Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After waiting 33 years to reach the Super Bowl, the  
Atlanta Falcons were embroiled in a small controversy as soon as 
their plane landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, in a show of respect for the team's older  
players, asked that Pro Bowlers and 10-year veterans be allowed to 
depart the chartered jet first after it arrived Sunday at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But receiver Terance Mathis, a Pro Bowl alternate and nine-year  
veteran, said it wasn't the appropriate time to give some players 
special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came this far as a team,'' he said. ``We should be treated  
as a team. No one is better than anyone else. The Super Bowl isn't 
about Pro Bowlers and 10-year vets. It's about 53 guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys getting off the plane first knew it was wrong. A  
lot of guys who were not getting off the plane first knew it was 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Robinson, a Pro Bowler and 14-year veteran, qualified to  
be one of the first players leaving the plane under the criteria 
put down by Reeves. He downplayed any hard feelings from those who 
had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all right,'' Robinson said. ``They'll get over it. It's  
only a de-planing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson noted that Reeves and his coaching staff also waited to  
leave the Delta jet, which arrived about 20 minutes late in Miami 
after a rousing sendoff by thousands of fans in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach is smart,'' the 35-year-old Robinson said. ``He let us  
get off first to show leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference held before Mathis spoke, Reeves did not  
discuss his arrangements for the airport arrival. He did apologize 
for stirring up bitter feelings last week when he discussed the 
longstanding feud with Denver coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't accomplish anything talking about it,'' Reeves  
said. ``I should be smart enough after 18 years in this business as 
a head coach that when people ask you a question, they're going to 
make more of it than you thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons seemed in good spirits when they left the plane,  
adorned on the inside with streamers, balloons and letters from 
schoolchildren. Many of the players gave the media a taste of their 
own scrutiny, carrying videocameras to record the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to emerge when the door opened was a flight  
attendant, holding a cluster of red-and-black balloons. Another 
Delta employee, wearing a Falcons T-shirt, performed the ``Dirty 
Bird,'' the team's arm-flapping touchdown dance at the top of the 
stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, hardly looking like a man who underwent heart bypass  
surgery six weeks ago, lugged two pieces of luggage down to the 
tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Tuggle gave a thumbs-up to the media, cordoned off behind  
orange-and-white barriers. Jamal Anderson held his right index 
finger in the air while his left hand grasped a camera. Morten 
Andersen, who kicked an overtime field goal to win the NFC 
championship, paused to wave as he came down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to stand there and enjoy the moment,'' said Andersen,  
playing in the Super Bowl for the first time in a 17-year career. 
``This is all new to me, so I just wanted to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been raining earlier in the day in south Florida, but the  
sun broke through the clouds and the temperature approached 80 
degrees when the Falcons touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great feeling,'' offensive tackle Bob Whitfield said.  
``You've got the warm weather and a beautiful city. We want to have 
a little fun the next two days, then it will be time to get to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves allowed the players to bring their families to the team  
hotel, hoping a comfortable atmosphere away from the field will 
translate into a victory next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to treat it as a family week,'' he said. ``The  
guys know what they have to do. We encouraged them not to bring 
young children, but it didn't exactly work out that way. We'll have 
to find a lot of baby sitters this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players didn't have a curfew for their first couple of  
nights in Miami. Three rookies -- Tim Dwight, Keith Brooking and 
Jose Portilla -- piled into a rented stretch limousine for a trip to 
trendy South Beach on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, the team buses took a detour on their way to airport  
to pass through an estimated 10,000 people who jammed Centennial 
Olympic Park. The crowd included Mayor Bill Campbell and Lt. Gov. 
Mark Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to see the city so excited,'' tight end O.J.  
Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl DeMaria of Roswell, Ga., drove 30 miles with his wife, two  
girls and dog to the downtown Atlanta park ``just so the kids could 
be part of the Super Bowl hoopla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, whose family has been season-ticket holders since the  
franchise was founded in 1966, admitted that he never thought he 
would see the Falcons in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son asked me that last year and it broke my heart to say to  
him that I didn't think they were ever going to make it,'' Taylor 
said. ``But I'm proud to be proved wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Survey Pinpoints American Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many low-income families worry about having  
enough to eat and paying the rent, though parents of all incomes 
read to their young children and kids across the board participate 
in extracurricular activities, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Survey of America's Families, released Monday by  
the Urban Institute, offers a baseline for future surveys that 
measure the effects of welfare reform. It was conducted in 13 
states that are home to more than half of the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found wide variations from state to state.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have always known that some amount of state variation  
exists, but seeing the degree of it raises a lot of questions when 
we're moving into an era when states have more authority over 
social programs,'' said Alan Weil, director of the Urban 
Institute's Assessing the New Federalism Project, which is 
monitoring the results of that increased state authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survey's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Overall, 12 percent of children were without health insurance.  
The figures ranged from 6 percent in Wisconsin to 21 percent in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in five children was poor, ranging from 11 percent in  
Wisconsin to 34 percent in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly half of low-income families worried about or had trouble  
affording food, compared to one in seven higher-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	--28 percent of all low-income parents said they had trouble  
paying mortgage, rent or utility bills. That ranged from 24 percent 
in Colorado to 39 percent in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Half of children born to unwed mothers were poor, compared to  
just 14 percent of children born to married parents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Three in four low-income parents regularly read to their  
children. For higher-income families, it was 90 percent. Parents in 
Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin were most likely 
to read to their kids. Least likely were parents in Texas and 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	--73 percent of low-income children participate in  
extracurricular activities, compared to 90 percent of higher-income 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey was conducted among 44,461 randomly  
selected households from February to November 1997. Families 
without telephones were provided with cellular phones for the 
interviews. Researchers paid particular attention to low-income 
families -- those with incomes below twice the poverty level, or 
$31,822 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
	States included were Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida,  
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New 
York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Bullet Trains' U.S. Future in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just about the first thing Jeb Bush did after  
being sworn in as governor of Florida was to kill plans for a 
high-speed train designed to rocket travelers between Orlando, 
Tampa and Miami at up to 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did he walk away from a project that Florida had  
already committed $28 million to, but Bush also put a chill on 
other high-speed rail projects elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day, the General Accounting Office told Congress  
that most of the 10 other high-speed corridors under development in 
the United States ``have not determined their funding sources'' -- a 
stop, look and listen warning for high speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 include the Gulf Coast, the Texas Triangle, Midwest  
corridors between Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and Minneapolis, plus 
similar tracks through California, the Southeast, upstate New York 
and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors concluded: ``These systems may be an effective  
alternative in corridors where travel is increasing and it is 
difficult to expand highway and airport capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, high-speed rail systems are costly, and thus  
ridership levels may not be high enough in the United States for 
systems to cover their costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exception is in the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak will  
begin operating 150-mph trains between Boston, New York and 
Washington in October. Amtrak expects its high-speed trains to help 
revive the financially strapped national railroad, as well as 
provide momentum for the proposed systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-speed rail is not just a metropolitan solution; it is a  
solution also for my part of the country,'' John Robert Smith, 
mayor of Meridien, Miss., and a member of Amtrak's board of 
directors, said last year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed trains are typical defined as those capable of  
traveling more than 125 mph. They achieve those speeds either with 
special tracks and locomotives or through technology allowing 
trains to tilt into existing curves. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, France and Germany, three nations with long rail  
histories, have taken the lead in developing such systems. When 
France opened its first TGV line between Paris and Lyon in the late 
1980s, the internal French airline, Air Inter, had to cut back on 
its service because the 180-mph TGV was faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, when a 175-mph InterCity Express train crashed near  
Eschede, Germany, killing 101 people, it was a blow to the national 
psyche. The trains were viewed as a symbol of German innovation and 
over their 10-year history had become an integral part of the 
country's travel network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida project was to have mirrored such foreign  
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a deal in 1996 with Florida  
Overland eXpress, a private consortium. It planned to run 
French-designed trains on new tracks that would cross existing 
obstacles with underpasses and overpasses, instead of traditional 
grade crossings. The project carried a price tag of up to $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush questioned the projected ridership and whether the routes  
might lead to unwelcome development around the Everglades. His 
biggest concern, though, was money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are better alternatives for $70 million per year  
compounded at 4 percent,'' the newly elected governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Chettle, spokeswoman for the Washington-based High Speed  
Ground Transportation Association, said Bush's decision shows why 
if high-speed rail is to spread across the United States, it will 
have to be done in increments. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, that means straightening track curves, rebuilding  
existing stations and buying trains with higher top speeds -- 
exactly what Amtrak is doing in the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to set lawmakers at ease, because it is not the big  
chunk of money they so often see advertised. It may not be the 
wisest use of money and actually lead to higher costs, but it seems 
to be the most palatable,'' Chettle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department is encouraging the approach by  
designating routes as ``high-speed rail corridors,'' making them 
eligible for special development money. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater is traveling to the Midwest this week to make such a 
designation for the line between Chicago and Indianapolis. Amtrak 
currently makes one run a day between the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the GAO's dire assessment, rail advocates believe  
high-speed trains can flourish in the United States, given the 
right approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is not really all or nothing,''  
said Amtrak spokesman John Wolf. ``If you use an incremental 
approach and build on existing rights of way in partnership with 
states and private businesses and freight railroads, we believe it 
will work.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils $128M Reading Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore stressed the importance  
of reading skills and called for continued federal participation in 
scientific research and development during his visit to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reading is more than a source of pleasure and pride. It is a  
vital tool for success,'' Gore said Sunday as he announced a $128 
million program to help youngsters learn to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the excitement about the information superhighway comes  
to naught if someone is unable to read,'' he said. ``A child can 
turn on the computer and point and click and connect to the 
Internet, but the screen might as well be dark if that child is not 
able to read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child literacy proposal includes $26 million for the Reading  
Excellence Act, which will make local grants available for reading 
improvement, and $50 million for a program that targets reading 
problems in the youngest children, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came during Gore's two-day tour through  
California. The pledge also comes as the state's new Democratic 
Gov. Gray Davis pushes a new slate of similar education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was scheduled to appear today in Sacramento and San  
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was part of a push to put volunteers from the  
national service program AmeriCorps in three San Diego schools that 
have between 64 percent and 94 percent Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning today, corps members will start a new literacy program  
that provides tutoring, home visits and classrooms for children who 
need help with their reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said schools nationwide need attention, from more teachers  
and smaller class sizes to upgraded buildings and equipment. But 
the most important skill for any child is learning to read well by 
the end of the third grade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke Sunday to a crowd of educators, parents and  
AmeriCorps volunteers after reading to children who earned the 
privilege to visit him by having perfect attendance. He made no 
reference to President Clinton's ongoing impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, while attending the American Association for the  
Advancement of Science in Anaheim, Gore said the federal government 
must support research not only for specific applied needs, but 
``the government should also support rigorous research even when we 
don't know where it will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He announced a $366 million high-tech appropriation and a  
proposed $2.4 billion research tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Technological advances must not come at the expense of ``the  
most cherished values of our nation,'' he said. ``As genetic 
science maps the blueprint of lives, it may open a Pandora's box of 
ethical concerns. Some of these concerns are absurd, but some are 
not receiving the attention they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research and development should be used ``to end suffering, to  
eradicate diseases and promote the freedom to educate our children 
and lives for our families and our nation,'' the vice president 
said. ``We haven't a moment to waste.''

<HEADLINE> Byrd Introduces Motion To Dismiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators from both parties struggled with  
the question of calling witnesses, a senior Democrat today 
introduced a motion asking the Senate to dismiss the perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges against President Clinton and end 
his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors immediately opposed the request from Sen.  
Robert Byrd, D-W.V., saying that dismissing the charges without 
calling witnesses would be ``inconsistent with the constitutional 
standards and harmful to the institutions of our government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., told the senators that the White  
House arguments -- that Clinton's offenses in concealing an affair 
with Monica Lewinsky didn't rise to the level of high crimes and 
misdemeanors -- ``will debase and degrade the institution of the 
presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to consider the harm he caused, the indignity he  
brought to the institution of the presidency,'' Canady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Byrd made his plea, Republican Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., declared he had enough GOP votes to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the votes, I believe, not to dismiss it at this  
point,'' Lott said. ``I think that is a short-circuiting of the 
process that would not be fair. The American people would not agree 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Republicans summarily rejected a plan that would have  
brought the trial to an end on Friday with no witnesses. The White 
House criticized the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said senators would vote Tuesday or Wednesday on the more  
difficult issue of whether to allow House prosecutors to call 
witnesses. As both sides met in private, Lott declined to predict 
the outcome of that later floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecution team, meanwhile, eliminated from its  
potential witness list a number of women mentioned in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case. Among those dropped: Kathleen Willey, 
who accused the president of making a sexual advance near the Oval 
Office. Former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris also was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	One House official, speaking only on condition of anonymity,  
said the prosecutors may ask for only three witnesses: Monica 
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and one of three others -- presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan, White House aides Sidney Blumenthal and John 
Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	With all 45 Democratic senators united in opposition to  
witnesses, one Republican senator conceded there could be enough 
GOP defections to defeat the plan. Republicans hold a 55-45 
majority in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote  
for witnesses,'' Smith said on CNN. ``I think there is reason to 
wonder whether or not the votes are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel on  
Sunday, and her attorney said afterward she had provided no 
information not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
One of her lawyers made clear today she does not want to testify 
from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered every question they asked,'' attorney Jacob Stein  
said. She now wants to avoid being used in ``what cannot be 
anything but an unseemly circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled to debate two rival motions beginning  
today -- one sought by Democrats to dismiss the charges, the other 
sought by the House prosecutors to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle told reporters of an ``alternative  
scenario'' that would scrap those two votes. He set out a schedule 
for final arguments and Senate deliberations that would culminate 
in a vote on the articles of impeachment themselves on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were to have been granted two hours later  
today to offer a formal rebuttal to the White House's defense 
arguments, and each side was to have had time for closing arguments 
on Tuesday. Then Wednesday and Thursday were to have been set aside 
for deliberations of the articles, with votes on Friday. Some 
Democrats also said they wanted provisions for censuring the 
president immediately after the articles of impeachment were voted 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of the alternative wasn't completely clear. Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he and GOP Sen. Slade Gorton had 
discussed the idea late last week. Separately, Democrats said they 
had handed it to Lott late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., opposed the  
idea. ``It is a step by step process that should not be ended 
before the time is right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., countered: ``There's a feeling  
that if the House managers have their way we're never going to get 
a bipartisan conclusion.'' And that conclusion, he said, is what 
both parties are determined to achieve, especially given the 
ferocity of the partisanship that gripped the House during its 
portion of the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came against the backdrop of a widely held  
belief that Clinton will win acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. A 
two-thirds vote would be required to convict and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the topic dominated the TV interview programs on  
Sunday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Grams, R-Minn., sounding a position held by most  
conservative Republicans, said he would be inclined to vote for 
witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were meeting today to finalize their witness  
list and submit it to the Senate. Among the names they were 
considering were Ms. Lewinsky, Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and possibly former presidential 
political adviser Dick Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to  
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that the former White House intern resisted and that Senate 
Democrats denounced as an act of desperation. A judge order Ms. 
Lewinsky to undergo the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts for the former intern.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Posts 58 Percent Profit rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. today reported a 58 percent rise in  
fourth-quarter profit, benefiting from cost cuts and strong demand 
for its mobile-phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit increase, which matched Wall Street forecasts, came  
despite another drop in the telecommunications giant's 
long-distance phone sales, which continue to be hit by competition 
from lower-cost providers of service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it earned $2.0 billion, or $1.12 a share on a diluted  
basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That was up from a profit 
of $1.26 billion, or 70 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 4.8 percent to $13.53 billion from $12.90 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said revenue from wireless services grew 25 percent to $302  
million amid a big response to its new Digital One Rate promotion, 
a pricing package that charges users from 11 cents to 15 cents a 
minute, no matter where they are calling from. AT&AMP;T signed more 
than 850,000 Digital One subscribers since introducing the plan 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from business services, which includes long-distance and  
data transmission services, grew 4.7 percent to $259 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But revenues from consumer services, most of which is  
long-distance phone sales, fell 3.6 percent to $5.54 billion as the 
company moved more customers off its traditional calling plans to 
packages that charge less per phone call but generate less revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, AT&AMP;T's profit grew to $6.40 billion, or $3.55 a  
diluted share, from a profit of $4.42 billion, or $2.47 a diluted 
share in 1997. Revenue rose to $53.22 billion from $51.58 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Dragging Death Jury To Be Picked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A black man was dragged to his death behind  
a pickup truck and his shredded body was left outside a black 
cemetery ``as some form of a message,'' a prosecutor told 
prospective jurors Monday in the case's first murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray briefly outlined  
the details of James Byrd Jr.'s death as defendant John William 
King buried his head in his hands at the mention of the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Byrd at the time he was chained at the back of the  
pickup truck was alive,'' Gray said. ``Not only was he alive, he 
was conscious at that time, and he was using his elbows and his 
body in every way he could to keep his head and shoulders away from 
the pavement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray described how the body, ``swinging out right and left like  
a boat pulling a skier,'' slammed into a culvert, shearing off 
Byrd's head and shoulder after he had been dragged by a chain for 
several miles on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing shocked the nation and the world, drawing new focus  
to racial crimes. There were gatherings in the town of 8,000 of the 
Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, an unemployed construction worker and avowed white  
supremacist, is the first of three men to be tried. The murder 
trials of Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, 
haven't been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	King was described as the ringleader. In place of shackles, he  
sat attentively with a 50,000-volt electric belt tied around his 
waist as Gray spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, King could be sentenced to life in prison or  
lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	King denies killing Byrd, saying he stood by as Berry committed  
the murder over a soured drug deal. Byrd's blood was found on the 
shoes of all three suspects, and other personal items and DNA 
samples found at the scene implicate the three, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray told possible jurors that the 49-year-old Byrd was  
intoxicated after attending a party the night of his death. He was 
walking home when the three men picked him up. They drove to a 
remote area northeast of Jasper in East Texas and, after a scuffle, 
Byrd wound up chained to the back of the truck, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray noted that while the body could have been dumped anywhere  
on the numerous logging roads in the area and remained missing for 
weeks or months, ``they chose to take that body and leave that body 
in front of a black cemetery, as some form of a message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of 12 jurors and two alternates will be selected.  
Attorneys expect testimony to take six to eight days.

<HEADLINE> $3 Billion Sought for New Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, concerned about  
security shortcomings at U.S. diplomatic missions, is expected to 
seek $3 billion for the construction of new embassies between 2001 
and 2005, a senior official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the figure was arrived at before a State  
Department-appointed panel recommended earlier this month that $14 
billion be spent over 10 years to overcome security deficiencies. 
The panel was appointed after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in 
East Africa last August. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how many new embassies would be built if  
Congress goes along with the administration request, which is 
expected to be part of the budget proposal President Clinton is 
expected to announce Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The official panel, directed by Retired Adm. William Crowe,  
concluded there was a ``collective failure'' of a succession of 
administrations and congresses to invest enough resources in 
protecting U.S. diplomatic missions. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,  
Congress approved $1.4 million in emergency funds to rebuild these 
embassies and to upgrade security at 250 overseas missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who asked not to be identified, said $250 million  
is needed to meet recurring costs caused by security upgrades.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Posts 27 Percent Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest banking  
company, posted a fourth-quarter operating profit that beat Wall 
Street's expectations even though it was 27 percent below results a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Steep declines in Latin America and investment banking offset  
strong performance in credit cards and consumer lending. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's profits totaled $1.4 billion, or 60 cents a share,  
topping analysts' average estimate of 56 cents a share. The New 
York financial services company reported operating income of $1.9 
billion, or 80 cents a share, in the fourth quarter 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating numbers released today don't include one-time  
charges related to the merger between Citibank and Travelers Group, 
as well severance costs for the elimination of 10,400 jobs 
announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Including those expenses, Citigroup posted net income of $677  
million, or 28 cents a share, down from $1.4 billion, or 59 cents a 
share, for the last three months of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, who share the titles of  
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement said the bank 
had made substantial progress since Citibank and Travelers combined 
their operations three months ago, but said they are not satisfied 
with the company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to achieving significantly higher levels of  
profitability in 1999 and beyond through a combination of business 
growth, stringent expense control, and continued reduction of risk 
exposure,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's stock rose quickly after the opening bell on the New  
York Stock Exchange, and was up $1.06 1/4 at $52.68 3/4 a share in early 
afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, said expenses rose faster than revenues in  
the quarter because of the $650 million needed to fix the Year 2000 
bugs in its computers, as well as changes to its foreign currency 
department to handle the euro, the new, single European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America was also a trouble spot for Citigroup. Profits  
from the area were cut by almost half because of a drop in business 
at Credicard, its Brazilian card affiliate, together with weaker 
credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's Internet banking division, e-Citi, is still losing  
money. In the last three months of 1998, e-Citi lost $43 million as 
the company spent heavily to perfect its technology and increase 
its customer research. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, the New York-based bank reported operating  
profits of $6.3 billion, or $2.66 a share, compared with $7.8 
billion, or $3.18 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time charges, net income totaled $5.8 billion,  
or $2.43 a share, down from $6.7 billion, or $2.74 a share in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Existing Home Sales Soar in Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes soared 13.5 percent in  
1998 to 4.78 million, riding low mortgage rates and American 
prosperity to the best year on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales easily surpassed the previous record, 4.21 million, set  
the previous year, the National Association of Realtors said today. 
The group began tracking sales in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, sales rose 3.1 percent from the month before to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.03 million, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong buying demand pushed the inventory of homes for sale,  
1.58 million, to a record low level -- a 3.8 month supply at the 
December sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuous low interest rates and the healthy economy have  
created a steady flow of buyers moving up to second and third 
homes, and they feel comfortable doing so because there are so many 
first-time buyers in a solid position to buy,'' said Realtors 
President Sharon A. Millett. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have remained  
below 7 percent since mid-June, the longest stretch at such a low 
level in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, last year's unemployment rate, at 4.5 percent, was the  
lowest in 29 years. Plus, strong stock market gains have supplied 
many well-off Americans with the werewithal to buy a larger home or 
vacation house. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists expect home sales to remain strong this year, though  
at something less than 1998's record. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong sale propelled a healthy increase in the value of  
many homes. The median price of an existing home last year, meaning 
half sold for more and half for less, was $130,600, up 5.2 percent 
from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, sales in December were strongest in the West, up 4.9  
percent to an annual rate of 1.07 million. In the Midwest, sales 
increased 4.8 percent to a rate of 1.30 million units; in the 
Northeast, 3 percent to a rate of 690,000, and, in the South, 1 
percent to 1.97 million units.

<HEADLINE>  Bodies of 5 Kosovo Albanians Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAKOVINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bullet-riddled bodies of five  
more ethnic Albanians -- two of them children -- were found Monday, 
fueling tensions at a time when diplomats admit being stymied about 
how to end the crisis in Kosovo peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, two boys and one woman appeared to have been shot  
at close range on a tractor-trailer that was returning from a 
cornfield off the main road through Rakovina, a village 35 miles 
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The grisly discoveries came 10 days after 45 ethnic Albanians  
were allegedly massacred in the Kosovo village of Racak. The Racak 
slaughter was the highest toll since government troops ambushed and 
killed 36 Kosovo Albanians as they tried to illegally cross the 
border Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials have renewed the threat of airstrikes, saying the  
likelihood of allied military action was real unless the Yugoslav 
government halts its crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest evidence of stepped-up preparations, the French  
Navy said the aircraft carrier Foch was leaving Toulon on Monday 
for the Adriatic Sea. It was expected to be in place by early 
Wednesday, the Navy said, and ready to participate in strikes on 
Serb and Yugoslav targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians form about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million  
people, and the vast majority favor independence. More than 2,000 
people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed since Yugoslav 
and Serb forces launched an offensive against Kosovo separatists 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
	International peace monitors told reporters they discovered the  
bodies of the five ethnic Albanians shortly after sunrise while 
conducting a routine patrol near Rakovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies identified by locals as a husband and his wife were  
found slumped in the cab of the tractor. Half the man's head was 
blown away. Empty shell casings littered the ground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	On the trailer, piled with hay and grain, lay the bodies of a  
father and his two sons, about 10 and 12 years old. The faces of 
all three were disfigured beyond recognition. All five were wearing 
civilian clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman of the international monitors, said it  
appeared the victims had been shot with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, quoting  
unidentified local residents, said Serb police fired at the victims 
from an armored vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Serb Media Center claimed the village was  
controlled by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for 
independence from Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb center also reported that separatists ambushed a police  
patrol Monday 15 miles west of Pristina. Police returned fire and 
wounded one attacker, who was taken to a hospital in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Finnish forensic team investigating the  
Jan. 15 slayings in Racak said the team would not release its 
findings until it completes its report in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Helena Ranta said it was too early to tell when the team would  
finish its work in Pristina, where it is examining 40 of the 45 
bodies found in a gully in the southern Kosovo village. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, admitted  
Monday that diplomats are running out of ideas for peace after both 
Serb and ethnic Albanian politicians rejected a series of American 
proposals for the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are heading to a situation where we have to come up  
with some very good ideas, strong ideas and to see some rapid 
implementation,'' Hill told reporters after meeting the leading 
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova. ``We cannot allow this 
process to go on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, foreign ministers from the European Union  
focused on Kosovo at their regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the breaches in the cease-fire and we want to  
avoid the potential of future atrocities,'' British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to achieve first is that people on the ground  
abandon violence,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of 
Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Brussels, ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations met  
Monday to work on a two-pronged plan that prepared for airstrikes 
while seeking a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	A foreign ministers' meeting of the Contact Group -- Britain,  
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- is expected 
by week's end, possibly in London.

government halts its crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest evidence of stepped-up preparations, the French  
Navy said the aircraft carrier Foch was leaving Toulon on Monday 
for the Adriatic Sea. It was expected to be in place by early 
Wednesday, the Navy said, and ready to participate in strikes on 
Serb and Yugoslav targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians form about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million  
people, and the vast majority favor independence. More than 2,000 
people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed since Yugoslav 
and Serb forces launched an offensive against Kosovo separatists 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
	International peace monitors told reporters they discovered the  
bodies of the five ethnic Albanians shortly after sunrise while 
conducting a routine patrol near Rakovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies identified by locals as a husband and his wife were  
found slumped in the cab of the tractor. Half the man's head was 
blown away. Empty shell casings littered the ground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	On the trailer, piled with hay and grain, lay the bodies of a  
father and his two sons, about 10 and 12 years old. The faces of 
all three were disfigured beyond recognition. All five were wearing 
civilian clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman of the international monitors, said it  
appeared the victims had been shot with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, quoting  
unidentified local residents, said Serb police fired at the victims 
from an armored vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Serb Media Center claimed the village was  
controlled by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for 
independence from Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb center also reported that separatists ambushed a police  
patrol Monday 15 miles west of Pristina. Police returned fire and 
wounded one attacker, who was taken to a hospital in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of a Finnish forensic team investigating the  
Jan. 15 slayings in Racak said the team would not release its 
findings until it completes its report in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Helena Ranta said it was too early to tell when the team would  
finish its work in Pristina, where it is examining 40 of the 45 
bodies found in a gully in the southern Kosovo village. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, admitted  
Monday that diplomats are running out of ideas for peace after both 
Serb and ethnic Albanian politicians rejected a series of American 
proposals for the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are heading to a situation where we have to come up  
with some very good ideas, strong ideas and to see some rapid 
implementation,'' Hill told reporters after meeting the leading 
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova. ``We cannot allow this 
process to go on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, foreign ministers from the European Union  
focused on Kosovo at their regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the breaches in the cease-fire and we want to  
avoid the potential of future atrocities,'' British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to achieve first is that people on the ground  
abandon violence,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of 
Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Brussels, ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations met  
Monday to work on a two-pronged plan that prepared for airstrikes 
while seeking a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	A foreign ministers' meeting of the Contact Group -- Britain,  
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- is expected 
by week's end, possibly in London.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Symphony Conductor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Robert Shaw didn't believe he had a great voice.  
But in directing others' voices, he became great. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, the longtime Atlanta Symphony conductor who elevated  
choral directing to an art, died Monday following a stroke. He was 
82. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't many men who can influence the whole world in any  
one particular field,'' said Martin Sauser, Shaw's longtime first 
violin, who also was concert and orchestra manager for 15 years in 
Atlanta. ``And I don't know anyone that has influenced any field as 
Robert Shaw has influenced the world in choral performing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw died in New Haven, Conn., where he had been to see a play  
that was his youngest son's senior acting and directing project at 
Yale University. He suffered the stroke during the performance 
Saturday night, said Meredith Harris, spokeswoman for the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw first gained fame as conductor of the Robert Shaw Chorale,  
which he founded in the late '40s. He also held posts at the San 
Diego Symphony and Cleveland Orchestra. He was appointed music 
director and conductor of the Atlanta Symphony in 1967, keeping the 
post until his retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shaw won one of the 1991 Kennedy Center Honors, center  
chairman James D. Wolfensohn called him ``the dean of American 
choral conducting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Shaw was a most respected and loved colleague who changed  
the level of choral conducting forever in the United States,'' 
violinist Isaac Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Atlanta Symphony president Allison Vulgamore: ``This is a  
profoundly sad day for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the music 
world. Mr. Shaw was quite simply the world's greatest choral 
conductor and Atlanta's national treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw began his career as a baritone, but rarely sang once he  
became a conductor, saying ``they tell me I grunt sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was probably best known for his arrangement of Beethoven's  
Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1981, Shaw was preparing to rehearse the piece for  
the 20th or 30th time. He was asked if it would be a chore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel ... this could be the last time I ever get to do  
this piece,'' he said. ``It's like speaking before the United 
States Senate or reading an Irish poem for William Butler Yeats. 
Any time you do this piece, it's an event. And it's a major 
event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw won 14 Grammy awards, and his latest album, with works from  
Barber, Bartok and Vaughan Williams, had been nominated for a 1999 
Grammy for classical album. Last year, he was inducted into the 
American Classical Music Hall of Fame in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped transform the symphony from a part-time amateur  
ensemble of 60 players with an annual budget of about $500,000 to a 
93-member orchestra with a $12 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw is also known for taking choruses -- which generally did  
popular music -- into the classical and religious fields in the '50s 
and '60s with the Robert Shaw Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a fourth-generation Californian, began singing in church  
choirs. His father was a minister whose five children were born in 
different towns during five pastorates. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include three sons, Peter, John and Thomas; a  
daughter, Johanna Shaw; a stepson; a sister; and a brother.

<HEADLINE> 1st U.S. Hand Transplant Performed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A man whose left hand was blown off while  
playing with a powerful firecracker 13 years ago received the first 
hand transplant in the United States. Hours later, the new hand was 
pink and warm. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 1/2-hour surgery, completed Monday morning, was the second  
such transplant ever. But doctors cautioned that the patient, 
Matthew David Scott, had a high risk of blood clots and other 
complications in the first 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There is as much as a 50 percent chance the hand will be  
rejected in the next year, forcing Scott to take powerful 
anti-rejection drugs that suppress the immune system and increase 
the risk of infection, cancer and death. Scar tissue could develop, 
snagging the spliced tendons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real battle and unknown starts now,'' said Dr. Warren C.  
Breidenbach, who led the surgical team at Jewish Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Breidenbach said first signs were good for Scott, 37. The  
``hookup'' of veins and arteries had worked, providing blood for 
the hand to turn pink. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was delighted. When bandages are pulled back and the hand  
is revealed, ``he stares at it and grins,'' his friend James Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, a paramedic, lost his dominant hand in a Dec. 23, 1985,  
blast from an M-80, which resembles a firecracker but is far more 
powerful. M-80s have been illegal in the United States since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott got a prosthetic hand and resumed working. In 1990, he was  
named National Paramedic of the Year by Emergency Medical Services 
magazine, said Tom Starr, director of the Mobile Intensive Care 
Unit at Virtua Health, where Scott now oversees paramedic training 
in southern New Jersey. He also is assistant director of the School 
of Paramedic Science at Camden County College. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors have questioned the risks of transplanting a  
non-vital organ such as a hand. Breidenbach said Scott was chosen 
because he had not adapted well to his artificial hand and is 
intelligent, articulate and has plenty of support from his family, 
which includes his wife and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview videotaped before his surgery, Scott said that  
with his artificial hand he lived in fear of going through buffet 
lines and handling food at parties. Nor was he able to show his 
sons how to play baseball, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been the little things -- the daily little  
things,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Scott can only hope to gain limited use of the  
transplanted hand -- able to pick up objects but unable to button 
his shirt, Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to get fairly good flexation and extension  
-- not complete -- and some sensation, but not normal,'' Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	People with prosthetic hands also are unable to perform such  
fine motor tasks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France, in  
September on Clint Hallam, a New Zealand man who lost part of his 
right arm in a prison sawing accident in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jon William Jones Jr., an organ rejection expert who  
assisted Breidenbach, said Hallam has shown no sign of rejecting 
his donor hand and has passed the period in which 90 percent of 
rejections occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's operation began at 3:30 p.m. Sunday and was completed  
about 6 a.m. Monday. The hospital refused to disclose any 
information about the donor or how long he had been dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery required joining the cadaver hand a bit above  
wristwatch level with Scott's arm. The surgeons had to join the 
bones, clamping them together with metal plates and screws. Tendons 
were attached and gently tugged to make sure they would cause 
fingers to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerves were joined next, then arteries and veins.  
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons for years have been able to reattach severed limbs  
following accidents, but they had never been able to successfully 
transfer a limb from a dead donor to a living recipient. At least 
one attempt at a hand transplant occurred in South America in 1964, 
but the patient's body rejected the hand within two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Company Signs $725 M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A leading Turkish holding company has  
bought a majority stake in Petromidia oil refinery for $725 
million, making one of the biggest single investments in 
post-communist Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	Akmaya Sanayi Ve Ticaret purchased 65 percent of Petromidia,  
which is located in the Black Sea port of Constanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania has 10 major oil refineries, built under former  
communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, which produce some 34 million 
tons of oil per year. Petromidia was built in 1979 and has an 
annual capacity of 4.8 million tons of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's transaction, the state owned 69 percent of the  
refinery, while the remaining 31 percent was held by a 
private-public investment fund and the public. Akmaya's 65 percent 
stake is part of the government share. 
</P>
<P>
	Akmaya holds assets in a range of companies, including steel  
makers, communications, banking, finance and insurance. It also 
wholly owns Turkey's Sumer Bank. The purchase of the refinery is 
Akmaya's third investment in Romania.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Want Samaranch To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch's ouster of six IOC members  
left many newspapers around the world calling for one more head: 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	European papers Monday were particularly critical of the  
International Olympic Committee president's moves to clean up the 
largest corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The response of the Dutch newspaper Trouw was typical. In a  
front-page editorial, it said it was ``brazen of Samaranch to stay 
put. It means that a nasty odor still clings to the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Samaranch found little support in northern  
Europe, although the criticism was lighter in his native Spain and 
neighboring France. 
</P>
<P>
	One telling headline came in Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport:  
``Samaranch, it's not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, home to six of the nine IOC members who have resigned  
or been expelled, there was scant coverage, with suggestions that 
African and Latin American IOC members had been made scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
	``High on a hill, lofty ideals are exposed as low farce,'' said  
London's The Independent in a front-page headline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Betrayal of Olympic ideal,'' read The Times front page.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Great Olympic Gravy Train has hit the buffers and, not  
surprisingly, just three of the nine people ... have volunteered to 
get off,'' wrote The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``So Ben Johnson is not the most debased symbol of athletics.  
The worst culprits hide behind tinted glass and security cordons in 
Lausanne,'' according to The Daily Telegraph. ``Juan Antonio 
Samaranch's dysfunctional Olympic family cannot be trusted to purge 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Samaranch should resign,'' headlined Norway's largest daily  
Verdens Gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has exposed itself. The organization is rotten. That  
is something Samaranch can't run away from,'' the newspaper said in 
an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has to cut deeper,'' said Brussels' La Libre Belgique.  
</P>
<P>
	``A good part of the 113 IOC members translate the slogan  
Altius, Citius, Fortius'' as ``money, free holidays, brothel 
visits,'' said Belgium's De Standaard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sune Sylven, writing in Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet, injected  
some sarcasm. ``Some things take time. For example, the 
International Olympic Committee let 105 years go by before 
establishing an ethics committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch got little support in Switzerland. But in Lausanne,  
home of the IOC, the Le Matin headline offered some comfort: ``The 
IOC is dead, long live the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Samaranch, Resign'' said the front page of the Tribune de  
Geneve. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all that has happened during his time in office since  
1980, marked by uncompromising striving for power and profit, 
Samaranch doesn't seem entirely the right person to push through a 
real change,'' said an editorial in the Basler Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did find some calm home in his native Barcelona with  
hometown La Vanguardia largely supportive of his pledge to reform 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samaranch has taken the games to heights of popularity and  
world projection. It is therefore logical ... that what has 
happened would hurt him. And it is also logical that he personally 
commits himself to pushing reform forward,'' La Vanguardia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madrid-based daily El Pais was more critical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from corrupt individuals ... the IOC is an anachronistic  
body that requires urgent reform,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most of Europe, French dailies played down the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	In some quarters in France, Samaranch was criticized -- not for  
his failure to resign -- but for the six expulsions. In an interview 
Sunday on French radio, French Olympic president Henri Serandour 
termed the six as ``scapegoats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Africa is the center of the scandal, but coverage there was  
light -- and almost nonexistent in the Middle East with 
Arabic-language papers carrying small stories deep inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the scandal is unimportant mainly because they  
see it as the problem of wealthier, more influential nations,'' 
said Ivorian journalist Sanogo Abdoul-Bakary. ``Most Africans see 
themselves far removed from the world of big-time international 
sports. Africa has never hosted an Olympic games. Soccer to most 
people is a far more relevant sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The sanctions focus on Africans and South Americans, so that  
amounts to punishing the weak. I wish the sanctions would hit the 
corrupters as well,'' said Imana Ingulu, a journalist from the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo who lives in exile in Brazzaville.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns signed four free agents Monday,  
including Rex Chapman and Clifford Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, entering his third season with the Suns, signed a  
six-year contract. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year veteran led the team last season with a 15.9-point  
average and 120 3-pointers, 19th in the NBA. Chapman played in 68 
games and also averaged 2.5 rebounds, 3 assists and 33.3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, returning for his second season in Phoenix, signed a  
one-year deal. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Robinson finished third on the team in scoring (14  
points per game) and second in blocks (1.13). 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifford was willing to sign a one-year deal to allow the Suns  
the necessary flexibility to assemble the best possible team and at 
the same time maximize his potential and provide flexibility for 
the future,'' said Robinson's agent Brad Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Chapman and Robinson, the Suns signed two  
first-year players, Pat Garrity and Gerald Brown.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Kicks Off 2000 Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley opened his  
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination Monday, saying 
his life story and political philosophy make him a better candidate 
than frontrunner Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a life before I got into politics and a life after I  
left the Senate,'' said the Hall of Fame basketball player who 
resigned from the Congress in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley declared, ``I am not really running against Al Gore,''  
but the former New Jersey lawmaker repeatedly drew subtle 
distinctions between himself and the vice president, the son of a 
Tennessee senator who entered politics at a young age and rarely 
wandered far from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been a part of the partisanship that has shaped the  
debate the last couple years,'' he said, trying to position himself 
as an anti-Washington Democrat despite his 18 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be better able to attract independents and Republicans in  
a general election,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the remarks at brief news conference on the first day of  
a three-day swing across New Hampshire, the site of the nation's 
first presidential primary a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley kept to intimate settings where his soft-spoken charm  
and star appeal warmed audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	At a program for high school dropouts, pregnant 17-year-old  
Carmen Velazquez broke into tears as she explained why she left 
school. Bradley unfolded his 6-foot-5 frame from a tiny chair, 
leaned across a rickety wood table and gently touched her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for your courage in sharing that,'' Bradley said in  
a poignant exchange that invoked memories of then-Arkansas Gov. 
Bill Clinton stirring audiences in New Hampshire eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's schedule included a visit to a local boy's club where  
Bradley planned to dust off his famous jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	While off to a good start, Bradley still has a long way to go to  
defeat Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president enjoys the support of President Clinton,  
stands to benefit from a booming economy and has already lined up 
most of the party's top elected officials, activists and donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley is respected, he may be outgunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I view New Hampshire as a foregone conclusion,'' said New  
Jersey consultant Harold Hodes, a former Bradley backer who now 
supports Gore. ``This is something Bradley should have done six 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not broke, don't fix it,'' said New Hampshire activist  
Kris Durmer, another Gore backer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bradley has a sports hero's glow, a solid record and a  
devoted following of activists -- many of whom owe him their 
political careers. Gore and Bradley backers alike say the race is 
not in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has been here a lot, he's very likable and  
has the support of many top activists in the state but ... that's 
just 100 votes and he needs a lot more than that,'' said Mary Rauh, 
who unsuccessfully ran for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There also may be a big anti-Washington vein for Bradley to tap.  
Though few mentioned the Monica Lewinsky investigation 
specifically, several state Democrats said they're tired of the 
partisan tone in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think having the vice president come in would change  
anything,'' said Jim Gilmour, 53, sipping coffee at a Keene, N.H., 
bagel shop. 
</P>
<P>
	State party chairman Jeff Woodburn, who is leaving his post next  
month, has endorsed Gore. His replacement, Kathy Sullivan, says 
Bradley entered the race about as late as a challenger can. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are still ``second and third circle'' activists  
on the market, but Gore has taken most of the top-tier talent. 
</P>
<P>
	After developing an anti-Gore message and raising money, Bradley  
still must mend fences with Democrats who took it personally when 
he left the Senate saying politics was broken and that neither 
party ``speaks to the people where they live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley served in the Senate after a 10-year career in the  
National Basketball Association. An academic and athletic standout 
at Princeton, Bradley was a Rhodes Scholar before turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said one reason he would make a better candidate than  
Gore is they have ``different personal histories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on the road for 30 years as a senator, a basketball  
player, a writer and a lecturer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, Bradley earned a reputation as a big-thinking  
moderate Democrat, a champion of tax reform, child nutrition 
programs and the Superfund cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He toyed with running for president in 1988 and 1992 but was  
twice gunshy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley promised not to accept political action committee  
donations or establish ``sham'' state fund-raising operations, but 
he declined to criticize Gore for fund-raising discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll respond to Senator Bradley,'' Gore  
spokesman Chris Lehane said in California, where the vice president 
was campaigning.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Kicks Off 2000 Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- With a flick of his Hall of Fame wrist,  
Bill Bradley launched the ball in a gentle arc toward the basket. 
Thud! It missed, a boy's club clanker, followed by two more errant 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Thud! Thud! Bradley kept shooting until his final three throws  
ripped through the net with a tell-tale swish! 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while to warm up,'' Bradley said, yanking at the  
sport coat sleeves that had ridden above his elbows during Monday's 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of basketball and out of politics in recent years, the  
former New Jersey senator is warming up for his challenge to Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	If his first day on the campaign trail is any measure, Bradley  
plans to quickly shake off the rust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not really running against Al Gore,'' Bradley declared at  
a news conference earlier in the day. Yet, he repeatedly drew 
subtle distinctions between himself and the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a life before I got into politics and a life after I  
left the Senate,'' said the former professional basketball player 
and Rhodes Scholar who resigned from the Congress in 1996. Bradley 
didn't need to say that Gore is the son of a Tennessee senator who 
entered politics at a young age and rarely wandered far from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been a part of the partisanship that has shaped the  
debate the last couple years,'' Bradley said, trying to position 
himself as an anti-Washington Democrat despite his 18 years in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that he stands a better chance than Gore of beating  
the GOP presidential nominee: ``I'd be better able to attract 
independents and Republicans in a general election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, Bradley kept to intimate settings where his  
soft-spoken charm and star appeal warmed audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	At a program for high school dropouts, pregnant 17-year-old  
Carmen Velazquez broke into tears as she explained why she left 
school. Bradley unfolded his 6-foot-5 frame from a tiny chair, 
leaned across a rickety wood table and gently touched her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for your courage in sharing that,'' Bradley said in  
a poignant exchange that invoked memories of then-Arkansas Gov. 
Bill Clinton stirring audiences in New Hampshire eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Concord, N.H., Boys and Girls Club, he organized a brief  
basketball shooting contest and signed autographs for kids who knew 
more about his pivots than his politics. 
</P>
<P>
	While off to a good start, Bradley still has a long way to go to  
defeat Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president enjoys the support of President Clinton,  
stands to benefit from a booming economy and has already lined up 
most of the party's top elected officials, activists and donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley is respected, he may be outgunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I view New Hampshire as a foregone conclusion,'' said New  
Jersey consultant Harold Hodes, a former Bradley backer who now 
supports Gore. ``This is something Bradley should have done six 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not broke, don't fix it,'' said New Hampshire activist  
Kris Durmer, another Gore backer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bradley has a sports hero's glow, a solid record and a  
devoted following of activists -- many of whom owe him their 
political careers. Gore and Bradley backers alike say the race is 
not in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has been here a lot, he's very likable and  
has the support of many top activists in the state but ... that's 
just 100 votes and he needs a lot more than that,'' said Mary Rauh, 
who unsuccessfully ran for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There also may be a big anti-Washington vein for Bradley to tap.  
Though few mentioned the Monica Lewinsky investigation 
specifically, several state Democrats said they're tired of the 
partisan tone in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think having the vice president come in would change  
anything,'' said Jim Gilmour, 53, sipping coffee at a Keene, N.H., 
bagel shop. 
</P>
<P>
	State party chairman Jeff Woodburn, who is leaving his post next  
month, has endorsed Gore. His replacement, Kathy Sullivan, says 
Bradley entered the race about as late as a challenger can. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are still ``second and third circle'' activists  
on the market, but Gore has taken most of the top-tier talent. 
</P>
<P>
	After developing an anti-Gore message and raising money, Bradley  
still must mend fences with Democrats who took it personally when 
he left the Senate saying politics was broken and that neither 
party ``speaks to the people where they live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said one reason he would make a better candidate than  
Gore is they have ``different personal histories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on the road for 30 years as a senator, a basketball  
player, a writer and a lecturer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, Bradley earned a reputation as a big-thinking  
moderate Democrat, a champion of tax reform, child nutrition 
programs and the Superfund cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He toyed with running for president in 1988 and 1992 but was  
twice gunshy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll respond to Senator Bradley,'' Gore  
spokesman Chris Lehane said in California, where the vice president 
was campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, a Democratic senator from neighboring  
Massachusetts, has not decided whether to enter the primary 
competition. He could divide any anti-Gore vote and make it harder 
for Bradley to get traction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Pope To Meet for 4th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A president living through a modern morality  
play is meeting with the spiritual leader of the world's Roman 
Catholics. But White House officials say human rights, Iraq and 
Cuba are the most likely topics of discussion for President Clinton 
and Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's visit marks the fourth time Clinton has met with the  
pontiff, and the first since the Monica Lewinsky scandal became 
public and led to the Senate impeachment trial. Clinton was meeting 
with the pope for 45 minutes after a welcoming ceremony at a St. 
Louis airport hangar. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton, a Southern Baptist, has sought spiritual guidance  
from several ministers in recent months, there was no indication he 
would touch the Lewinsky theme today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president enjoys carrying on a dialogue with one of the  
pre-eminent religious leaders in the world,'' White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said. ``He will discuss issues of mutual concern, 
including human rights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain the situation in Iraq, the situation in Cuba,  
which the pope has expressed particular interest in, will be part 
of the discussion,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that those will be simple issues to deal with. The pope has  
been critical of the U.S. strikes and U.N. sanctions against Iraq, 
and he did so again Monday following a U.S. missile attack in 
southern Iraq during which civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope also has criticized the economic embargo against Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	But there is much common ground, especially in the area of human  
rights. On his recent visit to Cuba, John Paul stressed the need 
for freedom and a rebirth of spiritual values on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart deflected queries about whether questions of morality  
would come up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave it to the Holy Father to do his own briefings,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Novak, the director of social and political studies at  
the American Enterprise Institute and a longtime student of John 
Paul's career, said he expected the pope's public pronouncements to 
emphasize ``moral ecology,'' or the ethos needed to gird a free 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, the pope stressed that the church speaks to the  
prosperous as well as to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this pope, culture trumps politics, and economics,'' said  
Novak. ``No matter how rich or how powerful you are, the question 
is, 'How do you live? What do you live for? And what are you 
willing to die for?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Novak, who has met with the pope a dozen times, doubted  
Clinton's troubles would come up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope meets with everybody, and any confessor knows a lot  
about moral failings,'' he said. ``Unless Clinton should choose to 
bring something up and speak as a penitent in some way, or as a 
Christian to a pastor, their meeting would be rather as heads of 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the meeting -- and the pope's message for the Americas  
--was cause for reflection at a time when the Lewinsky matter was 
playing itself out in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Victorian era, people used to speak in conversation  
about prayer and religious experience; it was sex they didn't talk 
about,'' Novak said. ``Today, everybody talks about sex. You'd 
embarrass people if you asked them about their prayer life.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Gov. Files for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Gov. Paul Patton on Monday filed for  
re-election, giving the Democrat a chance be the first Kentucky 
governor to succeed himself in almost 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done a good job and the people of Kentucky recognize  
it,'' Patton said during a brief news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton is the first governor in nearly two centuries eligible  
for re-election. The state's first constitution allowed it and 
James Garrard served two terms from 1796 to 1804. 
</P>
<P>
	Later constitutions barred governors from seeking re-election.  
Voters changed the constitution in 1992 to allow succession, and 
Patton is the first governor eligible to run again. 
</P>
<P>
	No major Republicans have filed for the race, despite claims  
that Patton is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Will T. Scott, who was the GOP nominee for attorney general in  
1995, said he is a single parent and wants to help his 16-year-old 
son get off to college in a few years. Scott also acknowledged he 
has been unable to get much interest in his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	And state Rep. Brian Crall of Owensboro said family and  
financial considerations will keep him out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The primaries are in May and the general election is in  
November.

<HEADLINE> Roy Re-Signs With Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Free to test his worth on the open market, Patrick  
Roy decided to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who could have become an unrestricted free agent this  
summer, signed a two-year contract extension Monday with Colorado 
to end six months of negotiations with the Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, 33, is in the final year of a contract that will pay him  
$5.1 million this season. He will earn $7 million in the 1999-2000 
season and $7.5 million during in 2000-2001. He also will receive 
$500,000 on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who ranks fifth in career wins and first among active NHL  
goaltenders with 394, helped Colorado to the Stanley Cup title 
after being traded from Montreal midway through the 1995-96 season. 
It was his third championship, the first two coming with the 
Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a family decision more than anything else. My wife and  
kids are extremely happy here,'' Roy said. ``It was fine with me 
because I like to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix, Roy's former agent,  
began negotiating with the goalie in June. Without an extension, 
Roy would have become an unrestricted free agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our commitment to try to keep all the guys that have been  
with us at least since 1996, when we won the cup, and keep our 
nucleus,'' Lacroix said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's contract includes a no-trade clause in the first year,  
which the goalie said was a key element in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a chance to play where I want, and Colorado was my first  
pick, but I had to know Colorado wanted me for that long,'' Roy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said now that Roy has signed, ``we're moving along with  
other files,'' a reference to all-star center Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's signing raises questions about whether Colorado will be  
able to retain Forsberg, a restricted free agent after this season. 
Lacroix said he is optimistic Colorado can sign Forsberg before the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avs can match any offer Forsberg receives, but they could  
face an aggressive bidding war like the one that almost cost them 
center Joe Sakic last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado retained Sakic when it matched the New York Rangers'  
three-year, $21 million offer that included $15 million up front. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche should get a financial boost next season when they  
christen the Pepsi Center, which will replace aging McNichols 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the NHL's most intense competitors, Roy has 44  
career shutouts and is a three-time winner of the Vezina Trophy 
awarded to the NHL's top goaltender. He also has twice been named 
MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy's trade to the Avalanche came after a well-publicized  
dispute with former Montreal coach Mario Tremblay, who watched Roy 
surrender the first nine goals of an 11-1 loss to Detroit. Feeling 
he should have been pulled earlier in the game, Roy skated to the 
bench and said it was his last game with the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Roy thrashed some video equipment with his stick  
after missing out on a Dec. 21 win against Anaheim. He played 
nearly the entire game, but did not get the credit because he was 
off the ice when Colorado scored the game-winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can break as many TVs as I want for one year,'' Roy said,  
referring to his no-trade clause. ``After that I better watch 
myself.''

<HEADLINE> Carnegie Hosts Rare Ellington Piece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke Ellington's ``Black, Brown and Beige (a  
Tone Parallel to the History of the Negro in America),'' a work he 
composed for the first concert his band gave at Carnegie Hall in 
1943, was nicely reprised by The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band in its 
first concert of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Peress, who conducted ``Black, Brown and Beige,''  
believes the piece has been performed only five or six times in its 
entirety and as it was originally conceived. The performance was 
crisp and evocative. Trumpeter Jon Faddis spoke the words with 
which Ellington introduced the three sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing it, one realizes again Ellington's great gift for  
melody. A work may be emphatic and lovely at the same time. You 
hear a tune that is clearly patriotic -- the premiere was during 
World War II -- and tunes that are sweet and swinging. The most 
famous melody in ``Black, Brown and Beige'' is ``Come Sunday.'' 
Ellington later put words to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The only song in the suite is ``The Blues,'' sung Thursday by  
Carrie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half of the program included Ellington compositions  
with new arrangements. Randy Sandke's ``Duke Takes a Train'' was 
especially enjoyable, bringing together four of the numbers 
inspired by the trains on which the Ellington Band traveled to 
perform, ``Happy Go Lucky Local,'' ``Choo, Choo,'' ``Delta Bound'' 
and ``The Old Circus Train.'' Jim McNeely missed on his arrangement 
of ``Rockin' in Rhythm,'' removing the pep and swing. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Ellington's centennial year. And Saturday night, Dick  
Hyman's ``Jazz Piano at the Y'' series began its 16th season with a 
program titled ``Keyboard Ellington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman and Dwike Mitchell were impressive at the 92nd Street Y  
improvising Ellington's ``Caravan'' and ``Satin Doll'' on two 
pianos. Then they added trumpeter Joe Wilder and bassist Willie 
Ruff for ``I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart'' and Juan Tizol's 
``Perdido,'' which the Ellington Band played often. 
</P>
<P>
	To top that and end the concert, Hyman introduced clarinet  
player Ray Beckenstein and soprano Nina Hennessey, to sing 
obbligatos Ellington composed for Kay Davis in ``Transbluency'' and 
``On a Turquoise Cloud.'' She also sang the piece Adelaide Hall 
created and recorded with the Ellington Band on ``Creole Love 
Call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman, saying it was one of his favorite ways to think about  
Ellington, announced ``On a Turquoise Cloud'' again when the 
audience demanded an encore.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Brush Off Plane Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons insist that ``Plane-Gate''  
won't be a distraction at their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan said Monday the players had  
discussed the complaints made a day earlier by receiver Terance 
Mathis, who didn't think it was appropriate for Pro Bowlers and 
10-year veterans to depart the team's chartered jet before everyone 
else after landing in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We squashed it,'' Buchanan said. ``We're not going to let it  
affect us. Some guys were mumbling this, some guys were mumbling 
that. Some of it was petty. But it was just personal feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves set the departure pecking order, apparently in  
a sign of respect for the team's older players and top performers. 
Even Reeves and his coaching staff waited for those players to 
leave the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mathis said, `We've come this far as a team, let's keep it  
as a team.'' The receiver did not attend Monday's news conference, 
which included five players. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Chuck Smith said the situation was blown out of  
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, man, that's just some talk, talk,'' Smith said. ``That's  
no big deal. Things like that, I think it was taken out of context. 
Everyone is asking about every aspect of what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith added, ``I could care less who gets off the (plane) first.  
When you look at it, why not let those guys get off first? It 
doesn't matter to me. ... Terance made a statement and -- I don't 
know if you can say it was blown out of proportion -- but I waited 
my turn and it was all good for me. I got off the back of the 
(plane). I didn't get off the front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons worked out for an hour at the University of Miami,  
getting adjusted to the field and facilities they will be using 
this week in preparation for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Lester Archambeau and tight end-fullback Brian  
Kozlowski did not practice because of lingering ankle sprains. 
Archambeau, listed as questionable, has not practiced since the NFC 
championship game on Jan. 17. Kozlowski, who moved from tight end 
to fullback when Bob Christian suffered a season-ending knee 
injury, was listed as probable by Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them wanted to practice, but with those ankle injuries  
we felt we needed to rest them another day,'' the coach said. 
``They should be able to practice Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Falcons will take part in media day at Pro  
Player Stadium. All players and coaches are required to face more 
than 3,200 members of the media who are in Miami to cover the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who apologized Sunday for stirring up his feud with  
Denver coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback John Elway, made it 
clear Monday he doesn't want to dissect the issue all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did you bring it up?'' he said, scolding a reporter who  
raised the issue again. ``I'm trying to forget about it. The only 
thing that heals wounds is time. I don't want to scratch over 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Mo. Campaign Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to clarify how  
far states can go in limiting individual contributions to political 
candidates' campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review a free-speech ruling that  
struck down Missouri's campaign-finance restrictions. The case will 
be argued next fall, and a decision is expected sometime in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In their appeal, state officials said the limits deter ``efforts  
to pollute the political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a real fear, which may be stronger today than at any  
time in recent memory, that money is harmfully distorting the 
nation's political process,'' the state's appeal contends. ``There 
is strong political pressure on legislators at all levels of 
government to adopt restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Missouri law set three-tiered limits on the contributions  
people can make to candidates: $1,075 for most statewide offices 
such as governor and lieutenant governor; $525 for state Senate 
candidates; and $275 for state representative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those limits were enforced in 1996 and 1998 elections until the  
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked future enforcement in its 
decision Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	A political action committee, Shrink Missouri Government, had  
challenged the limits early last year, but a federal judge upheld 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit court voted 2-1 to  
reverse the judge's ruling after concluding that the state's 
interest in preventing corruption did not justify the ``such a 
heavy-handed restriction of protected speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We again remind the state that it has the burden of showing  
that any limits ... are narrowly tailored to serve the state's 
compelling interest in addressing proven real or perceived undue 
influence or corruption attributable to large political 
contributions,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The November ruling offered no hint as to how high the  
contribution limits would have to be before they gained the appeals 
court's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri's appeal noted that the ruling conflicts with one from  
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld a $1,000 
contribution limit for certain state elections in Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Court: Census Can't Use Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 2000 census cannot be adjusted to make up  
for an expected undercount of minorities, the Supreme Court said 
today, ruling for taxpayers who challenged the Clinton 
administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal census law bars use of statistical methods intended  
to make the national population count more nearly accurate, the 
justices said in a divided ruling that could have a major effect on 
money and votes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	When the census law was amended in 1976, ``At no point ... did a  
single member of Congress suggest that the amendments would so 
fundamentally change the manner in which the (Census) Bureau could 
calculate the population for purposes of apportionment,'' Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said ``it tests the limits of reason'' to suggest that  
Congress would have been silent in enacting ``what would arguably 
be the single most significant change in the method of conducting 
the decennial census since its inception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusting the census likely would have helped Democrats because  
minorities and inner-city residents, who tend to vote Democratic, 
made up a large share of the estimated 4 million people missed by 
the 1990 count. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Campers Likely to Pay for Pay Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Forest Service failed to win an  
exemption from a prevailing wage law, pay will increase -- and in 
some cases nearly double -- for workers at hundreds of campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The change could make for unhappy campers. Businesses that run  
most of the campgrounds may have to boost overnight camping fees, 
which now range from $7 to $15. Concessionaires don't know where 
they will need to raise fees or by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will kill this industry relatively quickly,'' said Pat  
O'Brien, executive director of the National Forest Recreation 
Association. ``There's not enough to pay these (wages). It's a very 
thin margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service agrees that fees could increase and says the  
agency will take a cut in its $2 million in annual camping revenues 
because of the change. That reduction, while only a fraction of the 
agency's budget, could add to a maintenance backlog in forest 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very big concern,'' said Kenneth Karkula, concessions  
program manager for the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service employees used to run the agency's 4,000  
campgrounds, but when federal funding for forest recreation 
declined in the 1970s, concessionaires were hired. Today, about 70 
percent of the campgrounds are run by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses generally pay their workers minimum wage or  
slightly more. But in 1995, while reviewing campground concessions 
as part of a separate investigation, the Labor Department found 
that concessionaires should have been paying prevailing wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor union leaders cried foul when the Forest Service tried to  
get an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think the Forest Service ought to be racing to the  
bottom and exploiting workers,'' said Denny Smith, field 
representative for the carpenters' union in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department denied the Forest Service's appeal late  
last year, rejecting the Forest Service argument that campground 
concessionaires should be treated the same as motel concessionaires 
who are allowed to pay employees minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service will put the higher wages into effect next  
month. It will take five years for the increase to reach all 
workers, who will see their pay increase between $1 to $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recreation Roundtable, a group of chief executives for large  
recreation companies, wants Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
appeal the Labor Department decision. Some concessionaires hope the 
Forest Service or Congress will act to exempt them. But the Forest 
Service, which is part of the Agriculture Department, said it has 
no plans for appeals or congressional proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to heed what the Department of Labor told us ...  
and that's probably the end of the issue,'' spokesman Chris Wood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans questioned whether the wage increase  
would affect agency estimates that forest recreation will 
contribute $98 billion to the economy by next year, compared with 
just $3.9 billion from logging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea that this economic juggernaut would have to be  
sustained on the backs of minimum-wage workers cleaning out Forest 
Service campgrounds,'' Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> LucasVarity Wary of Federal Mogul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- British auto parts maker LucasVarity PLC shunned  
Federal Mogul Corp.'s $6.5 billion cash-and-stock takeover offer 
and announced Monday it was in talks for an all-cash deal with a 
third party. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity, which wants to move its headquarters from London to  
the United States, has been negotiating with several U.S. auto 
parts companies, including TRW Inc. and Tenneco Inc. But Federal 
Mogul on Monday tried to muscle in with an unsolicited offer so big 
that the LucasVarity board would have to accept or face pressure 
from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the LucasVarity board disclosed it was holding  
``advanced discussions with a third party'' on an all-cash bid. 
While it said there was no guarantee there would be a deal, 
LucasVarity said it could have an announcement later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While LucasVarity did not identify the suitor, the Dow Jones  
Newswires reported it was TRW. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Tenneco and TRW are believed to be looking for means of  
disposing of their automotive operations on a tax-efficient basis 
and merging it with another company is a smart way to do that,'' 
said Jonathan Rouner, a managing director at Credit Suisse First 
Boston in New York, who heads the firm's automotive mergers and 
acquisition practice. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW spokesman Jay McCaffrey, said ``We're not commenting on the  
reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Mogul, based in Southfield, Mich., offered 280 pence a  
share, or $4.64, to be paid half in cash and half in stock. The 
company has been on an acquisition spree for years and is so 
burdened with debt that it cannot afford an all-cash offer, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity, the world's No. 2 car brake manufacturer, rebuffed  
Federal Mogul's request to look over the company's operations in 
advance of a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Snell, Federal Mogul's chairman and chief executive  
officer, in a letter to his counterparts at LucasVarity, said, 
``I'm genuinely disappointed and surprised at your decision not to 
allow us to proceed with due diligence on LucasVarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the LucasVarity disclosed a third party was in talks  
about a takeover, the company's shares were soaring on prospects of 
a bidding war. The U.S. shares of LucasVarity rose 14 percent, or 
by $5.16 3/4, to close at $41.41 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where. Federal Mogul fell $1.43 3/4 to $61.81 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Profits Fall in 4Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Slumping global markets and a sales  
decline drove Union Carbide Corp.'s fourth-quarter 1998 earnings 
down 54 percent. The results were slightly below Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman William Joyce said Monday a decline in the world  
economy led to lower sales and said the difficult times were likely 
to last through most of 1999 and perhaps even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of plastics and specialty chemicals earned $67  
million, or 49 cents per share, in the October-December period, 
down from $130 million, or 92 cents a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenue fell to $1.29 billion, down 16 percent from  
$1.54 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results included an after-tax gain of $43 million, or  
31 cents per share, from the settlement of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that onetime gain, it would have earned 18 cents a share  
for the quarter, a penny below the average estimate of 19 cents a 
share by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Carbide closed  
up $1.50 a share at $44.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce said the results reflected continuing market weakness,  
particularly in Asia, and that prices of certain basic chemicals 
were at recent lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide's results were also hurt by maintenance turnaround  
costs at the company's Taft, La., and Texas City, Texas, plants and 
by the higher-than-expected cost of switching to a new information 
technology system. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter of 1997 benefited from an after-tax gain of  
$72 million, or 53 cents a share, in a separate legal settlement. 
An accounting change reduced earnings by $17 million, or 12 cents a 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Union Carbide reported net income of $403 million,  
or $2.91 a share, down from $652 million, or $4.41 per common 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year fell to $5.66 billion from $6.50 billion.

<HEADLINE> Saving Social Security / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You might think from all the noise that followed  
the president's proposal to invest Social Security funds in the 
stock market that most people don't want it. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyze their criticism, however, and you find that what  
generated most of the to-do following the State of the Union 
suggestion concerned the method by which the funds would be 
invested. 
</P>
<P>
	At one extreme are advocates of a purely private investment  
program for at least part of the funds, with power and choice 
controlled by the individuals involved. It would be a form of 
compulsory savings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other extreme is a continuation of the existing method in  
which employee and employer contribute to a security system, with a 
certain percentage of the funds then invested by government in 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal leans toward the latter form in that  
it, rather than the worker, would make the decisions. And that, 
more than anything else, is what brought on an instantaneous round 
of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the format rather than opposition to investing in the  
private sector that caused the opposition, including that from 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Left and right seem to 
agree it's a fair idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems with government itself making all decisions  
involves so many other issues it might be compared to entering a 
thorny thicket and finding a barbed wire fence in the middle and a 
bull on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the record of government as a fiduciary isn't good. Next,  
it has a hard time separating politics and goals. It has inherent 
conflicts that would test its objectivity and maybe compromise 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Government is a customer of companies that in all probability  
would be among those considered for investing. It is a regulator of 
companies. It is a complainant against companies. And it collects 
taxes from all. 
</P>
<P>
	By themselves, such issues could create insurmountable problems.  
Add to them the problems and threats that might be created by the 
sheer size of government as an investor in the public marketplace, 
or in a single company. Does it rate a seat on the board? How would 
the shares be voted? 
</P>
<P>
	Inherent throughout is the matter of personal choice vs.  
government power. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, some critics have asked, should still another agent be  
placed between the marketplace and the investor? Middlemen such as 
brokers, advisers and mutual funds already take a bite out of 
investor profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is to find some way in which workers' dollars can  
be invested with an assured minimal return while maintaining a 
degree of individual responsibility, and limiting government to 
governing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the rhetoric, the alternatives involve postponing  
the retirement age, raising taxes, limiting benefits, or the 
utterly unacceptable alternative of letting the system go broke. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue involves a lot more too. Unless corrected, the  
current system pits young against old, and haves against have-nots. 
The haves, you might have observed, generally have stocks among 
their holdings.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rejects Quick End to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton's Senate impeachment  
trial at a crossroads, Republicans and Democrats met separately 
today to decide whether to seek a swift end to the proceedings 
without a partisan struggle over witnesses. Republicans rejected a 
plan to end the trial this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats backed a proposal for final votes on the articles of  
impeachment on Friday, with no chance of witnesses. But Republicans 
``summarily rejected'' the idea during a closed-door meeting, 
according to John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla., said of the plan  
supported by the Democrats, ``I'm sure that there would be an 
objection if it precludes witnesses, and it does. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings came as House prosecutors held a private meeting of  
their own to draw up a list of witnesses they'd like to testify, 
Monica Lewinsky among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel on  
Sunday, and her attorney said afterward she had provided no 
information not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled to debate two rival motions beginning  
today -- one sought by Democrats to dismiss the charges, the other 
sought by the House prosecutors to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle told reporters the alternative  
would scrap those two votes. He set out a schedule for final 
arguments and Senate deliberations that would culminate in a vote 
on the articles of impeachment themselves on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors would be granted two hours later today to  
offer a formal rebuttal to the White House's defense arguments, and 
each side would have time for closing arguments on Tuesday. Then 
Wednesday and Thursday would be given to deliberations of the 
articles, with votes on Friday. Some Democrats also said they 
wanted provisions for censuring the president immediately after the 
articles of impeachment were voted on. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of the alternative wasn't completely clear. Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he and GOP Sen. Slade Gorton had 
discussed the idea late last week. Separately, Democrats said they 
had handed it to Majority Leader Trent Lott late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., opposed the  
idea. ``It is a step by step process that should not be ended 
before the time is right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., countered: ``There's a feeling  
that if the House managers have their way we're never going to get 
a bipartisan conclusion.'' And that conclusion, he said, is what 
both parties are determined to achieve, especially given the 
ferocity of the partisanship that gripped the House during its 
portion of the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came against the backdrop of a widely held  
belief that Clinton will win acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. A 
two-thirds vote would be required to convict and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the topic dominated the TV interview programs on  
Sunday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Grams, R-Minn., sounding a position held by most  
conservative Republicans, said he would be inclined to vote for 
witnesses ``if the House managers make a good argument'' that such 
testimony could resolve discrepancies in the current record of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, said today  
she is leaning against voting to allow witnesses. ``I haven't made 
that decision,'' she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``What 
would they offer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments, along with those of two other Republican senators  
on Sunday indicating they were anxious to end the trial as early as 
this week, gave the first signs of cracks in the Republican camp. 
``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican from Alabama, said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were meeting today to finalize their witness  
list and submit it to the Senate. Among the names they were 
considering were Ms. Lewinsky, Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and possibly former presidential 
political adviser Dick Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that Clinton's  
lawyers would make no effort to interview Ms. Lewinsky, would 
submit no list of potential witnesses and would argue for dismissal 
because ``the articles do not warrant removal based on the 
Constitution, the facts and the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate returned to work after a one-day recess in the trial.  
Senators could pose a few more questions to the legal teams, or 
just move to the two motions expected to be filed today: one 
requesting witnesses and the other requesting that the charges 
against Clinton be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors pressed ahead Sunday with preparations to  
subpoena witnesses, holding an informal interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
that the former White House intern resisted and that Senate 
Democrats denounced as an act of desperation. A judge order Ms. 
Lewinsky to undergo the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts for the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors met for nearly two hours with Ms.  
Lewinsky and her lawyer at the upscale Mayflower Hotel about six 
blocks from the White House. The meeting took place after 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, citing the immunity agreement 
she signed with his office, on Saturday obtained a court order 
requiring her attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said his client had  
been ``extremely truthful'' but said: ``She added nothing to the 
record that is already sitting before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who hold a 55-45 majority in the House, appeared  
solidly against dismissal, and some Democrats agreed that it was 
more appropriate to end the trial with a straight vote on the 
charges. With acquittal, the next question would be whether to 
write a censure resolution condemning Clinton for the affair.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Seek To Solve Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and the European Union were  
locked in talks today aimed at defusing a dispute over bananas 
before it escalates into a trade war, trade officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were closeted in discussions even as they were  
supposed to be attending a gathering of the 133-member World Trade 
Organization. On the agenda of that meeting was the U.S. request 
for approval of $520 million in sanctions on EU imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was eventually adjourned for five hours with no sign  
of U.S. or EU delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Latin American countries claim the EU's  
trade policy on bananas continues to violate global trading rules 
because it favors producers in former European colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU rejects the claim, saying it has complied with a 1997  
judgment by the WTO dispute panel. A WTO panel has yet to rule on 
the EU's claim of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States has been pressing ahead with its sanctions  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a compromise suggested by WTO Director-General Renato  
Ruggiero, the panel looking at the new EU banana import system will 
also consider whether the proposed U.S. sanctions are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, spokesman for EU trade commissioner Sir Leon  
Brittan, told reporters in Brussels that the compromise was ``a 
fair proposal which we are supporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out the possibility that the EU would retaliate by  
imposing its own sanctions, saying Europe would seek a solution 
through the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have absolutely no desire for a clash with the United  
States or an escalation of this dispute,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said the planned U.S. sanctions would affect people who  
had nothing to do with bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,  
said the compromise would give both parties a bit of breathing 
space to see if they can resolve their underlying differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it is ready to sit down with the EU  
at any time to discuss the matter, but the EU says it will not 
negotiate while the threat of sanctions hangs over its head.

<HEADLINE> Intel Introduces Faster Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Fast laptop computers could become  
cheaper with the mobile Pentium II and Celeron processors Intel 
Corp. introduced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chips, designed for mobile and low-cost computers, are  
faster, lighter and require less power than the original Pentium 
chip, Intel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mobile Pentium II chips run at 333 megahertz and 366 MHz and  
cost about $450 to $700. They are twice as fast as the mobile 
processor introduced a year ago, Intel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celeron models, Intel's first low-cost chips for portable  
computers, come at speeds of 266Mhz and 300 Mhz and cost about $100 
and $200, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduction of the Celeron chips should bring the price of  
laptops down to about $1,500, compared with $3,000 or more for 
top-of-the-line Pentium II machines, analysts said.

	Dismissal of Clinton Case Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate closed its doors today to debate a  
Democratic attempt to dismiss all charges against President Clinton 
and bring his impeachment trial to an end. Senators deliberated for 
4 1/2 hours in a rare secret evening session. The Senate was 
reconvening at noon EST tomorrow, when it may turn its attention to 
the subject of possible witnesses. House prosecutors today pressed 
their case for testimony by Monica Lewinsky and a shortened list of 
additional witnesses. Meanwhile, the White House announced Clinton 
would ignore a written list of questions submitted by Majority 
Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans.

	219 Killed in Colombia Quake  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An earthquake shook western Colombia  
today, killing at least 219 people and injuring 900 others. The 
early afternoon quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6, according 
to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. Its epicenter was 
located in western Valle del Cauca state, 140 miles west of the 
capital, Bogota. The death and damage toll appeared to be highest 
in Armenia, Pereira and Calarca -- three cities near the epicenter.

	Iraq: U.S. Missiles Kill 11 People  
</P>
<P>
	BASRA, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi officials reported at least 11 people  
killed after U.S. missiles slammed into residential neighborhoods 
in southern Iraq. Pentagon officials said it was likely that U.S. 
jets targeting the Iraqi air defense installations misfired and 
that at least one high-explosive missile may have killed civilians 
in and around the city of Basra. The senior U.S. commander in the 
Persian Gulf, Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, said ``we deeply regret 
any loss of civilian lives or civilian casualties or injuries.''

	Albright Fails To Meet Yeltsin  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright clashed with  
a potential Russian presidential candidate over a U.S. missile 
defense proposal and other issues, but failed Monday to talk to 
ailing President Boris Yeltsin. The blunt encounter between 
Albright and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a possible successor to 
Yeltsin, underscored U.S. and Russian differences on a host of 
issues. Yeltsin was still in the Central Clinical Hospital with an 
ulcer and made clear he would not meet with Albright.

	$4B Sought To Combat Global Warming  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Kyoto climate treaty remains in  
limbo, the Clinton administration in its upcoming budget will 
propose $4 billion in spending and tax breaks, a third more than 
this year, to help address the threat of global warming. Vice 
President Al Gore said today the initiative represents 
``significant new investments ... to accelerate our aggressive, 
common-sense efforts to meet the challenge of global warming.'' The 
package includes a $200 million ``clean air partnership fund'' that 
will funnel grants to state and local governments to reduce 
greenhouse gases.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrives in St. Louis  
tomorrow, and the transformation of the Trans World Dome into a 
massive church-for-a-day was just one of a multitude of finishing 
touches under way in an intensely proud city. The pope is scheduled 
to celebrate Mass at the dome before 104,000 people on Wednesday 
morning. The Pope gave the final address of his Mexico visit today 
to more than 110,000 people packed into a soccer stadium.

	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- America Online Inc. will reportedly  
make Marc Andreessen, the 27-year-old cofounder of Netscape 
Communications Corp., chief technology officer once it completes 
its acquisition of Netscape. The move should help prevent a 
brain-drain at Netscape, where before the merger, engineers 
disdained AOL as technologically unsophisticated. Andreessen, who 
was in charge of software development at Netscape, will report to 
AOL Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Case, the Wall Street 
Journal reported today.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Teen Lynching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) -- A teen-ager accused of lynching a  
learning-disabled girl who was hoping to make friends went on trial 
Monday, claiming she was wrongly accused by others who made deals 
to save themselves from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Holtmeyer, 16, faces the death penalty if convicted in  
the killing of 15-year-old Kimberly Dotts, who was hanged in some 
woods in front of several teens before her head was smashed with a 
rock the size of a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teen-agers and a 24-year-old woman pleaded guilty to lesser  
charges and are expected to testify against Ms. Holtmeyer, who 
along with Aaron Straw, 18, faces a charge of murder. Straw is to 
be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ms. Holtmeyer wanted Kimberly dead because she  
was worried the girl would tell others about her plans to run away 
from Clearfield, a working-class coal and lumber town of 7,500 
about 125 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. But the defense said Ms. 
Holtmeyer is a victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police jumped to the conclusion that Jessica Holtmeyer  
committed this crime,'' lawyer Bryan S. Walk said. ``All they had 
were a couple of statements from a couple of people who turned out 
to be liars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly was hoping to make friends when she was invited to  
sleep over at one of the teen's homes in May. But the next day she 
found herself in the woods with a group of kids she barely knew who 
were planning to run away to Florida that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone complained that Kimberly -- short, overweight and  
learning-disabled -- might ``snitch'' on them. A noose was pulled 
over her head, the other end slung over a maple branch, and Ms. 
Holtmeyer and Straw then yanked on the rope with all their 
strength, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly's body shook and convulsed, then went limp. On the  
ground, as she gasped for breath, prosecutors said, Ms. Holtmeyer 
smashed her face with a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness was Straw, who agreed to testify in return for  
not having to face the death penalty. Straw said he wanted to scare 
Kimberly and admitted helping Ms. Holtmeyer, his then-girlfriend, 
hang the girl twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did you do it a second time?'' Walk asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``To scare Kim even more,'' Straw answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Paul Cherry told jurors in his opening statement that  
Kimberly was a quiet girl who was just beginning to reach out 
socially when she fell in with the loosely knit group of teens who 
called themselves the Runaway Gang. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Ms. Holtmeyer headed for Lakeland, Fla., that night.  
Searchers looking for the missing girl found the body nine days 
later. Cherry asked Straw about Ms. Holtmeyer's demeanor the day of 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weird,'' he said. ``It was like a side of her I didn't see  
before. Like she didn't care about nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Wording Affected Lewinsky Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During failed negotiations last year to win  
Monica Lewinsky's cooperation, prosecutors became upset when her 
original lawyers altered language in her offer of testimony that 
affected their obstruction-of-justice case against President 
Clinton, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	The wording change was a factor in killing a proposed immunity  
deal between Lewinsky lawyer William Ginsburg and Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office last February, according to the 
documents, released Monday at the request of The Associated Press 
and other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky eventually replaced Ginsburg with Washington  
attorneys Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, and in her subsequent 
immunity deal she stayed with the weaker amended account given in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In her initial handwritten ``proffer'' to Starr's office Feb. 1,  
Ms. Lewinsky raised serious questions about possible obstruction by 
Clinton, stating that he had told her ``she should say she was 
bringing him letters ... or visiting (Oval Office secretary) Betty 
Currie'' if ever asked why she was with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, a federal judge released documents showing that  
Ms. Lewinsky amended her statement to Starr's office on Feb. 3, 
adding a paragraph that stated the president had made his comments 
to her before she was subpoenaed in Paula Jones' sexual harassment 
lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of Clinton's comments was an important issue to  
Starr's office in determining whether he might have engaged in 
obstruction of justice in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	On receiving the amendment to Ms. Lewinsky's proffer, Starr  
deputy Robert Bittman fired back a letter to Ginsburg saying that 
``some provisions of Ms. Lewinsky's written proffer -- including a 
version we received yesterday with added provisions -- contradict 
other provisions of the document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg responded by asserting that Starr prosecutor Bruce  
Udolf had verbally agreed to the amendment -- as well as to a 
complete immunity deal for Ms. Lewinsky -- in a telephone conference 
late on the evening of Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office denied making a deal and said prosecutors had  
information that was ``inconsistent'' with Ms. Lewinsky's amendment 
that placed Clinton's comments before she was subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue over the timing of Clinton's comments has never been  
previously known publicly as a reason why Starr's office rejected 
Ms. Lewinsky's proposed immunity deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg went to court to try to enforce the proposed immunity  
deal, saying Starr's office had agreed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office replied that the amendment to Ms. Lewinsky's  
handwritten proffer constituted a ``counteroffer'' to which they 
had never agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson on May 1 denied  
Ginsburg's motion to enforce the agreement, saying in the newly 
released court decision that Ms. Lewinsky's amendment ``constituted 
a material change requiring further acceptance'' by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors ``had not proposed'' the amendment ``and had  
never had a chance to discuss or approve Ms. Lewinsky's change in 
the timing of Clinton's statement, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Udolf's oral assent'' to the change ``fell short of the  
requisite acceptance because the evidence ... on this issue failed 
to prove that Mr. Udolf told Mr. Ginsburg'' that Starr's office and 
Ms. Lewinsky ``in fact had a binding deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that the prosecutors had made clear to  
Ginsburg that only Starr had the authority to approve an immunity 
deal for his office, and she noted that Starr was not involved in 
the phone call.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Posts 58 Percent Profit rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. today reported a 58 percent rise in  
fourth-quarter profit, benefiting from cost cuts and strong demand 
for its mobile-phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit increase, which matched Wall Street forecasts, came  
despite another drop in the telecommunications giant's 
long-distance phone sales, which continue to be hit by competition 
from lower-cost providers of service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it earned $2.0 billion, or $1.12 a share on a diluted  
basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That was up from a profit 
of $1.26 billion, or 70 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 4.8 percent to $13.53 billion from $12.90 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said revenue from wireless services grew 25 percent to $302  
million amid a big response to its new Digital One Rate promotion, 
a pricing package that charges users from 11 cents to 15 cents a 
minute, no matter where they are calling from. AT&AMP;T signed more 
than 850,000 Digital One subscribers since introducing the plan 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from business services, which includes long-distance and  
data transmission services, grew 4.7 percent to $259 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But revenues from consumer services, most of which is  
long-distance phone sales, fell 3.6 percent to $5.54 billion as the 
company moved more customers off its traditional calling plans to 
packages that charge less per phone call but generate less revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, AT&AMP;T's profit grew to $6.40 billion, or $3.55 a  
diluted share, from a profit of $4.42 billion, or $2.47 a diluted 
share in 1997. Revenue rose to $53.22 billion from $51.58 billion.

<HEADLINE> American To Build New JFK Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Airlines said Monday it will build a $1  
billion terminal at Kennedy Airport with a check-in area large 
enough to hold Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the 1.9-million-square-foot terminal was timed  
to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the nation's first 
coast-to-coast jet service by American between New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy was a big part of our airline, even when it was known  
as Idlewild,'' said Donald J. Carty, American's chairman and chief 
executive. ``And now we're making sure that JFK is a cornerstone of 
our international operations in the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financing will come through the sale of tax-exempt bonds and all  
costs will be covered by the airline. Construction is to begin in 
July and end in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The terminal, able to accommodate 40,000 passengers a day, will  
feature three concourses. There will be 59 gates for use by 
American, its regional subsidiary American Eagle and other carriers 
that will contract for space. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline didn't provide dimensions of the check-in area,  
other than to say it could hold Giants Stadium, which is about 
450,000-square feet.

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Louisiana Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- Roadblocks went up and a chase team equipped  
with thermal detectors and night-vision goggles began a search for 
four convicted killers who bolted from a Louisiana prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the sharp eyes of 15-year-old Matt Tibbett who foiled  
the inmates' plans after spotting two of the men Sunday while out 
deer hunting alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The ill-fated escape -- which left one inmate dead and the other  
three in custody -- began at 2 p.m. CST when the men, armed with two 
smuggled guns, took a prison maintenance worker hostage and left 
the prison grounds in a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates made it through a gate at the 18,000-acre Louisiana  
State Penitentiary to a water tower, where they ditched the truck 
and tied up the maintenance supervisor with duct tape, Warden Burl 
Cain said. The foursome then fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only minutes for the hostage to free himself and alert  
the nearest guard post. By then the inmates had about a half-hour 
head start, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement from surrounding areas immediately set up  
roadblocks. The prison's chase team, armed with night-vision 
goggles, thermal detectors and packs of dogs, launched a recovery 
effort for the four men, each serving a life sentence for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Others monitored the Mississippi River, which borders the prison  
grounds to the east, while three helicopters searched from above. 
</P>
<P>
	About this time, 15-year-old Tibbett was deer hunting on his  
family's property, and noticed two men sitting on the ground about 
50 yards away. Not knowing about the prison break, he kept walking. 
</P>
<P>
	A short while later, his brother-in-law, who had heard of the  
escape, met up with the teen. The pair alerted law enforcement 
officials and soon, bloodhounds were on the trail of inmates Roy 
McFall and Jerry Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis later said when McFall saw the dogs, he turned to him and  
said, ``I'm not going back to prison, they're about to catch us,'' 
according to Cain. 
</P>
<P>
	McFall, 40, then shot himself in the head, and later died at a  
hospital. He had been serving a life sentence for first-degree 
murder in the June 1983 stabbing of a Texas woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 39, was taken into custody without incident.  
</P>
<P>
	The chase team then found and began following the second set of  
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Wooley, 35, and Darrell Crider, 37, were found at 7 p.m.  
about 200 yards from where McFall and Davis had been huddling in 
brush near Tunica Bayou. The inmates surrendered without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Cain said prison officials would review the escape to find any  
breakdowns in prison policy. Twenty walk-through metal detectors 
have already been ordered, which should prevent guns being smuggled 
inside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to really investigate and find out how  
that happened,'' Cain said. ``We can't afford for that to happen, 
not at this prison.''

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Remember AP Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Myles Tierney, an Associated Press television  
producer shot to death at 34 by rebels in Sierra Leone, lived his 
life with zest, compassion and a drive to tell the story of a 
troubled continent, colleagues said at a memorial service Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Myles understood people in pain,'' said Miguel Gil Moreno de  
Mora, an Associated Press Television News cameraman who worked with 
Tierney in Africa for two years. ``He cared for them because each 
was an individual to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw them as people, not as a story,'' said AP photographer  
David Guttenfelder, who was with Tierney and AP West African Bureau 
Chief Ian Stewart when rebels opened fire on their car in a 
Freetown street on Jan. 10, instantly killing Tierney. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 32, is recovering in London after undergoing two brain  
operations where a bullet pierced his skull. Though he can't sit or 
talk yet, AP International Editor Thomas J. Kent said, Stewart 
wrote a note saying he wanted to cover the national elections in 
Nairobi next month. ``It's my turf,'' the injured Stewart wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 AP employees and colleagues, friends and family --  
including Tierney's mother, Hanne Tierney-Wang and his father, 
Myles Tierney -- attended the service at the Newseum/NY in 
Manhattan. The service was broadcast over the Internet to AP 
bureaus around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing any of us can say will make sense of this senseless  
killing,'' Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of the AP, told 
mourners. ``But everything we say will show that Myles' journey was 
not in vain. It was an inspiration and it will remain one for 
generations to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like so many AP people around the world, he braved danger and  
hardship so that the truth might be known,'' said Donald E. 
Newhouse, president of Advance Publications and chairman of AP's 
board of directors, reading from a board resolution. ``We and those 
we serve are in his eternal debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boccardi later introduced a 10-minute video that showed a  
smiling, joking Tierney, both behind the camera and in front of it. 
It showed him clowning with colleagues, riding past refugees on his 
way to a story and talking with heavily armed young men. 
</P>
<P>
	The film was set to Tierney's favorite music, including songs by  
Elvis Presley, James Brown, and Martha &AMP; the Vandellas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil and Guttenfelder, who suffered cuts from flying glass,  
remembered Tierney as a deeply passionate, lovable and irreverent 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the obituary of a fake saint,'' Gil said, telling  
the crowd that Tierney liked his apartment sloppy, his pockets 
empty and both his beer and women plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	But above all else, Gil said, Tierney was ``naturally good.''  
</P>
<P>
	``His approach to his job and generally to his life,'' Gil said,  
``was to serve others. ... He found happiness in making other 
people happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney, a native of Manhattan, joined the AP's television arm  
in 1996, as a free-lance producer in Africa. He helped set up the 
first television bureau in New York but soon longed to return to 
Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Niles Baker, head of news for APTN, said he was reluctant to  
send Tierney back but eventually relented. ``Not only was he the 
best man for the job,'' Baker said, ``colleagues in Africa called 
me to say Myles was the only man for the job. They trusted him with 
their lives in difficult situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Myles got me in and out of some of the most dangerous places  
on earth,'' Gil said. ``Places where only he could get access and 
where I wouldn't go with anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guttenfelder said Tierney's death ``does not change what he  
stood for or diminish his influence across'' Africa, where he was 
known and loved by everyone from hotel clerks to livery drivers to 
heads of state. ``At first they liked him because he was big, 
laughed loudly and he bought them lots of beer,'' Guttenfelder 
said. But he soon proved himself by going ``right up to the front, 
where the rest of the world was fleeing, where the bad guys were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Africans struggling through war or famine, ``the people with  
the cameras are often the last hope. They think that if they could 
only talk about their suffering, the world would rush to help them. 
Myles understood this role very well,'' Guttenfelder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Urschel, senior vice president of the Freedom Forum and  
president of the Newseum, said Tierney's name will be added to a 
memorial in Washington honoring journalists killed while covering 
stories. The names of 99 other journalists, including Tierney's, 
will be added to the 934 existing names in a rededication service 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The memorial is a sobering reminder that in many parts of the  
world today, journalism remains a dangerous profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney's photograph will also be added to the AP's Wall of  
Honor at its World headquarters in New York. Tierney was the 24th 
journalist to die in the line of duty in the organization's 
150-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Tierney's sister, Loren Tierney Mumford, said her family feels  
``incredibly lucky in the midst of this horrendous pain that we got 
to see Myles realize himself so fully and so gloriously in a way 
that so few people get to do, no matter how old they live to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She then dedicated a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay to her  
brother, but not before revealing another flash of Tierney's 
irreverence. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Rejects Call To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch fired back at one of his most vocal critics today, saying 
former U.S. Olympic chief Robert Helmick had no business calling 
for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after expelling six IOC members in the organization's  
biggest corruption scandal, Samaranch expressed disdain for the 
attacks against him by Helmick, a former IOC vice president and 
U.S. Olympic Committee president who resigned from both 
organizations in 1991 over conflict-of-interest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmick's resignation was the only one ever by an IOC member in  
an ethics scandal before the current case broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmick has repeatedly called for Samaranch to resign in  
connection with the ethics scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's 
selection as host of the 2002 Winter Games, saying he should take 
responsibility for the misconduct of members that occurred under 
his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the propositions (are) coming from Helmick, for me, they  
have not any kind of value,'' Samaranch said. ``He was a man who 
had to resign because he was facing expulsion from the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch reiterated he has no plans to resign as long as he the  
support of the IOC members, who now number 106. He said ``not a 
single'' call for his resignation has come from within the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Only if he fails to win a vote of confidence at a special IOC  
general assembly March 17-18 will be resign, Samaranch said. That 
possibility is considered remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' Samaranch  
said. ``In these moments, the Olympic movement is in real danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, already the worst in Olympics history, appeared  
certain to spread as the IOC prepared to ask all bidders from the 
1996 Games onward to disclose any improper activities on the part 
of either bid committee or IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Japan, Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada acknowledged that the  
city's successful bidders for the 1998 Winter Olympics provided IOC 
officials all-expenses-paid trips to the ancient capital of Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, we were the ones who were asking to be chosen.  
It's rather difficult to turn down the requests from IOC members 
who wanted to tour Kyoto,'' Tsukada said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake, organizers said they were ``deeply saddened'' by  
the wrongdoing uncovered by the IOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these actions should not have taken place,'' said  
Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A member from Sudan who was expelled on Sunday said  
$1,000-a-month payments from Salt Lake bidders to his son were 
education-aid loans that he intended to repay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have explained this to the committee (IOC),'' Gen. Zein  
el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir told The Associated Press in Khartoum. 
``But this is an exceptional circumstance and, in such cases, we 
know the reaction would not be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another implicated member, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands,  
said official warning for his financial conduct was ``absolutely 
unjustified'' and blamed Dutch Olympic officials for his plight. 
</P>
<P>
	Geesink was cautioned because of a $5,000 payment made by the  
SLOC to the Friends of Anton Geesink Foundation, a nonprofit group 
that funds his work promoting Olympic ideals and his IOC efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not happy about it,'' Geesink told Dutch television  
today. ``I accept it, but it is absolutely unjustified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, despite statements by Samaranch and other IOC leaders  
that the 2002 Winter Games would stay in Salt Lake, another former 
Olympic host city offered to step in if a replacement was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Toni Neidlinger of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, said  
his town would ``immediately apply'' if the games were withdrawn 
from Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Alpine town was the site of the 1936 Winter Olympics  
and lost a race for the Winter Games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And the IOC received some good news -- and a tax break -- when a  
Swiss Parliament commission voted 12-11 to exempt the committee 
from a 7.5 percent value-added tax that would have cost it about 
$217,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said today that the six members who were ``temporarily  
excluded'' Sunday had effectively been expelled. If those members 
fight their ouster, they will need to seek reinstatement at the 
March session. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch virtually ruled out the chance of any of the six  
members retaining their IOC seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot imagine this,'' he said. ``The proposition to expel  
the members is very clear. All the documents will be in the hands 
of the members of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was referring to the IOC investigative report  
implicating 14 members with accepting cash payments, scholarships, 
medical services and other favors during the Salt Lake bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning, not the end of our work,'' Samaranch  
said Sunday. ``I am certain that the Olympic movement will emerge 
from the crisis stronger than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch apologized for the influence-peddling scandals and  
pledged to root out misconduct once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not have happened,'' he said. ``I am sorry. I hope  
the decisions we made today will demonstrate our resolve to never 
let this happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would broaden its investigation to  
examine allegations of misconduct in other bids stretching from the 
games of 1996 to 2006. But he stressed the 2000 Summer Games would 
definitely proceed in Sydney and that Salt Lake would keep its 
games, despite the scandal that now encompasses both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympics chief John Coates disclosed last week that  
he offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the 
night before Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes in the 1993 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the offer was not a bribe but part of an assistance  
program for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would send two top officials to Sydney to look  
into the controversy. But he said no formal investigation had been 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also announced the creation of an ethics commission,  
composed mainly of independent officials outside the IOC, to police 
the way the committee and its members do business. 
</P>
<P>
	And the IOC recommended a radical change in the selection  
process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to 
bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be 
selected this June by a 15-person body rather than the full 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure for future Olympic selections will be decided  
after the 2006 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch urged the six ousted members to ``accept their fate''  
and quit. But several have said they would fight, including African 
Olympics chief Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report found that Ganga received more than $216,000 in  
direct payments, medical and travel expenses and ``unusually 
generous'' gifts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	That was nearly half the total payments -- $440,710 -- which the  
report says went to eight members. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not include the payments made to the three  
members who resigned, two still under investigation and one who 
died. If those members are included, inquiry head Dick Pound said 
he believed the total is close to $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Members ousted were Gadir, Ganga, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador,  
Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander 
of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Geesink's warning, Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the  
Ivory Coast, Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of 
Russia remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland resigned Sunday. Finland's Pirjo  
Haeggman and Libya's Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi resigned last week. 
The late Rene Essomba of Cameroon also was cited for some $100,000 
in scholarship payments to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake  
scandals. Other inquiries -- some potentially more damaging -- are 
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice 
Department and FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah 
attorney general.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky $5,000 Hotel Cost Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Monica Lewinsky was interviewed by House  
impeachment managers in the ``Presidential Suite'' of an opulent 
Washington hotel, some wondered who was footing the bill for the 
$5,000 per night room. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office said Monday it is  
only paying for the former intern's coach airline ticket and a 
regular room at the Mayflower Hotel, where she is staying during 
her time here. The Presidential Suite was provided at no cost by 
the hotel for three House managers to meet with Ms. Lewinsky, 
according to a House Judiciary Committee spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The room is the grandest in the stunning hotel. It is the size  
of five regular rooms and rents for 25 times the rate of a single 
room.

<HEADLINE> ABL Players Give Last Salute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- A month after their league folded, the  
sense of loss lingers. Seeking closure, 15 members of the defunct 
ABL gathered on the basketball court to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day they were supposed to hold their league's all-star  
game at the San Jose Arena, the former ABL players met in a 
community college gym Sunday to give their final salute to the 
women's pro basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Azzi, who starred for the San Jose Lasers and helped  
round up players for Sunday's hoopSalute game, said the healing 
process continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you still face it. It's one thing to lose your own  
job, but that's nothing compared to this because it affects so many 
people,'' Azzi said. ``I find it hard to explain to young girls 
that come to my basketball camp. I think that's where the real loss 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players ran through the crowd for high-fives and tossed sneakers  
to fans during introductions. There were more hugs than handshakes 
on the bench. And one of the all-stars sang the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for me it's really a good feeling to be able to say  
goodbye to the fans,'' said Kate Starbird, who played for the 
Seattle Reign. ``After a month I've been through the shock phase 
and the grieving phase. I'm trying not to be sad about things, but 
to celebrate the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL folded suddenly three days before Christmas amid unpaid  
bills and an inability to withstand the challenge of the rival 
WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had known that was going to be our last game (in  
mid-December), we would have smiled more or reached out to the 
fans,'' Azzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what they did Sunday in a game that doubled as a  
memorial to the ABL. Among the bonuses for fans was hearing Naomi 
Mulitauaopele of the Reign do an unaccompanied version of the Star 
Spangled Banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans paying up to $1,500 per ticket packed the 1,600-seat  
bleachers at tiny De Anza College. Many wore Lasers shirts or other 
ABL gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to raise at least $10,000 for charities,  
including the De Anza women's team and a shelter for victims of 
domestic violence. Expenses included $5,000 per player. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was organized in 17 days by volunteers, mostly via  
e-mail. The effort was led by Gay Katilius, who quit her job as a 
sales manager for a small software firm to set up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a sense of closure,'' said Katilius, whose only  
previous exposure to the ABL was as an avid Lasers fan. ``Women are 
victims all the time. Things happen to us that we have no control 
over. I just wanted to write a happier ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment of silence was held before the game to honor ABL player  
Katrina Price, who died of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun 
blast to her head last week. Price's death intensified some of the 
sense of loss the players already had been feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sad thing is that if the ABL didn't go out,  
Katrina would have been in a hotel room preparing for a game,'' 
Starbird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Edwards, who played with Price on the Philadelphia Rage,  
said Sunday's game was a chance for players and fans to honor 
Price's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for those people to reach back out to  
her family,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer was an assistant coach for  
one of the all-star teams. She and many Lasers fans bemoan the loss 
of a team and a league that they thought represented a big step 
forward for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the league disbanded, local officials tried to hold  
the all-star game at the San Jose Arena. But that fell through, 
leaving volunteers to organize Sunday's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, we were all devastated by the ABL's folding and then by  
the cancellation of the all-star game,'' said Kristin Noel, a 
Lasers fan who bought two of the eight $1,500 tickets that were 
sold. ``Out of the ashes, a phoenix arose.''

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A self-proclaimed pastor who held church

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Tops Fidelity in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They're the biggest firms in the business, but  
Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group have strikingly different 
approaches to competing in the mutual fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity, the biggest firm in the business, has tried to beat  
the market. No. 2 Vanguard has tried to ride the market. Fidelity 
paid for research, Vanguard boasts the lowest fees in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Monday vindicate Vanguard. Net inflows into  
Vanguard's retail stock and bond funds totaled $48.9 billion in 
1998, more than four times' Fidelity's total of $11.3 billion, 
according to figures released by Financial Research Corp. on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing nine of the world's 25 top-selling funds helped  
Vanguard break the all-time record of $43 billion set by Fidelity 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vanguard has so many top-selling funds, it goes a long way to  
showing what a strong brand they have,'' said David Haywood, an 
analyst with Financial Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say 23-year-old Vanguard is riding the crest of the  
enormous popularity of funds tied to major market indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Vanguard's outspoken former chairman, John Bogle,  
brought out the personal competitiveness in Fidelity's 
publicity-shy chairman and owner, Edward M. Johnson III. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle enjoyed tweaking Fidelity for its higher fees and  
marketing expenses. He also managed to peddle Vanguard's image as 
an investor-friendly company owned by its funds, and therefore its 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say we're cheap,'' Bogle told Barron's in 1997. ``We're  
putting our shareholders first in line, where they should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity went through a low point in 1996, when many of its  
funds faltered and portfolio managers left in droves. With Vanguard 
nipping at its heels, Fidelity introduced index funds, cut its 
management fees and removed the sales charge from many of its 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity's performance has improved dramatically since mid-1997,  
with the arrival of a new investment manager who worked to retain 
portfolio managers and beefed up research. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Vanguard's stunning year for sales, it still has a way  
to go before it overtakes Fidelity, which had $752.7 billion in 
assets under management as of Dec. 31. Vanguard has $440 billion in 
assets under management. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst said Fidelity has gotten too big to be concerned  
about Vanguard alone, and should pay attention to a wider range of 
financial-services companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidelity has outgrown that universe,'' said Eric Kobren,  
president of the Kobren Insight Group. He noted the discount 
brokerage firm Charles Schwab has eaten away more of the giant 
mutual fund company's market share than has Vanguard.

<HEADLINE> For Broncos, Falcons Loses Motivate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In losing, the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons  
found the inspiration to become winners. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Broncos, the humiliating defeat to Jacksonville in the  
1996 playoffs still serves as motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never forget that game,'' league MVP Terrell Davis  
said. ``Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Falcons, a more recent loss, at San Francisco in the  
third week of this season, spurred the turnaround from perennial 
losers -- eight winning seasons in 33 years -- to NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was when the character-building on this team began, the  
second half of that San Francisco game,'' Travis Hall said of a 
31-20 loss that was 31-7 at halftime. ``The guys just decided they 
weren't going to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So don't expect either side to surrender on Sunday when the  
defending champion Broncos and the upstart Falcons meet in the 
Super Bowl. Their memories are too sharp to let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That loss came up at various times last year and this,'' Steve  
Atwater said of the 30-27 defeat by the Jaguars, the last time 
Denver lost at Mile High Stadium. ``Now, we know that is something 
we had to go through to get where we are now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still hurts to think about it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just look in the eyes of Broncos players and you'll see the fire  
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the most painful loss we could've experienced,'' Ray  
Crockett said. ``We could've been 15-1 or 14-2 that year, we had 
the home field, we were on our way. We let something very valuable 
go that could've been our only chance. We didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was painful. We definitely should've been in the Super Bowl  
that year. But it might be a big reason we've been in the Super 
Bowl the last two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Broncos learned a valuable lesson with that defeat.  
Despite owning the best record in the AFC and clinching the West by 
the end of November, they were well into their offseason when the 
NFL championship was being decided between Green Bay and New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, they are 19-0 at Mile High Stadium and have won six  
straight postseason games, including last January's Super Bowl over 
the Packers. A victory on Sunday will give them the look of a 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot of work and dedication and heartache by a lot  
of people to get there,'' Bill Romanowski said. ``After you've been 
the best, it might be natural for a letdown. But we have enough 
veterans and enough guys who remember (the Jacksonville loss) and 
who won't let it happen again. We have too many guys who enjoyed 
the experience and won't let winning not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Falcons generally have experienced for three decades is  
losing. Their biggest tormentor has been San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they made things close at 3Com Park, then won five of  
their next six before meeting the 49ers again, they felt validated. 
And when they beat the Niners 31-19 at home, they felt ready to 
contend for, well, just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the Super Bowl, which they reached for the first time  
with their scintillating comeback victory at Minnesota for the NFC 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, man, we've got guys out here who truly believe not  
only in the coaches, but the scheme and each other,'' said Jessie 
Tuggle, whose dozen years in Atlanta make him the senior Falcon. 
``When the game is on the line, someone needs to step up and make a 
play, I don't worry about, `Hey, who's going to make the play?' I 
know my teammates will come through for me like I come through for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have come through every week since Nov. 1. But it  
was that Sept. 27 defeat they tend to point toward as the turning 
point of their special year, the game they built on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 49ers ruled our division,'' Ray Buchanan said. ``When we  
showed we wouldn't back down against them, things began changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Terance Mathis, ``I said we feared no one, but we respect  
a lot of teams. We feel now we can play with any team. We don't 
quit, no matter how far behind we are.''

<HEADLINE> Carjack Slaying Suspect on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Seven years after her sister-in-law  
was brutally murdered by a serial killer, Carla Larson was abducted 
from a supermarket near Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Police immediately began a search for Mrs. Larson, a 30-year-old  
construction engineer and mother of a toddler. Her husband, Jim, 
hoped for her safe return -- and a less painful outcome than the one 
his family had endured years before. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Mrs. Larson's naked and decomposing body was  
found in the woods near the amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feelings in your stomach are basically the same,'' Larson  
said at the time, trying to recall the emotions he felt after his 
sister, Sonja, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, jury selection began in the trial of John Huggins, the  
man indicted in Mrs. Larson's June 1997 death. The trial is being 
held in Jacksonville, where the case was moved because of extensive 
media coverage in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Larson has said he wants John Huggins -- who faces charges of  
first-degree murder, carjacking, robbery and kidnapping -- to be 
executed if jurors convict him in the expected three-week trial. 
Huggins has denied committing the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else are they going to do with him? Put him back on the  
streets?'' Larson has said.

<HEADLINE> Merck Stock Falls Amid Downgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Shares of drugmaker Merck &AMP; Co. continued  
downward Monday due to investor disappointment over a research 
setback involving an experimental antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck disclosed Friday that it was delaying the final stage of  
testing for the drug, known as MK-869, after small human studies 
showed it offered no improvement compared with a dummy pill. Merck 
shares fell $7.31 1/4 after the announcement Friday. On Monday, CIBC 
Oppenheimer downgraded the firm's investment rating on Merck from a 
strong buy to a buy. The stock dropped another $1.50 Monday to 
$137.50 in the New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts had hoped MK-869, would have helped protect Merck  
from the rash of patent expirations involving its major drugs in 
the next three years. The expirations will likely cause a flood of 
cheaper generic medicines and erode Merck's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	MK-869 was also expected to shake up the $7 billion  
antidepressant market, now dominated by Eli Lilly's Prozac and 
Pfizer's Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said it was evaluating  
its options related to MK-869. Merck initially expected to start 
final stage of human testing this year. Those plans have now been 
placed on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This delay is clearly a major negative for Merck's stock,''  
said Mariola Haggar, analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with MK-869 places more pressure on Merck's other  
expected blockbuster, Vioxx, a drug for pain relief, she said. The 
Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Vioxx later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck said it still plans to move ahead with studies to use  
MK-869 to help prevent nausea in chemotherapy patients.

<HEADLINE> GTE To Sell Gov't Info System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- GTE Corp. on Monday put its 7,000-employee  
government systems division up for sale as part of a strategy of 
focusing on its high-growth telecommunications businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE Government Systems, based in Needham, Mass., is a defense  
telecommunications and government information service with 
operations in 23 states and the District of Columbia. It has 
contracts in more than 20 nations and annual sales of $1.4 billion, 
accounting for about 5 percent of GTE's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irving, Texas-based GTE said the move is part of a strategy  
announced in April to raise $3 billion to offer customers one-stop 
shopping for local telephone, long-distance, Internet access, 
wireless, video, and other services in the commercial marketplace. 
GTE earlier said it plans to sell its GTE Airfone subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are unrelated to a July agreement to merge with  
another leading phone company, Bell Atlantic Corp., GTE said. It 
hired the investment banking firm Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc. to help 
find buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government unit now on the market started as a small  
operation designing and building specialty radios and switches and 
has grown into a major player, with expertise in 
telecommunications, information and intelligence systems, and 
electronic defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE said its intent is that the potential buyers agree to hire  
all of the unit's employees in the same or comparable positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the stock market closed. GTE's stock  
closed down $4, or by nearly 6 percent, at $64.75 a share on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Status of High-Speed Rail Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at 10 high-speed rail corridors in various stages of  
discussion, planning or construction in the United States: 

</P>
<P>
	CALIFORNIA:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 676 miles and links Sacramento, the San  
Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego. 
Cost estimates range from $21 billion for standard high speed to 
$29 billion for magnetic levitation trains. The California 
Intercity High-Speed Rail Commission is studying the proposal and 
trying to obtain financing. A statewide vote is expected by 2000. 

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO-DETROIT:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 279 miles and links Ann Arbor, Mich., and  
Kalamazoo, Mich., with Detroit and Chicago. The estimated cost is 
$800 million for an incremental approach to rebuilding stations and 
improving signals along the line. Amtrak and the Michigan 
Department of Transportation hope to begin service on part of the 
corridor this year and along the full route by 2006. 

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO-MILWAUKEE-MINNEAPOLIS:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 418 miles and links Chicago, Milwaukee and  
Minneapolis, and possibly Madison, Wisc., and Wisconsin Dells. 
Incremental improvements are planned. The estimated cost for the 
stretch between Chicago and Milwaukee is $471 million. There is no 
firm price tag for the overall project. Wisconsin is working with a 
nine-state coalition to find funding. 

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO-ST. LOUIS:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 282 miles and links Springfield and  
Bloomington-Normal, Ill., to Chicago and St. Louis. The estimated 
cost is $350 million. Engineers are working on incremental 
improvements, including developing a net to prevent accidents at 
railroad crossings and a new system to control trains. Once 
completed, Illinois would seek a private-sector partner. The states 
hope to begin service in 2003. 

</P>
<P>
	GULF COAST:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 719 miles from Houston through New Orleans  
to Birmingham, Ala. Incremental improvements are planned, but 
currently there is no estimated cost. A ridership and feasibility 
study is underway. Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are working 
together to obtain funding. 

</P>
<P>
	NORTHEAST:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor runs 457 miles between Boston, New York and  
Washington. There has been a $4 billion improvement project 
underway, electrifying the track between New Haven, Conn., and 
Boston, and buying 20 new trains capable of traveling at 150 mph. 
The improvements are scheduled to debut in October. 

</P>
<P>
	PACIFIC-NORTHWEST:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 466 miles and links Portland and Seattle  
with Eugene, Ore., and Vancouver, B.C. The estimated cost is $1.865 
billion. The project would entail a series of incremental 
improvements to push train speeds up to 125 mph. No timetable yet 
for starting the service. 

</P>
<P>
	SOUTHEAST:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 390 miles between Washington and Charlotte,  
N.C. The work would involve a series of incremental changes such as 
straightening curves to push existing rail speeds up to 110 mph. 
There is no cost estimate, although Virginia said it would cost 
$350 million to add a second track to the corridor. There is no 
starting date for the 110 mph service. 

</P>
<P>
	TEXAS TRIANGLE:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor runs in a 436-mile triangle between Dallas, Houston  
and San Antonio. The estimated cost is $4 billion. In 1989, the 
state awarded a franchise to build the line, but the franchise was 
terminated in 1994. While the project is now dormant, the state 
Transportation Department has been talking with private investors 
and rail companies about making incremental improvements along the 
corridor. 

</P>
<P>
	UPSTATE NEW YORK:   	
</P>
<P>
	The corridor covers 431 miles and links Rochester, Syracuse and  
Albany, N.Y., with New York and Buffalo. The estimated cost is $315 
million, much of which is for improving the condition and 
technology of the existing rail lines. The work should be completed 
by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Local Phone Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court backed the federal  
government's efforts Monday to open the $110 billion local phone 
market to competition. The ruling means consumers are more likely 
to get more choices for local phone service faster and cheaper, 
government regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court, in a 5-3 decision, said a 1996 law gives the  
Federal Communications Commission the power to set pricing 
guidelines for long-distance companies and other potential 
competitors to connect with local phone companies' networks. Rivals 
need to do this to offer competing local service. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling overturns a 1997 decision by a federal appeals court  
in St. Louis that said states -- not the FCC -- have this power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruling is a defeat for the five regional Baby  
Bells, GTE and state regulators, and a big -- although not complete 
-- victory for the FCC and long-distance companies. The ruling 
boosts the federal government's ability to spur competition for 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a monumental victory for consumers who want choice  
among telephone providers,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. AT&AMP;T 
and MCI agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America estimated savings of about  
$10 a month off total residential phone bills as a result of local 
phone competition. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators and big local phone companies had argued that  
the price rules must be set by the states because the 1996 law 
didn't explicitly give that power to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I'm disappointed,'' said Bob Rowe of the National  
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which represents 
state telecommunications regulators. The decision, he said, 
underscores the need for state and federal regulators to work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing matter now returns to the St. Louis court, where the  
substance of the FCC's price rules, which the high court did not 
address, will be examined to determine whether they are consistent 
with the 1996 law, attorneys for Bell Atlantic, GTE and US West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous victory for consumers on all fronts,''  
said Sprint spokeswoman Eileen Doherty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competitors don't have to juggle the rules and rates of 50  
states,'' added Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Roellig, executive vice president of US West, said  
federal involvement won't accelerate local competition because 
states already have issues rules and rates similar to those from 
the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In another action, the Supreme Court vacated a government rule  
that forces local phone companies to give their rivals blanket 
access to any piece of the local network they want. The court said 
the FCC didn't adequately consider whether rivals could obtain 
these pieces elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Roellig said this part of the ruling will make it difficult for  
the FCC to require local phone companies to provide rivals with 
access to new high-speed Internet connections, something the FCC is 
considering doing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC attorneys, speaking on condition of not being further  
identified, acknowledged that the FCC's Internet data proposal 
could be delayed as a result of the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion,  
were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas  
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who 
long has owned AT&AMP;T stock, did not participate.

<HEADLINE> Seattle To Host Global Trade Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced Monday  
that it has selected Seattle as the site for a meeting of 133 
nations that will launch a new round of global trade talks in late 
November and early December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the largest trade event ever held in the United  
States and it will inaugurate global negotiations which will shape 
world trade as we move to the next century,'' U.S. Trade 
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in making the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks will be held under the auspices of the World Trade  
Organization, the Geneva based body that serves as a referee for 
trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton first raised the possibility of a new round of  
global trade negotiations in a speech to the WTO last May in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	He also discussed the negotiations in his State of the Union  
speech last Tuesday. The administration hopes to use the talks to 
lower trade barriers to counter growing projectionist forces that 
have been unleashed with the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, more than 40 U.S. cities had expressed an interest in  
serving as host for the meetings, which will be held from Nov. 30 
to Dec. 3. That group was narrowed to six finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The other five finalists were Dallas, Denver, Detroit, San Diego  
and Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Court: FCC Can Set Phone Price Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reinstated federal  
rules aimed at quickly opening the $110 billion local telephone 
market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in splintered voting, said a 1996 law lets the  
Federal Communications Commission set pricing rules for 
long-distance companies and others that want to start offering 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a big, although not complete, victory for the  
government's goal of speedily letting customers nationwide choose 
their local phone company much as they now can choose a 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had argued that such competition will  
happen sooner if price rules are set by the federal government 
rather than by each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators and companies that now monopolize local phone  
service had said the pricing rules must be set by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the Federal  
Communications Commission has general jurisdiction to implement the 
local-competition provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be gross understatement to say that the  
Telecommunications Act of 1996 is not a model of clarity,'' Scalia 
wrote. ``It is in many important respects a model of ambiguity or 
indeed even self-contradiction. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``But Congress is well aware that the ambiguities it chooses to  
produce in a statute will be resolved by the implementing agency. 
... We can only enforce the clear limits that the 1996 act 
contains,'' Scalia added. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they lost today, state regulators and local phone  
companies still can return to a lower court and challenge the 
substance of the federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, four of the eight court members wrote opinions in the  
case. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who long has owned AT&AMP;T stock, 
did not participate in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also upheld most of the FCC's rules aimed at  
prohibiting local phone companies from separating parts of their 
network and then requiring a customer who leases those parts to pay 
the cost of reassembling them. The commisision contends that such 
``unbundling'' imposes unneeded costs on a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices said the FCC ``did not adequately consider''  
all factors when it passed a rule requiring a local phone company 
to provide competitors with access to various local network 
elements. The court concluded that the commission's Rule 319 is 
inconsistent with the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also ruled that the commission can impose a ``pick and  
choose'' rule on local phone companies, which allows competitors to 
buy or lease any service or network element under the same terms as 
they were provided under any previous agreement -- without having to 
accept the entire agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of local phone competition hope it will lead to lower  
prices like the 70 percent drop in long-distance costs after 
competition was introduced during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling reversed key portions of a federal appeals court  
decision that said the FCC could not regulate the prices 
competitors must pay to connect to local phone companies' networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the federal government in supporting the FCC price rules  
were long-distance companies, including AT&AMP;T and MCI, that hope to 
begin offering local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing the federal rules were state utility regulators and  
existing local phone monopolies such as Bell Atlantic and 
BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to let the FCC set the pricing rules was 5-3. Joining  
Scalia were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas  
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting on other aspects of the dispute also was split.  
</P>
<P>
	The case is AT&AMP;T vs. Iowa Utilities Board, 97-826.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo To Close 4 Frito-Lay Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay division is closing  
four of its oldest manufacturing plants employing 850 people in a 
move to boost productivity at the snack food industry leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Frito-Lay will expand capacity at five other plants in a move  
that could add 400 jobs there, Frito-Lay officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The net impact would be to reduce Frito-Lay's domestic work  
force of about 40,000 people by about 450 jobs, or a bit more than 
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo, the Purchase, N.Y.-based conglomerate that owns the  
nation's second-largest soft drink company as well as Frito-Lay, 
also announced Monday it is swapping bottling operations with its 
biggest independent bottler, Whitman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get rights to bottle Pepsi products in several  
Midwestern states and in Eastern Europe in exchange for a 
combination of cash, stock and bottling rights in Virginia, West 
Virginia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Frito-Lay plants that will be closed over the next six  
to eight months are in Chamblee, Ga., Salisbury, N.C., Jackson, 
Miss., and Marlborough, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Frito-Lay plans to expand its plants in Lynchburg, Va.,  
Jonesboro, Ark., Fayetteville, Tenn., Perry, Ga., and Killingly, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Frito-Lay is the leader in the snack food industry, with  
products like Lay's, Doritos and Tostitos chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottling deal continued PepsiCo's efforts to consolidate  
bottling of Pepsi products at a smaller number of large bottling 
businesses. The bigger bottlers are expected to serve expanding 
retail customers better. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo plans to sell a majority stake in its company-owned  
bottling business, which accounts for about 54 percent of the 
volume of Pepsi-Cola products sold domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman is its biggest independent bottler, accounting for about  
12 percent of Pepsi's domestic sales volume. After the deal 
announced Monday, it would handle about 17 percent of U.S. Pepsi 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman will get PepsiCo bottling territories in Illinois,  
Indiana, Missouri and Ohio as well as in the Czech Republic, the 
Slovak Republic, Hungary and Poland. Those businesses generated 
$720 million in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo will get about $300 million in cash, stock representing  
about a 35 percent stake in Whitman and bottling operations in 
Marion, Va., Princeton, W. Va., and St. Petersburg, Russia, with 
combined 1998 revenue of about $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo currently owns 20 percent of Whitman's bottling  
division.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal of Clinton Case Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans remain deeply divided over  
whether to end President Clinton's impeachment trial early as they 
turn to the issue of calling witnesses or bringing the proceedings 
to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, meanwhile, were considering a plan that  
would allow the Senate to find Clinton guilty of perjury and 
obstruction of justice -- but not remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, Republican officials said, was predicated on the  
widely held assumption that the 67 votes needed to convict and 
remove Clinton would never materialize. This way, Clinton would 
emerge from the trial acquitted but irrevocably tarnished -- and 
senators would be afforded cover with constituents who believe 
Clinton should be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that is not meeting a great deal of opposition in  
the Republican caucus,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki told 
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats questioned whether the proposal was constitutional.  
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors were pressing for new testimony with a  
shortened list of witnesses today, saying the Senate shouldn't be 
forced into a quick exit strategy by polls showing the majority of 
the public continues to believe Clinton shouldn't be kicked out of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``A trial is a search for the truth and it should not be trumped  
by an exit strategy,'' Hyde told the Senate on Monday during final 
arguments on a motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
case without a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans were expected to produce a formal proposal for  
witnesses today, to be voted on after the Democratic attempt to 
dismiss the charges. Votes are expected by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before senators went into a rare closed session Monday to debate  
Byrd's motion, the White House argued that the case was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case cannot be made. It is time to end it,'' said attorney  
Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	But several GOP senators were sticking to their belief that the  
president should be removed. They insisted that witnesses be called 
to substantiate charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are weary of this thing,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,  
R-Okla, who wants to see witnesses called to address discrepancies 
in testimony. ``All of us would like to see it terminate before too 
long, but we want to do it correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of their GOP colleagues want Republican leaders to find  
an endgame strategy that would resolve the case as early as this 
week, rather than call witnesses, according to two officials 
speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki confirmed that Republican leaders were seriously  
looking at a plan by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to allow the 
Senate to find Clinton guilty without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' would allow senators to declare that  
Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice, but also allow them 
to find him not guilty in subsequent votes on the articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	To steady the wavering Republican support, House prosecutors  
trimmed their witness list Monday to three people: Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential secretary Betty Currie and a third person yet to be 
determined, according to a knowledgeable Republican who demanded 
anonymity. This official said the third person was likely to be 
Vernon Jordan, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta or Clinton 
confidante Bruce Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to prioritize this and get down to the bare minimum  
and not run the risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on 
too many,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., a member of the House 
team prosecuting the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--The White House, confident of Clinton's ability to win eventual  
acquittal, announced it would ignore a written list of questions 
submitted by Lott and other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	--An attempt by two Democrats to open the debate to the public  
was rejected, 57-43. A two-thirds majority was needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats expressed confidence they could produce enough votes  
to make it clear that Clinton eventually will be acquitted on the 
impeachment charges. It takes a majority vote to dismiss the 
charges, but two-thirds to convict the president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, met with Democratic Sen. Edward  
Kennedy, D-Mass., on what officials said was a GOP suggestion for a 
limited number of witnesses to be questioned in private on a 
compressed timetable before a final vote. No deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in both parties have begun to call in increasing  
numbers for an end to the trial, which has consumed virtually all 
the Senate's time since it convened on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic support for Clinton has hardened over that period,  
virtually assuring his acquittal when the final vote is called.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Barry Has Big Predecessor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Brent Barry's been following famous  
people all his life. He's one of Rick Barry's kids, even though his 
relationship with his father admittedly is ``rocky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 6-foot-6 guard, who won the NBA slam dunk contest three  
years ago and who's known for his flashy play and no-look passes, 
has joined the new-look Chicago Bulls as their shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a position a guy named Jordan played with distinction for  
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does play well in Chicago, then they think they've got  
the next Michael Jordan,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, who signed a six-year, $27 million deal Monday with the  
Bulls, had several options as a free agent, including Golden State, 
which recently gave former Bulls forward Jason Caffey a seven-year, 
$35 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Going back to Miami was another. But his short stay there last  
season after being traded from the Los Angeles Clippers was not 
pleasant. He struggled with both an ankle injury and the Heat's 
system and was left off the playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry met with the Bulls last week, dined with new coach Tim  
Floyd and did some checking on his own, calling Indiana Pacers 
guard Fred Hoiberg, who played for Floyd at Iowa State. He also 
liked Chicago's triangle offense, which rewards players who move 
without the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing what I know about this system, obviously with Scottie  
(Pippen) and Michael playing here, you can't defend it -- even when 
Randy Brown and Jud Buechler were in the game -- so that helps the 
players,'' Barry said Monday after his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``(General manager) Jerry Krause saw me play in college -- he saw  
me more times than my dad did. He knows my game, they wanted me on 
draft day three years ago, so I know I'm wanted here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said his relationship with Riley is not bad. Miami sent  
Isaac Austin, Charles Smith and a first-round pick to the Clippers 
for Barry last February. After averaging 13.7 points in 41 games 
for Los Angeles, he averaged only 4.1 in 17 games for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat recently lost shooting guard Voshon Lenard for an  
extend period with a stress fracture of his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coach Riley is a little upset that he got nothing out  
of the deal he made last year,'' Barry said. ``He's a good coach 
and unfortunately things didn't work out for me in Miami. The fact 
they don't have a `2' guard right now, I think he's a little 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't the option for me. I decided to come to Chicago  
and do my thing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, who has two brothers in the NBA and another playing  
professionally in Germany, got a long-term deal from the Bulls, who 
are rebuilding after Jordan's retirement. They've sent Pippen to 
Houston and are looking forward to the summer when they can go free 
agent shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't like to go the next day to a New Year Eve's party,''  
Barry said. ``The floor is sticky and the stuff is still in the 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no fun to be part of the cleanup crew, but hopefully that  
will only last a year or two and you get back to where the team was 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry also cited the chance to play with Toni Kukoc, who also  
likes to make open-floor, no-look passes, and a good feeling about 
Floyd as factors in his decision. Not to mention the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm silly to come here but he (Floyd) is crazy to be coaching  
here,'' Barry said. ``That's the way I look at it. Any guy that 
crazy I want to play for. I talked to Fred Hoiberg and he had great 
things to say about him and on that recommendation my decision was 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I was crazy to come here?'' Floyd said. ``That  
makes the two of us crazy, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a piece to our future, a great piece.''  
</P>
<P>
	Barry's father, like Jordan and Pippen, was chosen one of the  
NBA's 50 greatest players. Father and son are not close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship between me and my dad has been rocky, but  
it's something we're trying to work on,'' Barry said. ``It's no 
different than a lot of people who have situations between family 
members. I think he likes my game. I hope he does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, the Bulls renounced the rights to forward Scott  
Burrell.

<HEADLINE> Health Benefits Costs Seen Up 9 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of steady growth, the proportion of  
workers joining health maintenance organizations fell in 1998 as 
employees switched to more flexible plans, according to a new 
employer survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell whether the decline in HMO enrollment  
is a short-term phenomenon or more ominously a sign that these 
managed care plans may not be the centerpiece of the nation's 
health care delivery system after all,'' said Blaine Bos, a 
consultant for William M. Mercer, the employee benefits firm which 
conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer survey of nearly 4,200 employers, released Monday,  
found that enrollment in HMOs, and HMO point-of-service plans -- 
plans that give some out of network coverage -- dropped to 47 
percent in 1998 from 50 percent the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, preferred provider organizations grew from 35  
percent to 40 percent in 1998. PPOs are a less restrictive form of 
managed care in which consumers pay less if they use doctors in the 
network, but they don't have to. Unlike HMOs, PPOs do not require 
consumers to visit their primary care doctor before seeing 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are moving into a PPO so not to have to deal with a  
gatekeeper,'' Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
	PPOs have grown steadily in the past five years, rising from 27  
percent of employees in 1993. Traditional insurance has dropped 
from 48 percent of employees in 1993 to 13 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that most employers expect the cost of  
providing health benefits for workers will rise 9 percent this 
year, the biggest increase in seven years. In 1998, health benefits 
costs rose 6.1 percent, Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers blamed the increases on rising premiums charged by  
health plans and skyrocketing drug costs. To deal with rising 
costs, employers are continuing to drop coverage for retirees and 
are reducing drug benefits for some active workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the percentage of companies with 500 or more workers  
providing health benefits retirees over age 65 fell to 36 percent, 
down from 46 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As for active workers, about one-third of employers said they  
cut prescription drug benefits, either by reducing choice of 
certain drugs or asking workers to pick up a higher share of the 
costs. In come cases, workers have been paying higher 
``co-payments'' on each prescription they buy. Co-payments that 
used to average $5 or $10 per prescription can now be as high as 
$20 or even $40. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying the higher benefit costs is the fact that health  
plans are facing a profit squeeze due to their inability to pull 
the reins in on rising health costs. Those plans are now passing on 
their higher costs to employers, and this, in turn affects 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer study found the average health benefit cost per  
employee was $4,164 last year, the first time it topped $4,000. The 
average cost varied widely, from a low of $3,438 in the South to 
$4,340 per employee in the Northeast, the study found. The regional 
differences were attributed to the impact of health maintenance 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs require that patients choose doctors only from those in a  
network of physicians who have agreed to accept lower fees. HMOs 
closely monitor care and require that a primary care physician 
approve all care by specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found costs rising in all three major types of health  
plans-- HMOs, preferred provider organizations and traditional 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercer survey covered employers with 10 or more workers. It  
was conducted by mail and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Taylor Offers No Apologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor has no apologies and no remorse for  
the drug and personal problems that could jeopardize his election 
this week to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize for anything,'' Taylor said Monday in a  
conference call with reporters, some of whom are on the Hall of 
Fame voting panel. ``There are some things in all our lives we wish 
we could change. Unfortunately, we can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past is the past. I can't worry about it. I can't dwell on  
it. There are consequences for every choice you make. Every day of 
my life, I've known there are consequences. From when I was a 
little boy and learned right from wrong, you know there's 
consequences for everything you do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the choices I made. When my days are over  
I'll have to answer for everything I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's playing career was interrupted by a four-game  
suspension in 1988 when he tested positive for drugs. Since 
retiring, he has been arrested twice on drug charges, pleaded 
guilty to filing false federal tax returns and declared bankrupcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified before a grand jury investigating organized  
crime, his driver's license was suspended for outstanding parking 
tickets, and he received three summonses for leaving the scene of 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the baseball Hall of Fame, there is no citizenship  
criteria for election to Canton. The bylaws of the Pro Football 
shrine speak only of a nominee's achievements and contributions as 
a player, coach or contributor in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	That would seem to include Taylor, one of the most dominant  
linebackers in the game for 13 seasons. And he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the bylaws, it should be a no-brainer,'' he said.  
``If you start going by off-the-field problems, you might have to 
kick out half the people in that Hall of Fame right now. I leave my 
Hall of Fame fate up to the voters. If I don't get in, I don't get 
in. That's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be elected, a candidate needs 80 percent of the vote from  
those present at Saturday's election. If all 36 electors show up, 
Taylor would need votes from 29 of them. A minimum of four and 
maximum of seven of the 15 finalists will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a first-year candidate, knows there will be some  
opposition because of his history, which includes a number of drug 
rehabilitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of life,'' he said. ``Everybody can't be as perfect  
as everybody in that room. We make our choices and they have 
consequences. If my consequences mean not going to the Hall of 
Fame, you guys decide. I'm not losing sleep over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be there. I expect to be there. If you want to say  
LT had problems, I'm guilty. If you want to say LT had controversy, 
guilty. If you want to say there will be more controversy, guilty. 
I have that problem. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're asking me to apologize or be remorseful for what  
I've done, I can't do that. I can't tell you what I would have done 
or could have done. I thank God I'm alive and able to have this 
conversation. There are some things I'd like to change but I can't 
change. I'm happy with who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor is in south Florida this week, filming an Oliver Stone  
football movie titled ``On Any Given Sunday.'' He expects to return 
Sunday to New Jersey, where his son is to undergo knee surgery.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Clashes With Moscow Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright clashed with  
a potential Russian presidential candidate over a U.S. missile 
defense proposal and other issues, but failed Monday to meet with 
ailing President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunt encounter between Albright and Moscow Mayor Yuri  
Luzhkov, a possible successor to Yeltsin, underscored U.S. and 
Russian differences on a host of issues including U.S. policy in 
Iraq to the Balkans, Russian technology transfers to Iran, and an 
emerging U.S. plan to build a missile defense shield. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was still in the Central Clinical Hospital with an ulcer  
and made clear he would not meet with Albright. While her aides had 
said she intended to talk with Yeltsin on the telephone, 
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin had nothing to say about 
that and no call had gone through by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's press service said Monday the president was ``in  
stable and satisfactory condition,'' but gave no further details 
about his health. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Albright has been doing most of her business with  
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, 
holding separate talks with them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to Moscow to pursue cooperation where I can, and  
to understand better the disagreements we do have,'' Albright told 
advocates of human rights at the Foreign Language library. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the slump in relations, Luzhkov warned at the outset  
that he intended to be blunt. He challenged Albright on U.S. policy 
on Iraq, Kosovo, missile defenses and technology sales by Russian 
firms to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzhkov's core complaint was the United States had moved forward  
without taking Russia's concerns completely into account, a senior 
U.S. official told reporters after Albright and Luzhkov met. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stood her ground, telling the mayor U.S. bombing of  
Iraq and pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over 
Kosovo were correct. She assured Luzhkov that while the Clinton 
administration was embarked on a search for a missile defense it 
considers the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the former 
Soviet Union important to U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very little ground was given on either side,'' said the U.S.  
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. official called the exchange not unusual for Albright  
and that one purpose of her visit was to get a sampling of views 
from various political quarters. Albright called the exchange 
``good and useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayor Luzhkov raised issues of American policy which I hope I  
was able to clarify in order to resolve some misunderstandings 
which exist,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Luzhkov, also took aim at Yeltsin, saying that the  
president's frequent illnesses were undermining the government. 
Luzhkov has not made a final announcement about seeking the 
presidency, but he has been taking steps to boost his profile, 
including the meeting with Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright sympathized with the ``hard times'' Russians are  
experiencing amid a battered economy, as her strategic advisers 
sought an understanding on reduced levels of tanks and other 
military equipment in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	At the library, Albright announced that the United States would  
boost to $63 million the assistance it gives to bolster Russian 
democracy. Part of the aid will finance a fellowship in Washington 
for Russian scholars in conflict prevention and human rights. Some 
$10 million will be committed to help independent newspapers to 
overcome falling advertising revenue.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Rejoins Rockets at Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley has put away his golf clubs.  
</P>
<P>
	It's time to join Scottie Pippen and the rest of his Houston  
Rockets teammates for Tuesday night's exhibition opener against the 
San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley missed the Rockets' first four practices while playing  
in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in California. But he was back at 
work Monday, catching barbs from teammates about his unorthodox 
golf game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a chance to play golf with Michael Jordan in Palm  
Springs or go to two-a-days,'' Barkley said. ``That's a no-brainer. 
Some guy said `You're not a very good golfer,' and I told him 
imagine how good I'll be in two-a-days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, who had off-season elbow and hernia operations, may not  
have been happy to be sweating through practice, but his teammates 
were happy to see him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have him back. There's a little more noise around  
here,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We had competitive workouts 
before, but when he is here it's stepped up. He's so competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens on the golf course is another matter. And teammates  
Matt Bullard and Eddie Johnson let him know David Duval has no 
reason to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I come in here and they've all got tired legs,'' Barkley  
said. ``Me, I feel very refreshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Barkley joining Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon, the Rockets  
again have three players who were voted among the top 50 players in 
NBA history. Clyde Drexler, who retired after last season, also is 
on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have him here so he can get accustomed to the  
new players, namely myself and the other guys,'' Pippen said. ``We 
have to know how Charles plays and where he likes his spacing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, who missed 14 games with injuries last season, was done  
for good after tearing his right tricep after colliding with Utah's 
Greg Foster in a first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	His average of 15.2 points a game was his lowest since averaging  
14 as a rookie in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a nightmare with two hernias,'' Barkley said.  
``I was disappointed the way I played because I never felt good 
physically. Now, I've got all my physical ailments out of the way 
and I'm going to have a great season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich didn't complain about Barkley's late arrival.  
Instead, he praised Barkley for signing at the $1 million minimum 
salary, freeing enough money to sign Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many players would do what he's done,''  
Tomjanovich said. ``His plan was to explore his options, which is 
his right. When he found out he was the pivotal guy in us getting 
Scottie, he scrapped that whole plan. He made a sacrifice for this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets didn't hold their first workouts until Saturday  
because of delays in completing Pippen's signed. Tomjanovich wished 
for more time to get ready for the first of two exhibitions games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (Tuesday's game) is like a practice and not a good practice  
because I can only work five guys at a time,'' Tomjanovich said. 
``I'd like those guys to come over and scrimmage for about 10 
quarters.''

<HEADLINE> `Big Play Ray' No Slouch With Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Big Play Ray? No doubt about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Mouth Ray? That fits, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's shutting down Randy Moss or guaranteeing a Super  
Bowl victory for the Atlanta Falcons, Ray Buchanan puts a bulls eye 
on his chest every day and stands willingly in front of the firing 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the consummate NFL cornerback, a star student in Deion  
101. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person I fear is God,'' Buchanan preaches to the  
assembled congregation. ``Everybody else is a pea in the pod.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Deion Sanders, Buchanan combines superior athletic skills  
with a steadfast arrogance that he's the best. When he looks across 
the line and sees someone like Moss or Jerry Rice, not a bit of 
trepidation creeps into Buchanan's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can go out there and cut you with a butter knife and find  
out you bleed, then I know you're human,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a Pro Bowler who ranked second in the NFC with seven  
interceptions, stirred up a tempest last week when he guaranteed a 
victory Sunday over the Denver Broncos, a la Joe Namath 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While it was clear he was goaded into making the prediction by  
Cris Collinsworth during an appearance on HBO's ``Inside the NFL,'' 
Buchanan refuses to distance himself from his inflammatory words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's mindset has got to be on winning this game,'' he  
said. ``I'm not going to back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl-savvy Broncos were stunned that someone would  
actually go on record with such a bold prediction, no matter what 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you crazy?'' defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``If you  
don't have confidence going out there, you're going to get yourself 
killed. But to speak your mind and say you guarantee a win, that's 
a little deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan spoke with equal confidence before the NFC  
championship game against Minnesota, viewing the Vikings' 
high-scoring offense with downright disdain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons started out with Buchanan matched one-on-one against  
Cris Carter, while the other cornerback, Michael Booker, covered 
Moss with help from safety Eugene Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't work as the Vikings scored on their four  
possessions, including a touchdown pass to Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember vividly in the game when I came up to him and said,  
`Man, that Randy Moss cat is fast,''' Booker recalled. ``Ray says, 
`He ain't that fast! I can take him!' I couldn't believe it. He 
really wanted to play Randy Moss man-to-man all over that field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan got his wish, working more and more against Moss. The  
Vikings' rookie managed only one catch for 4 yards after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always goes out there with a sense of arrogance that he  
can't be beat,'' Booker said in admiration. ``And if he does get 
beat, he's going too come back and make a play right after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Falcons had in mind two years ago when they  
lured Buchanan away from the Indianapolis Colts with a four-year, 
$13 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves recognized right away that the secondary was  
the team's most pressing need. The Falcons surrendered an NFL 
record for passing yards in 1995 and had been looking for a decent 
coverage cornerback ever since Sanders left following the '93 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can cover anybody in this league one-on-one,,'' defensive  
coordinator Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of Buchanan allows the Falcons to be more flexible  
in their defensive schemes. They can bring strong safety William 
White closer to the line to help against the run. They can call 
more blitzes without fear of Buchanan getting beat downfield. They 
can allow Robinson to float to Booker's side of the field, helping 
out the second-year cornerback who's still perfecting his coverage 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan compensates for his lack of height -- he's only 5-foot-9  
-- by always seeming to be in the right position. 
</P>
<P>
	``His balance and body control is outstanding,'' Brooks said.  
``He has great explosion out of the break. Once he sees what a 
receiver is going to do, he can plant and drive on it as quick as 
anybody in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, on yeah, he's got the requisite bravado to play the  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't play corner in this league with a lack of  
confidence,'' Brooks said. ``If you do, you're going to get your 
brains beat out because you'll be worrying, `Oh, I hope they don't 
throw to my side.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray is sitting back there going, `Throw it to my side. I'm  
going to get a pick and I'm going to score.'''

<HEADLINE> RNC Member's Resignation Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Anti-Defamation League on Monday  
called for a Republican National Committee member from South 
Carolina to resign from a conservative group accused of supporting 
the notion of white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be duped into believing they are mainstream  
conservatives,'' Jay Kaiman, the league's Southeast director, said 
of the Council of Conservative Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The league Monday called for Buddy Witherspoon of Lexington to  
resign from the council. Last week, RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson 
urged Republicans to withdraw. He directly appealed to Witherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Witherspoon, an orthodontist from Columbia, refused the league's  
request just as he refused Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the group is made of constituents concerned with  
conservative and Southern causes, especially the right to display 
the Confederate flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, fights  
anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Ga., have both distanced themselves from the group and its views 
after reports that they spoke at council meetings.

<HEADLINE>  Hit-Man Atwater Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- His chronically sore shoulders are a testament to  
the intimidating hits he has delivered to wide receivers and 
running backs for the past 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 total tackles ... 12 forced fumbles ... 24  
interceptions ... 89 passes defensed ... and countless warnings: 
Pain zone ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Since entering the league, Denver Broncos safety Steve Atwater  
has started 155 games in the regular season and 13 in the 
postseason, missing only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	But last season and again this season, he failed to post 100  
tackles for the only times in his career, a sure sign that his body 
finally is beginning to wear down. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been selected to his eighth Pro Bowl and his  
third as a starter, Atwater has given increasing thought to his 
future and might opt to retire, producing a leadership void in the 
Broncos' defense similar to the effect of John Elway's expected 
retirement on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to end sometime, but whether or not it's this year,  
I haven't decided,'' Atwater said. ``It would take away from my 
preparation to think about it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his healthier moments, the Broncos' hit man doesn't believe  
he is ready to leave the game. This could be his last season with 
the Broncos, however. Or it might be his last season as a full-time 
starter, because young safeties Eric Brown and George Coghill 
already have seen increased playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said. ``I hope it's not my last year  
with the Broncos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft choice from Arkansas in 1989, Atwater was  
selected to the Pro Bowl his second season, beginning a string of 
seven straight Pro Bowl appearances that set a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the ``smiling assassin'' by former assistant coach  
Charlie Waters because of his sunny off-field disposition and his 
bone-jarring tackling, Atwater established his reputation in his 
second season. That's when he stopped Kansas City's mammoth running 
back, Christian Okoye, with a thunderous collision in a memorable 
Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 6-foot-3, 217-pound Atwater has endured his second  
straight sub-par regular season, he has continued to excel in the 
postseason. To many NFL observers, Atwater's play in last January's 
Super Bowl victory over Green Bay set a standard for free safeties. 
</P>
<P>
	He had six tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and two passes  
defensed. 
</P>
<P>
	His sack of Brett Favre caused a fumble that was recovered by  
Neil Smith, setting up a field goal for a 17-7 lead in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he had one of the game's biggest pass breakups on a  
third-and-8 from the Broncos' 39-yard line early in the fourth 
quarter, knocking away a pass intended for Robert Brooks that would 
have given Green Bay a first down inside the Broncos' 25-yard line 
with the score tied 24-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to get around the ball and make some plays,'' he  
said. ``That's all any player wants, an opportunity to make some 
plays. I'm hoping I can get the opportunity to get around the ball 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much difference in preparing for regular-season  
games and playoff games, except, you know, it's do-or-die. You 
either win or you go home. I'm not ready to go home.''

<HEADLINE>  Albright Clashes With Moscow Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright clashed with  
a potential Russian presidential candidate over a U.S. missile 
defense proposal and other issues, but failed Monday to meet with 
ailing President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunt encounter between Albright and Moscow Mayor Yuri  
Luzhkov, a possible successor to Yeltsin, underscored U.S. and 
Russian differences on a host of issues including U.S. policy in 
Iraq to the Balkans, Russian technology transfers to Iran, and an 
emerging U.S. plan to build a missile defense shield. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was still in the Central Clinical Hospital with an ulcer  
and made clear he would not meet with Albright. While her aides had 
said she intended to talk with Yeltsin on the telephone, 
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin had nothing to say about 
that and no call had gone through by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's press service said Monday the president was ``in  
stable and satisfactory condition,'' but gave no further details 
about his health. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Albright has been doing most of her business with  
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, 
holding separate talks with them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to Moscow to pursue cooperation where I can, and  
to understand better the disagreements we do have,'' Albright told 
advocates of human rights at the Foreign Language library. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the slump in relations, Luzhkov warned at the outset  
that he intended to be blunt. He challenged Albright on U.S. policy 
on Iraq, Kosovo, missile defenses and technology sales by Russian 
firms to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzhkov's core complaint was the United States had moved forward  
without taking Russia's concerns completely into account, a senior 
U.S. official told reporters after Albright and Luzhkov met. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stood her ground, telling the mayor U.S. bombing of  
Iraq and pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over 
Kosovo were correct. She assured Luzhkov that while the Clinton 
administration was embarked on a search for a missile defense it 
considers the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the former 
Soviet Union important to U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very little ground was given on either side,'' said the U.S.  
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. official called the exchange not unusual for Albright  
and that one purpose of her visit was to get a sampling of views 
from various political quarters. Albright called the exchange 
``good and useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayor Luzhkov raised issues of American policy which I hope I  
was able to clarify in order to resolve some misunderstandings 
which exist,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Luzhkov, also took aim at Yeltsin, saying that the  
president's frequent illnesses were undermining the government. 
Luzhkov has not made a final announcement about seeking the 
presidency, but he has been taking steps to boost his profile, 
including the meeting with Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright sympathized with the ``hard times'' Russians are  
experiencing amid a battered economy, as her strategic advisers 
sought an understanding on reduced levels of tanks and other 
military equipment in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	At the library, Albright announced that the United States would  
boost to $63 million the assistance it gives to bolster Russian 
democracy. Part of the aid will finance a fellowship in Washington 
for Russian scholars in conflict prevention and human rights. Some 
$10 million will be committed to help independent newspapers to 
overcome falling advertising revenue.

<HEADLINE> Report: Insurers Push Cheap Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many insurers push ``shoddy'' and even dangerous  
knockoff replacement parts on car owners after a crash, Consumer 
Reports magazine found in a study issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, in the magazine's February issue, found replacement  
bumpers that crumpled with little resistance, poorly fitting 
fenders prone to rust, and hoods with faulty latches that allow 
them to open at high speeds. Consumers Union, a nonprofit group 
that publishes the magazine, is urging Congress and states to 
regulate the industry and require car owners' consent before 
imitation parts are used. 
</P>
<P>
	Most insurers endorse imitation parts because they come as much  
as 65 percent cheaper. Yet customers complain about knockoff parts 
twice as often, according to a survey of 500 repair shops done for 
the auto industry by Industrial Marketing Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Della Rova grew concerned over replacement parts after  
the hood of his Honda Accord flew into his windshield on the 
highway near Kutztown, Pa., in 1998. A damage appraiser blamed a 
cheap imitation hood made in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in price can be substantial. A replacement hood  
for the Accord cost about $100, compared with about $225 for a hood 
made by Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a major reason why insurers call for imitation parts 59  
percent of the time, according to Industrial Marketing Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one major insurer of 10 questioned by Consumer Reports  
required replacement parts made by the original automaker: the 
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club of Southern 
California. The magazine said Allstate will pick up the cost for 
original parts if the customer insists. State Farm, Travelers and 
Erie require the consumer to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers warn that requiring parts from original equipment  
makers could drive up the $59 billion Americans spend each year 
replacing parts damaged in the 35 million auto accidents that occur 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry is not aware of widespread problems with  
replacement parts, said David Snyder, a lawyer with the American 
Insurance Association. Any legislative response, he added, ``should 
not be so wrapped up in red tape that it eliminates the consumer 
savings and competitive benefits of aftermarket parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone agrees that an open market for replacement parts  
has helped keep prices down. Yet parts from original automakers 
remain high. The sum of the parts on a 1998 Ford Explorer is more 
than two-and-a-half times its $27,145 list price, according to the 
Alliance of American Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union wants Congress to require the National Highway  
Traffic Safety Administration to require labeling that would allow 
authorities to track parts for recalls and to determine legal 
liability. It also wants states to require insurers to disclose how 
much they're saving with imitation parts.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Earnings Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Continued strong sales of  
prescription drugs for lowering cholesterol and treating diabetes 
helped Warner-Lambert Co. post a 45 percent increase in 
fourth-quarter profit, 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Monday it earned $341 million, or 40 cents  
a share, for the October-December period, up from $236 million, or 
28 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results matched expectations of Wall Street analysts,  
according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales rose to $2.9 billion, a 24 percent gain  
from $2.3 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, net income increased to $1.3 billion, or $1.48 a  
share, up from $870 million, or $1.04 a share, in 1997. Sales rose 
25 percent to $10.2 billion from $8.2 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales of the cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor more  
than doubled in 1998 to $2.2 billion. Lipitor is the most widely 
prescribed cholesterol drug on the U.S. market. 
</P>

	Annual sales of the diabetes treatment Rezulin increased 78  
percent to $748 million, the company said. The Food and Drug 
Administration has asked independent experts to review the safety 
of Rezulin, which it has linked to 32 deaths from liver failure in

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Monday as a  
report showed Japan's global trade surplus rising dramatically 
against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar rose against the euro as foreign exchange markets  
speculated that Europe will lower interest rates to generate growth 
despite words to the contrary from the euro-zone's central banker. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1555 in late New York trading, falling  
from $1.1580 late Friday. The dollar fell to 113.96 yen, down from 
114.54 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's global trade surplus roared to a record $121.8 billion,  
a 40.1 percent increase in 1998 over a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That included a 33.4 percent increase, to $58.3 billion, against  
the United States, the Japanese Finance Ministry reported Monday. 
The U.S. called for a lowering of the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Japanese corporations continued their fiscal  
year-end repatriation of yen to bolster balance sheets before the 
year ends on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ``good selling interest'' from those looking to  
offload dollars, said Ricardo Gomes, the head of foreign exchange 
at Republic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's working in favor of the yen,'' Gomes said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen during early trading Monday on  
continued speculation that China would devalue its currency, the 
yuan, but that dissipated as Hong Kong's leader rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg  
said Monday that the economic situation in the 11 countries making 
up the euro-zone ``justifies maintaining a steady interest-rate 
policy'' for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors discounted Duisenberg's pronouncement because  
Europe's economy still needs fixing and they believe that an 
interest rate cut will be used to spur lending and growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is still looking to a possible rate reduction,  
possibly in the first quarter,'' Gomes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.3869 Swiss francs, up from 1.3830,  
and 1.5178 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5184. The British pound 
rose to $1.6567 from $1.6554. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6926 German 
marks, up from 1.6889; 5.6754 French francs, up from 5.6657; and 
1,675.04 Italian lire, up from 1,672.24.

<HEADLINE> Bakersfield, Calif., Gets Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- This central California city got its  
first snowfall in at least 27 years, up to a half-foot that gave 
schoolchildren a rare chance to make snowmen but made travel 
difficult if not impossible today. 
</P>
<P>
	A 100-mile stretch of Interstate 5, the main highway linking  
Northern and Southern California, was closed, as was a section of 
Highway 58 linking Bakersfield and the Mojave Desert to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	There were scattered power outages and all schools in  
Bakersfield, population 200,000, were closed. Snowfall totals 
ranged up to 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's because they want to celebrate,'' said Michael  
Most, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Hanford. 
``Officially, they are doing it because of the potential travel 
problems, but I think they really want to stay home and make 
snowmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time it snowed in Bakersfield was in 1972 --  
meteorologists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been hail, though. There's a debate,'' Most  
said. ``What we're getting today is genuine snow. There are no 
qualms about it. Driving to work today, it was quite a sight to see 
snow on the cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Areas that didn't get snow got rain, and travel was difficult  
all the way south to the Mexican border. The cab of one big-rig 
hung precariously over a rain-slicked freeway overpass near 
downtown Los Angeles. The driver, dangling from his seat belt, 
managed to crawl out onto a railing to escape.

<HEADLINE> German High-Speed Train Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) -- Backers of a high-tech, super-fast  
Transrapid train link from Berlin to Hamburg said Monday it likely 
won't be ready until October 2006, a year later than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty about European Union environmental standards lay  
behind the delay for the magnetic-levitation rail, said Peter 
Jablonski, spokesman for the Transrapid Planning Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay adds further uncertainty to the controversial project.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's federal coalition government has cast doubt on the  
project, saying it would honor contracts signed by the outgoing 
government, but would not pay for any cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say it is too expensive and charge the powerful  
electromagnetic force that will drive the train could have adverse 
health consequences for humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9.8 billion marks ($5.5 billion) magnetic-levitation train  
would link Germany's two biggest cities and cut travel time for the 
297-kilometer (185-mile) trip by two-thirds, to about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	It is being paid for by the federal government and private  
companies involved in building it -- Thyssen AG, Siemens AG and 
Adtranz, a joint venture of Daimler-Chrysler and the Swiss-Swedish 
electrical engineering group ABB. 
</P>
<P>
	The state government of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, one of  
five states through which the link is to pass, also opposes the 
link and has refused it state funding.
