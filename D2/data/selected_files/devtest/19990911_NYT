<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, 134 kids _ including a 10-year-old _ are missing from
state foster homes, all runaways. But little is being done to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare officials and police say scouring the streets for
these children _ who don't want to be found anyway _ is mostly
futile. They either turn up or get picked up for other reasons _
curfew, trespassing, stealing, drinking or drugs, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Others say more should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our kids. They belong to the state of Arizona,''
says Carol Kamin, director of the Children's Action Alliance, a
non-profit advocacy group. ``If one of your children was missing,
you would be out looking for them _ driving around, calling their
friends, doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old Glendale girl in foster care who recently made
headlines for having a late-term abortion in Kansas was a chronic
runaway. But no one ever chased her down, either, family members
say.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials think the girl became pregnant while she was on
the run. She told the court that she also used alcohol and illegal
drugs while on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep an eye on her 24 hours a day, seven days a
week,'' says Bob Harkins, the girl's maternal uncle. ``And the
state didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   When a kid runs from foster care, child welfare officials file a
report with police and contact parents and school authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go looking for the child because we know that that
can be like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' especially in
urban areas, says Mary Ault, a Child Protective Services
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   If they get word about where a runaway might be _ at the home of
a friend or relative _ they will go look for the kid. But Ault says
the agency simply doesn't have enough staff to spend hours looking
for these kids. There are almost 7,000 kids in state foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Even the police don't search for known runaways, particularly
teenagers, Mesa Police Det. Jose Martinez says. Officers will
follow up on any initial leads and then put information on a
national computerized list of missing juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they run across these kids while on patrol, but they
don't hunt them down or go door-to-door as they would for a missing
child.
</P>
<P>
   Police do look for runaways if they suspect they could be in
danger or are suicidal, Martinez says. The younger the kid, the
more likely they are to look.
</P>
<P>
   Of the kids currently on ``runaway status,'' the youngest is 10,
the oldest is 18. The state may continue to supervise 18-year-olds
for many reasons, including if the teens are disabled or pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of runaways are 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can become victims for all kinds of predatory types of
people,'' says Rick Lenz, director of therapeutic group home
services for Arizona Baptist Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit agency runs two Phoenix group homes.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a 12-year-old boy ran away from one of the
agency's homes just before bedtime wearing only boxer shorts and a
T-shirt. He was barefoot and spent the night huddled in an alley,
hiding himself with debris.
</P>
<P>
   The boy came back the next morning, much like he had the dozen
or so other times he ran away during his 18 months in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   For this boy, it is his way of coping with anger, stress or
sadness, Lenz says. He simply runs from it.
</P>
<P>
   Some foster kids run without much thought, walking out the door
with only the clothes on their backs. Others plan it, storing food
and other supplies before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some run because they don't like where they live or the people
they live with, officials say. Some run because they miss their
families and think things will be better if they can just get home
again.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, they run because they were told they
couldn't attend some great party in the desert on Saturday night,
say those who work with the kids. Or, they sneak out to see a
forbidden friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that kids don't just run away from foster care,'' Ault
says. ``They run away from their own parents, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of them don't know why they are running.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Kroll, who has worked for CPS since 1990, has seen
plenty of foster kids run. She is an independent living specialist,
working with teenage foster children.
</P>
<P>
   One 16-year-old girl she knew ran away 68 times in two and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so frustrated,'' Kroll said. ``I felt like all I did was
chase her from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl turned 18 while on the run and never came back. Kroll
often wonders what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Foster homes and group homes cannot be locked, according to
federal law. These children are in the state's care because of
something their parents did, not because they did anything wrong.
So, it is up to staff to make sure no kid leaves when they are not
supposed to, though state law prohibits them from physically
restraining children.
</P>
<P>
   And, like other children, these kids often go to public schools
and can take off easily from there, simply never showing up back at
the group home in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't have the manpower to send staff out looking for
them,'' Lenz says.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer kids run from foster homes where they get the full
attention of foster parents instead of a rotating staff and where
there are not as many children, Lenz says.
</P>
<P>
   It is easiest to find kids who are habitual runners, Kroll says.
They usually turn up at the same places and with the same people.
It's the kids who run less frequently or for the first time that
are the hardest to track.
</P>
<P>
   These are children who typically are self sufficient, having
been part of families who gave them lots of responsibility _
running a household, getting themselves off to school or caring for
younger siblings. But Kroll still worries about the condition they
are in when they come back, particularly the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for someone to love them, so people take
advantage of them in that way,'' she says. ``I talk about that with
my girls a lot. I tell them that sex is not love.''
</P>
<P>
   What irks Ault is that these kids can't get far alone.
Unfailingly, someone gives them a ride _ sometimes out of state _
food and a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says anyone who knowingly helps runaways could be
charged criminally, either with hindering prosecution or harboring
a fugitive. Both are Class 1 misdemeanors, punishable by up to six
months in jail or fines up to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old who took off a few days ago from Lenz's group
home now is in juvenile detention, waiting to be transferred to a
more secure residential center where doors can be locked.
</P>
<P>
   It will be harder for him to run from there.

A BATTLE WITH MOSQUITOES AND PUBLIC PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 7th graf with man dying in Albany) (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephen Athineos, the manager of a bike messenger
service in Manhattan, is perfectly clear on two things. The first
is that the current threat of the St. Louis encephalitis outbreak
is a total fabrication of city officials. The second is that they
ought to be doing a much better job of containing it.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude underscores the fine line that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani must walk. Both the mayor and health officials are
challenged to appear extremely aggressive at controlling the
illness, which has claimed the lives of three people, while at the
same time quelling public hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   A day after helicopters clattered ominously above the city
spraying insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that spread the
disease, Giuliani held a press conference Friday in which he
convivially chided reporters for failing to protect their feet from
insects bites with socks. Vans with bull horns have crawled down
city streets bellowing public health warnings, but along those same
streets, city officials also set up command centers to provide
information to a nervous public with a decidedly folksier touch.
</P>
<P>
   And scores of city officials have also taken over phone banks to
take inquiries from nervous citizens, where the number of calls
since the outbreak emerged a week ago have far outnumbered the
amount ever received by the mayor's Office of Emergency Management
since its inception in 1996, sometimes clocking 800 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely difficult to strike the balance between
providing the public with all the information they need to know
while at the same time not creating undue concern or panic,'' said
Neal Cohen, commissioner of the city health department. He added
that for this reason, the encephalitis outbreak has been one of the
most difficult public health crises in his career.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a severe outbreak of E. coli, linked to a
county fair in upstate New York, has state health officials working
overtime to inform and assist a worried public. Officials believe
that heavy rain washed cow feces into an aquifer from a farm near
the fairgrounds in Washington County. From the aquifer, they
believe, it flowed into a well supplying the fair. As of Friday
evening, one child had died, 611 people were suspected of being
infected, with 85 cases confirmed and 58 people hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, officials from a veterans hospital in Albany
reported that a 79-year-old patient died after contracting the
bacterium, health officials said. John Hawley, a department
spokesman, said investigators had yet to determine whether E. coli
was the cause of the man's death.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said they believed the outbreak of
primary infection had peaked last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in the city is more complex, in part because of
the illness itself, which is extremely hard to diagnosis. Its
symptoms are very much like those of flu and a common form of
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it is not curable; only the symptoms can be treated.
While this is hardly a problem for mild cases, it raises the level
of fear about getting sick. Health officials say that babies and
the elderly are at greatest risk. And while the illness at first
seemed to be contained to Queens, there have now been reports of
possible cases across the city, lending the illness an appearance
of being out of control, even though the chance of contracting it
is slim. And while not a single child has died, parents do not seem
to be able to keep themselves from fretting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is a citywide issue that doesn't target one
community or one population makes it more frightening to the
public,'' Cohen said. ``A good part of what we are doing now is
assuring the public that the threat and risks are very minimal
given what we know about exposure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And then there is the mayor himself, who seems to be struggling
at times to let the public know that everything is under control
with this major health scare while at the same time telling them
that the scare is perhaps not so big. At the news conference
Friday, he chided reporters for botching facts and inciting fear,
but at the same time pressed them to remind the people to douse
themselves with insect repellent, a point he underscored by giving
himself a little spray during his comments. He has insisted there
is no health threat connected to the city's spraying efforts, a
point many experts and the Environmental Protection Agency agree
with. But then Giuliani hinted that people might want to shut a
window or two.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some New Yorkers have turned their fears away from
mosquitoes and toward the chemicals being used to combat them.
``We're upset about the reality of the mosquito problem, but I
don't believe the chemical is totally harmless,'' said Eve Logan,
who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kaplan, who lives in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn,
echoed the fear. ``I give my children only organic fruits and
vegetables and now they're spraying everywhere,'' said Ms. Kaplan,
who is seven months pregnant and has twin 2-year-olds. ``I don't
trust that they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Athineos, who manages Mother's Messengers,
seem to see things both ways. ``The politicians have promoted
hysteria,'' he said. But he quickly added that the city should have
been more aggressive with its insecticide spraying up front.
``Basically if you have one case, you should spray the whole
city.''

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEIZED FROM VESSEL TAKEN TO BASE IN ESQUIMALT,
B.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ A Canadian navy destroyer carrying between 150
and 170 illegal Chinese migrants arrived in Esquimalt near
Victoria, B.C., Friday night, the latest development in what
officials are calling the largest human smuggling operation in
Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, believed to be from Fujien province, were earlier
taken off an unmarked coastal steamer that was boarded by Canadian
authorities off the coast of Vancouver Island on Thursday night.
They are being taken to the Canadian forces base in Esquimalt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such boat seized in Canadian waters since July
20. The boats have carried a total of more than 600 Chinese who
have pledged or paid smugglers an average of about $38,000 for the
trans-Pacific crossing, often in filthy, crowded conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest operation we have ever seen off the West
Coast. We believe organized crime is responsible,'' said Constable
Tracey Rook of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth boat, spotted sinking off the Queen Charlotte Islands in
early July, is believed to have earlier discharged its human cargo
on shore. Immigration officials have not apprehended anyone from
the so-called ``ghost ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Johnston, enforcement manager for Immigration Canada, also
described the succession of vessels as ``the largest smuggling
operation ever experienced in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston confirmed Friday that 32 Chinese from the first boat,
who were routinely released after applying for refugee status in
Canada, have disappeared. Nationwide warrants have been issued for
their arrests after they did not appear for scheduled meetings with
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials speculated privately that some or most
may have gone to New York, where they work off the cost of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has since clamped down on subsequent releases. It was
holding 378 illegal migrants before the latest boat was seized off
Nootka Sound, about 170 miles northwest of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is considerably larger than previous ships. It is a
small coastal freighter rather than a decrepit fishing boat,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. Chris Henderson of Canada's Department of National
Defense. He said the migrants aboard the ship appeared to be in
good health.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-foot-long ship was sighted about 500 miles off Vancouver
Island on Tuesday by a long-range military patrol aircraft. ``As
luck would have it,'' Henderson said, the naval destroyer Huron had
been dispatched to aid the RCMP and Immigration Canada in
apprehending the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials declined to say whether the United States
assisted in detecting smugglers' ships headed for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all prepared to discuss sharing of information
between the Canadian Armed Forces and the American military,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Canada said it knows of no other smuggler boats
presently headed for the West Coast. But the human cargoes have
been arriving at a rate of one every 12 days. Based on interviews
with the Chinese passengers, many of them reluctant to talk,
officials have privately speculated that as many as 11 boats are
headed eastbound across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Canada hopes the arrival of fall storms from the Gulf of Alaska
will deter further human smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our understanding there is a finite window for this kind
of activity,'' said George Varnai, Vancouver manager for
Immigration Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The latest boat was ordered to halt late Thursday afternoon at a
point 18 miles off Vancouver Island. The smugglers' boat instead
increased its speed toward shore. But with the Huron bearing down
on it, and three helicopters hovering overhead, the boat stopped
and a white T-shirt was hoisted.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was then escorted to historic Nootka Sound, where
18th-century British explorer Capt. James Cook first landed and
traded with natives for furs in what is now Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that _ thankfully _ we might have taken them by
surprise,'' Henderson said. ``It is critical that we deny certain
information to the persons planning these operations, so they do
not make changes in their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants, and those holding them, have been caught
in a vise.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese are mainly poor farmers or street merchants with
little education. They live in fear of the smugglers _ known as
``snakeheads'' _ and have been reluctant to provide information,
Rook said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said reports from the Chinese community in Vancouver
indicate that smugglers and their agents have threatened those from
the first boatload of migrants who were released.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the illegal migrants have applied for refugee status in
Canada. Such applications take an average of 11 months to process,
although officials are trying to speed up the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose refugee claims are refused will be repatriated to
China, if that country's government agrees to take them.

SOWARD'S COMMENTS SPICE UP TROJANS' BYE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an otherwise tranquil bye week for USC, wide
receiver R. Jay Soward has managed to keep things interesting.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in the summer with this week's ESPN
magazine, Soward vented on a couple of notable subjects, including
USC coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Soward accused Hackett of spying on him, saying ``Hackett wants
to know everything. He even has people that sit in our parties.
That's why I don't hang at 'SC.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward did not back off those comments when asked to verify
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that goes on here,'' Soward said. ``(But) I'm
happy it's in ESPN and not the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was amused by Soward's charges in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that's a figment of his imagination,'' Hackett
said. ``I told R. Jay before the season, that he underestimates the
number of people who see him and know what's going on in this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is more interested in Soward having a good senior season
than rehashing any previous issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to perform. He seems to be at the top of his game
right now,'' Hackett said. ``Can he finish (his season) off
(strong) and catapult us? That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward also had some terse comments over his rocky relationship
with former USC wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who plays for the
New York Jets. Soward has suspected that Johnson wanted him to sign
with Johnson's agent, and had an expletive-filled response to
Johnson's advice that he abandon his rap music career and worry
only about football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's mean to me,'' Soward said. ``But I love the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson questionable: Freshman fullback Chad Pierson, who
sprained his ankle against Hawaii, might be able to play against
San Diego State, Hackett said. When the Trojans return to practice
Sunday, cornerback Kevin Arbet (ankle), linebacker Jason Steen
(neck) and offensive lineman Trevor Roberts (ankle) are still
expected to be out.
</P>
<P>
   Day off: USC takes today off, then resumes practice Sunday
night. Most of the coaches are busy this weekend, attending high
school games Friday night and junior-college games today.

   CONGRESS-TAX (Washington) _ Rep. Baron Hill, a moderate Democrat

says he heard little enthusiasm for the $792 billion Republican tax

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEIZED FROM VESSEL TAKEN TO BASE IN ESQUIMALT,
B.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ A Canadian navy destroyer carrying between 150
and 170 illegal Chinese migrants arrived in Esquimalt near
Victoria, B.C., Friday night, the latest development in what
officials are calling the largest human smuggling operation in
Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, believed to be from Fujien province, were earlier
taken off an unmarked coastal steamer that was boarded by Canadian
authorities off the coast of Vancouver Island on Thursday night.
They are being taken to the Canadian forces base in Esquimalt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such boat seized in Canadian waters since July
20. The boats have carried a total of more than 600 Chinese who
have pledged or paid smugglers an average of about $38,000 for the
trans-Pacific crossing, often in filthy, crowded conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest operation we have ever seen off the West
Coast. We believe organized crime is responsible,'' said Constable
Tracey Rook of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth boat, spotted sinking off the Queen Charlotte Islands in
early July, is believed to have earlier discharged its human cargo
on shore. Immigration officials have not apprehended anyone from
the so-called ``ghost ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Johnston, enforcement manager for Immigration Canada, also
described the succession of vessels as ``the largest smuggling
operation ever experienced in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston confirmed Friday that 32 Chinese from the first boat,
who were routinely released after applying for refugee status in
Canada, have disappeared. Nationwide warrants have been issued for
their arrests after they did not appear for scheduled meetings with
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials speculated privately that some or most
may have gone to New York, where they work off the cost of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has since clamped down on subsequent releases. It was
holding 378 illegal migrants before the latest boat was seized off
Nootka Sound, about 170 miles northwest of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is considerably larger than previous ships. It is a
small coastal freighter rather than a decrepit fishing boat,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. Chris Henderson of Canada's Department of National
Defense. He said the migrants aboard the ship appeared to be in
good health.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-foot-long ship was sighted about 500 miles off Vancouver
Island on Tuesday by a long-range military patrol aircraft. ``As
luck would have it,'' Henderson said, the naval destroyer Huron had
been dispatched to aid the RCMP and Immigration Canada in
apprehending the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials declined to say whether the United States
assisted in detecting smugglers' ships headed for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all prepared to discuss sharing of information
between the Canadian Armed Forces and the American military,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Canada said it knows of no other smuggler boats
presently headed for the West Coast. But the human cargoes have
been arriving at a rate of one every 12 days. Based on interviews
with the Chinese passengers, many of them reluctant to talk,
officials have privately speculated that as many as 11 boats are
headed eastbound across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Canada hopes the arrival of fall storms from the Gulf of Alaska
will deter further human smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our understanding there is a finite window for this kind
of activity,'' said George Varnai, Vancouver manager for
Immigration Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The latest boat was ordered to halt late Thursday afternoon at a
point 18 miles off Vancouver Island. The smugglers' boat instead
increased its speed toward shore. But with the Huron bearing down
on it, and three helicopters hovering overhead, the boat stopped
and a white T-shirt was hoisted.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was then escorted to historic Nootka Sound, where
18th-century British explorer Capt. James Cook first landed and
traded with natives for furs in what is now Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that _ thankfully _ we might have taken them by
surprise,'' Henderson said. ``It is critical that we deny certain
information to the persons planning these operations, so they do
not make changes in their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants, and those holding them, have been caught
in a vise.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese are mainly poor farmers or street merchants with
little education. They live in fear of the smugglers _ known as
``snakeheads'' _ and have been reluctant to provide information,
Rook said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said reports from the Chinese community in Vancouver
indicate that smugglers and their agents have threatened those from
the first boatload of migrants who were released.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the illegal migrants have applied for refugee status in
Canada. Such applications take an average of 11 months to process,
although officials are trying to speed up the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose refugee claims are refused will be repatriated to
China, if that country's government agrees to take them.

INDIANAPOLIS KNOWS HOW TO PRIVATIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ City officials debating whether Kansas City
needs a year or more to forge a privatization plan should read
``The Seven Habits of Effective Mayors,'' in the Sept. 13 Weekly
Standard. They should then go to Indianapolis for an expert
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The article, by Eric S. Cohen, assistant editor of Public
Interest, chronicles how Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith has
made privatization a critical component of one of the country's
most successful city administrations during the '90s. Since
Goldsmith's election in 1992, Cohen says, ``(he) has cut the budget
every year, cut taxes four times, opened nearly 80 city services to
competitive bidding, and reduced the city work force by 40
percent.'' Meanwhile, crime is down and homebuilding is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's record, in other words, offers a model that those
searching for similar solutions would do well to study. Its
components, however, go far beyond mere privatization:
</P>
<P>
   - Encourage competition: Although contracting out some of the
city's services to private firms has saved the city $400 million,
management reforms also have enabled the city's union workers to
win ``a fair number'' of city contracts. The competitive way,
Goldsmith says, is both cheaper and better.
</P>
<P>
   - Eliminate cronyism: Goldsmith fired enough of the political
hacks larding the management bureaucracy to make city departments
competitive with private sector companies. Many of those axed were
the mayor's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   - Cut taxes: Both Goldsmith and other big-city mayors are
finding that tax relief is a key to reversing the outflow of
residents and businesses to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   - Emphasize fundamentals: Goldsmith believes cities should stick
to their knitting. Focus on roads, sewers, water systems and other
such infrastructure needs. More than $1 billion has been spent on a
Building Better Neighborhoods initiative, and law enforcement
outlays have been increased by $160 million even while taxes were
being reduced.
</P>
<P>
   - Support ``little platoons'': City hall nurtures neighborhood
leaders who undertake projects to improve their areas. An example
is the creation of a community center that has helped neutralize a
tough neighborhood's gang and drug influence.
</P>
<P>
   - Enlist institutions: Goldsmith's ``Front Porch Alliance''
encourages faith-based and community-based efforts ``to rebuild the
city's social capital.'' Examples include churches getting city
assistance to help transform abandoned parking lots into parks and
playgrounds, and community groups being supplied with city trucks
and trash collection bins for neighborhood cleanup projects.
</P>
<P>
   - Acknowledge government's limits: City government concentrates
on providing public services, while leaving job creation to
business and encouraging churches and families to maintain the
social fabric and instill civic virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here, it seems, is twofold. Privatization's process
is well understood, but success depends on decisive political
leadership that understands it's only one building block in the
quest to improve city government. The overall plan must include the
grass-roots involvement of citizens, churches, charities, civic
groups and businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them Phoenix's supervoters, the priority voters.
</P>
<P>
   They're mostly older, educated Anglos, half of whom live in
north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And they are the ones, political professionals say, on whom
campaigning politicians lavish the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite campaign rhetoric to the contrary, most citywide
elections _ including Tuesday's _ are decided by pretty much the
same 96,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The professionals know this exclusive clique well and have even
given it a name: &UR; supervoters, priority voters, even high-efficacy
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Win their hearts, and you win the election.
</P>
<P>
   The other 400,000 registered Phoenix voters are largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Even the political parties' get-out-the vote drives are aimed
mainly at the regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice thought, that it would be on an even keel,'' said
Cortland Coleman, political director of the Arizona Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the case. Resources and energy are focused on
priority voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervoters club isn't difficult to join. Just vote in city
elections year after year and you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pollock is a member. So are many of her neighbors who live
in City Council District 4, a central Phoenix community rich in
supervoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When elections roll around, we are blitzkrieged with
candidates and fliers and tons of phone calls,'' said Pollock, a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians woo supervoters with mailers and phone calls, leave
fliers at their houses, even make personal visits _ or at least
send a volunteer. In his first mayoral race, for example, Skip
Rimsza left potted plants at the homes of 50,000 to 60,000
supervoters.
</P>
<P>
   And they are more likely to pick up the phone when you call.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock is convinced that being a supervoter means getting more
attention once politicians are in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a doubt in my mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Political researchers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians will skew values, beliefs and programs to people
who vote all the time,'' said Arizona State University Professor
David Berman, author of ``Arizona Government and Politics''.``''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who make their living in the political trenches say
targeting supervoters is a purely practical decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best world, I'd advocate communicating to every
registered household,'' said political strategist Michael Crusa.
Communicating with a household can cost a candidate $1 to $2, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the math,'' Crusa said. ``Candidates can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Crusa advocates seven contacts _ phone, mailer, visit,
flier _ with supervoters and, if a candidate can afford it, at
least two contacts with those voters who make it to half the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthier candidates, especially non-incumbents, may reach out
to semidependable voters _ those who vote in special elections,
Crusa said. He calls them ``the-two-out-of-fours.''
</P>
<P>
   Although supervoters live throughout Phoenix, more than half of
the members of the club live in three of eight council districts _
Districts 3, 4 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   In all three of these central Phoenix districts, 20 percent of
registered voters cast a ballot Tuesday, compared with 17 percent
citywide.
</P>
<P>
   Even more noteworthy was that only one of these three districts
had a race for a council seat _ and that was a race in name only.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with southeast Phoenix's District 7, where a tight
three-way race for a council seat drew only 14 percent of
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Central Phoenix's District 4 had Tuesday's highest rate of of
voter turnout, 20.92 percent. In 1997, when District 4 voters chose
a new council member, nearly 27 percent of registered voters cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Within District 4 are a handful of precincts that can turn out a
voting rate as high as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   District 4 resident Posey Moore Nash is appalled by the city's
low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``People died for the right to vote,'' Nash said. Yet when Nash
ran for the council seat in 1997, she couldn't afford to reach out
to new and unreliable voters, but concentrated her efforts in
supervoter precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pepper those areas with literature and you walk them,''
Nash said. ``You want to get those people. The other ones are
hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   District 4 resident G.G. George ran for mayor in 1994 and said
she should have spent more time and energy capturing the attention
of the city's known voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concentrated on everyone; that was my downfall,'' George
said. ``I spoke to everybody I could. The political strategists are
absolutely correct. That's not the right way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Democratic and Republican parties admit that what they
called their get-out-the-vote efforts are most often confined to
people who already vote regularly.
</P>
<P>
   They will, on occasion, reach out to new residents or make a
foray into a new neighborhood; but those are not efficient uses of
scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
   But that must be done carefully, Crusa said. In Scottsdale on
Tuesday, he said, the Canals Project went down to defeat because
the controversy ``encouraged too high a turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists took their message to the most logical place _ the
people who always vote, Crusa said. What they failed to do was get
their message to the rare voter motivated by this particular issue.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for catering exclusively to a small group of
known voters is that it's often to an incumbent's or
well-established candidate's benefit to keep turnout low, Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get supporters out to vote,'' he said, ``and hope others
don't know it's an election.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the American system was designed from the beginning to
prevent mass voting, keep turnout low and establish a small,
controllable group of like-minded voters, political researcher and
ASU Professor Bruce Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed, Merrill said, to maintain power in the hands of
``the White, male, Christian elite.'' It's done through
registration rules, one-day voting, and minimal attempts at voter
outreach, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill and others are expecting significant changes in
traditional American voting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Women, minorities, and younger people have the potential to
carry sway at the ballot box; and the growing vote-by-mail movement
could begin developing a new set of supervoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These great pressures will eventually lead to mass voting,''
Merrill said. For example, he said, with more education and more
money, more of Phoenix's Hispanics will move into the supervoter
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll begin to understand they can not only join the game,
they can write the rules of the game,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the power continues in the hands of those who have
always understood the game, get involved and vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the voters in Tuesday's race voted early and by mail.
Mail-in ballots aren't counted by precinct, making it difficult to
track precinct-by-precinct voter counts.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's ``permanent list of early voters'' contains the
names of residents who vote and request early ballots, and usually
return them.
</P>
<P>
   That list _ now a favorite with candidates seeking supervoters _
shows that in 13 of 41 District 4 precincts, more than 25 percent
of voters requested early ballots.

JOHNSON ISN'T USED TO THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson has won a World Series and been to
the playoffs five times, but for the first time in 11 full seasons
his team won't finish first or second. Instead, the Dodgers will
probably finish the season 20 games or so behind the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But unless any finish is accompanied by a playoff berth, it
means nothing to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come in second a few times, but that was never my goal,''
Johnson said. ``If you can't win your division, finishing second or
third, it's just a measure of how far you have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need a tape measure instead of a ruler to calculate
how much ground they'll have to make up during the offseason. The
Diamondbacks are on pace to win 96 games while the fourth-place
Dodgers are looking at 75 wins from their $80 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers needing to make up a bundle of games
through offseason moves and prayers that players who had mediocre
years can get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   But those are things that will have to wait a laborious 21 games
before the Dodgers can begin attacking their offseason plan to add
depth to the minor-league system and pare payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a few more things I could look at (before the end
of the season), to be honest with you,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so spoiled: It's not exactly the voice the Dodgers wanted,
but at least their inflections could hold some bearing on the
playoffs. Of the 21 games the Dodgers have remaining, 12 are
against teams involved in a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, $80 million is also a steep price for a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a rat's (butt) about those other teams,'' Johnson
said. ``I care about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Orel surgery: Mets right-hander Orel Hershiser's two-hit,
one-run performance in the series opener wasn't the first time
Johnson witnessed something like that from the one-time Dodger.
Hershiser, then a Dodger, beat the Johnson-led Mets 6-0 in Game 7
of the 1988 NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``September, sometimes Hershiser can turn it up a notch, and
that's what he did,'' Johnson said. ``His concentration level goes
up. I've seen that before. He becomes bionic. As (Todd) Hundley
said during the game, he's inventing stuff as he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: The Dodgers claimed right-handed
minor-league pitcher Dwayne Jacobs off waivers from the Chicago
White Sox, and to make room for him took lefty Jeff Kubenka off the
40-man roster and designated him for assignment. Jacobs, 23, was
1-3 with four saves and a 5.03 ERA for Single-A Winston-Salem in
the Carolina League. The 6-foot-10 Jacobs struck out 76 in 59
innings. Kubenka, 25, was 0-1 with am 11.73 ERA in six appearances
with the Dodgers this season. . . . Left-handed pitcher Hong-Chih
Kuo, the 18-year-old high schooler signed out of Taiwan in July, is
on his first visit to Dodger Stadium and threw in the bullpen
before the game. Kuo, whose fastball is clocked in the mid-90-mph
range, is expected to begin next season with Single-A San
Bernardino. . . . Right-hander Antonio Osuna pitched one shutout
inning in a rehab stint for San Bernardino. He allowed one hit and
struck out one.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Seventeen months after light-rail planning
stalled, the city has launched a new study to answer _ possibly
once and for all _ the question of light rail's future in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Perry, an architect and planner hired by the city, will
oversee a team of experts charged with reaching consensus on a
practical public transit system in the city's central business
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is expected to take 12 to 18 months, could cost
between $600,000 and $700,000 and will be paid for by the Federal
Transit Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the business community, neighborhoods and others
would be included as the city tried to develop the consensus that
eluded area transportation officials and froze the planning process
in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure we not only speak to the public but have
a conversation with the public about this issue,'' Perry said. ``It
won't be us deciding something and then going out to test the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the latest study, coming from both the city and
business leaders, began almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to complete work halted by the Kansas City Area
Transportation Authority, focusing on the central business
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Several key questions the city must answer are whether light
rail is the right technology, what the starter route should be, and
how to coordinate with the commuter rail system _ passenger trains
on existing heavy rail tracks from Johnson County, Kan. _ that has
received funding authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When the ATA started drafting driveway and intersection changes
in early 1997, high-profile business leaders and politicians
protested that they had not been consulted.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce then tried to find a
route that business interests could support, but gave up in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials worked with U.S. Sen. Kit Bond to free up
about $1.5 million remaining from the ATA's preliminary engineering
grant.
</P>
<P>
   The city will direct the study, with the ATA providing technical
support. If the city arrives at an agreed-upon strategy, the rest
of the $1.5 million grant can be used to complete preliminary
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Mann, chairman of the chamber's Metropolitan Initiative
Committee, urged that the consulting team make a point of working
with the newly formed Regional Transit Alliance, a group of
residents supporting quality metropolitan area transit.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be asked on Nov. 2 to consider a light-rail proposal
developed by transportation activist Clay Chastain and his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's initiative asks voters to extend two half-cent sales
taxes _ due to expire in December 2000 _ for 15 years. One
half-cent tax would pay for improvements to roads, sewers, bridges
and sidewalks. The other would pay the city's share of a $1.5
billion light-rail line from Kansas City International Airport to
south Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said that the competition among cities for federal
transit dollars was fierce and that time was running out for Kansas
City to identify its local match and get in line for those
dwindling federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative that we get this thing approved now,''
Chastain said, ``and let the city deal with the details after it's
approved.''
</P>
<P>
   But city, chamber and transportation officials say that is the
wrong approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Transit Administration, they argued, has strict
guidelines and wants detailed plans and ridership and cost
estimates before it will consider funding. Those are questions the
city's study will explore.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ flowing, dancing notes.
</P>
<P>
   Each new painting created a distinctive melody in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He reduced his color range to a muted bronzish-olive tone. He
cut out all backgrounds so that his sculptural ``objects'' would
appear to float in space.
</P>
<P>
   His work became larger and larger. He dreamed of a triumphant
one-man exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``...but several times readying myself for a show, seemingly
only a few months away, I stopped, discarded everything and began
again, knowing I had just given myself a year or two more of solid
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   In June of this year, exhausted and nearly overwhelmed by an
internal exploration that had, he said, ``lasted a bit too long,''
he found a space downtown, framed and hung 15 huge paintings, and
sent out invitations for a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I was thinking of such great crowds,'' he said. ``I had
such expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anyone came, hardly anyone at all. He received no
critical attention. He sold nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet for me,'' he said, ``it was the most glorious of defeats,
finally seeing it all hung, all framed, my task complete.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien came to the show and thought the paintings ``very
interesting'' but problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding a market will be difficult,'' he said. ``But selling
is not the true end result for an artist. Physically making art is
the true end result. Sean is a born maker of art. He has to create.
What he does now will tell us what he got from those seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bovinett said recently that he is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay with it,'' he said, ``simplify the work,
return to a normal life, and see where it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my grandfather would smile at that. He would
appreciate the cheekiness of going on with this adventure no matter
what the consequences.''

SECLUSION AIDS ARTIST'S CREATIVE DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Seven years ago a local painter named Sean
Bovinett, well known in Kansas City's small arts community,
closeted himself in his Valentine neighborhood apartment and
essentially disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shut out the world so I could devote myself to a monumental
task,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his self-imposed exile he remained secretive, sharing
his thoughts with almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if he'd vanished,'' said John O'Brien, owner of the
Dolphin Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean became an enigma,'' said Tom Gomersall, a former
instructor at the Kansas City Art Institute who taught Bovinett 26
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him then as a tough, outgoing ex-Marine _
disciplined, aggressive, full of life and creativity. He embraced
the world,'' Gomersall said. ``I don't think I ever understood his
decision to isolate himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bovinett, now 48, saw his choice as a necessary step on a
``long journey'' that had begun in the tiny English village of
Marlow Bottom, 30 miles southwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he and his twin brother were raised by their
maternal grandparents. His divorced mother had married a U.S. Air
Force officer and moved to America.
</P>
<P>
   Bovinett's grandparents, Ivy and Douglas Gregory, were lay
ministers in the Methodist Church and staunch, radical supporters
of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were artistic as well,'' Bovinett said. ``We were the odd
folks on the street, so to speak. It was a delightful way to grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 13, his mother returned. Her second husband adopted
the boys, gave them his name, and several years later they all
moved to America _ to Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from culture shock, eager to escape Montgomery, Bovinett
joined the Marines shortly after graduating high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Marines,'' he said, ``I developed a strong feeling
about doing things right, no matter what the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He also discovered that his drawing, begun when he was 3 years
old, was considered unusually good by his colleagues. Encouraged,
he decided to try a career in art.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Art Institute, Bovinett worked for
seven years as a process artist at Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent every day hunched over a light table, duplicating and
enhancing other artists' original work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while I felt as though I were locked in an arts
factory, a velvet prison. It's a horrible place to be when you feel
you have something original to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to England he found a small watercolor painting
his grandfather had made in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``He painted it in my grandmother's autograph book,'' Bovinett
said. ``It was a simple landscape, but a truly lovely thing. My
grandfather could have been a great painter if he hadn't had to
work in a factory. That painting nudged me toward quitting Hallmark
and trying to make it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   When the owners of a New England-based printing company
expressed interest in using Bovinett's work for limited-edition
posters, he was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed everything in my '74 Land Rover, including my dog,
and moved to Boston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a disaster. The poster contract fell through. The
Land Rover threw a rod. And Bovinett, nearly broke, had to give
away his golden retriever.
</P>
<P>
   He flew back to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to feel that I didn't fit in anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he had his own show at the old Athena Restaurant on
Broadway. He sold three paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But he was feeling lost, empty, without purpose.
</P>
<P>
   To reinvigorate himself he began to work on still-life
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to create my own simple still life, a traditional
vase of five tulips,'' he wrote in his journal. ``But after several
weeks I found myself working on over 30 still lifes at the same
time...there seemed to be no end in sight....''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he had become obsessed with the work, he destroyed all
but seven of the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was clearly placing a terrible burden on himself,'' said
O'Brien of the Dolphin Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, to pay his rent, Bovinett took a job at the Boulevard
Brewery, cleaning vats. He could no longer afford flowers to paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced to consider using my imagination to begin
creating my own vases...I felt I needed serious hours to pursue
this lead. Began going to bed at 7:30 in the evening and waking
around 2:30 in the morning to work (before going to brewery).''
</P>
<P>
   He painted with new fervor, sensing that his ``lead,'' a journey
deep into his imagination, would result in something important.
</P>
<P>
   He quit his brewery job. He cut off his relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put my social life on hold for the indefinite future. I
suppose it can be described as an obsession, but I prefer `complete
immersion.' The very withering away from the world is that which is
sustaining...Socializing is just letting the pressure out of the
cooker. I needed to keep the fire stoked.'
</P>
<P>
   He left his apartment only to shop. Living off a profit-sharing
plan from a previous job, he bought nothing but groceries, art
supplies, and an occasional shirt from a thrift shop.
</P>
<P>
   He painted seven days a week, 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time doesn't matter. I had come a long way and had found
myself inside a kind of cathedral of the imagination...anything was
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by the work of Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte, he
painted imaginary vases with billowing opera curtains extending
magically from their sides. He struggled to create sculptures on
canvas. He painted undulating musical instruments extending skyward
with flowing, dancing notes. MORE

E. COLI FROM FAIR BELIEVED TO CAUSE SECOND DEATH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health officials said they believe that a 79-year-old man who
died at a hospital in Albany Friday may have been the second victim
of an outbreak of E. coli that has already sickened more than 600
people in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday y, state health officials had reported 611
suspected cases of E. coli poisoning, up from 497 on Thursday. All
of the victims had attended the Washington County Fair on Aug. 28
or 29.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the outbreak is tied to a contaminated
well. Officials say that heavy rains may have washed cow manure
infected with the bacterium into the underground water supply.
Rachel Aldrich, 3, died last week after drinking a glass of water
at the fair. Another 58 people remained hospitalized. The man who
died Friday , Ernest Wester, attended the fair on both days and
drank coffee that was made with contaminated water, said Linda
Blumenstock, a spokeswoman for the Stratton Veterans Administration
Medical Center, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Health department officials could not confirm late Friday night
whether Wester's death was caused to the fairground's water supply.

FOR ONE NIGHT, DODGERS DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the spring-training war room, as clear as if it
were yesterday, it's easy to remember the Dodgers brass talking
about these types of games. The Dodgers wouldn't need to score
much, which wasn't expected anyway, because the pitching would do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The runs, or even run, would come either from the long ball or,
unlike past teams, the manufactured route.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days, when dreaming of such wins seemed like so
much more than a dream. They were supposed to come more than once
every 100 or so games.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was, in all its splendor, Friday against the Mets.
The Dodgers won 3-1 behind a strong start from surging right-hander
Darren Dreifort and a pair of manufactured runs.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit his 29th homer and the Dodgers ended a
four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   For a night, you started to get the idea this group knows how to
play the game together instead of as individuals. The Dodgers
actually scored a run without a hit. They did what winning teams
did, only winning teams do this more than once every few months.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Eric Young leading off with a walk against Al
Leiter. Mark Grudzielanek's grounder with Young trying to steal got
the Dodgers a man on second with one out. Young, who used his legs
to create mayhem during the first month of the season, stole third
and scored on Gary Sheffield's fly ball to the track. One run, no
hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, it was more of the same. Devon White led off with
a double and was sacrificed to third on Adrian Beltre's bunt to the
right side. White scored on Paul LoDuca's flyout between center and
right field to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dreifort continued the most impressive stretch of his
career by pitching at least seven innings in his fifth consecutive
start. Dreifort allowed four hits, struck out six and walked two.
He's 4-1 with a 2.06 ERA in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he struck out four straight Mets. He finally bent
in the sixth inning when ex-teammate Roger Cedeno doubled to right
with one out and scored on pinch-hitter Matt Franco's two-out
double to right center as the Mets pulled within 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Dreifort got Ricky Henderson to line to shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek to end the inning before Mondesi gave Dreifort his
two-run cushion back.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who's still hearing boos every time he comes to the
plate, fouled a ball off his foot that sent him spilling onto the
batter's box dirt. A few gingerly taken steps, a little wincing and
Mondesi was back in the box against reliever Bobby Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi then pulled himself within three stolen bases and a home
run of the second 30-30 season of his career when he drove Taylor's
2-2 pitch down the left-field line for a homer and a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who was shaky in the seventh, then saw the new tactic
of manager Davey Johnson, which is to push pitchers more than
they've been pushed all season. Instead of shaking hands after
seven innings, Dreifort pitched a perfect eighth before turning it
over to Jeff Shaw in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw recorded his 32nd save. Dreifort, who six weeks ago had a
hot ticket to the bullpen, has evened his record at 13-13 and
trails only Kevin Brown for the staff lead in wins (16).
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers, for one of the few times this season, did
exactly what they were supposed to do.

NFL DECISION ON COWBOYS' LETT STILL ON HOLD 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The word from NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in
July was that he would have a ruling on the punishment phase of
defensive tackle Leon Lett's indefinite substance-abuse suspension
before the NFL's regular-season opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That was contradicted yesterday by a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Leon Lett \Rdecision\S today. Probably next week,'' NFL
spokesman Greg Aiello said yesterday on behalf of Tagliabue, who
had an expansion committee meeting this week. ``The commissioner is
preoccupied with some other matters right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are preoccupied with the Washington Redskins. The
Cowboys now go into tomorrow's game not knowing when they will get
their former Pro Bowl defensive tackle back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the non-news in stride yesterday.
He said he respects Tagliabue's timetable, although nobody is sure
what that exactly is now.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Tagliabue missing his self-imposed target date,
Aiello said, ``This doesn't mean anything. We were pressed hard
\Rfor a decision\S, and the commissioner said at the time that he
hoped to have something by the first game. He changed his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiello intimated that this wasn't a big deal since there has
been nothing to indicate that Lett was going to be allowed back to
play in early-season games anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As customary, Jones watched practice yesterday, then issued a
brief statement that couldn't be interpreted as even mildly
combative by anyone in Tagliabue's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten any word from the league about a change in
Leon Lett's status,'' Jones said. ``Again, I must respect the
league office and the commissioner's timetable.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly
Linebacker Quentin Coryatt still hadn't surfaced at Valley Ranch
when practice ended yesterday. For more than two weeks, he has been
away from the team, receiving treatment from a specialist in
Indianapolis for his chronic Achilles' tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt received a $1 million signing bonus in April and was
expected to be the Cowboys' starter at strongside linebacker. Owner
Jerry Jones and Coryatt talked by phone Wednesday. Jones said he is
eager to meet with him when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie wide receiver Wane McGarity has been named by coach Chan
Gailey to return punts against Washington. McGarity didn't return
punts at Texas and returned only five punts for a 4.8-yard average
in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year wide receiver Jeff Ogden will be the Cowboys'
primary return man on kickoffs. Ogden returned three kickoffs last
season and one this preseason. He will be joined by McGarity.

PUERTO RICAN NATIONALIST LEAVES LEAVENWORTH PENITENTIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAVENWORTH, Kan. _ Luis Rosa was sent to prison for acting on
his belief that Puerto Rico should be a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the 39-year-old Rosa walked out of the U.S.
Penitentiary in Leavenworth, becoming one of 11 Puerto Rican
nationalists to receive clemency from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa was grateful for his freedom but remained passionate about
his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are capable of creating their own institutions,
laws and government that will serve their interest,'' Rosa said.
``We can sustain ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those eligible for clemency were members of the
ultranationalist FALN, which was responsible for some 130 bombings
in the late 1970s and early 1980s that left six persons dead and
scores wounded. FALN is the Spanish-language abbreviation for the
Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the prisoners who were offered clemency was directly
responsible for deaths or injuries, and they were required to
renounce violence as a condition for accepting clemency, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa said Friday he was accused of _ but would not admit to _
being a FALN member.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in April 1980. At the time, he was a junior at a
University of Illinois campus and teaching drama, history and music
workshops at an alternative high school.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa and another person were arrested after police spotted them
in a Northwestern University parking lot, walking away from a
stolen vehicle that contained weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said his charges included armed robbery and _ because of his
political convictions _ seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa served half of his 32-year state sentence in Illinois.
Three years ago he was transferred to Leavenworth to serve his
75-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa said Clinton recognized that the prison sentences were
excessive. But Rosa said he thought that the clemency should have
come sooner and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that President Clinton took an important step
toward healing,'' Rosa said. ``I will adhere to my conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he did not see his now 23-year-old son grow up, Rosa
said he did not regret his time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said other men _ such Nelson Mandela and Mohandas Gandhi _
suffered more for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are fighting for is something sacred,'' Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa said U.S. colonialism had exploited all aspects of Puerto
Rican life, including the educational system and the island's
ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I am fighting for a just cause,'' Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa said Friday that he was unsure where he was going. If he is
sent to Puerto Rico, he wants to earn a master's degree in
education and build a house. If he stays in his native Chicago, he
wants to continue his education and work in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Rosa said, he would like to work to release
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we will have to rejuvenate ourselves for the
comrades we left behind,'' Rosa said. ``It's not a complete
celebration, because they still stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first hours of freedom, Rosa ate jumbo fried shrimp at a
restaurant about seven miles from the federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undescribable,'' Rosa said of his freedom. ``No poet can
ever describe it. No songwriter can ever write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa's mother, Hipolita Perez, sat quietly staring at her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosa said his family suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were also sentenced to 19 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa never thought of himself as a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our people say that they want us back in our community,
it's not because they view us as terrorists; rather they have known
our convictions and know what we can contribute to the empowerment
and betterment of our community,'' Rosa said.

NETWORK SERVER PRODUCER SEEKS NEW BEGINNING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ChatCom Inc., the long-struggling producer of
network servers, said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy
protection and furloughed its entire staff of seven employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had warned in March that it was facing
bankruptcy due to a cash crunch, made the Chapter 11 filing this
week in federal bankruptcy court in Woodland Hills. The filing
listed $2.2 million in liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Roche, who became chief executive officer in July after
agreeing to provide up to $600,000 in financing, said he was forced
to seek bankruptcy protection because of recent efforts by senior
secured lender ALCO Financial Services to place the company into
receivership. Roche said ChatCom owes ALCO about $66,000, down from
the $282,000 it owed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Roche also said the filing should enable ChatCom to start
reorganizing its finances and rehire the furloughed employees next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ALCO spokesman Robert Weisberg said the company had sought to
place ChatCom into receivership because of ongoing financial
problems since Roche took over. ``It's a sad situation,'' Weisberg
said. ``The company has good prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom's staff was cut from 50 to 21 earlier this year and it
moved to smaller offices. It recently announced it had developed a
signature verification system called ChatLok that would protect
individual computer users within a system.

DESPITE BUDGET CUTS, UMKC PONDERS RENOVATIONS TO CHANCELLOR'S
HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the midst of a financial crunch that
requires cutting $2.8 million from the campus budget, University of
Missouri-Kansas City officials are proposing renovations to the
chancellor's residence that could cost more than $228,000.
</P>
<P>
   The house was occupied until 10 days ago by the former
chancellor, who resigned in January. The university has been paying
$3,750 a month to house the interim chancellor in an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   UMKC administrators said they thought this fall was a good time
to fix up the chancellor's house because it will be empty several
more months until a new chancellor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   They say the house needs a better water-drainage system, a more
modern kitchen and bathrooms, and a remodeled first floor that's
more accessible to the public. UMKC officials also said a renovated
house could make the chancellor's job more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   So a committee of the governing University of Missouri Board of
Curators had planned to meet Friday in Columbia to discuss
renovation options. These range from minimal changes costing about
$228,000 to major changes totaling about $629,000.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday afternoon, the curators canceled the meeting,
saying they weren't ready to decide on renovations. The committee
said it would discuss the issue at a future meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Paul Steele, from Chillicothe, is on the executive
committee that had planned to meet Friday. He said he did not feel
comfortable making a decision based on the information he had.
</P>
<P>
   Some UMKC chancellor's residence renovations have been paid for
with private donations before, but Steele said he had no indication
from UMKC officials that private donations would be used to pay for
these renovations. The curators recently approved a plan from
Manuel Pacheco, president of the four-campus University of Missouri
system, that called for major budget cuts on the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Professors and a student leader at the campus said
administrators shouldn't consider major renovations after asking
academic departments together to cut about $1.2 million from their
budgets next year. UMKC has a total budget of about $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' medical school professor Wayne Simpson, a
member of the Faculty Senate, said of the proposed renovations.
``Other chancellors have lived in it. It can't be that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Hackmann, Student Government Association president, whistled
in amazement when she heard the university already has spent about
$26,000 to house the interim chancellor, and probably will spend
almost $15,000 more before a new chancellor arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackmann also questioned the need for such expensive renovations
to the university-owned chancellor's residence, which is in the
center of campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that doesn't set a very good example,'' Hackmann said.
``If it is necessary (renovations)...to make it functional, OK. But
to make extravagant renovations in a time of budget cuts is
hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   The brick-and-stucco home, built in 1933, was donated to UMKC's
predecessor, the University of Kansas City, in 1958. UKC merged
into the University of Missouri system in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, no major repairs have been made to the house, which
is situated on an acre of lush, green lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The house has a major drainage problem, with water often
collecting in the basement, UMKC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old, old house, and we have not put much money into
that house,'' said Barbara Smith, UMKC assistant vice chancellor
for communication. ``It is very difficult to move around in there.
And the toilets don't flush properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The house's first floor, where chancellors often have had
dinners or receptions for professors, students and community
members, is fairly cramped. The dining room only accommodates about
10 persons, and other rooms are small.
</P>
<P>
   The foyer is on a higher level than the other rooms on the first
floor, so the public floor of the house could not be reached by
someone in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by consultant SH Associates, fixing the
drainage problem would cost about $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Improving public accessibility for events on the first floor
would cost about $177,000. That would include lowering the foyer to
the level of the dining and living rooms, enlarging the foyer's
coat closet and adding a second toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Other more cosmetic changes to the house would cost more than
$100,000. They would include removing the first-floor carpet and
refinishing the hardwood floors underneath, and repainting and
remodeling the brown-and-yellow kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The house was occupied up to about two weeks ago by former
Chancellor Eleanor B. Schwartz, who resigned in January after seven
years as chancellor. The curators, who are appointed by the
governor, allowed her to continue living in the chancellor's
residence until Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Chancellor Gordon Lamb, whose home is in Columbia, said
he wasn't aware of how much the university was spending for his
temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   The university has paid about $26,000 since February to house
Lamb in a furnished apartment, university officials say. Lamb will
live there until the new chancellor comes to campus, which probably
will be after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A chancellor search committee has narrowed the pool of
candidates for the top job to eight. By Friday, each member was to
have ranked those eight in order of preference and given their
rankings to the head of the search committee.
</P>
<P>
   The top six vote-getters will be brought to Kansas City for
interviews with the search committee. The committee will choose
three and forward their names to Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellors are required to live in the chancellor's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb and other UMKC officials said recruiting a top-quality new
chancellor would be easier if the school could offer a modern,
attractive residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can recruit a chancellor to a house with
water in the basement?'' Lamb asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Simpson, who is on the chancellor search committee, said the
committee wasn't even aware that renovations to the chancellor's
residence were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even on the priority list'' of the committee, he
said.

METS' LUCK RUNS OUT AGAINST DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was exactly the combination of events the New
York Mets had managed to avoid for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When the starting pitching was shaky for three-quarters of the
season, the bullpen was the stalwart. When, in recent weeks, the
bullpen has suffered, the starters have frequently been good enough
to keep the relievers in their seats. Rarely had the two gone wrong
simultaneously and neither was disastrous Friday night. But like an
exhausted sprinter trying to make a clean baton pass, both ends of
the Mets' relay team stumbled just enough to allow the Dodgers to
eke out a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Al Leiter allowed two runs on three hits in six innings,
not bad considering he had trouble getting ahead of most hitters
and struggled to throw a strike in the first inning. But by the
sixth inning, he had thrown 87 pitches trying to dig his way out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And reliever Billy Taylor, who has pitched better recently
despite allowing 11 runs in the eight innings he had pitched
entering the game, gave up an insurance run during the one inning
he pitched, when he left a slider way up to Raul Mondesi, who
belted a home run into the left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   With the powerful Mets' offense held to four runs and 12 hits in
the first two games of this series _ incredibly, they beat ace
Kevin Brown, but lost to mediocre Darren Dreifort _ the small slips
could not be made up.
</P>
<P>
   The lowly Dodgers have beaten the Mets in four of their six
meetings this season, but this loss was particularly painful for
the Mets, because Cincinnati beat Florida to close the gap in the
wild-card race to 2 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a hallmark of Leiter's uneven season, it has
been his lack of control early in games. And although he rarely
gets shelled, he needs plenty of pitches to get out of trouble.
Friday night, he struggled immediately and walked the first batter
he faced, Eric Young, on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Dodgers scored just one run off Orel
Hershiser _ a solo home run by Gary Sheffield. Friday night, they
were determined to take advantage of Leiter's shakiness to
manufacture more runs. Leiter threw two more balls to the next
hitter, Mark Grudzielanek, prompting a quick visit to the mound
from Mike Piazza. Grudzielanek grounded out on the next pitch, but
Young was running and made it to second.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter fell behind again to the next batter, Gary Sheffield,
going 3-1. Young ran on the next pitch _ just the second strike
Leiter had thrown _ and was safe at third. With the count full,
Sheffield hit a sacrifice fly to left field to give the Dodgers a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter still struggled to get ahead in the count, but after the
run scored, he retired 10 of the the next 11 batters. To start the
fifth, Leiter got ahead of the leadoff hitter Devon White 1-2. But
White smacked the next pitch down the right-field line for a
double. Adrian Beltre sacrificed White to third and backup catcher
Paul LoDuca, batting eighth, hit a fly ball to shallow right
center. Roger Cedeno caught it, but his throw to the plate went
past Piazza and White scored the Dodgers' second run.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets' explosive offense, that would seem to have been
no problem, especially against Dreifort. He was just 12-13 with a
5.02 earned run average entering the game, but he was in the middle
of one of the best stretches of the season, having won three of his
last four starts. He had given up just five earned runs in 301/3
innings with 19 strikeouts and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   While Leiter was struggling, Dreifort continued his recent
efficiency. He retired all but two of the Mets he faced in the
first four innings, and he struck out the side in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had their best chance to score in the fifth when, with
one out, Cedeno singled under Young's glove at second base. When
Dreifort fell behind Rey Ordonez 2-0, the fleet Cedeno was off to
second. Ordonez walked and Leiter sacrificed them over. With
leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson, who was fourth in the National
League with a .444 on base average and sixth in batting (.331)
entering the game, up next, the Mets seemed poised to bail Leiter
out. But the count on Henderson went to 0-2 and when he tried to
check his swing, he was called out by home plate umpire Mark
Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Grudzielanek, whose brainlock error Thursday led to
Piazza's two-run home run, briefly opened the door for the Mets in
the sixth, when he overran Piazza's slow roller, then slipped on
the infield dirt, allowing Piazza to reach first with two out. But
Dreifort struck out Robin Ventura to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Mets scored in the seventh. With one out, Cedeno,
on an 0-2 count, drilled a double to right field. Ordonez grounded
out, but Cedeno went to third. Matt Franco, pinch hitting for
Leiter, hit a double to the gap between right and center that
scored Cedeno to make the score 2-1. But Henderson again failed to
drive a run in, lining out to Grudzielanek to end the inning.  &QL;

NO EXPLANATION OFFERED ABOUT DEFENDANT WHO THWARTED MONITORING
SYSTEM  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA and MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Court and corrections officials Friday were
unable to explain how a defendant accused of strangling an elderly
Kansas City woman was on the streets for more than three weeks
after removing his electronic monitoring device.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Corrections knows that Michael L.
Farris removed his monitor Aug. 9, but did not say when it learned
he had done so. A request for an arrest warrant for Farris did not
reach a judge's desk until Sept. 7 _ four days after Sophia
Szymczak was found dead in her home in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the slaying, law enforcement officials could not or
would not say exactly when they were notified that Farris had
tampered with his monitor, or which authorities had received that
notification. Interviews with the prosecutor's office, state
corrections officials, and local probation and parole authorities
Friday indicated that the monitoring system worked as designed.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, are not saying what was done in the 25
days between the removal of the monitor and Szymczak's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the killing, Farris was awaiting trial in the
burglary of Szymczak's home last year. He also was on probation in
Johnson County, Kan., after pleading guilty in a theft case.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Aug. 26, Johnson County officials knew Farris had
cut off his monitor, and moved for his arrest. The next day,
corrections officials in Jackson County prepared a report to notify
court officials in Kansas City, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials in Jackson County, Mo., who supervise
defendants on home detention awaiting trial, on Friday referred all
questions about Farris to Missouri Department of Corrections
spokesman Tim Kniest in Jefferson City. He said that the situation
was under review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're redoubling our efforts with Jackson County to develop
something to collapse notification time to the court,'' Kniest
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said he believed that
public attention to this case would lead to improvements in the way
courts are informed about a defendant's violation of pretrial
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem will rectify itself,'' he said. ``I
anticipate the courts will get (reports) in a more timely
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird also said he and the presiding judge of the county's
criminal court division decided this week to limit use of home
detention to people charged with relatively minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said the Farris situation might have been avoided had the
Jackson County Jail annex opened earlier, as scheduled. Because the
jail was under pressure to keep its population down, Farris almost
certainly would have been released on bond had he been sent to the
jail to await trial, Beaird said. Home detention, he said, allowed
a greater degree of supervision at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the time Farris was placed on home detention, 176
additional beds have become available at the Jackson County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had happened now, it might have come out differently,''
Beaird said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Executive Katheryn Shields, who oversaw
construction of the annex, could not be reached for comment Friday.
She has said the delays were because of contractor problems.
</P>
<P>
   Farris now is charged with first-degree murder, and Beaird is
considering whether to seek the death penalty. Silencing a
potential witness is an aggravating factor that can elevate a
murder charge to a capital crime.
</P>
<P>
   County and state officials said Friday it was unusual for home
detainees to remove their monitors. Assistant Jackson County
Prosecutor David Fry said he could not recall another case in which
a defendant awaiting trial removed a monitor and committed another
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Home-detention devices are hard plastic rings that lock around a
person's ankle and communicate electronically with a monitoring
authority, over telephone lines. Officials at a remote center know
whether a defendant is home when he's supposed to be, but cannot
confirm his whereabouts when he is outside the range of the
transmitter. Every morning, the center sends a report to local law
enforcement officials on people in the program.
</P>
<P>
   If the device is tampered with, a signal alerts the monitoring
company and local authorities, according to a spokeswoman for B.I.
Inc., which manufactures the equipment in Boulder, Colo., and
tracks detainees from there.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was unaware of the Farris case.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith, unit supervisor for the pretrial release office of
the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, said that if a monitor
is tampered with, his office is notified immediately. In those
cases, which Smith called unusual, a case supervisor is summoned to
investigate and the courts are notified.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that the design of the monitor and its locking device
made removal difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not something simply done,'' he said. ``It would take
some effort.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people on bond awaiting trial in Jackson County wear
the monitor in home detention, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, who used the alias ``Sneakie Pete,'' has a history of
preying on elderly victims.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after being paroled for a 1976 burglary conviction,
Farris and five others invaded and robbed the home of a 61-year-old
man and his 51-year-old wife. The couple were bound with electrical
cord. After the others left, Farris stayed behind and attempted to
rape the woman.
</P>
<P>
   For that attack and a separate, similar incident, Farris was
found guilty of assault with intent to do great bodily harm with
malice, assault with intent to rape, two counts of first-degree
robbery and a crime against nature. The jury recommended a 440-year
sentence. The court imposed 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   But that and other Missouri verdicts were set aside after a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that a Missouri law allowing women an
automatic exclusion from jury duty was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a new trial, Farris pleaded guilty in September 1979
to two counts of first-degree robbery. He was sentenced to
consecutive 25-year terms. The other charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, two years after Farris was paroled from prison,
he was charged with stealing $3,000 worth of jewelry from an
82-year-old Shawnee, Kan., woman while he was working for a moving
company.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, he allegedly burglarized Szymczak's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Farris is in custody now, and Beaird said he plans to seek a
murder indictment from a Jackson County grand jury. Beaird said he
would convene a committee of prosecutors to decide whether to seek
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird also said that he had met Wednesday with Jackson County
Circuit Judge John R. O'Malley, who presides over the criminal
docket. The two agreed that in the future the option of home
detention should be limited to cases involving bad checks,
forgeries, failure to make support payments and traffic offenses.

   LOS ANGELES -- Investors pounded Sound Source Interactive Inc.
shares Friday after the company was delisted from the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market and placed on Nasdaq's less-regulated Over The
Counter Bulletin Board.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which closed at 40.6 cents Thursday, fell to 25 cents
on the OTC Friday., a 38 percent drop. More than 22,000 shares
traded hands, a 23 percent increase over the average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas-based children's software company lost its listing
on the SmallCap Market Thursday, after market officials refused to
give the company more time to comply with listing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bitetti, Sound Source chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company was delisted because its net tangible
assets fell below $2 million and its stock has traded under $1
since April.
</P>
<P>
   But Bitetti said the move to Nasdaq's less-regulated board would
not hurt Sound Source's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view the OTC as a good place for us at this time,'' Bitetti
said. ``If and when we turn around the company, we will be able to
regain compliance with Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound Source, ranked among the six or seven largest educational
software publishers in the country, has struggled in recent years.
Bitetti said the company was especially hurt by dismal sales of
three ``Babe: Pig in the City'' titles last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired Los Angeles-based Wedbush Morgan Securities
earlier this year to find a buyer or strategic partner, but Wedbush
terminated the deal in late June. Just days later, Sound Source met
with Nasdaq officials to request a short-term exception to market
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bitetti said he hopes a planned foray into the market for Sony
PlayStation games will help revive the company.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Sound Source also needs a cash infusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the prospects are good,'' he said, ``but I really do
feel it's time to recapitalize the company.''

TAGLIABUE IN NO HURRY TO FREE LETT
</HEADLINE>

   Waiting for Leon?
</P>
<P>
   (Insert mindless whistling here).
</P>
<P>
   (Jingle pocket change).
</P>
<P>
   (Hum a few bars of Barry Manilow favorite).
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting?
</P>
<P>
   To their growing chagrin, the Cowboys are maintaining a vigil,
too. Leon Lett, alas, isn't coming back tomorrow for the season
opener in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll come back next week. Or next month. Or next time
there's a lunar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lett: Lineman in Exile remains a continuing story. And NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue can't seem to script the final chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Writer's block?
</P>
<P>
   No. It's more like the commish has other priorities. Like this
instant replay thing. And rearranging that always-pesky
Commissioner's Sock Drawer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys and Owner Jones, no news yesterday was bad news.
According to the commish's office, Tagliabue had good intentions of
announcing the length of the Lett suspension, but he never got
around to it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's it. The dog ate his homework.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and the Cowboys, of course, would like to know exactly how
long their best defensive lineman is going to be out, so that they
can:
</P>
<P>
   1. Find a sober replacement.
</P>
<P>
   2. Order an extra Happy Meal for the team plane.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sell advertising on Leon's empty locker.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the owner is keeping his candid comments about the
situation to himself. Privately, his loafers are steaming. How's a
guy supposed to run a football team when he doesn't even know when
to expect his players?
</P>
<P>
   A good question. But let me suggest that Owner Jones should have
thought of that two Leon suspensions ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, two substance-abuse strikes and you're
probably out. But Jones chose not to ``correct'' the problem by
flushing Lett from the roster. Instead, he has continually welcomed
Leon back to the nurturing nest.
</P>
<P>
   Two scenarios, therefore, may be playing out themselves here.
First, there is the locally popular notion that Tagliabue harbors a
grudge against the maverick Jones and now relishes this opportunity
to make life miserable for him.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, it's both ragingly unprofessional and
thoroughly understandable. Commissioners are not hired to carry out
personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this isn't personal. It's just an impersonal case of
Cowboys-needling. Tagliabue may not have it in for America's Team,
but he certainly doesn't owe it any favors.
</P>
<P>
   The union-negotiated rules regarding substance abuse allow the
commissioner to be as arbitrary and vague as he wants or needs to
be. Blame it on the system, not necessarily the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible Lett scenario accuses the Tagliabue delay of
being both intentional and purposeful. The commissioner knows that
each week that passes without rendering a sentence for Lett is
another week of punishment for Leon. And that's the precise point.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones still considers Lett a valued employee. He has made
no public moves, despite Lett's multiple suspensions, to discipline
him, trade him or release him. Granted, the players association
prevents Jones from imposing certain further sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But the union doesn't say anything about continuing to employ
and pay him. A lesser Cowboy with a drug suspension, Clayton
Holmes, was quickly banished from the roster, you may recall. Yet
Jerry keeps the porch light on for Leon.
</P>
<P>
   In the second scenario, therefore, if Jones won't make it any
tougher on Lett, the commissioner will.
</P>
<P>
   These are theories, admittedly, not facts. But by the bright
light of an onrushing season opener, they have as much credence as
yesterday's he-didn't-get-around-to-it excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys will miss Lett, provided that he is the
Leon Lett they know. The one that played last year was, at best,
inconsistent and, at times, invisible. The Cowboys dearly need
their front four to provide pressure, beginning tomorrow against
the Redskins' Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The starting defensive tackles in Washington are going to be
Chad Hennings and Alonzo Spellman. The backups hail from deep down
somebody else's depth chart and//or that overseas league,
Euro-Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   This could get worse before it gets better. Getting Leon Lett
back would probably help.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hold your breath. The commissioner will get around to
deciding that next week. Or next month. Or, well, whenever.

A BATTLE WITH MOSQUITOES AND PUBLIC PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES totals in 6th graf; DELETES 7th graf) (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephen Athineos, the manager of a bike messenger
service in Manhattan, is perfectly clear on two things. The first
is that the current threat of the St. Louis encephalitis outbreak
is a total fabrication of city officials. The second is that they
ought to be doing a much better job of containing it.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude underscores the fine line that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani must walk. Both the mayor and health officials are
challenged to appear extremely aggressive at controlling the
illness, which has claimed the lives of three people, while at the
same time quelling public hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   A day after helicopters clattered ominously above the city
spraying insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that spread the
disease, Giuliani held a press conference Friday in which he
convivially chided reporters for failing to protect their feet from
insects bites with socks. Vans with bull horns have crawled down
city streets bellowing public health warnings, but along those same
streets, city officials also set up command centers to provide
information to a nervous public with a decidedly folksier touch.
</P>
<P>
   And scores of city officials have also taken over phone banks to
take inquiries from nervous citizens, where the number of calls
since the outbreak emerged a week ago have far outnumbered the
amount ever received by the mayor's Office of Emergency Management
since its inception in 1996, sometimes clocking 800 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely difficult to strike the balance between
providing the public with all the information they need to know
while at the same time not creating undue concern or panic,'' said
Neal Cohen, commissioner of the city health department. He added
that for this reason, the encephalitis outbreak has been one of the
most difficult public health crises in his career.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a severe outbreak of E. coli, linked to a
county fair in upstate New York, has state health officials working
overtime to inform and assist a worried public. Officials believe
that heavy rain washed cow feces into an aquifer from a farm near
the fairgrounds in Washington County. From the aquifer, they
believe, it flowed into a well supplying the fair. As of Friday
evening, one child and one man had died, 611 people were suspected
of being infected, with 85 cases confirmed and 58 people
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said they believed the outbreak of
primary infection had peaked last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in the city is more complex, in part because of
the illness itself, which is extremely hard to diagnosis. Its
symptoms are very much like those of flu and a common form of
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it is not curable; only the symptoms can be treated.
While this is hardly a problem for mild cases, it raises the level
of fear about getting sick. Health officials say that babies and
the elderly are at greatest risk. And while the illness at first
seemed to be contained to Queens, there have now been reports of
possible cases across the city, lending the illness an appearance
of being out of control, even though the chance of contracting it
is slim. And while not a single child has died, parents do not seem
to be able to keep themselves from fretting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is a citywide issue that doesn't target one
community or one population makes it more frightening to the
public,'' Cohen said. ``A good part of what we are doing now is
assuring the public that the threat and risks are very minimal
given what we know about exposure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And then there is the mayor himself, who seems to be struggling
at times to let the public know that everything is under control
with this major health scare while at the same time telling them
that the scare is perhaps not so big. At the news conference
Friday, he chided reporters for botching facts and inciting fear,
but at the same time pressed them to remind the people to douse
themselves with insect repellent, a point he underscored by giving
himself a little spray during his comments. He has insisted there
is no health threat connected to the city's spraying efforts, a
point many experts and the Environmental Protection Agency agree
with. But then Giuliani hinted that people might want to shut a
window or two.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some New Yorkers have turned their fears away from
mosquitoes and toward the chemicals being used to combat them.
``We're upset about the reality of the mosquito problem, but I
don't believe the chemical is totally harmless,'' said Eve Logan,
who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kaplan, who lives in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn,
echoed the fear. ``I give my children only organic fruits and
vegetables and now they're spraying everywhere,'' said Ms. Kaplan,
who is seven months pregnant and has twin 2-year-olds. ``I don't
trust that they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Athineos, who manages Mother's Messengers,
seem to see things both ways. ``The politicians have promoted
hysteria,'' he said. But he quickly added that the city should have
been more aggressive with its insecticide spraying up front.
``Basically if you have one case, you should spray the whole
city.''

MARINERS LOSE IN 12, BUT DAVEY SHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ By now, the Mariners are too far behind in the
American League wild card race for individual games to be pivotal.
Their 5-4 loss Friday night to the Baltimore Orioles, marred by
three unearned runs in the early innings and later failures by the
bullpen and offense, might have stung more if the M's were closer
than 9{ games behind the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting impression from the game, which ended when Mike
Bordick hit a solo homer off a high fastball from Robert Ramsay
with one out in the 12th inning, might be the performance of Tom
Davey. The rookie right-hander had his best performance as a
Mariner, working 22/3 scoreless innings in what he hopes is a
preview of his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look at myself from a managerial standpoint, and you
don't know what you're going to get,'' said Davey, who was acquired
from Toronto in the David Segui trade on July 28. ``Is he going to
pitch well, or is he going to come in and walk guys and start
aiming the ball? I mean, you're going to have your days, but I've
had too many of those days this year where I've been bad,
especially since I've come over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Davey, who turns 26 today, entered the game with a 6.59
earned-run average in 10 games as a Mariner. He has not figured in
a decision, but he had been erratic, allowing 31 baserunners in
132/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, after Butch Henry and Jose Paniagua had allowed
the Orioles to tie the score, 4-4, on two singles in the eighth,
Baltimore threatened again with two on and one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Davey came in, got Bordick to line out and allowed a single to
B.J. Surhoff on which Brian Hunter threw out Jerry Hairston at home
plate, ending the inning. The tie preserved, Davey worked 1-2-3
innings in the 10th and 11th. His most impressive at-bat came
against the dangerous Albert Belle, who struck out on fastballs
that ranged from 95 to 99 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Davey left the game with tightness in his right triceps. He
could have lasted longer, he said, had he not thrown so many
pitches before the game while perfecting a flaw in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When Davey is mechanically sound, his arm is raised near his
head by the time he lands on his left foot. Before Friday night,
though, his arm was dragging behind the rest of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was landing on my front foot,'' he said, ``and my hand was
still behind my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected the problem Friday night, ``and instead of thinking
about 10 other things like I was before,'' Davey said, he
concentrated on making pitches. The result was probably his best
performance since he earned a save against the Mariners for the
Blue Jays on May 1, working 31/3 scoreless innings with no walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I thought I showed everyone the pitcher they thought
they were getting from when I threw against them early in the
year,'' Davey said. ``For me, that's a confidence booster. If I
keep throwing the ball like that, I'll get more innings and be able
to help the team more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Davey, starter Paul Abbott left early with a minor injury.
Abbott allowed three unearned runs over seven innings before
removing himself with a pulled groin. He said he expects to make
his next start.
</P>
<P>
   The first two runs came on a Belle double in the third that
followed a two-out error by shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who was
screened by baserunner Mike Figga and lost track of Surhoff's sharp
grounder. The Orioles' next run, in the fourth, was aided by an
error by second baseman David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have played good defense all year, and we gave them three
runs there,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``Those were the deciding
runs, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez tied the game with a two-run homer in the sixth, his
37th, and Edgar Martinez followed with his 23rd to put the M's in
front, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But five Orioles relievers _ part of a bullpen that blew 20
saves in the first half _ limited Seattle to just two singles over
the final six innings. That allowed Baltimore to come back in the
eighth, when Cal Ripken drove in Surhoff with his fourth single of
the game. The hit came off Jose Paniagua, who was not charged with
a run but registered his American League-leading ninth blown save.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Right fielder Jay Buhner left the game in the seventh
inning with cramps in his left hamstring. Buhner did not consider
the setback serious. ... Reliever Mark Leiter, out for the season
with a torn rotator cuff, threw for five minutes before yesterday's
game. ``Originally they said November, but I threw today and it
went good,'' said the 37-year-old right-hander. ``If I can get
going by spring, that's more than I expected. It definitely could
happen.'' Whether a comeback happens with the Mariners is unclear,
since Leiter is a free agent this winter. ... Piniella may travel
to North Carolina Sunday for the funeral of Hall of Famer and
former New York Yankees teammate Catfish Hunter, who died Thursday
at age 53. ... With KIRO 710 AM covering the Seahawks/Lions game,
Sunday's Mariners game will be broadcast on KNWX 770 AM and 100.7
FM.

TAKE ME SERIOUSLY, JUNIOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ He has joked about it frequently, but in recent
days, Ken Griffey Jr. has become serious when discussing the
possibility of leaving the only team he has known.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mariners' 5-4, 12-inning loss in Baltimore Friday
night, Griffey spoke forcefully about his future for the second
time this week. For those hoping he will play center field for the
Mariners after his contract runs out after next season, the message
was not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't think that I will leave, then they are sadly
mistaken,'' Griffey said, referring to Mariners management. ``I'm
not going to stay here and lose for the next eight years of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are trying to re-sign Griffey _ and shortstop Alex
Rodriguez _ and have made three contract offers to Griffey. But
since the club's sub-.500 finish last season, Griffey has insisted
that his decision to stay past this contract will be based on the
direction of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have they done to change my mind?'' Griffey asked. ``A
new ballpark is supposed to change my mind? They signed one player
out of spring training. What have they done since then?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners maintained the same payroll from 1998 to '99, and
entered this season with four significant veterans set to become
free agents this winter. Pitcher Jamie Moyer agreed to a two-year,
$15 million extension in April, first baseman David Segui and
pitcher Jeff Fassero were traded and designated hitter Edgar
Martinez remains unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 23, the Texas Rangers have held a double-digit lead
on the Mariners in the American League West, and the M's seem
headed for their second consecutive third-place finish after
winning the division two of the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners management has stressed that the move to Safeco Field
will allow the team to be competitive. Griffey said Mariners
players have higher standards, and expressed disappointment that
team president Chuck Armstrong and others have not stated loftier
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chuck (gives) his definition of a competitive team, or if
the organization gives one, then I might be able to give a
counter-proposal (to contract offers),'' Griffey said. ``But they
can't. Because we have two different opinions on competitiveness.
My opinion is I want to beat everybody. That's it. Their definition
is being competitive with Texas, Anaheim and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-uh. I want to beat the daylights out of everyone, and have
people afraid to come in and play the Seattle Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong would not comment Friday, other than to reiterate that
the club does not discuss contract negotiations and that it intends
to re-sign both marquee players.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who was presented with a reported seven-year, $135
million offer in July, has said numerous times that money is ``not
the issue.'' Yesterday, he defined just what the issue is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about respect,'' he said. ``I go out there every day,
(even) if I'm hurting. Everybody knows my knee's been messed up for
a month, two months, three months now. I go out there because
there's something I can do to help this ballclub, and I wouldn't go
out there if I felt like I couldn't contribute in any way, shape or
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the respect of the guys in this locker room,
and the other locker rooms, about what I do out on the field. But I
don't have the respect of our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey referred to several incidents throughout his 11-year
Mariners career. He laughed when asked if players were consulted on
various aspects of Safeco Field, and he said the team should ask
players before using their likeness on giveaways sponsored by
companies those players may not endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also brought up travel-related issues _ ``Our travel
schedule costs us seven to 10 games a year,'' he said _ including
the club's infamous 1997 midseason trip to Zebulon, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know me know that it's not, `Hey, I need this to
stay, I want this, I want that,' '' Griffey said. ``It's always,
`As a team, we'd like to have this, it's important that we get this
done.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak for the team. `I' and `me' don't really get along.
That's why it's so hard to answer when you (reporters) ask me
questions about me. I'm not real good about that. But what I am
really good about is telling people what's wrong, and what we need
to better our ballclub and organization.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also personal issues. This is the first extended
period that Griffey has been apart from his family during the
baseball season; 5-year-old son Trey has begun school at home in
Orlando, Fla. For Griffey to return to a team that plays so far
from his home, he will have to be convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Mariners) can make the decision real easy for me,'' he
said, ``or they can make it real tough.''

DREIFORT PASSES ANOTHER EXAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a curious thing. For the first 45 starts of
his career, everyone wanted to know what was wrong with Darren
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everyone is trying to figure out why everything is so
right with Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplation about moving him to the bullpen has been replaced
with talk of how dominant Dreifort can be. The latest example came
in Dreifort's latest masterpiece. He allowed four hits in eight
innings of a 3-1 win against the Mets to end the Dodgers' losing
streak at four games Friday night at Dodger Stadium. Raul Mondesi
added his 29th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning himself,'' Dodgers ace Kevin Brown said. ``He's
comfortable. It's him learning on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Dreifort was one more dismal start away from being
in the bullpen. Now he's 4-1 with a 2.06 ERA in his last five
starts and on the fast track to being one of the few nice surprises
in an atrocious season.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Dreifort was 8-11 with an ERA near 6. Now,
he's 13-13 with a 4.84 ERA and trails only Brown for the club lead
in wins (16).
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he was a great starting pitcher,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said with a wide grin. ``He shut down a good
hitting club. He never tried to really overthrow. He was completely
smooth the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Dreifort would reach his pitch count by the
fifth inning. Against the Mets, he threw 100 pitches in eight
innings before giving way to Jeff Shaw, who notched his 32nd save.
</P>
<P>
   But it goes way beyond just the 70 strikes he threw and the
confidence on the mound. No longer does Dreifort throw every pitch
with maximum velocity.
</P>
<P>
   He's also regressed to his days of academia at Wichita State.
Dreifort has taken to studying hitters more and talking to other
pitchers and catchers during games he's not starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sitting there for days and discussing things with the
other pitchers, and when someone gets a hit, everyone runs over to
the catcher to see what pitch was thrown,'' Dreifort said. ``The
first game of a series I might spend talking to the bullpen guys,
the way to pitch certain guys. Mike Maddux is a great guy for that.
He makes mental notes and writes things down, and he's easy to
approach and (bounce things) off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped a lot. Going into a game, it's going in and taking
an exam. If you prepare yourself, you're going to pass or you're
going to fail. You have to give yourself a chance to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hierarchy, as well as catcher Todd Hundley, also
said they've noticed Brown's impact on Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has a tendency to bear down with runners on base,
particularly when they're in scoring position. Dreifort has started
to do that and it showed in the seventh inning against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-teammate Roger Cedeno doubled to right with one out and
scored on pinch-hitter Matt Franco's two-out double to right-center
as the Mets pulled within 2-1. Dodgers second baseman Eric Young
tried to keep pinch-runner Shane Halter close to the bag, and
though Dreifort paid attention, his focus was instead on batter
Ricky Henderson, who lined out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot just watching (Brown) pitch, just his
competitiveness,'' Dreifort said. ``He's a guy where you can just
watch him and sometimes he'll get himself into a jam, and all of a
sudden, one, two, three strikeouts, or a strikeout and a
double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of like, you bear down for one out, but the other
thing is you're less concerned about the runner and you're less
concerned about everything but the batter.''

   FBN-SEASON (Undated) _ With John Elway's retirement, the AFC,
which seems to have the strongest contenders for Super Bowl
champion, is a wide-open race and for the first time in ages the

Bill Parcells appears to be pointing to winning it all this year,
motivated in part perhaps, by the knowledge that with the team for
sale this could be his final season as coach. By Mike Freeman.

retirement. He led them to a 15-1 record last season and is primed
to become a superstar this season. By Mike Freeman.

FOR NEW COACHES, AMBITIONS ARE GRAND, EVEN IF TEAMS AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine head coaches are in new roles in the National Football
League this season and all are intent on infusing their franchises
with wisdom and style. In most of their situations, plenty of
infusing is required.
</P>
<P>
   The nine range in age from 41 (Andy Reid) to 59 (George
Seifert). Five are offensive-minded coaches _ Reid in Philadelphia,
Brian Billick in Baltimore, Chris Palmer in Cleveland, Mike Riley
in San Diego and Mike Holmgren in Seattle. Four are
defensive-minded _ Seifert in Carolina, Gunther Cunningham in
Kansas City, Ray Rhodes in Green Bay and Dick Jauron in Chicago.
Three are former pro head coaches _ Holmgren, Seifert and Rhodes.
Two have won Super Bowls as a head coach _ Holmgren and Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   And their initial seasons are expected to unfold this way:
</P>
<P>
   Good: Holmgren and Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: Billick and Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Reid, Palmer, Riley, Seifert and Jauron.
</P>
<P>
   Jauron, for his part, said he is not concerned about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not particularly interested in what other people
think,'' he said, though the Bears trudged to 4-12 finishes in both
1997 and 1998. ``We're only interested in what we as a team think.
We'll see where their predictions are at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, some in this group will fly and others will fold.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren earns more ($4 million per year) than any coach and has
as much authority as any, including over personnel and contracts.
He has the autonomy in Seattle that he did not have in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a challenge to see how you can do it, from the ground
up, the way you want to do it,'' Holmgren said. ``It's new, but
it's something I'm excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement has been rare in Seattle, where the Seahawks have not
had a winning season in nine years or a playoff berth in 11 years.
He has good players to work with.
</P>
<P>
   And the good players Holmgren left in Green Bay, Rhodes
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes plans to turn loose quarterback Brett Favre. Holmgren
used to constrain Favre, but Rhodes' attitude is, let it fly and
take us to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Seifert, who won two Super Bowls as the head coach in San
Francisco, another Super Bowl seems far away. The Panthers were
4-12 last season, and they could be worse in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the unexpected in Cleveland, where Palmer helps an old
franchise start anew. The Browns are an expansion team dripping
with nostalgia, and with an assortment of players grabbed from
other team's rosters, from the draft and from free agency. It is a
mix that seems muddled now with a terrific fan base yearning for a
quick jell.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and San Diego fight a discouraging battle in the American
Football Conference West, where two-time defending Super Bowl
champion Denver reigns. Cunningham and Kansas City are also in that
division.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham worked for 30 years as a college and pro assistant
before gaining the Chiefs' head coaching job. His task is huge:
restoring luster and respect to the Chiefs after their ugly fall
last season, one in which they compiled a losing record (7-9) after
nine straight winning ones and in which they finished as the
league's most penalized team. Cunningham has the task of restoring
the fans' respect of a team that was boorish on the field a year
ago. Cunningham describes himself as ``blood and guts'' on the
sideline. Explosive. He wants his team to play in that manner.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Reid said of his new job with the Eagles,
``I've never put myself in a bad situation.'' Many wonder.
Philadelphia looks porous.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens and their fans know that feeling. ``This is a city
starved for a winner,'' Billick said of Baltimore, where the Ravens
were 6-10 last season and had a four-game losing streak early and a
three-game losing streak late. ``I see a good core on defense and
an offense that just needs to be tweaked.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the new coaches, Billick said his players ``need to
change and find a new way of doing business.'' There are five areas
he plans to focus on: 1) Be well-prepared; 2) Provide attention to
detail; 3) Do not be prone to mental errors; 4) Exhibit passion for
the game, and 5) Do not allow big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to develop a team that is explosive,'' Billick said.
``We want an offense that doesn't put a good defense on a short
field. We will use a lot of multiple formations and groupings. We
can't line up and shove the ball; we're not that good. We will use
superior numbers and angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Be crafty. Create hope and keep it alive. Win. For most of these
new head coaches, that will happen only over the long haul. History
indicates that most will not earn the chance to finish what they
start.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that is how most of them got their jobs.

TWO-ANNOUNCER BOOTH MIGHT EASE PRESSURE ON ESIASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cardinal rule of television production: three announcers in
the booth are definitely better than two if that is what you have
got, but two in the booth are far better if you have just shed one
of the previous three. Got it?
</P>
<P>
   At ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' the departure of Dan
Dierdorf to CBS leaves Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason on their own
to boast about the benefits of being a pair. ``It's going to be
much easier,'' Esiason said.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels added: ``A benefit of three in the booth is you have a
lot of lively commentary if each analyst approaches the play from
different angles, but there can be redundancies. With a two-man
booth, we can allow the telecast to breathe. You don't have to keep
up a constant patter.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is entering its second season of ``Sunday Night Football''
with Mike Patrick, Paul Maguire and Joe Theismann. ``You do a
three-man booth when it works, and we found one that works even
though we backed into it last year to mirror ABC's three-man
booth,'' Jed Drake, a vice president at ESPN, said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial season for Esiason, who was not experienced
enough to be the solo analyst last season. And his aggressive style
in dealing with Dierdorf led some viewers to think they disliked
each other. ``It was all in the ear of the beholder,'' Esiason
said. ``I was saddened. I never felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   With more time to talk, Esiason will be under pressure to
provide analysis on a par with that of Maguire, CBS' Phil Simms or
Fox's John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   The season marks ``Monday Night Football's'' return to a 9 p.m.
Eastern starting time _ to bring back West Coast viewers not home
for the early part of games that last season started at 8:20. ABC
will not bring back its inane pre-game show either, but halftime
with Chris Berman will emanate from New York's ESPN Zone
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first year since 1971 that Frank Gifford is not
with ``Monday Night Football.'' Esiason replaced him last season,
and Gifford's nominal role on the pre-game show was eliminated this
season. He was not offered a new role at ABC. ``He sounds fine,''
Michaels said, ``but he keeps his inner feelings to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At CBS Sports, ``The NFL Today'' Sunday show underwent a radical
makeover, keeping the host, Jim Nantz, but bringing in the analysts
Randy Cross, Craig James and Jerry Glanville to replace Brent
Jones, George Seifert and Marcus Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three experienced analysts in the studio, which we
didn't have last year,'' said Sean McManus, who took responsibility
for the inexperience of last year's crew of analysts and made the
right choices to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports made no substantial changes, except to turn the cast
of the pre-game ``Fox NFL Sunday'' into animated Claymation
characters for promotional reasons. The program is also adding
forecasts from the Weather Channel to assure viewers that the Green
Bay tundra is frozen. If NFL games are not canceled or delayed
because of severe weather, it seems that gamblers will benefit most
from the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Cable's Fox Sports Net is launching ``NFL This Morning'' Sunday
at 11 a.m., Eastern with Chris Myers, Jackie Slater and Marv Levy,
which will lead into the noon ``Fox NFL Sunday.'' The show will
feature less mirth and more hard-core pigskin chatter than its
broadcast sibling.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of yet another NFL studio show again raises the
question: when is too much too much? Answer: never, at least to
those involved. ``On the day of the game, I don't think there is a
saturation point,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   But look out: the NFL has contemplated creating an All-NFL
Channel that will probably show used game uniforms being laundered
to fill time.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's ``Sunday NFL Countdown'' on Sunday stretched to two hours
last year and ``Monday Night Countdown'' bulks up to 120 minutes
Monday. Berman regrets that ESPN cannot start ``NFL PrimeTime'' _
its 45-minute lead-in to the Sunday night game _ at 7:15 p.m.
Eastern, rather than 7:30. He would also like the game to kick off
at 8:35, not 8:20. ``Forty-five minutes is hard,'' he said. ``As
fast as I talk, I have to talk faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for more and lengthier studio shows is largely a
result of the networks' eight-year, $18 billion NFL deals. Studio
shows are relatively inexpensive to produce and promote the games.
The league will receive $1.8 billion this season and each team will
receive $58.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN starts Sunday night when Pittsburgh plays in Cleveland,
with the expansion Browns resuming life after a three-year hiatus.
The NFL has missed the Cleveland market. In 1995, the Browns' final
year in Cleveland before Art Modell moved them to Baltimore, the
market's Sunday afternoon network rating averaged 16.9. In 1994,
the 21.3 Cleveland rating was tied with Dallas for the league's
best. By last season, the rating had tumbled to 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited about this game than the two Super Bowls I
called,'' said Maguire, who grew up near Cleveland. ``Whether they
win or not is beside the point. They're back.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: EXTERMINATE THE REPLAY BUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a familiar phrase in pro football: rookie mistakes. And
when the National Football League season opens Sunday, mistakes are
sure to be made by its most controversial rookie: the new
television replay system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system is going to do what it's designed to do,
change those game-breaking plays,'' Tony Dungy, the coach whose
Tampa Bay Buccaneers open at home against the Giants, was saying
the other day. ``But it's not going to be without a few bugs this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   What bugs?
</P>
<P>
   Dungy laughed and said: ``I just got a memo from the
commissioner's office. We weren't supposed to comment and be
critical, so I'm just going to leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL must exterminate those bugs.
</P>
<P>
   This new system has created an all-rookie team that should be
known as the Replay Bugs. Referees and replay-booth officials, no
matter how many years of experience they may have in other areas,
are still learning a new system just as a rookie quarterback must
learn an offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the preseason would be a laboratory,'' said Jerry
Seeman, the NFL's senior director of officiating. ``Is the system
letter perfect? No way. But it's an insurance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's insurance against the catastrophic mistake that allows the
wrong team to win a game. As the Jets did last year, 32-31 over the
Seattle Seahawks, when Vinny Testaverde was awarded the winning
touchdown on a 5-yard quarterback sneak on fourth-and-goal with 27
seconds remaining. Replays clearly showed he had been stopped short
of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   That documented blunder, with a few others, prompted the NFL to
restore replay with a new system:
</P>
<P>
   In each game, a team is permitted a maximum of two challenges
that will initiate referee replay reviews. Each challenge requires
the use of a team timeout. If a challenge is upheld, the timeout
will be restored to the challenging team. No challenges will be
recognized from a team that has exhausted its timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-minute warning in each half and during overtime,
any review will be initiated by the replay official in the booth,
without limit and without a timeout's being charged.
</P>
<P>
   All replay reviews will be conducted by the referee on a
field-level monitor after consultation with other officials. A
decision will be reversed only when the referee sees ``indisputable
visual evidence'' that warrants the reversal. Each review will be a
maximum of 90 seconds, beginning when the referee puts on the
headset to the replay booth.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough, but bugs have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 63 exhibition games, 14 of the 61 reviewed plays were
reversed _ 10 of the 47 challenges by coaches, 4 of the 14 reviews
from the replay-booth official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had six errors,'' Seeman acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman meant six plays that either were reversed incorrectly or
let stand incorrectly, but that's six bugs too many, even in
exhibition games. More than most teams, the Giants saw the bugs. In
Baltimore, running back LeShon Johnson was ruled to have fumbled
and the Ravens recovered. The video feed seen in the New York area
clearly showed Johnson down before the ball spurted loose.
</P>
<P>
   But the referee, Phil Luckett, was shown only the Baltimore
video feed that, to him, was not indisputable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some exhibition games use only four cameras,'' Seeman said.
``All our network games will have a minimum of seven cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   That particular bug should not reappear, but others will. On a
Ravens pass, wide receiver Billy Davis was ruled to have caught the
ball out of bounds because his left foot came down on the chalked
sideline. When the Ravens challenged the call, Luckett reversed it
_ incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original call should have stood,'' Seeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jets, wide receiver Ike Hilliard of the Giants
fumbled out of bounds in front of the Jets' bench. Coach Bill
Parcells made his only preseason challenge, claiming that Jets
safety Chris Hayes had recovered the ball in bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Gerald Austin upheld Parcells' challenge _ incorrectly.
As Hayes recovered the fumble with one hand, his other hand was
discovered later to have been out of bounds. Austin did not notice
that.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Fassel, the Giants' coach, the downfield
official who made the original out-of-bounds call was never
consulted by Austin before the referee stuck his head inside the
video-replay flap on the field monitor _ a zebra suddenly turned
ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   To exterminate that bug, the NFL should have both the official
who made the challenged call and the referee peer at the replay on
the field monitor. Let the other official see it again.
</P>
<P>
   Other bugs will surely surface, but Parcells had a thought on
the new system that has created an upstairs booth with a replay
assistant, a video operator, a technician and a communicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we don't hear the ballcarrier was down by contact,
the whistle blew,'' the Jets' coach said. ``That's what ruined this
thing the last time. Just let 'em play. In professional football,
the play kills itself. You see spearing, you call it, but you can
officiate the game without a quick whistle. That's the only thing
I'm hoping for because then the system loses credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As it will if the Replay Bugs are not exterminated quickly,
beginning Sunday. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn who got an
up-close-and-personal look at the next step in the evolution of a
superstar. Before Glenn's eyes, Randy Moss, the Minnesota Vikings
wide receiver, departed from his one-dimensional realm of being
only a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation happened last season when the Jets played the
Vikings at Giants Stadium on Sept. 3. Moss was lined up on the far
right side of the field against man-to-man coverage by Glenn. Moss'
pattern was simple. He took a few quick steps forward, then sliced
inside, leaving Glenn in his wake. The play gained 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is one of the quickest cornerbacks in the National
Football League, but the move Moss made was done with such
aggression, skill, and grace. That kind of footwork usually takes
three or four years to develop. After one season in the league,
Moss has those dance steps down.
</P>
<P>
   A few plays later, Moss ran a 10-yard crossing pattern against
the cornerback Victor Green, smartly using a game official as a
shield. It was yet another veteran move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot I have to learn,'' Moss said, ``and I'm
learning it pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he is. It's not that Moss never ran those kinds of patterns
as a rookie last season, because he did. He just did not do them as
well. He did not need to. His speed ruled. He had 69 catches for
1,313 yards and single-handedly changed the Vikings from a good
team into a great one that went 15-1 and failed to go to the Super
Bowl by a missed field goal. He so frightened the division rival
Green Bay that three of the Packers' first four picks in last
April's draft were defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings realized what they had and milked it as any good
team would. Why have him run a bunch of crossing patterns when he
can destroy a team's psyche with two deep touchdown catches?
</P>
<P>
   But even the most talented speedsters need to develop a total
game. And clearly that is what Moss has done. It is comparable to
when Michael Jordan developed an outside game to go along with his
inside skills.
</P>
<P>
   Moss spent much of the off season and training camp working on
his skills at running pass routes. In addition to going down field
like a gold-medal sprinter, he can now run a great post pattern, or
crossing route, or down and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy already had great moves last year but, yes, we're
emphasizing some of that more this season,'' said Vikings Coach
Denny Green. ``This season people will see that Randy is more than
just a deep threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The receiver's biggest challenge? ``I think staying healthy,''
Green said, ``because it's going to be real physical. Guys are
going to bang him and bump him more. He's going to have more people
coming after him because they know he can make a big play so he's
going to have to keep his mental edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, every time Moss makes a play, he can expect
tacklers to give him a brutal hit, or a shot to the ribs, a punch
or a twist of his ankle. It happened to Jerry Rice. It will happen
to Moss.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Vikings will be to find creative ways to
get Moss the ball. Moss is going to be the focus of every defensive
coordinator opposing the Vikings. One series, Moss might face a
double-team. The next series, he might draw single coverage from a
team's best defensive back. He could see triple coverage. He could
see Mel Blount coming out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Moss questioned whether his team had the same desire
it had last season. He expressed disappointment in the Vikings'
lackluster preseason and the poor play of the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of shocked me, to be honest with you, to see as far as
the veteran group of guys we got playing the offensive line,'' Moss
said last week. ``You know, they made some mistakes during the
preseason. And we all made mistakes. I made some during preseason.
You know, I think even Coach Green made some during the preseason.
So its just not the guys on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Moss is taking a leadership role in just his second
season, putting as much pressure on himself as others.
</P>
<P>
   It is always interesting to watch the NFL replenish itself. When
one superstar leaves or ages, another steps in his place. Rice has
only a short time left before he retires and goes into the Hall of
Fame. Here comes Moss, a more complete Moss, who has a chance to be
just as good.
</P>
<P>
   How close Moss gets to Rice's greatness is largely up to Moss.
It certainly does not hurt Moss that his repertory of moves has
expanded. And the Vikings' chances of getting a championship have
grown right along with him.

<P>
   Two straight Super Bowl victories, trademark offense, glimmering
endorsements and a striking transformation from being that team in
the mountains with the funky orange jerseys to becoming the
football franchise by which all others are judged _ yes, everyone
in Denver agrees: Life with the Broncos is so royal, so regal.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up that Jacuzzi. Sip another glass of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! The plug has been pulled. The bottle dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Star quarterback John Elway retires after January's Super Bowl.
Linebacker John Mobley drives his Jeep off the road and is slapped
with a charge of driving under the influence. Elway's successor,
Bubby Brister, is benched and walks out of camp. Brian Griese, who
has thrown all of three regular-season passes, is named the
starting quarterback. Bill Romanowski is accused of fraudulently
obtaining prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   All before the first regular-season snap against Miami Monday
night at home in Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No Elway, plus controversies like these, further reduces the
chance that the Broncos will become the first team to win three
consecutive Super Bowls. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here have had it pretty good, and there has been
little controversy here in the last couple of years,'' Broncos
Coach Mike Shanahan said. ``So, what's wrong with that now? It can
be good. I'm not trying to create it. But I embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take our quarterback position. I made my decision based on
minicamps, preseason games, practices and summer camp. Bubby is
better coming off the bench. Brian quickly came up. Now, I could
have done it the easy way. I could have let Bubby start, just play
the whole thing out, but that was not best for our football team.
Our players don't know the position like I do. As far as Bubby or
any of them, I'm not trying to be popular. I'm doing it for the
team. I told Bubby that if he could not accept it, if he couldn't
work with me, let me know so I could trade him. None of this
bothers me. What bothers me is not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Every team in the National Football League is coming after the
Broncos now, full steam, especially the Jets from the American
Football Conference East Division and Jacksonville from the AFC
Central. National Football Conference powers on the Denver schedule
this season include Green Bay and Minnesota. It is open season on
the Broncos. Shanahan knows he and his team are the hunted.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than quiver or shake, Shanahan shook up his team. The
initial results were promising. After a relatively listless
preseason, Denver's final preseason game was a 34-3 rout of San
Francisco in Griese's debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw guys finishing plays,'' the veteran Broncos end Alfred
Williams said of the game. ``I saw guys turning it on. That's what
we'll have to do to defy the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ominous odds. Remaining energized and eager after consecutive
championships. Winning with a first-time starting quarterback who
is only 24. Replacing the leadership and playmaking of Elway.
Handling controversy. Meeting the league-wide, full-court press of
attention and competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not paying attention, rest assured that everyone
else is,'' Pat Bowlen, the Broncos' owner, said. ``When you're up,
you're not well liked. I know that because for the last 10 years, I
respected the 49ers and the Cowboys but I didn't like them much. We
lost our first three Super Bowls. They both won two straight.
That's where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Griese.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan liked him from the start. He drafted Griese from
Michigan in the third round of the 1998 draft. The trait he admires
most about Griese is his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wunderlich test is given to players in the draft,''
Shanahan said. ``An average score is 15 to 20. A real smart
quarterback scores a 28. Brian scored a 39. He has picked up the
offense in total better than any quarterback I have been around.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shanahan has coached not only Elway, but also Joe Montana
and Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a coolness and calmness and great poise there,''
Shanahan said of Griese. ``At Michigan, he went undefeated his
senior season and won the national championship. Now, that wasn't a
great offensive team he played on; how many of those players are
star pro guys now? And given that he is the son of Bob Griese and
his dad is a Hall of Fame quarterback, you put a kid around a man
like that and it has to be an infectious environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, said Brister. He thought the starting job was his
because Shanahan anointed him as Elway's replacement soon after the
Super Bowl. And Brister believed the job was his to lose during the
regular season, not the preseason, although Brister led the Broncos
to just one touchdown on 18 offensive possessions in the preseason.
The number that mattered, Brister said, was that he was 4-0 as a
regular-season starter when Elway was injured.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan and Bowlen believed Brister was crumbling under the
pressure of replacing Elway. The grind, the baggage and the
responsibility seemed ``overwhelming, stifling and near
impossible'' for Brister, Bowlen said. ``If Brian had carried that
baggage for four months, I don't know if we would be talking about
him being the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brister, initially emotional, said Shanahan had lied to him and
had made an unjust decision. Things have calmed, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine that there are guys on this team that I have
to win over and earn their respect because they wanted Bubby to be
the starter,'' Griese said. ``But I am more concerned about not
rushing things and being myself. I don't do a lot of talking.
People have compared my game to my father's, but I was 5 years old
when he retired. They say I play a lot like him, but it is not
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is getting this offense to score touchdowns; that's
how quarterbacks should be judged. I saw the relationship,
friendship, respect and trust that Mike and John had for each
other. That's the kind of trust that leads you to the Super Bowl. I
don't have to have the same kind of friendship. But I like being in
the game and knowing how my coach calls a game. I like to get into
his head and be able to anticipate what the next play call will be.
That's the kind of relationship that wins championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Williams said of Griese: ``He's so young. Miami is going
to bring the house against him. But I still see a party
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   A seasonlong party, Denver hopes, even with Romanowski's
situation hovering. Local and federal authorities are recommending
that he, his wife, Julie, and two others be charged for allegedly
using fraud to obtain prescriptions used for the drug Phentamine.
It is primarily used for severe cases of obesity but is also a
stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has no legs,'' Bowlen said. ``I'm in the
weight room with our players. We had 45 guys make 100 percent of
all off-season workouts and the rest made more than 80 percent. It
is a part of our program we emphasize. I'd have to be deaf and
blind to not know there was some serious drug abuse going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Broncos ``deaf and blind'' about a first-time starter at
quarterback possibly winning a Super Bowl? About the drug charge
and controversy eventually swallowing them? That they are on the
verge of possibly being embarrassed?
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan believes his offensive line is improved. That
sensational running back Terrell Davis can produce even more. The
defense added a star in Dale Carter from Kansas City, one of the
league's premier single-cover cornerbacks. Shanahan expects more
from his defense, especially until Griese finds his way. He said
this team is his deepest, even without Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare and get mentally connected or we are going
to get embarrassed,'' he said, his eyes full of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy? Get used to it.
</P>

GIANTS, VIKINGS, 49ERS PICKS IN NFC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: Teams are profiled in order of predicted finish
</P>
<P>
   NFC EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. Giants &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Against Baltimore in the preseason, Michael Strahan
made crushing sacks of quarterback Tony Banks on back-to-back
plays. After one, he looked toward the Baltimore sideline and made
a face as if to say, ``No one can stop me.'' Like last season, when
Strahan recorded 15 sacks, the towering defensive end will be
unstoppable, as will linebacker Jessie Armstead. Despite questions
about when cornerback Jason Sehorn will return from his hamstring
injury, the Giants still have one of the top five defenses in the
league. That will be enough for them to win one of the weaker
divisions in football.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The offensive line will either be really good or
really bad. The only truly stable player is tackle Roman Oben, who
could have a Pro Bowl season. The rest is a toss-up. Who knows how
long center Brian Williams will hold up? And depth is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  Quarterback Kent Graham will have a big year and
Coach Jim Fassel, a smart coach, will finally unleash all of his
offensive plays because of his confidence in Graham. The receiving
group of Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius is solid.
</P>
<P>
   2. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 10-6, division champion
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  The old men are still hanging around. Quarterback
Troy Aikman, wide receiver Michael Irvin and running back Emmitt
Smith still have enough _ barely enough _ to win nine games. They
remain the center of the franchise. Larry Allen, the best offensive
lineman in football, will protect Aikman, and wide receiver Raghib
Ismail provides a legitimate deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The Cowboys still can't stop the run. They gave up
101.2 yards a game on the ground last season, and this year
defensive lineman Leon Lett, a great run stopper, is out at least
four games because of a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The division race will come down to the Giants and
the Cowboys. The Cowboys will finish second because of their age.
Football is a young man's game and the Giants have more
20-something talents.
</P>
<P>
   3. ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 9-7, wild-card team
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  There may be no more exciting quarterback to watch
than Jake Plummer. Last season, he threw for 3,737 yards and 17
touchdowns, and his savvy and ability to escape drew comparisons to
Joe Montana. Plummer is the real deal. He doesn't have the strong
arm of Kent Graham, the veteran smarts of Troy Aikman, or the
supporting cast of Brett Favre, but he is the next star quarterback
in the NFL. Plummer alone gives the Cardinals a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  After the Cardinals went 9-7 and upset Dallas in
the first round of the playoffs last season, many in the league
thought Arizona was on its way to a great season this year. But
these are the Cardinals; they don't know how to handle prosperity.
This past off season they had a series of contract disputes, and
the team did little in free agency to upgrade itself. Arizona's
biggest problem is its own history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  Because of Plummer, Arizona is capable of winning
nine games. Because these are the Cardinals, they won't.
</P>
<P>
   4. WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  The Redskins have been in a desperate funk under
Coach Norv Turner, whose record in Washington is 32-47-1. Knowing
that the team's biggest weakness was at quarterback, the Redskins
traded with the Minnesota Vikings for Brad Johnson. In training
camp this year, Johnson has had some injuries, but when healthy he
has shown the kind of poise and accuracy he did with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  There are potential problems everywhere. Defensive
linemen Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson have been total busts.
There is little talent at running back. And so far Turner has not
shown that he is capable of being a top head coach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  Turner won a power struggle with the former general
manager, Charley Casserly, when the new owner, Daniel Snyder, sided
with the head coach. Now Turner has no one to blame but himself for
what is very likely to be an ordinary season.
</P>
<P>
   5. PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 3-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  There is only one bright spot for what is certain
to be one of the worst franchises in sports in the next year, and
it is the rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb. In just a few
preseason games, McNabb has shown a flair and understanding of the
game that few rookies show immediately. He resembles Peyton Manning
in some ways, only he is more athletic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  No stars on defense. A terrible offensive line. No
wide receivers or a running game. Other than that, the Eagles are
fine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Eagles are going to win three games this year,
and the fans at Veterans Stadium, who have booed Santa Claus, will
have lots of fodder this season. The Eagles players are already
grumbling privately about whether the rookie coach, Andy Reid, has
the right stuff. This could be an ugly season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC East Player to Watch: Kent Graham, quarterback, Giants  &LR; 
There is no more motivated player in the NFL than Graham. He knows
the front office does not believe in him. He knows that many
members of the news media are waiting for him to fail. None of that
has distracted him.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has always been mentally tough, buoyed by his strong (and
private) religious beliefs and support from his family. After an
off season of intense preparation, which included showing up at
Giants Stadium before six in the morning to watch game film, Graham
is ready to have a big year. In fact, he could explode. His coach
supports him. His teammates do as well. And, for probably the first
time in his professional career, Graham has a complete offense
around him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NFC CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 15-1, division champion
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  In some ways what the Vikings did last season _
breaking every scoring record known to man _ has become a burden.
Everyone expects Minnesota to match that performance. That will
probably be impossible. Still, Coach Dennis Green, one of the
smartest in the business, is keeping expectations high, constantly
reminding the players that any letdown can lead to mediocrity. The
offense should also benefit from Green's becoming more involved in
the play-calling. The Vikings may have had a mediocre preseason
(2-2 record, outscored by 104-79), but with quarterback Randall
Cunningham, wide receivers Cris Carter and Randy Moss and running
back Robert Smith, they still have the best group of offensive
players in football.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  As the Jets showed against Minnesota in the final
preseason game, teams can still move the ball against the Vikings
in large chunks. But this team has few holes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Vikings are still the team to beat in the
division and a Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   2. GREEN BAY
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 11-5, wild-card team
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Like Minnesota, the Packers possess a dazzling
offense, led by quarterback Brett Favre, who hasn't looked this
sharp in three or four years. General Manager Ron Wolf has done a
good job of keeping the team intact and even adding depth. His best
move was making sure wide receiver Antonio Freeman was locked up to
a long-term contract. Defensive end Vonnie Holiday is making the
Packers forget about Reggie White.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The secondary is still vulnerable despite the
addition of several defensive backs via the draft. Safety LeRoy
Butler is in his 10th year and is a soft spot in coverage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Packers could easily make it to the Super Bowl
except for one problem: Green Bay still has no way of preventing
Moss from dominating.
</P>
<P>
   3. TAMPA BAY
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 8-8
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  The running game, led by Warrick Dunn and Mike
Alstott, remains one of the best. Last year, they combined to rush
for 1,872 yards and 10 touchdowns. Defensive end Warren Sapp vows
to take the Buccaneers to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  Two words: Trent Dilfer. He has supposedly
improved his game. He is supposedly more consistent. Blah, blah,
blah. Dilfer is Dilfer. As long as he is the quarterback, Tampa Bay
will most likely never be great.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Buccaneers, because of their defense and running
game, are a 10-victory team in a tough division. How far they go in
the playoffs depends on Dilfer. He has always been Tampa Bay's weak
link, a defensive coordinator's dream, and the only way the
Buccaneers will become a serious threat is if Dilfer sheds his
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   4. DETROIT &QL; 
1998 Record: 5-11
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  No Scott Mitchell, for one. He was dumped into the
hands of Baltimore. The team still has good wide receivers in
Herman Moore and Johnnie Morton. Charlie Batch is a good young
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  Running back Barry Sanders will be watching
football games this season instead of playing for the Lions. The
team has no running game whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  Without Sanders, the Lions are a team likely to win
five games. Coach Bobby Ross had made them more competitive over
all, but the organization needs to take a hard look at how it came
to be that Sanders is no longer there. Losing him is one of the
biggest personnel blunders this decade.
</P>
<P>
   5. CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 4-12
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  A team with two consecutive seasons with four
victories has no strengths. Quarterback Cade McNown, Chicago's
first pick in the draft, has shown promise in training camp and
might start by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The Bears have a large gap in talent. Last season,
teams averaged 318 yards a game against them, and that might go up
this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Bears are again destined to finish as one of the
worst teams in the league. They are a long way from the days when
George Halas or Mike Ditka was running the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC Central Player to Watch: Brett Favre, quarterback, Packers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason the Packers feel they can get back to the
Super Bowl is because of their strong-armed quarterback. He showed
up to training camp at 214 pounds, some 20 less than his playing
weight in 1998. To Green Bay, that is a positive omen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great shape,'' said the offensive coordinator, Sherman
Lewis. ``The last time he was in great shape like this was 1996,
the year we won the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Packers' Super Bowl victory, Favre admitted an
addiction to painkilling medication. He was also known as a serious
drinker. Since then, Favre has had no known further addiction
problems and stays away from alcohol. His conditioning and attitude
are the best they have been in years. For opponents, that is a
scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NFC WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. SAN FRANCISCO
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 12-4, wild-card team
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  A loaded offense. With Steve Young at quarterback
and Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes at wide receiver, the
49ers are formidable. Lawrence Phillips, if he stays out of
trouble, adds depth at running back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The first chunk of San Francisco's schedule is
interesting: the opener at Jacksonville, followed by games against
New Orleans, Arizona, Tennessee, St. Louis, Carolina and Minnesota.
If the 49ers aren't careful, they could end up winning only three
of those games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The 49ers can never sneak up on anyone. But everyone
expects Atlanta to win the division, and that will help the 49ers.
San Francisco still believes it is the class of the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   2. ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 14-2, division champion
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Jamal Anderson is a smart, bruising back. He ran
the ball an NFL-record 410 times last year. He may have more
carries this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The key for Atlanta last year was that the
once-brittle quarterback, Chris Chandler, stayed healthy for most
of the season. The chances of his doing that in consecutive seasons
are slim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Falcons made a crucial mistake when they released
wide receiver Tony Martin (he is now in Miami). His replacement is
the former Giants wide receiver Chris Calloway _ a solid player but
excruciatingly slow. It can't be underestimated how much Martin's
speed _ and his 66 catches _ meant to the Atlanta offense. He
scared teams. Now, Anderson is sure to see more eight- and nine-man
fronts. The Falcons are still a team good for 11 or 12 victories.
</P>
<P>
   3. NEW ORLEANS
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 6-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Ricky Williams put a scare into the organization
when he went down with an ankle injury in the preseason. Suddenly,
the idea of trading away the entire draft did not seem like such a
good idea. But Williams turned out to be fine and will start the
season opener against St. Louis. So far the trade was a good idea,
as Williams is a powerful runner who will keep the pressure off of
the Saints' weak passing game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The two Billy Joes, Tolliver and Hobert. Neither
can play a lick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Saints are interesting to watch. If Williams is
good _ and so far he looks like a big-time player _ they could
sneak into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   4. ST. LOUIS
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 4-12
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Trading for Marshall Faulk was a smart move that
will provide the Rams some much-needed offense. For the
Indianapolis Colts last year, Faulk had 1,319 yards rushing and 908
yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The Rams are still a terrible defensive team,
especially against the run.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  When quarterback Trent Green blew out his knee in the
final preseason game, any chance of the Rams' making the playoffs
disappeared. Teams will design their game plans to stop Faulk
because he is St. Louis' only true offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   5. CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: 4-12
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STRENGTHS: &LR;  Tshimanga Biakabutuka is a solid runner. Fullback
William Floyd is a good blocker. Wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad
provides a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEAKNESSES: &LR;  The new coach, George Seifert, is putting in an
entirely new defensive system, and it will take time for the team
to adapt. Quarterback Steve Beuerlein is mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUTLOOK: &LR;  The Panthers are years from having the talent to
compete seriously for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC WEST PLAYER TO WATCH: Jamal Anderson, running back,
Falcons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the most talkative and friendly players in
professional football, and he is a leader on the Falcons. This is a
crucial season for Anderson. He is coming off a contract holdout
that sometimes got bitter and tested his relationship with Coach
Dan Reeves and his teammates. All are said to be fine with
Anderson, however.
</P>
<P>
   It will not take long to find out how true that is. Anderson
will be tested, mentally and physically, more than ever. Reeves
will surely call his number again and again, and Anderson will at
times feel like he is 70 years old.
</P>
<P>
   How well Anderson holds up is the key to Atlanta's season.  &QL;

GIANTS CONTINUE THEIR MATURATION PROCESS FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On several levels, there are signs the 1999 National Football
League season will be the most pivotal one for the Giants franchise
since the team's 1990 Super Bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   If the team digresses from last year's 8-8 record, and
especially if the Giants have a disastrous season, there could be a
new head coach and a search for a new quarterback. In that case,
there would be a new offensive system, new assistant coaches, an
entirely new direction, and probably, plenty of soul-searching
about whether the Giants basic operating football philosophy needs
an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean the fourth coaching makeover in eight years, and
that's a lot of instability for a team wedded to constancy.
</P>
<P>
   But if this Giants season is a winning one, the picture changes
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It is a certainty that Coach Jim Fassel would get a contract
extension. A big part of the quarterback situation would have been
resolved. A belief in the Giants' methods of building a team
through the draft and a new, if limited, enthusiasm for free agency
would be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The regime of General Manager Ernie Accorsi, which began a year
ago, would be off to a sterling start. With a contract extension,
Fassel would be chasing Bill Parcells and Allie Sherman, both of
whom were with the team eight years, for the longest Giants head
coaching term in the last 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to rest on one season, a season which begins with a
difficult road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   If all this pressure is wearing on Fassel, he isn't showing it.
Always driven and meticulous to every detail, Fassel is nonetheless
visibly more relaxed this year than in the two previous seasons.
Friday, he said the stakes of this season as they relate to his own
status or personal gain have not crossed his mind for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about any of that,'' said Fassel, standing
outside the team's locker room. ``I've never worried about a job in
my life. If you're thinking about those things, you're not thinking
about the things that matter in your job, which is how you're going
to be judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big year, I know that. We have to win. But I don't
think anybody can put more pressure on me than me. I have more
confidence this team will perform at a higher level than any other
team I've had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi would not talk about the possibilities in a worst-case
scenario for his team, but he emphatically endorsed Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great degree of respect and affection for Jim
throughout the organization,'' Accorsi said. ``From ownership on
down, including me personally. It's a good working relationship
that we expect to be a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel is confident the Giants are on the cusp of a breakthrough
season. Indeed, he might already have a contract extension, except
that Fassel told friends he was willing to gamble that his
negotiating leverage would be even better after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel believes the 1999 Giants have matured, with more veteran
players in key leadership roles like quarterback Kent Graham, who
is 30 years old, linebacker Jessie Armstead, who turns 29 next
month, and defensive end Michael Strahan, a 27-year-old beginning
his sixth season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the Giants have been the youngest team
in the league. It was once a badge of honor. By last season, it was
more often the excuse for the team's stumbles and missteps. Fassel
and his players don't want to hear about their youth anymore. They
want to hear about how they are beginning to play as a seasoned
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I was here, we were battling a lot of things -
a lack of confidence mostly,'' Fassel said. ``I didn't know how far
we were going, but we were building. The second year, I sensed we
might be misreading our growth and where we were, that we were too
overconfident. I tried to change that. It was tough to take, but we
got through it. This year, I see us understanding what it takes
mentally more than ever. And I think we acquired better players.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those players: Kerry Collins, an immensely talented backup
quarterback; tight end Pete Mitchell, a skilled pass catcher who
could be the team's leading receiver; center Brian Williams, the
emotional leader of the offensive line who is back after two years
sidelined with an eye injury; and the surprising rookie running
back Sean Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The team's defense will again be a strength and should be good
enough to keep them in most games. Fassel has promised that the
offense would keep its daring and unpredictable preseason look. If
they pull the reins in as they have in other years, they could well
be doomed. National Football League defenses feast on the timid.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Giants contend there is a new attitude to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are fed up,'' Strahan said, describing his teammates.
``Last year, we had too many guys who were content. I want to win
now, I'm fed up with waiting, and I got plenty of guys with me.
</P>
<P>
   `` That's a bad mood to be in and that's nothing but good for
us.'' &QL;

 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde had gone through the batch of newspaper
clippings prepared each day for the Jets' front office. Now, he
looked at the cover sheet, which had a little saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pursue happiness,'' the Jets quarterback read. ``Others
create it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time almost 30 years ago when he tacked a poster of Joe
Namath onto his bedroom wall and imagined himself leading the Jets
to the Super Bowl, Testaverde has created his own happiness. And
now, in the funny way sports sometimes works, Testaverde has
created a spectacular situation by being less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped thinking about a perfect game last year,'' he said.
``I think about what Coach said. It's getting my job done. If
there's no play, you throw it away _ rather than taking a sack or
throwing an interception.''
</P>
<P>
   So he admits it is a more patient Testaverde, a Testaverde
content with doing less who leads the Jets Sunday against the
Patriots in the opener of a season many people believe will
continue until the end of January and the Super Bowl in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Testaverde has always been able to maintain
confidence in his own ability. In the uncertain world of
quarterbacks, it helps. Testaverde did it through the
interception-plagued years with Tampa Bay; he did it in Cleveland
when the fans wanted the prodigal son Bernie Kosar, and he did it
in Baltimore when, at the end, they demanded someone younger. That
confidence was not always rewarded in performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a pro career going back to 1987, Testaverde had never
finished a season among the top eight quarterbacks in any major
category _ touchdowns, fewest interceptions, yardage, completion
percentage. And not, certainly, in victories. As a starter, he had
a won-lost percentage of 36.7.
</P>
<P>
   So when Testaverde became a Jet last season, the wise, yet
cynical, Boomer Esiason _ another Long Islander who had been a
Jets' quarterback and can laugh about it _ telephoned him
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Boomer saying, `The Jets?''' Testaverde chuckled at
the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Boomer told me, `It's a double-edged sword. You win, it's
twice as good. You lose, it's twice as bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   What was it, then, when the Jets surged to 12-1 with Testaverde
starting? When he produced in the clutch: 10 touchdowns, no
interceptions, a completion percentage of 62.9 on third downs? When
Testaverde threw an astounding 29 touchdowns and a mere 7
interceptions and the Jets came within two or three dropped balls
of going to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   It was ``the magical season,'' as Testaverde calls it.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers heaped respect on Testaverde, burnishing the
appealing hometown boy-makes-good story, and helped make the Jets'
offense one of the most dangerous in the NFL. And now the Jets are
American Conference East Division favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has come a long way. Through the bad years _
including six Tampa Bay seasons that never produced a record better
than 6-10 _ he remained the dogged competitor his father, Al
Testaverde, taught him to be. ``Vinny, if you're going to throw a
football, throw it as hard as you can,'' insisted Big Al, who died
last February. ``Whatever you do, don't do it half-speed. Learn as
much as you can about everything you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Testaverde might have learned losing, he never gave up.
And he always threw the ball hard. Sometimes too hard, too often.
</P>
<P>
   But last year something happened to the way Testaverde
approaches football, and that altered how he approaches life, he
says. He began to let the game come to him.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was looking for work 14 months ago. He was a free
agent and the Jets were in need of a back-up to Glenn Foley.
Luckily for Testaverde, he had a history with some key Jets'
people-Bill Belichick, the defensive mastermind who, as head coach
in 1993, had brought Testaverde to Cleveland, and suffered the
wrath of the Dog Pounders by benching the beloved home-town boy
Kosar. And Scott Pioli, who had been Cleveland's personnel guru,
was now doing the same with the Jets. Both told Parcells about
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   The new quarterbacks' coach, Dan Henning, also was in
Testaverde's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got out of college,'' explained Henning, ``he went
with a team that was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioli, meanwhile, knew this telling statistic: In Testaverde's
career, he had been blessed with a 1,000-yard rusher in only one
season, the journeyman Reggie Cobb who did it at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed Testaverde in June 1998, Coach Bill Parcells knew
that the quarterback's career had been split in two. Since leaving
Tampa Bay in 1993, he had tossed 98 touchdowns to only 71
interceptions. He had gone to a Pro Bowl with Baltimore. Too many
people, however, remembered him for those horrid Tampa Bay
statistics: 77 touchdowns, 112 interceptions. Too few people knew
that in only one season of his 12-year pro career had Testaverde
been blessed with a 1,000-yard rusher, the journeyman Reggie Cobb
with Tampa Bay in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Vinny, `When you've been in trouble is when you started
to run with the ball and tried to make something happen,'''
Parcells said. ``I told him, `You don't worry about anything but
the passing game. We'll run the ball for you. We've got weapons for
you. Don't try to make things happen yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had an outstanding preseason, but Glenn Foley had an
equally strong showing and he started the year at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It was a frustrating time for the Testaverdes. Once, Al
Testaverde, after watching his son take command of a practice,
looking more imposing at 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds than most
of his teammates, asked: ``Why don't they use my boy? Don't you
think he's better than Glenn?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Parcells came to that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But only after the coach had deprogrammed Testaverde of early
training that had encouraged him to take everything upon himself.
Testaverde recently reflected again on his changed approach to the
game. ``I think Bill's pretty accurate talking about what happened
when I got in trouble in the past. When I got out of the pocket
I've made bad mistakes on the run. If there's a wide receiver open,
get it to him. But if you have to scramble, throw it away.'' And
then Testaverde added, looking to his left, ``Don't throw it across
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   He realizes now that his progress as a pro quarterback was
delayed by his earlier successes: from a legendary high school
career, to Heisman Trophy winner at Miami, which led to his
selection as the overall No.1 draft pick with one of the sport's
worst franchises, Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for four coaches in six years with the Buccaneers,
Testaverde tried to do it all, whatever the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think early on, that's what my problem was,'' he said. ``I
thought I could throw on anybody. What's ingrained in me now is
there's nothing wrong with punting on fourth down. It's worse to
throw an interception on third down. If a play didn't work in past
years, I'd think, why didn't they run my play? When you start
thinking too many things, it clouds your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He rarely sounds bitter about the early years, but he does say,
with some pride, ``If I was that bad, would I have lasted that
long? Look who was quarterbacking before me at Tampa Bay: Doug
Williams, Steve Young, Steve DeBerg. All went elsewhere as backups,
and two of them led their teams to Super Bowls. I cannot allow
people to make me perform differently because of their
perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   When he breaks the huddle Sunday, he said he will worry about no
one's responsibilities but his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to worry ... would the guard pick up the blitz? I don't
worry about it. That's not my job description. It's freed up a lot
of space in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has freed him of hometown doubts, but not of the burden
of hometown expectations. When asked how he would now respond to
Esiason's wry view of playing quarterback for the Jets, Testaverde
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right,'' he replied. ``It's twice as good. But I'm
going to say that with a lot of hesitation.'' &QL;

   They often go unnoticed because they perform dirty work, clean
up the mess of others. For most, the ball is not in their hands _
they have to toil for it. Some start, others do not, but their
teammates and coaches know their value.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Al Del Greco, 37 and still kicking. How about Michael
Sinclair _ did you know in the last three seasons he has gained
more sacks (41.5) than any other National Football League player?
How about Trace Armstrong, rushing the passer on the field and
running tirelessly for his peers off it, helping them gain the best
collective bargaining deals with management.
</P>
<P>
   How many thought Mike Tomczak was finished a few years ago when
his then Bears coach, Mike Ditka, used to grab him and demean him
and embarrass him in public view? He survived that, grew, remained
dignified and found a home in Pittsburgh, where he will most likely
be needed once again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Lomas Brown. A big man, a stately one. Soft-spoken
but sincere. Digging on every play. A guy from the gritty Overtown
section of Miami who daily remembers his roots. A survivor of 14
seasons who is ready for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I just want to play one more season,'' Brown said. ``One
more. OK, maybe one more after that. And then that would be it.
I've had a ball. I've had the chance to enjoy something I love. And
if I didn't get all the attention in the world while I was doing
it, that was fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   These unappreciated players always seem to give one more season.
</P>
<P>
   One more play.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown, OT, Cleveland Browns, 6-4, 290, 15th season.
Remains athletic and mobile; a quiet leader.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tomczak, QB, Pittsburgh Steelers, 6-1, 210, 15th season.
Survived early career disasters; always there when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bailey, CB, Detroit Lions, 5-9, 174, 9th season. Nickel
back and productive special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Woodall, LB, San Francisco 49ers, 6-1, 224, 6th season. Once
a project, now a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hayes, S, Jets, 6-0, 206, 3d season. Nonstop motor and
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Trace Armstrong, DE, Miami Dolphins, 6-4, 270, 11th season. A
leader in and out of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Hoard, RB, Minnesota Vikings, 5-11, 224, 10th season. A
dazzling backup who could start for several teams.
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco, K, Tennessee Titans, 5-10, 202, 16th season.
Kickers come and go; he endures. Led the league last season in
field goals with 36.
</P>
<P>
   William Thomas, LB, Philadelphia Eagles, 6-2, 223, 9th season. A
very good player on a very bad team.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sinclair, DE, Seattle Seahawks, 6-4, 267, 8th season.
Forced six fumbles last season.

 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere, littered about like clues in a
mystery. In a league crammed with a half-dozen legitimate Super
Bowl contenders that could make this one of the most riveting
seasons in years, it is Jets Coach Bill Parcells _ his team and his
future _ at the center of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are this year's team of intrigue, mainly because of
their brilliant, intense and manipulative head coach. Parcells
appears to be preparing for one final, grand run at a National
Football League championship. After making several astute personnel
moves over the past few years _ the signing of running back Curtis
Martin, rejuvenating the careers of quarterback Vinny Testaverde
and linebacker Bryan Cox, and snagging the Pro Bowl safety Steve
Atwater from Denver _ Parcells has positioned the Jets at the brink
of something special.
</P>
<P>
   They will have serious competition. The Broncos are the two-time
defending champions and have the best running back in football in
Terrell Davis, Minnesota has a devastating offense led by wide
receiver Randy Moss, and Jacksonville could easily win at least 12
games. Yet it is the Jets who have the best of everything: balance
on offense, a solid defense and the best coaching staff in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and his team will have to deal with high expectations,
injuries to key players and edginess about the new instant-replay
system. But the Jets also face a unique set of problems. The team
is for sale and the head coach may be on his way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will not publicly discuss his future, but there are two
prominent signs that he could be making his last stand. First,
contrary to his strong public denials, Parcells is closely involved
with an undisclosed group to buy the Jets, according to a league
official. NFL rules prevent an owner from coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Parcells is working on another book, this one detailing
his experiences with the Jets. The last time Parcells wrote a
football book was in 1987, when he penned his autobiography the
same year he led the Giants to a victory in Super Bowl XXI. The
Jets hope that is an omen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, figuring out what Parcells will do is like trying to
decipher a Bill Belichick defense, which is almost impossible. So
there are as many opinions on Parcells' future as harsh words used
by Denver's Bubby Brister after learning he was being demoted as
the starting quarterback in favor of Brian Griese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to guess, I would say this is his last year,'' said
John Madden, the Fox analyst, who knows Parcells well. ``He's a
great coach and he's done it all. He won when he was here with the
Giants. He won in New England. He has won back here with the Jets,
and he is probably thinking there is little else for him to do as a
coach. There were rumors before this season that this would be his
last one, and that was before the ownership situation. If that
situation is not right, then he will definitely be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who also played for Parcells in New England, said:
``Bill is so unpredictable, you never know what Bill is going to
do. Bill might coach for four more years, or Bill might stop
coaching at the end of this season. I don't even try to figure him
out. Sometimes it seems there is no rhyme to his reason. You're
asking me to get inside his mind. I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on this season might be equally as difficult
because so many teams have a chance to be special.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback John Elway made his teary goodbye from the
Broncos this summer, no one had any idea what occur in his wake.
Because of Brister's poor performance in the preseason, the
uncertainty surrounding the second-year quarterback Griese, and the
burden of knowing that no team has won three consecutive Super
Bowls, the Broncos are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of teams peruse the league, see no clear favorite, glance
in the mirror and say: ``There is no reason we can't win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the Vikings are still angry at losing the
conference title game to Atlanta and vow a Super Bowl run, as do
the Falcons, led by running back Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson thinks his Miami Dolphins, after adding the
controversial runner Cecil Collins (once accused of attacking a
female student while he was at Louisiana State) and wide receiver
Tony Martin (recently acquitted of Federal money-laundering
charges), have one of the most potent offenses in football. Johnson
is another coach who could retire after this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this team a lot,'' he said. ``Anyone who looks at us
and doesn't think we're capable of winning a lot of games is making
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville added the best defensive back in the game, Carnell
Lake, to boost its defense, but it is the Jaguars' offense, sparked
by quarterback Mark Brunell, that makes them so formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos still feel good about their team despite a
quarterback controversy and the possibility that linebacker Bill
Romanowski could face felony charges and NFL suspension. He has
been accused of illegally obtaining a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams could spring surprises. Green Bay quarterback Brett
Favre lost 20 pounds in the off season and the Packers added 200
pounds of intensity in Ray Rhodes, their new coach. The Giants may
have the best defense in the league, which should help their
chances of capturing the weak NFC East. In Buffalo, quarterback
Doug Flutie, the scrambling little man, has proven he can lead the
Bills to the post-season, a place where Peyton Manning, a
second-year player who is the next great quarterback, might land
his Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL hasn't seen a situation like this in quite some time: no
dominant team. No single group of superstars, which Dallas had in
the early 1990s. The door to a championship is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree this is going to be an exciting season,'' Madden said.
``A lot of the division races might go down to the final week.
Right now it is really hard to pick one team and say, `That team is
the one.'''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be difficult to peg a favorite, it is not hard to
see which team has prepared hardest for this moment. Parcells has
built the Jets, player by player, to make a run now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be true, we may be ready now,'' Testaverde said.
``This could be a special year, but we have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells was named coach of the Jets before the 1997
season, it did not take long for his strong will to infect a
demoralized franchise. Parcells brought in coaches and players who
would follow his orders without question. Many of them, like
Martin, were talented, expensive veterans, and it quickly became
apparent that Parcells was not building for the long term, but for
immediate success.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Parcells came within one half of reaching the Super
Bowl, but the Jets disintegrated against Denver late in the AFC
title game at Mile High Stadium. The way the Jets lost left
Parcells with a bitter feeling. He was not used to seeing a team of
his fall apart at such a critical time in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells knew the Jets were where he wanted them and needed
only a few more pieces. He wisely decided to get a player from the
Denver team that beat him in Atwater, who played with the Broncos
for 10 years. Even at 32, Atwater is capable of changing a game
with a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets may have a young starting offensive line, but over all,
they are one of the smartest, most veteran teams in the league.
Coach Dennis Green's Vikings played the Jets in preseason, and he
walked away thinking they are the team to beat in the AFC and
perhaps the league. ``I think they're very good,'' Green said.
``They block well. They have a fine runner in Curtis Martin, Vinny
Testaverde plays smart, and then defensively they are very
scrappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Green can identify with Parcells' situation. Two years ago, the
Vikings were for sale, and Green coached through a turbulent and
uncertain year.
</P>
<P>
   When Green looks at Parcells, he is not so sure the Jets' coach
will retire. Parcells has lost weight, as Green did recently, and
to Green Parcells looks refreshed. Indeed, how Parcells feels at
the end of the season may be as big a factor in any retirement
decision as who buys the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is his last year or not because I think
he's really enjoying it,'' Green said. ``A lot will depend on the
sale of the team. I went through the same thing with the Vikings.
It can be stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know something else?'' Green added. ``Look at him.
He's lost weight and looks great. He is obviously enjoying himself.
There are a lot of coaches who have come out of training camp
basically retired. They're tired and worn down. You can see it in
their eyes. That's not the case with Bill. He seems upbeat and
shows a lot of enthusiasm. Besides, I don't know if Bill knows what
he wants to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Parcells definitely wants is another Super Bowl ring.
This may be his best chance to get it.

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ On the very day that the United States
helped bring one more Middle East peace agreement to fruition and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright witnessed its signing, a
crisis broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington
was called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the
United States found it not so easy to make the problem go way by
simply swaggering in at the opportune moment and brandishing its
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is stunning, if only because the world has long
thought of the Middle East, not some tiny corner of Indonesia, as
the toughest nut to crack among all the world's many intractable
disputes, and because the world has recently come to think of the
United States as the one power with enough influence to make just
about anybody sit up and listen _ the ``indispensable nation,'' in
one of Albright's favorite phrases.
</P>
<P>
   But just what does this singular U.S. power consist of, and how
and where can the United States use it? More important, are there
still moments, as with the Indonesians last week, when Americans
might be tempted to just throw up their hands and say it is beyond
their power to do anything?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly academic. Right now, Washington is trying
to help end a war in East Africa between Ethiopians and Eritreans.
In North Asia, it wants to stop the North Koreans from test firing
a ballistic missile, a threat that worries South Korea and Japan.
And in South Asia, the Clinton administration is unofficially
adjudicating the dispute in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse for Americans to get involved in East Timor was
sudden and sharp, after murderous militias rampaged through the
Portuguese-speaking territory last week in an effort to overturn
the results of a referendum in which the population voted
overwhelmingly for independence. At least at first, Indonesia
flatly rejected U.N. efforts to send in a peacekeeping force,
leading U.S. officials to step in and try to persuade them to
either restore order quickly or let outsiders do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial moments of frustration with Indonesia, it might
have been tempting to think of the way American clout had just
played so important a role in the Middle East. But in fact, the
decision to get peace talks back on track with a revamped
land-for-security deal between the Palestinians and Israelis hardly
represented a precedent for success in Indonesia. Instead, it was
an unusually easy opportunity to make America seem irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   First, the immediate question to be mediated in the Middle East
wasn't really so tough. There was a quibble here over the release
of prisoners, a quibble there over the right to launch unilateral
actions. And a larger question underneath hinted at inevitable
American success. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had wanted as
little U.S. input as possible, preferring to bargain on his own
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But Arafat waited for the
comfort of a U.S. presence not just at the signing, but in the
deal-making itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the presence of Albright that gave the
Palestinian the confidence to sign up. For Arafat, this made
Washington a court of last appeal. Now, he can reason, if something
goes wrong with the implementation of the deal he can turn to the
Clinton administration for help.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of history has gone into that understanding _ nearly
three decades of a tenacious, expensive and often frustrating U.S.
commitment to help the Middle East find a lasting peace. The
question in other parts of the globe now is whether the United
States can similarly play the role of ``indispensable nation'' in
helping resolve situations like the one in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, Washington does seem to have a long history of
involvement, and hence considerable leverage, with Indonesia _
certainly a lot more than can be claimed by neighboring Australia,
one of Washington's staunchest and now most nervous allies.
Australia, whose northernmost port of Darwin is only about 400
miles from East Timor, clamored all week for U.S. help in calming
the violence and for U.S. logistical support in mounting a
peacekeeping mission to be sponsored by the United Nations. Very
quickly, senior U.S. military officers were in contact with Gen.
Wiranto, the head of the Indonesian army, telling him to curb the
militias or face consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But as Wiranto listened by telephone to Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Indonesian knew he had a
very good hand to play as well. All of Washington's history of
backing the Indonesian military during the Cold War in fact brings
it little leverage these days; in recent years, almost all military
assistance has been cut by Congress because of the Indonesian
army's abuse of human rights. And as Wiranto listened, he knew
something even more important: that the United States is not about
to totally abandon Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous
nation and the master of sea lanes through which U.S. naval vessels
and oil carriers pass.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Indonesia is a strategically important country for the
United States in Asia, one that serves as a counterbalance to China
as well as Japan. (The Israelis have known something similar over
the years, of course, but their calculations have been different:
While no U.S. president could abandon Israel, the United States
also wasn't about to abandon its Arab allies who gave America
access to oil. Hence the pressure for all sides to seek peace.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before Clinton left Washington to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in New Zealand, where East
Timor's plight is sure to dominate the discussions, he suggested he
might push for the International Monetary Fund to curb economic
assistance to Indonesia. But on hearing this, Wiranto may well have
calculated that this was not a serious threat either. The end of
financial aid to Indonesia, where the economy is in perilous shape,
would produce the very troubles that the United States would like
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States would hate to carry out that threat because
you would create chaos,'' said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow
at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is writing a book on the
history of American diplomacy. ``The last thing we want to be
forced to do is shoot the Indonesians in the head. To block all aid
would hurt United States interests as much as Indonesia's.''
</P>
<P>
   While Washington was displeased last week with the Indonesian
army's refusal to put out the fire in East Timor, the
administration also had reason to fear putting too much pressure on
the Indonesian military. With the decline of the major political
party, Golkar, and with democratic reforms in their infancy, the
United States still sees the army as the only national institution
capable of holding together an archipelago nation strewn across
thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Mead also argues that Washington is hampered in the new crisis
by a lack of past identification with East Timor. In the Middle
East, for example, administration negotiators, who have been
dealing intensely with Arafat for nearly a decade, can tell him:
``Don't declare statehood, don't mess it up, you can't do that,''
Mead said. And then the administration can _ as Clinton did last
April _ promise to hold a summit meeting, always an attractive
offer for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the lure of the United States as a broker is the
lure of the United States as a dispenser of economic assistance. In
the Middle East 20 years ago, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did
not make peace with Israel primarily out of a desire for peace
itself, said Itamar Rabinovitch, a former Israeli ambassador to the
United States who has just written a history of Middle East
negotiations, ``Waging Peace'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). ``He
wanted to disengage from the Soviet Union and have ties with the
United States,'' Rabinovitch said. Sadat's reward for settling with
Israel at Camp David consisted of huge infusions of annual aid to
Egypt in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rabinovitch argues, the priority today for Syrian
President Hafez Assad is not so much to make peace with Israel as
to make peace with Washington and then hopefully reap economic
assistance. Thus, Assad is insisting on an American broker as he
contemplates whether to get serious and start negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea too, money plays a big role; it is why North Korea
accepts the United States as a mediator between it and the South.
In essence, Washington has been bribing crop-starved North Korea
with food aid to try to keep it from firing a missile. And for some
smaller countries, good behavior in American eyes can result in
largesse from the international financial institutions. With U.S.
involvement as mediator in the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, it is
almost certain that financial support would follow peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, it is the use of U.S. economic power as a club
or carrot that may prove the most promising way to persuade the
Indonesians to let the world help stem the violence in East Timor.
Indonesia is, after all, only now emerging from the economic crisis
that shook all of Asia just two years ago, and that brought about
the collapse of Indonesia's last government, under Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as though an industry of peace is our greatest export,''
said Mead.

   Sleep, while never exactly out of style, seems really in vogue
now. The Wall Street Journal this year proclaimed it ``the new
status symbol.'' Business superstars like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com
and Marc Andreesen of Netscape _ in contrast with past
overachievers like Thomas Edison, who scoffed at sleep _ brag about
getting eight hours of luxuriant nod regularly, to the doubtless
envy of America's legions of sleep-deprived stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world has been busy sawing wood itself, producing
so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the nation now has
a viable alternative to counting sheep. According to R.R. Bowker's
``Books in Print,'' scores of new titles on sleep have been churned
out annually in the late 1990s and there are now hundreds
available.
</P>
<P>
   Many are redundant, recommending familiar habits of healthful
living as keys to sound slumber. (Eat right, exercise, go easy on
the booze and caffeine, etc.) But even so, the books may not leave
your eyelids drooping _ for a close perusal yields passages that
surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. Here is a sampling.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 1: ``The Snoring Cure: Simple Steps to Getting a
Good Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Laurence A. Smolley and Debra Fulghum
Bruce (W.W. Norton, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Through the years, bed partners have taken it upon
themselves to solve the snoring problem, using such obscure
remedies as stuffing a cloth in the snorer's mouth. Snorers have
claimed fractured ribs from getting hard pokes during the night by
a bed partner in an attempt to jolt the snorer and quiet the noise.
In an extreme case of listener annoyance, the gunslinger John
Wesley Hardin is remarked to have fatally shot a loud snorer in the
next room.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 2: ``The Sleep Rx: 75 Proven Ways to Get a Good
Night's Sleep,'' by Norman Ford (Reward Books, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Quote, on a stress-reduction method: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worry-Stopper No. 1: The Worry Tree
</P>
<P>
   Choose a tree in your yard or near your home that you see each
day as you come home from work. Designate it as your ``worry
tree.'' ... Leave all your worries on the tree as you enter your
home.
</P>
<P>
   If no tree is handy, visualize yourself pinning each of your
worries on a real or imagined clothes line. Or visualize yourself
burying each of your worries in a hole in the ground and covering
it with soil. Or ``see'' yourself placing all your worries in an
incinerator and burning them. Another variation is to place all
your worries in an imaginary garbage can. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 3: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting a Good
Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Martin Moore-Ede and Suzanne LeVert (Alpha
Books, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Revelatory opening line: Sleep: It's an activity we all try to
perform every day, just like eating or getting some exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 4: ``Don't Snore Anymore: Your Complete Guide to
a Quiet Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Jeffrey N. Hausfeld (Three Rivers
Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: An elderly couple made separate appointments to see me
and were placed in two adjacent examining rooms. When I first went
in to see the gentleman, his major complaint was a stuffy nose.
Upon examination, he had significant obstruction to his nasal
airflow, a very bulky uvula, enlarged tonsils and a short, heavy
neck. Suspecting that he might have a problem with snoring, I asked
him, ``How badly do you snore at night?'' His answer surprised me.
He said that he used to snore very loudly, but in recent years his
wife had not complained. It turned out that when I went to the
adjacent examining room to speak to his wife, she was there to
consult me about her progressive hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 5: ``The Promise of Sleep,'' by Dr. William C.
Dement and Christopher Vaughan (Delacorte, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote, on napping in the cockpit: Although pilot naps, intended
or otherwise, already occur on American flights ... it has proven
politically impossible to pass regulations allowing them; there is
still the unfortunate perception that permitting pilots to sleep in
the cockpit is dangerous _ even with a fully awake co-pilot _
despite studies that show planned napping to be safer than not
napping. This is one of the most preposterous and illogical policy
decisions of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 6: ``No More Sleepless Nights: A Proven Program
to Conquer Insomnia,'' by Peter Hauri, Ph.D., and Shirley Linde,
Ph.D. (Wiley, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Some patients get up in the middle of the night and eat,
without ever becoming fully conscious. In a behavioral state that
resembles sleepwalking, they may wander into the kitchen while
unconscious and eat. Sweets and pasta are usually preferred, but
some patients eat inappropriate foods such as raw, frozen or
spoiled food in odd mixtures of butter, fruit and leftovers
prepared in a blender. ...
</P>
<P>
   Patients with this disorder awaken in the morning with full
stomachs, skip breakfast, but still gain weight.

   Sleep, while never exactly out of style, seems really in vogue
now. The Wall Street Journal this year proclaimed it ``the new
status symbol.'' Business superstars like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com
and Marc Andreesen of Netscape _ in contrast with past
overachievers like Thomas Edison, who scoffed at sleep _ brag about
getting eight hours of luxuriant nod regularly, to the doubtless
envy of America's legions of sleep-deprived stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world has been busy sawing wood itself, producing
so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the nation now has
a viable alternative to counting sheep. According to R.R. Bowker's
``Books in Print,'' scores of new titles on sleep have been churned
out annually in the late 1990s and there are now hundreds
available.
</P>
<P>
   Many are redundant, recommending familiar habits of healthful
living as keys to sound slumber. (Eat right, exercise, go easy on
the booze and caffeine, etc.) But even so, the books may not leave
your eyelids drooping _ for a close perusal yields passages that
surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. Here is a sampling.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 1: ``The Snoring Cure: Simple Steps to Getting a
Good Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Laurence A. Smolley and Debra Fulghum
Bruce (W.W. Norton, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Through the years, bed partners have taken it upon
themselves to solve the snoring problem, using such obscure
remedies as stuffing a cloth in the snorer's mouth. Snorers have
claimed fractured ribs from getting hard pokes during the night by
a bed partner in an attempt to jolt the snorer and quiet the noise.
In an extreme case of listener annoyance, the gunslinger John
Wesley Hardin is remarked to have fatally shot a loud snorer in the
next room.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 2: ``The Sleep Rx: 75 Proven Ways to Get a Good
Night's Sleep,'' by Norman Ford (Reward Books, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Quote, on a stress-reduction method: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worry-Stopper No. 1: The Worry Tree
</P>
<P>
   Choose a tree in your yard or near your home that you see each
day as you come home from work. Designate it as your ``worry
tree.'' ... Leave all your worries on the tree as you enter your
home.
</P>
<P>
   If no tree is handy, visualize yourself pinning each of your
worries on a real or imagined clothes line. Or visualize yourself
burying each of your worries in a hole in the ground and covering
it with soil. Or ``see'' yourself placing all your worries in an
incinerator and burning them. Another variation is to place all
your worries in an imaginary garbage can. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 3: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting a Good
Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Martin Moore-Ede and Suzanne LeVert (Alpha
Books, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Revelatory opening line: Sleep: It's an activity we all try to
perform every day, just like eating or getting some exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 4: ``Don't Snore Anymore: Your Complete Guide to
a Quiet Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Jeffrey N. Hausfeld (Three Rivers
Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: An elderly couple made separate appointments to see me
and were placed in two adjacent examining rooms. When I first went
in to see the gentleman, his major complaint was a stuffy nose.
Upon examination, he had significant obstruction to his nasal
airflow, a very bulky uvula, enlarged tonsils and a short, heavy
neck. Suspecting that he might have a problem with snoring, I asked
him, ``How badly do you snore at night?'' His answer surprised me.
He said that he used to snore very loudly, but in recent years his
wife had not complained. It turned out that when I went to the
adjacent examining room to speak to his wife, she was there to
consult me about her progressive hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 5: ``The Promise of Sleep,'' by Dr. William C.
Dement and Christopher Vaughan (Delacorte, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote, on napping in the cockpit: Although pilot naps, intended
or otherwise, already occur on American flights ... it has proven
politically impossible to pass regulations allowing them; there is
still the unfortunate perception that permitting pilots to sleep in
the cockpit is dangerous _ even with a fully awake co-pilot _
despite studies that show planned napping to be safer than not
napping. This is one of the most preposterous and illogical policy
decisions of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Book No. 6: ``No More Sleepless Nights: A Proven Program
to Conquer Insomnia,'' by Peter Hauri, Ph.D., and Shirley Linde,
Ph.D. (Wiley, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Some patients get up in the middle of the night and eat,
without ever becoming fully conscious. In a behavioral state that
resembles sleepwalking, they may wander into the kitchen while
unconscious and eat. Sweets and pasta are usually preferred, but
some patients eat inappropriate foods such as raw, frozen or
spoiled food in odd mixtures of butter, fruit and leftovers
prepared in a blender. ...
</P>
<P>
   Patients with this disorder awaken in the morning with full
stomachs, skip breakfast, but still gain weight.

   Sleep Book No. 7: ``Desperately Seeking Snoozin': The Insomnia
Cure From Awake to Zzzz,'' by John Wiedman (Towering Pines Press,

   Sleep Book No. 8: ``Tired All the Time: How to Regain Your Lost
Energy,'' by Dr. Ronald L. Hoffman (Pocket Books, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: An Orthodox Jew and father of five came in with his
17-year-old daughter. ``She's feeling so sick, doctor,'' he said.
``She used to be an A student and now her grades are poor. She has
headaches and she's always tired.'' Blood tests revealed nothing
special. ... I was stumped. Then, during one visit, he offhandedly
mentioned that his whole family seemed to have a virus. ``Everybody
in my family is sick. We all feel cranky. The only one who feels
good is my son who is off at Yeshiva.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that that there had been a fire in the home, and
the fire department had soaked one wall with hundreds of gallons of
water. Soon after, the wall became discolored _ and they began to
get tired and feel sick. This prompted me to think of molds. ...
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this new clue, my patient packed his family off to
upstate New York for the summer, and everyone began to feel better.

   The Canals That Wouldn't Wash
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a yearning for a deeper sense of history that
made city officials and developers in Scottsdale, Ariz., push so
hard for a grand redevelopment project called ``The Canals of
Scottsdale.'' They envisioned a sort of Venice of the desert, with
little barges to transport countless new tourists to shops and
restaurants along the banks.
</P>
<P>
   For precedent, Europhiles needed only look about 150 miles north
to Lake Havasu City, where the London Bridge was hauled, brick by
brick, and reconstructed in a fake English village 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But to just about everyone's surprise, the voters of Scottsdale
rose up on election day to soundly reject the canal project, 54
percent to 46 percent. It would have cost $653 million, including
$200 million in public funding, and would have wiped out about 40
small businesses and shops in the downtown area that sell Western
and Mexican-style wares.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' revolt seemed to catch the power elite of
Scottsdale, including the mayor, Sam Camapana, by surprise.
Backers, including a California developer, had spent $838,000 in
recent weeks in a campaign that featured glossy brochures and
expensively produced television commercials. The opponents, who
called themselves ``Save Old Scottsdale,'' raised about $12,000,
much of it collected in jars at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `Enough already,''' Lois Fitch, a retired
teacher, told the local newspaper, The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any paid volunteers,'' she said. ``We simply
had hard-core volunteers who said, `We're taking our city back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution No. 9? Not So Fast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings of a Y2K-style meltdown and prophecies about a
possible guest appearance by Satan, the date 9-9-99 _ the dreaded
nines _ came and went without any apocalyptic incidents.
</P>
<P>
   There were few reports of mayhem among an older generation of
computers that were expected to confuse the string of nines as a
cue to shut down. Those keeping an eye on the world's Year 2000
readiness saw the scarcity of glitches as a divine omen for Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimistic astrologers looked at all those nines, turned them
on their head, and said they would be irresistibly alluring to the
devil. But if the stock market was any indication (the Dow rose 43
points that day), Lucifer didn't take the bait. On the contrary,
most people saw the nines not as jinxed sixes but as lucky sevens,
and lotteries across the country reported a run on the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the West is largely ambivalent about the number, Asia
is far more passionate about its nines. The Japanese keep it out of
their hospitals _ the word nine is a homonym for the word pain _
while in China, it is the supreme number, a metaphor for the
emperor and a building block of traditional Chinese architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Adherents of Mary Katherine Kracht, a San Diego numerologist who
conducts seances on the World Wide Web, know that nine is the
finest of figures, a turning point and a prompt for new
opportunities. ``Anyone who sees sixes in nines is living in
fear,'' she said. ``Truth is, with nine you just can't go wrong.''

   Israeli Court Limits Use Of Force in Interrogations
</P>
<P>
   It was an issue that Israeli justices were loathe to touch. For
years, international human rights groups had condemned Israel for
allowing its security police to use physically coercive methods to
interrogate Palestinian detainees. But the Israeli government had
claimed it could not shackle its agents, not if their techniques
helped extract information to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay the Israeli Supreme Court unexpectedly
outlawed the use of forceful interrogation methods by the Shin Bet
security service, setting off a raging debate within Israel.

   Danforth to Examine Waco

   Attorney General Attorney General Janet Reno named John
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, to lead an
independent reexamination of the FBI's tear-gas assault in 1993 on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. Danforth was granted
full investigative and prosecutorial powers to charge federal
agents with crimes if he finds the law was broken. In part, the
choice reflected an effort by Reno to quiet her Republican critics
in Congress. But the outcry grew louder, with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott telling reporters, ``I am beginning to think that
she should resign.''

   Detroit Teachers End Strike

   It was back to school for teachers in Detroit after a strike
that lengthened summer vacation by more than a week for the city's
180,000 public school students and gave their parents child-care
headaches. The teachers voted to return to classrooms after their
union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, reached a tentative
three-year contract agreement with the Detroit School Board that

   Gore Unveils Health Plan

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore became the first of the current crop of
presidential contenders to lay out a detailed plan for health
policy. He promised to guarantee access to affordable health
insurance for all children by 2005, through a number of steps,
including expansion of the 1997 Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>

   Gore's plan was modest compared with President Clinton's
ill-fated 1993 proposal for universal coverage. Health policy

   To New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the answer to St. Louis
encephalitis, which by the weekend had killed three people in the
New York area, is clear: spray, spray and spray some more in all
five boroughs. ``The more dead mosquitoes, the better,'' he said.
But while the threat is real, some New Yorkers balked, with one

lungs.''

   Whitman Quits Senate Race

   Citing the overwhelming burden of running New Jersey and
campaigning for the U.S. Senate, Gov. Christie Whitman stunned her
Republican colleagues and Democratic foes by saying she no longer
planned to run for the seat being vacated by Frank Lautenberg, the
Democratic incumbent, who is retiring.

   Yeltsin Shrugs Off Rumors

   Another Russian Campaign
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that the United States lost a war with Alabama and sued
for peace, only to see Alabama invade Mississippi, and you have a
rough idea of the Kremlin's latest military plight. The Russian air
force was hard at work bombing its own territory, the province-like
Republic of Dagestan, after Islamic radicals from neighboring
Chechnya marched in by the thousands, unmolested, with the aim of
taking it over.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens fought Russia's ragtag army to a standstill in 1996
and appeared to be holding their own this time. President Boris
Yeltsin, furious, ridiculed his ``careless'' generals on
television, and the military promised a swift campaign to oust the
rebels. But the Chechens promised to hit back.

   Israeli Court Limits Use Of Force in Interrogations
</P>
<P>
   It was an issue that Israeli justices were loathe to touch. For
years, international human rights groups had condemned Israel for
allowing its security police to use physically coercive methods to
interrogate Palestinian detainees. But the Israeli government had
claimed it could not shackle its agents, not if their techniques
helped extract information to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay the Israeli Supreme Court unexpectedly
outlawed the use of forceful interrogation methods by the Shin Bet
security service, setting off a raging debate within Israel.

   Danforth to Examine Waco
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Attorney General Janet Reno named John
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, to lead an
independent reexamination of the FBI's tear-gas assault in 1993 on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. Danforth was granted
full investigative and prosecutorial powers to charge federal
agents with crimes if he finds the law was broken. In part, the
choice reflected an effort by Reno to quiet her Republican critics
in Congress. But the outcry grew louder, with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott telling reporters, ``I am beginning to think that
she should resign.''

   Clinton Testifies Again
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was back before an independent counsel, giving
testimony under oath in the investigation of Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman. Lawyers said that the little-noticed inquiry into
accusations of influence peddling and campaign finance violations
by Ms. Herman appeared to be winding down. One of the president's
lawyers said Clinton was only a witness in the case, not a criminal
target.

   Detroit Teachers End Strike
</P>
<P>
   It was back to school for teachers in Detroit after a strike
that lengthened summer vacation by more than a week for the city's
180,000 public school students and gave their parents child-care
headaches. The teachers voted to return to classrooms after their
union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, reached a tentative
three-year contract agreement with the Detroit School Board that
gave them raises and promised smaller class sizes next year.

   Gore Unveils Health Plan
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore became the first of the current crop of
presidential contenders to lay out a detailed plan for health
policy. He promised to guarantee access to affordable health
insurance for all children by 2005, through a number of steps,
including expansion of the 1997 Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan was modest compared with President Clinton's
ill-fated 1993 proposal for universal coverage. Health policy
experts said the cost of Gore's plan would probably exceed $5
billion a year.

   Gun Buyback Plan
</P>
<P>
   Opening a new round in the debate over gun control, President
Clinton announced a $15 million program to buy back and destroy as
many as 300,000 firearms, mostly in and around crime-ridden public
housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in November, the government will provide grants to
police departments of up to $500,000, and suggest that authorities
offer $50 for each working gun, either in cash, food, gift
certificates or tickets to sporting events.

   Let Us Spray
</P>
<P>
   To New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the answer to St. Louis
encephalitis, which by the weekend had killed three people in the
New York area, is clear: spray, spray and spray some more in all
five boroughs. ``The more dead mosquitoes, the better,'' he said.
But while the threat is real, some New Yorkers balked, with one
woman objecting to ``all those horrible chemicals in your child's
lungs.''

   Whitman Quits Senate Race
</P>
<P>
   Citing the overwhelming burden of running New Jersey and
campaigning for the U.S. Senate, Gov. Christie Whitman stunned her
Republican colleagues and Democratic foes by saying she no longer
planned to run for the seat being vacated by Frank Lautenberg, the
Democratic incumbent, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican leaders scrambled to find a backup who could
raise $12 million in one year.
</P>
<P>
   With Whitman out of the race, the two leading Democratic
candidates, former Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. chairman Jon Corzine and
former Gov. Jim Florio, who lost his office to Whitman in 1993, can
focus on beating each other.

   Yeltsin Shrugs Off Rumors
</P>
<P>
   So, Boris, what about those rumors you might be caught up in the
scandal involving money-laundering and the Swiss construction
company that got a big contract to fix up the Kremlin? Yeah,  &UR; that &LR; 
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The subject came up in a phone chat between President Bill
Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin the other day. Yeltsin stopped
short of replying, ``I am not a crook,'' in Russian, but blamed his
enemies for the rumors.

DOLPHINS, JAGUARS AND BRONCOS ARE AFC SELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: Teams are profiled in order of predicted finish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC EAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Miami
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (10-6), wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Recent Super Bowl teams have won with offense
highlighted. Miami will attempt to win a championship with defense
at the forefront. It has an oftentimes spectacular one that a year
ago helped the Dolphins allow the fewest points (265) in the NFL.
It starts directly over the ball where the Miami front is powerful,
flexible and deep. Tackles Tim Bowens and Daryl Gardener are
flanked by interchangeable ends in Jason Taylor, Lorenzo Bromell,
Kenny Mixon and Trace Armstrong. And then for added strength, Miami
signed free agent end Rich Owens from Washington. Zack Thomas leads
the linebackers and Terrell Buckley the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : The running game has been a sore spot for Miami in
recent seasons, but the Dolphins have retooled in alarming fashion.
Karim Abdul-Jabbar returns and so does John Avery and Stanley
Pritchett, but three draft picks at the position loom large: James
Johnson from Mississippi State, Rob Konrad from Syracuse and
talented but troubled Cecil Collins from McNeese State. The
receiving core needs a jolt and newly acquired Tony Martin can
provide it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : A team with a strong defense and Dan Marino at
quarterback always has a chance. Add an improved running game and
Martin and Miami will create a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   2. New England
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (9-7), wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : The quarterback (Drew Bledsoe), the cornerback (Ty
Law) and the receiver (Terry Glenn). Each is a Patriots staple.
Bledsoe is big (6-5, 233), strong and now in his seventh season is
experienced and ready to distinguish himself with a consistent
level of excellence. Law earned nine interceptions a year ago and
his first pro bowl berth. Glenn has been injured in each of his
first three seasons but when healthy provides Patriot thrills. With
him New England is 23-11; without him they are 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Without injured Robert Edwards, the Patriots start
over again at running back. No proven star, but rookie Kevin Faulk
from LSU is promising. Injuries crushed this team a year ago, with
16 starters missing 58 games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Big play by Faulk and a healthy crew for the entire
seasons spells big success.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jets
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (12-4), divisional champion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths: &LR;  Everything with the Jets starts with the coach,
Bill Parcells, whose shadow looms large and whose coaching staff
excels. Parcells and his staff prepares his team with supreme
confidence and results. Vinny Testaverde at quarterback looks to
duplicate a rare pro bowl season and the weapons are there to
achieve it: Curtis Martin's daring running, Keyshawn Johnson's
flamboyant pass catching and a punishing defense led by linebacker
Bryan Cox. The special teams are always good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  The offensive line is revamped and untested as a
group. How will it fare since last year's line played the entire
season in harmony?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : The Jets could easily move up if all falls into place
like last season, one full of close, harrowing victories. Seldom,
though, does a repeat like that happen.
</P>
<P>
   4. Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   1988 record (10-6) wild card team.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : With quarterbacks Doug Flutie and Rob Johnson, the
Bills possess a 1-2 punch at the position that other teams envy.
Flutie features mobility, Johnson a strong arm and accurate deep
passing. Another duo at running back _ Antowain Smith and Thurman
Thomas _ makes the ground game viable. Eric Moulds at receiver is a
special player and the defense, once again, is anchored by
venerable 15-year pro Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  None of the Bills linebackers have been able to
reach the steady and big-play style of long departed Bryce Paup or
Cornelius Bennett. Buffalo finished 14th in pass defense a year ago
and needs improvement there. That is a big reason why it selected
Antoine Winfield from Ohio State and he is likely an immediate
starter in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  A tough, rugged, veteran-inspired team capable of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   5. Indianapolis
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (3-13).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Peyton Manning's first pro season was a success if
his team's record was not. He threw for the most yards (3,739) ever
in a Colts season, beating Johnny Unitas. He threw touchdown passes
in 13 consecutive games. He played every down and started every
game and in his eyes and arm his teammates could see the future.
Marvin Harrison (59 catches, 7 touchdowns and a long score of 61
yards) was a favorite Manning target.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Defense. Teams scored 444 points on the Colts, 111
more than the next worse in the division (Buffalo with 333). In 11
leaguewide defensive categories, Indianapolis finished either next
to last or last.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Defensive help arrives via free agency but not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC CENTRAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Jacksonville
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (11-5) Divisional champions
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : The Jaguars have been knocking at the Super Bowl
door for three seasons now. Their playoff losses in the last three
years have been dealt by New England, Denver and the Jets; after
those losses New England reached a Super Bowl, Denver won it and
the Jets reached the AFC championship game. Is it finally
Jacksonville's turn to topple the AFC full tilt? Everything appears
in place. Solid leadership in management and in Tom Coughlin, the
head coach. The complete package at quarterback in Mark Brunell. An
emerging running back in Fred Taylor. A star offensive tackle in
Tony Boselli. Great receivers, speedy linebackers, adept special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  A defensive star. No Jaguar on defense in past
years consistently dominated games. The addition of safety Carnell
Lake, in from Pittsburgh, and Dom Capers as the new defensive
coordinator figure to boost the defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   2. Baltimore
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (6-10).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Scott Mitchell, exiled in Detroit, gets a new
chance with the Ravens under new coach Brian Billick, the former
Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator. Mitchell and Billick.
Their fortunes are intricately tied, thus, both need the other to
take the Ravens where they want to go. Billick has the right stuff
having tutored the Vikings offense to great heights. There are
other tools for Billick. Back Priest Holmes (1,008 rushing yards),
playmaking receiver and returner Jermaine Lewis (57.6 yards
averaged on his eight touchdowns scored), pro bowl tackle Jonathan
Ogden and a group of starting linebackers as good as any in
football.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Confidence, especially on offense. Baltimore
ranked 26th overall on offense, 20th rushing and 25th passing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Can the Ravens earn early success and then build?
Yes, especially with three of their first five games against
divisional opponents and two of those at home.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   1998 record 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : This has been an underachieving, nomadic team that
finally has a home in a new, downtown Nashville Stadium, a new name
(Titans) and new uniforms. This year will bring either success or
more riveting change to a team that yearns for consistency. Start
at quarterback. Steve McNair has shown what he can do with his
legs; now he needs to do more with his arm, especially deep
downfield. There is no problem at running back: Eddie George will
benefit from a two-back set that features former New Orleans Saint
Lorenzo Neal at fullback. The defense is young and improving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  The Titans need better field position, thus more
from their punt and kick return teams. Their 7.4 yard per punt
return ranked 26th. Their 20.5 kickoff return average ranked 24th.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : A new and permanent home should work wonders for a
team that has been full of talent but has lacked confidence and
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (7-9)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths: &LR;  Resiliency, but is it waning? Pittsburgh's free
agents losses over the last few seasons could compile an all-pro
team but usually the Steelers rebound. Last year they did not,
toiling through their first losing season in Bill Cowher's seven
seasons as head coach. Jerome Bettis remains the key element of the
offense with his bruising, powerful runs Kordell Stewart at
quarterback has been both stellar and lousy. It is a big season for
Stewart, who hopes to be elevated by the addition of Kevin Gilbride
as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Offensive production. In Pittsburgh's last five
games, the offense scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Pittsburgh featured the best Red Zone defense in
football last season and looks for more, but the team's playoff
fortunes rely heavily on Stewart. Can he ``Slash'' once again?
</P>
<P>
   5. Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   First season of the new Browns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths: &LR;  Football returns to Cleveland beginning with a
Monday night game at home against Pittsburgh and after that, who
knows what is in store for an expansion team that has more history
than most NFL clubs. Certainly, the Browns should be fun to watch,
especially if the rookie quarterback Tim Couch, the team's first
pick in last year's draft, cracks the starting lineup. There are
other exciting players: rookie receiver Kevin Johnson and
cornerbacks Corey Fuller and Marquez Pope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : New coach (Chris Palmer), new stadium, new
everything all trying to mesh over 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Exciting, regardless of the record.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cincinnati
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (3-13)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : The Bengals are an enigma. A doleful enigma. They
have not flourished under Bruce Coslet, their head coach, and he is
the leading candidate among all NFL head coaches to be dismissed
first. Jeff Blake is the quarterback and he has been down, up and
then down again. Corey Dillon is a fluid running back fun to watch.
Few players on the defense have distinguished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Horrible at finishing games and terrible at home _
the Bengals were 1-7 in home games a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Cincinnati needs something good to happen starting
from kickoff in their first game at Indianapolis. Likely, it won't.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC WEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Denver
</P>
<P>
   1998 Record: (14-2) Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Mike Shanahan coaches his team with a heavy hand
and with a magnificent mind. Each player on the Denver roster is
hand-picked by Shanahan and he has assembled another talented group
minus one key player _ John Elway. Brian Griese in only his second
pro season will start at quarterback, replacing Elway and
supplanting Bubby Brister. Griese does not have to win games alone
with the magnificent back Terrell Davis, rock-solid tight end
Shannon Sharpe, receivers Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith and a robust
offensive line providing plenty of help. The defense vastly
improved itself with the addition of one player, Dale Carter from
Kansas City, one of the league's best single cover cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  The leadership void left by Elway. Off-field
distractions, chief among them linebacker Bill Romanowski's
fraudelent drug prescription charges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  If the Broncos stay united, the divisional title and
the playoffs are easily theirs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Oakland
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (8-8)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Napolean Kauffman at running back. Tim Brown at
receiver. A spell-blinding cornerback duo in Eric Allen and Charles
Woodson. And a defense led by tackle Darrell Russell and defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw that could be the surprise of the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  Rich Gannon at quarterback. A career backup who is
likeable, mobile, intelligent _ but he only takes you so far.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : The Raiders will begin a return toward the elite this
season under head coach Jon Gruden but too many holes remain to
talk Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   3. Seattle
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (8-8)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths: &LR;  A $32 million coach in Mike Holmgren, who runs the
Seahawks with full control. A still tenacious runner in Ricky
Watters and an exciting backup in Ahman Green. A terrific
cornerback in Shawn Springs. Non-stop linebacker Chad Brown and end
Michael Sinclair are primed for big seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Will Joey Galloway, a contract holdout, join the
fold?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : Seattle has long been a team full of ability that
spun its wheels but Holmgren is expected to change that. Old habits
often die slowly. Expect at least a year of transition.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (7-9)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Kansas City earned nine consecutive winning seasons
and then crashed last season. It was the league's most penalized
time and suffered a six-game losing streak. Gunther Cunningham,
formerly the Chiefs defensive coordinator, enters as head coach and
finds a wobbly quarterback (Elvis Grbac), a determined running back
(Kimble Anders), dashing receivers (Andre Rison and Derrick
Alexander), a smooth tight end (Tony Gonzalez) and a defense still
looking for linebacker Derrick Thomas to lead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses: &LR;  Kansas City needs a big year from Anders; Donnell
Bennett was last year's starting back and leading rusher with only
527 yards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook &LR; : The Chiefs are all shook up but how will it pan out?
Like Seattle, a year of transition is required.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Diego
</P>
<P>
   1998 record (5-11)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strengths &LR; : Mike Riley is the new coach and he inherits a team
that is 5-19 in its last 24 games, the worst record in the league
during that span, and a team that was reeling under the sour
influence of last year's top rookie pick at quarterback, Ryan Leaf.
Thank goodness for Jim Harbaugh. He enters as the starter, a
intuitive 13-year veteran who inspires and provides solid
quarterbacking. His job is to help re-invent an offense that has
scored one or no touchdowns in 28 of 32 games over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weaknesses &LR; : Preventing and producing turnovers; San Diego was
minus 24 in turnover differential, worse in the league.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Improved with Harbaugh, but still long days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC players and coaches to watch: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dom Capers and Kevin Gilbride &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two guys that used to be head coaches (Capers in Carolina and
Gilbride in San Diego) now find themselves back doing what they
once did _ Capers as a defensive coordinator and Gilbride as an
offensive coordinator. Capers in Jacksonville, Gilbride in
Pittsburgh. Their goal is to have their sides of the ball excel,
win a Super Bowl and get back into the head coaching carousel.
Well, Capers has the inside track. He gains a defense in
Jacksonville full of speed and potential that has played
inconsistently and he is reunited with safety Carnell Lake. Watch
Capers devise aggressive, interesting schemes that help make
Jacksonville a Super Bowl favorite. Gilbride has the awesome task
of grooming and coaxing Kordell Stewart back into form. Stewart
last year slid into bad habits at quarterback and his play was
frightening. Since both are in the same division, the battle to
play ``Mr. Fixit'' between Capers and Gilbride will color not only
the division but the entire conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Martin: Miami receiver &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OK, here was the deal for Tony Martin: face a few years in
prison for an association with a big-time drug dealer or continue
your NFL football career as a Miami Dolphin. Martin, a former
Atlanta Falcon, signed as a free agent in Miami, where his federal
trial was being held. Dan Marino testified on his behalf. Probably
everyone in the courtroom was a Marino and Dolphin fan. Martin won.
So do the Dolphins. This is one of the better route-runners in the
NFL _ watch the huge separation he gains on outs and on deep
routes. Marino has not had a receiver this good since the
Clayton/Duper days. Marino to Martin will be a fixture of the `99
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brian Griese: Denver quarterback &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What will it take in Denver to fill the void at quarterback left
by the gorilla-like presence of John Elway? How about a second year
player who has thrown all of 3 NFL passes? Finally, the dust has
cleared _ and so have the tears and darts _ as Bubby Brister has
accepted his demotion as the starting quarterback and the
replacement for Elway. It is Griese now and forever, says Broncos
coach Mike Shanahan _ until Griese slips and then Brister gets the
call in the backup style that is his game. Griese is not your basic
second-year player. Wonderful genes, the son of a Hall of Fame
quarterback. Brilliant mind. A guy born to play quarterback. He
will play under intense glare for a team seeking a historical
three-peat. The odds are long against him, but his season will be
full of intrigue.

   In the modern Internet economy, the race of capitalism belongs
to the fleet and nimble. The preferred organizational model, it
seems, is the Silicon Valley start-up _ informal, entrepreneurial
and youthful. ``Three people, under 25, with a hot idea _ those are
the companies we're backing,'' explained Ron Conway, who heads a
start-up investment fund in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Yet across much of Corporate America, the ethos of ``bigger is
better'' is flourishing _ and last week's announcement that Viacom
Inc. agreed to buy CBS Corp. for $37.3 billion is merely further
confirmation of the recent trend.
</P>
<P>
   The five biggest merger deals ever came last year, when the
total value of corporate acquisition activity reached a record $1.6
trillion, equal to 19 percent of the annual output of the economy.
So far this year, reports Thomson Financial Securities Data, a
research firm, the mergers total $1.06 trillion, only slightly
behind the 1998 pace. Business deals on this scale have not
occurred since the turn-of-the-century days of J.P. Morgan and John
D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   The forces behind many of the big deals are rapid technological
change, deregulation and freer trade, which make it more efficient
to market products and manage operations globally. The booming
stock markets have fueled the merger binge because most of the
corporate purchases are made with shares instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Such mergers seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics
course. They are intended to expand a network for the distribution
of goods or services or consolidate overlapping networks. The goal
is to more efficiently use a high-fixed-cost network _ whether that
network distributes phone calls, banking services or gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the logic behind many deals is tricky to explain _ and ego,
hubris and management fads are often part of the motivation. Over
the years, research on mergers has found that many fail, as
post-deal returns for shareholders often trail the market averages.
Putting together two large organizations is a difficult management
challenge, business analysts say, even when the two companies are a
good fit strategically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are so large in most of these deals that they
already have all the sins of bureaucracy,'' observed Rosabeth Moss
Kanter, a professor at the Harvard business school. ``Some of the
merger activity we're seeing is defensive strategy in times of
rapid technological change and uncertainty. It's an attitude that
we'll link up with another company before someone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger deals are always oversold when they are announced. A
helping of hyperbole is expected, but certain arguments are
particularly suspect, business experts warn. Deals are often
presented as a ``merger of equals,'' an ego-stroking euphemism
intended for the ears of the chief executive and staff of the
acquired company. ``The merger of equals is a myth,'' Ms. Kanter
said. ``Show me one.''
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect assertion is that a big merger will result in
the new economic math of synergy _ a term that first gained
currency during the wave of conglomerate mergers in the 1960s, a
business fad that in hindsight appears to have been folly. But
today's executives still sometimes play the synergy card when
justifying a deal, saying that ``one plus one will equal three'' or
``two plus two will equal five.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoped-for synergy rarely materializes. ``Most of the time,
it's two plus two equals three,'' said Michael Cusumano, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   The modern synergy strategy usually involves putting together
two companies in related fields, and then trying to cross-promote
the offerings of each. An example is Travelers Group's purchase
last year of Citicorp for nearly $73 billion, assembling a
financial services empire that includes insurance, commercial
banking, investment banking and a stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   The ``financial supermarket'' is a catchy phrase, but it is not
yet proved to be a winning business strategy, industry analysts
say. A notable failure is Sears, Roebuck's venture into financial
services, which it abandoned in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The big media mergers are partly inspired by visions of the
payoff from combining related businesses. Michael Eisner talked a
lot about synergy when Walt Disney Co. acquired Capital Cities/ABC
in 1995. And the Viacom's planned purchase of CBS is similar. Both
deals link entertainment studios with television networks for
distributing that programming to the households of viewers. Yet the
Disney-Capital Cities/ABC merger has proved to be a disappointment
so far, most industry analysts agree, and the Viacom-CBS merger
faces some of the same challenges.

   The business strategy, it seems, runs counter to some basic
free-market principles. Isn't the producer of entertainment
programming better off having several networks bid for his
programs? And isn't a television network better off being able to
choose among competing suppliers of programs?
</P>
<P>
   Is becoming a much bigger corporation a stimulus to creativity _
vital to the entertainment business _ or a hindrance to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for the big combined media companies like
Disney, Time Warner and now Viacom is how to make these very large
corporations with complex sets of relationships work in ways that
pay off,'' said David Nadler, chairman of Delta Consulting Group
Inc., a management consulting firm. ``Just owning a bundle of
different properties doesn't mean you get the profit-making
synergies that executives talk about when they announce these
mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Big companies, to be sure, can succeed in being creative, even
entrepreneurial, if organized and managed properly. Microsoft
Corp., for example, has become a huge company, but it keeps its
software programmers working in modular teams of three to eight
people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the leading big-company success story, though, is the
revival of IBM under chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner.
When he took over the stumbling computer maker in 1993, Gerstner
was widely expected to turn the bigger-is-better rationale on its
head, breaking up IBM into a group of smaller companies, which, it
was assumed, could better keep pace in fast-changing technology
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gerstner kept the company together. He decided that
IBM's huge investment in research and development was an underused
asset that could be spread profitably across the company's many
computer divisions. And he streamlined management, slashed
bureaucracy and built up IBM's faster-growing services and software
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive, as profits and IBM's stock
price have rebounded. The laudatory reviews extend well beyond Wall
Street. The Washington Monthly recently published an article,
``What Lou Gerstner Could Teach Bill Clinton: Lessons for
government from IBM's Dramatic Turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those Silicon Valley start-ups, of course, are eager to get
bigger, and the hopes of many involve mergers. Microsoft and
America Online, for example, are frequent buyers of other
companies. But with the exception of America Online's
multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape last year, most of the
Microsoft and AOL deals are smaller purchases, up to a few hundred
million dollars, of promising start-ups that have begun to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy may favor the nimble, but a paradox is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of those three-person Internet start-ups is to grow
to a 100-person company and get bought out,'' observed Eric
Greenberg, director of management studies at the American
Management Association.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential power to issue pardons and
reprieves represents the ultimate constitutional act of forgiveness
_ unreviewable and absolute. But as the outcry over President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists
demonstrates, it is not immune from second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 were members of the FALN, the Spanish acronym for
the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a militant independence
group believed to be responsible for scores of bombings in the
1970s and 1980s in which six people were killed and many others
wounded. Their original sentences ranged from 35 to 90 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton's decision came under heavy political attack
from Republicans and Democrats alike. The House of Representatives
voted 311-41 to condemn the leniency offer, with 93 Democrats
crossing party lines to endorse the Republican-sponsored measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that his decision had been influenced by the
political ambitions of the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
is weighing a bid for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. Mrs.
Clinton had sided with her husband's opponents to urge him to
rescind the sweeping offer of leniency, saying that after three
weeks they had had enough time to meet the conditions that they
renounce violence and abide by parole restrictions. Clinton, saying
he acted independently, set a deadline, and by the weekend 14 of
the nationalists had accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clintons viewed the entire episode as an effort
to maneuver votes in Mrs. Clinton's behalf among New York's 1.3
million residents of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Clinton suggested that his grant of
leniency should be viewed as a routine matter, one he never
discussed with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the offer appears to be far from routine for Clinton. He has
granted fewer clemency petitions _ including commutations of prison
sentences or pardons for past crimes _ than either of his
Republican predecessors, Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of presidential clemencies has steadily declined
since World War II, particularly since the Ford administration as
the intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up. ``Mr. Clinton's record in clemency matters reflects a
trend that began during Ronald Reagan's presidency,'' said Margaret
Love, the pardon attorney at the Justice Department from 1990 to
1997. ``It had been very much an operational part of the criminal
justice system. Now clemency has been taken hostage in the war on
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemency grants plummeted further during Reagan's first term,
when a change in Justice Department procedures effectively placed
control of pardons and commutations in the hands of prosecutors,
including Rudolph Giuliani, who was then an associate attorney
general. As mayor of New York City, where many of the attacks took
place, and as a likely opponent of Mrs. Clinton in the Senate race,
Giuliani has criticized the president's Clinton's offer to the
imprisoned Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said that during the Clinton administration, the White
House has relied less on the Justice Department's recommendations
in clemency cases and more on its own judgment of a case's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there is little incentive to grant clemency. ``As
a general rule, there's nothing in it for a president or an
attorney general to do anything for anybody,'' said John Stanish,
who was a pardon attorney under President Jimmy Carter. ``They can
only be humiliated or embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency to the imprisoned Puerto Ricans on
the condition that they renounce violence was unusual but not
unprecedented. Conditional clemency is rare, though not unheard of.
When Carter commuted the bank robbery sentence of Patricia Hearst
in 1979, she was required to agree not to take part in militant
politics. When President Richard M. Nixon commuted Jimmy Hoffa's
racketeering sentence in 1971, the labor leader had to agree to
refrain from union activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer represents the first time a president has
granted conditional clemency to prisoners convicted of crimes
related to terrorism, though none of those offered clemency were
directly responsible for deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency applications have piled up during the Clinton
administration. While Justice Department records of the 3,042
clemency petitions filed during Clinton's presidency do not
distinguish between serious and frivolous or repetitive requests,
they show that Clinton has reduced the sentences of only three
people.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these people, Jackie Trautman of Ohio and Johnny Palacios
of Florida, were convicted of drug offenses. A third man, Ernest
Krikiva of Nebraska, , was a hog farmer who had been convicted of
perjury in a bankruptcy proceeding and had won the support of
family farm groups.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department figures show that, as of April, 884 people
had filed petitions for commutations that were pending, waiting to
be acted on by the Justice Department and the White House. It
remains unclear how the cases of the 16 Puerto Rican militants were
culled from these requests _ although their supporters, including
Carter and retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu had been
advocating their release for years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton explained his decision by saying the sentences were much
longer than those they would have received under the more recently
enacted federal sentencing guidelines for crimes committed after
1987. Most of the imprisoned nationalists were convicted of
offenses like interstate transportation of firearms or armed
robbery and were not accused of explicit terrorist acts, even
though law enforcement officials have said their crimes were meant
to support the violent activities of a militant group.

   WASHINGTON _ The presidential power to issue pardons and
reprieves represents the ultimate constitutional act of forgiveness
_ unreviewable and absolute. But as the outcry over President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists
demonstrates, it is not immune from second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 were members of the FALN, the Spanish acronym for
the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a militant independence
group believed to be responsible for scores of bombings in the
1970s and 1980s in which six people were killed and many others
wounded. Their original sentences ranged from 35 to 90 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton's decision came under heavy political attack
from Republicans and Democrats alike. The House of Representatives
voted 311-41 to condemn the leniency offer, with 93 Democrats
crossing party lines to endorse the Republican-sponsored measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that his decision had been influenced by the
political ambitions of the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
is weighing a bid for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. Mrs.
Clinton had sided with her husband's opponents to urge him to
rescind the sweeping offer of leniency, saying that after three
weeks they had had enough time to meet the conditions that they
renounce violence and abide by parole restrictions. Clinton, saying
he acted independently, set a deadline, and by the weekend 14 of
the nationalists had accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clintons viewed the entire episode as an effort
to maneuver votes in Mrs. Clinton's behalf among New York's 1.3
million residents of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Clinton suggested that his grant of
leniency should be viewed as a routine matter, one he never
discussed with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the offer appears to be far from routine for Clinton. He has
granted fewer clemency petitions _ including commutations of prison
sentences or pardons for past crimes _ than either of his
Republican predecessors, Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of presidential clemencies has steadily declined
since World War II, particularly since the Ford administration as
the intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up. ``Mr. Clinton's record in clemency matters reflects a
trend that began during Ronald Reagan's presidency,'' said Margaret
Love, the pardon attorney at the Justice Department from 1990 to
1997. ``It had been very much an operational part of the criminal
justice system. Now clemency has been taken hostage in the war on
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemency grants plummeted further during Reagan's first term,
when a change in Justice Department procedures effectively placed
control of pardons and commutations in the hands of prosecutors,
including Rudolph Giuliani, who was then an associate attorney
general. As mayor of New York City, where many of the attacks took
place, and as a likely opponent of Mrs. Clinton in the Senate race,
Giuliani has criticized the president's Clinton's offer to the
imprisoned Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said that during the Clinton administration, the White
House has relied less on the Justice Department's recommendations
in clemency cases and more on its own judgment of a case's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there is little incentive to grant clemency. ``As
a general rule, there's nothing in it for a president or an
attorney general to do anything for anybody,'' said John Stanish,
who was a pardon attorney under President Jimmy Carter. ``They can
only be humiliated or embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency to the imprisoned Puerto Ricans on
the condition that they renounce violence was unusual but not
unprecedented. Conditional clemency is rare, though not unheard of.
When Carter commuted the bank robbery sentence of Patricia Hearst
in 1979, she was required to agree not to take part in militant
politics. When President Richard M. Nixon commuted Jimmy Hoffa's
racketeering sentence in 1971, the labor leader had to agree to
refrain from union activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer represents the first time a president has
granted conditional clemency to prisoners convicted of crimes
related to terrorism, though none of those offered clemency were
directly responsible for deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency applications have piled up during the Clinton

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When John D. Rockefeller turned his attention to
philanthropic causes earlier this century, he relied in many ways
on his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., for help in deciding how to
disburse his colossal oil fortune. Both father and son famously
brooded, at times to the verge of mental exhaustion, over how hard
it was to give away money in an intelligent and useful fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a while before William H. Gates III, the 43-year-old
founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp. and now the wealthiest
person on the planet, asks his children for help with his
philanthropic endeavors. After all, Jennifer is only 3, and Rory
John is shy of 4 months. And since Gates remains at the helm of his
company, he is unable to concentrate full time on the task himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gates has looked in the other direction on the family
tree and given much of the responsibility to a genial, 6-foot-6
retired lawyer by the name of William H. Gates Jr. _ a man candid
enough to admit, if a touch sheepishly, that his techno-billionaire
son harbors ``a continuous frustration about the problems that
people like his father have with their computer,'' and droll enough
to enjoy the humor in going by the name Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a big kick out of that,'' the 73-year-old Gates said,
adding that it was especially true when he called people on the
phone. ``First, there's just a pause. They don't know what to say.
Or it's, `Are you kidding?' Or, `Come on, now, are you really?' And
to that I always say, `Sure, I am Bill Gates.'''
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the
elder Gates sits atop a $17 billion organization, one that pledges
to make huge donations in the fields of education and global
health.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates philanthropic foundation recently became the largest
in the country, and with the David and Lucile Packard Foundation of
Los Altos, Calif., in the No. 2 position, it is a striking symbol
of the fast-growing role of high technology and West Coast money in
the world of American philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   With more donations expected, the Gates Foundation is virtually
certain soon to surpass the Wellcome Trust in Britain as the
largest philanthropic organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation remains highly unusual in having living
benefactors, and relatively young ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Fords, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies of the
foundation world, you can only go back into history to figure out
what their benefactors wanted,'' said Stacy Palmer, editor of The
Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit
organizations. ``The difference here is that you actually have
donors saying, `This is what I care about, this is the big
philanthropic bet I want to make.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, in an inversion of the usual roles, it is the father who
gets to help spend the son's money, soon to be a minimum of nearly
$1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's broad priorities, as set by the Microsoft
chairman and his wife, include global health programs, especially
those focused on developing and distributing vaccines for malaria,
AIDS and other diseases; education, encompassing programs to
provide computers, Internet access and technical training for
libraries in lower-income areas across North America; and a variety
of community, educational and cultural programs here in the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But it is up to the elder Gates and the foundation's
co-chairwoman, Patty Stonesifer, a former Microsoft executive and
longtime friend of the younger Gates, to cull the possibilities and
come up with specific grant recommendations. (The elder Gates had
been in charge of the William H. Gates Foundation, which
concentrated on health issues and the Pacific Northwest, since
1994, while Ms. Stonesifer headed the Gates Learning Foundation,
created under a different name in 1997. Those two organizations
recently merged to become the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.)
</P>
<P>
   The requests and recommendations pour in, including what the
elder Gates describes as an astounding number of letters from
people down on their luck and desperately seeking some cash; the
foundation, however, by its charter, cannot make donations to
private individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But even as there is a huge amount of speculation over the
impact of the Gates Foundation on the philanthropy world, the
organization is clearly making an effort not to rock the boat. The
senior Gates and Ms. Stonesifer, for instance, recently traveled to
New York City to meet with leaders of the 40 other top foundations
in the country to discuss ways to make their giving strategies
complementary. The meeting was arranged by Vartan Gregorian, the
president of Carnegie Corp. and a member of the Gates foundation
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a signal,'' Ms. Palmer said. ``They're saying
they're not trying to reinvent everything here and start from
scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If the two John D. Rockefellers found the task of philanthropy
daunting, especially as they labored over the details of building
brick-and-mortar institutions, like the University of Chicago,
which were created with Rockefeller money, the two Bill Gateses, at
least for now, seem less overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the younger Gates has said that while
philanthropy may one day become his obsession, he is simply more
immersed now in his young family and his company, which, among
other things, is embroiled in a huge antitrust battle with the U.S.
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   That means that, for now, he has left many of the details of his
philanthropy to his father and others.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, the grant-making process at the Gates
Foundation is simpler in one respect than that of the Rockefellers,
at least in the area of health, which the elder Gates has
concentrated on: The money has generally been donated to existing
groups or efforts, like the Malaria Vaccine Initiative and the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, rather than used to create
institutions. And both the elder Gates and Ms. Stonesifer say that
that is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the man wading through all the possibilities for
gifts said he found that the daunting nature of the process was far
outweighed by the satisfaction of being able to do some good in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pretty profound thing to have set out to be retired
and wind up close to preoccupied with the work of the foundation,''
Gates said in an interview the other day. ``But it's profoundly
satisfying. There is, of course, incredible joy in frequently being
able to say yes to something.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy is not new to the elder Gates. A prominent Seattle
lawyer, he has long been involved in numerous charitable
activities, including the United Way _ ``and not just as chair of
the fund-raising drive,'' said James R. Ellis, a longtime friend
and partner in their law firm, Preston Gates &AMP; Ellis, which is one
of the city's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can recall seeing Bill handing out United Way literature at
UW football games,'' Ellis said, referring to the University of
Washington, where Gates got both his bachelor's and law degrees.
``He is truly a hands-on guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' philanthropic duties with the foundation, for which he
receives an annual salary of $90,000, grew out of a conversation a
few years ago with his son and daughter-in-law during a night out
at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For a time his duties with the foundation were largely conducted
from a basement office in the same unassuming home in Seattle's
Laurelhurst neighborhood in which he and his wife Mary raised their
son, who sometimes declined entreaties to come to the table for
family dinner by shouting from his room: ``I can't right now! I'm
thinking!''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the same son, still called Trey by the elder Gates,
who at the age of 12 simply announced that there was no logical
reason for him to carry out some of the household chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an emotional reaction or resistance to the
imposition of somebody else's will,'' recalled the father, who can
afford to laugh about it now. ``With Trey, it was an intellectual
thing. It was, `I really don't need to clean up my room, Mother. I
do not need to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Gates, who was active in Seattle charities, died of cancer
five years ago, and Gates has since married Mimi Gardner Gates, who
is the director of the Seattle Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the fateful night at the movies, Gates recalled, ``My son
was expressing a lot of frustration about his ability to deal
properly with requests for charitable gifts. He was concerned that
people were complaining that he didn't answer their letters, which
he didn't have time to do. And I just said, `Well, look, son, my
time isn't all that fully occupied. Why don't I help you with
that?' So that's how it all got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Over its first few years, and under the elder Gates' direction,
the foundation has given gifts that include $100 million to reduce
delays in the delivery of new vaccines to children around the
world; $50 million to the Maternal Mortality Reduction program at
Columbia University; $50 million for research on the malaria
vaccine, and $25 million to the AIDS vaccine initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The learning foundation has given about $200 million to the
library project, which has so far installed computers and Internet
connections in 1,745 libraries in 32 states, with a five-year goal
of reaching 10,000 libraries in the United States and 3,000 in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But as significant as these gifts are, they may well pale in
comparison to coming grants, because under federal regulations, the
foundation will have to give away roughly 5 percent of its assets a
year _ close to $1 billion with the current endowment, and more as
the assets grow.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, who for years have faulted the younger Gates for not
giving away more of his holdings, have suggested that his
philanthropic contributions do not stem from purely altruistic
motives: The huge gifts come at a time when both he and his company
are trying to bolster a public image damaged by the antitrust
fight, and the library-wiring objectives of the learning foundation
are hardly incompatible with the goals of his software company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a huge amount of new money coming into the
philanthropic pipeline, and many of those in the health field say
that Gates' willingness to spend on vaccines could help bring about
major medical breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates understands that vaccines are like investing in
software,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International
Aids Vaccine Initiative in New York City. ``You spend a fortune
getting it together, getting it right. Once you've got the
technology, and you know it works, then you can produce it cheaply
and use it globally.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Gates has made much the same point, and also said
that vaccines should be such a high priority because they carry
with them the promise of staving off tens of billions of dollars in
health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley said of the Microsoft chairman, ``It's clear he's
delegated a lot of authority to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   And the responsibility is obviously a deeply serious one for the
elder Gates, who will soon be off on a trip to Nepal, Bangladesh
and Indonesia to study health programs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the elder Gates does not seem consumed with the mental
anguish that periodically visited the Rockefellers, he has
concluded that the problems the foundation hopes to alleviate are
immensely complicated, and not solvable only with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health problems of the underdeveloped world are
horrendous,'' he said, ``and there isn't enough money being devoted
to it to raise the slightest possibility of seriously affecting it
except over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the world is more humane than that sounds, because, in
fact, it's not exactly clear, if you had 10 times as much money,
what you would do with it,'' Gates said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Because there are environmental conditions that have to come
along, infrastructure, public attitude, political problems _ all of
those things have to play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gates meets and exchanges e-mail frequently with his son
and daughter-in-law about foundation matters, he said he tried to
bother his son as little as possible when he had computer problems,
even with Microsoft programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the language of some of those messages that come
up,'' he said, shaking his head with a laugh. ``It just absolutely
drives me crazy. They are flat-out incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have an internal ambiguity about talking to my son,'' he
continued. ``In part I'm so angry at something that's happened that
I want to tell him about it. And in part I know he feels bad about
all that stuff, and I sort of hesitate to lay another problem on
him.''

<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ His cell phone had been ringing with
increasingly urgent calls from his constituents: The quelea birds
were here! Locusts were coming!
</P>
<P>
   So quelea birds and locusts were the order of the day for
Suleiman Isyaku, one of the 360 members of Nigeria's brand new
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast in the cafeteria of the still-unfinished National
Assembly building, Isyaku, 35, explained the motion he would
present later in the day. The legislation _ a big step in his new
career as a lawmaker, a small one in his country's path toward
democracy _ would urge the minister of agriculture to ``take
immediate action with a view to combat'' quelea birds and locusts.
</P>
<P>
   The pesky migratory birds had been spotted in Isyaku's home
region, feasting on the millet, sorghum and other crops grown in
the Sahel area of northeast Nigeria. If that were not enough,
history showed that locusts would follow.
</P>
<P>
   A motion has no power of enforcement. But should the agriculture
minister not respond immediately, Isyaku said, he would attack him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say, `People are suffering because of him. He's inhuman,'
'' Isyaku said. ``I'll go on radio, on TV, in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuja is like that these days. Once the dormant capital of a
nation ruled by decrees quietly issued and then rigidly enforced by
Nigeria's military rulers, Abuja is abuzz with the noisy workings
of representative government.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has ended nearly 16
years of military rule, and its politicians have plunged into the
new system with typical Nigerian spirit: headlong, combatively and
with a reserve of jaw-dropping surprises.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Toronto has suddenly become the most famous foreign
city in Nigeria, after Ibrahim Salisu Buhari, who was the house
speaker and No. 4 in the government, said he was a graduate of the
University of Toronto. Also, he said, he was 36 years old, well
above the minimum age of 30 to be a House representative. Untrue
said a magazine called The News, in a story titled ``The Face of a
Liar.''
</P>
<P>
   After vehement denials, the 29-year-old, non-college-educated
speaker was forced to resign. Critics of the new lawmakers began
attacking them as ``Toronto'' politicians. As the Canadian city
became a code word for fraud, the politicians defended themselves
by saying that they were not, in fact, Toronto men.
</P>
<P>
   (The Senate president is also facing accusations in the media of
having lied about his age and academic credentials. But so far no
one appears to have produced irrefutable evidence to turn the No. 3
in the government into a Toronto politician.)
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these setbacks _ and others that followed _ new
lawmakers argued that they were all learning about democracy and
how to build it in a highly diverse country of 110 million people,
many of them with memories of nothing but military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Laoshe, a representative from Lagos, and other lawmakers
pointed out that since the military handed over power to a civilian
government, the executive branch was headed by President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a military ruler in the late 1970s, and other
recognizable faces. The ministries, too, were led by men known to
most Nigerians from the years of army dominance.
</P>
<P>
   And so the creation of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, they argued, were the areas where real progress
toward democratization had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole generation of Nigerians who don't know
anything about democracy,'' said Laoshe
</P>
<P>
   ``But democracy is this house,'' he said, referring to the
National Assembly building.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Consider the quelea birds and locusts. Under previous military
regimes, farmers in northern Nigeria had been reduced to pleading
with military administrators for planes to spray pesticides. Given
the corruption and general lack of accountability, though, farmers
were never sure what the planes were releasing.
</P>
<P>
   One time, a plane _ carrying kerosene, it was later learned _
blew up in the sky. Another time, a plane was spraying water.
``Look at this madness,'' Isyaku said, recounting the farmers'
reaction. ``Spraying all day. Disturbing our families. And the
birds are not dying. So they attacked the pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers resorted to what Isyaku described as primitive
methods of repelling the tiny red-billed quelea birds, which
typically migrate in groups of hundreds of thousands, darken the
sky as they slowly circle above a field and then suddenly swoop
down to eat. The farmers shoot rifle rounds in the air. ``Or you
take the whole of your family,'' Isyaku added, ``and you scare them
away by shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   A real estate developer until recently, Isyaku said he was asked
by his village elders to run for the House seat, but not because he
had done remarkable things for his community. ``Honestly, there is
no big thing I did for them,'' he said. ``The only thing is maybe I
am a good boy, someone who doesn't smoke and drink, who respects
his elders.''
</P>
<P>
   His two brothers _ one also a developer, another one a
businessman involved in refined oil _ bankrolled his campaign to an
easy victory. The job was not what he had expected, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be easy work,'' Isyaku said of his
legislative duties, considered part-time in the Nigerian
Constitution. ``Come in the morning, one or two debates, then do
something else in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were endless committee meetings in the afternoons, so
many documents to read in the evenings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to his government-supplied house, in the
Levittown-like government-designated neighborhood where most
legislators live in two-story duplexes, Isyaku pointed to the
balcony that he was planning to turn into a study for all the
unexpected work. ``It's like being a student again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were installing tiles inside his three-bedroom house,
which like many of the legislators' houses was still undergoing
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The houses, and especially the seemingly harmless issue of
furniture, have become sore spots for the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing military government had budgeted about $120,000 in
furniture for each representative. The members, arguing that the
figure was too high and that the furniture contractors were cronies
of the military, asked that it be reduced to $25,000 _ but that
they be given the money and allowed to buy their own furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The executive branch agreed, furniture makers swarmed into
Abuja, and the lawmakers suffered their biggest public relations
black eye to date.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the legislators would buy shoddy furniture and
pocket the difference. The lawmakers said they were saving
Nigerians money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed they are not fighting for change,'' said Adams
Oshiomhole, president of the Nigeria Labor Congress, the country's
biggest union umbrella group. ``They want the corrupt practices to
continue, but they want to be the beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Oshiomhole said that in the spirit of transparency, they should
have advertised for new bids in newspapers and not used the
military regime's budget as a yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   The union organized a huge rally here. Protesters shouted
``Thief!'' to lawmakers entering the National Assembly. They said
it was unseemly to hand out $25,000 for furniture in a country
where the lowest paid public workers were demanding a wage increase
_ to $35 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like all of them have a common interest, which is what
they can get for themselves,'' said Bashir Shehu, 32, who was
visiting the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Another visitor, Musa Abubakar, 57, was more generous. ``We have
to give them time,'' he said. ``Three months is not enough to judge
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, the National Assembly's two photocopiers
malfunctioned and delayed the start of the session by two hours.
The first motion, on flood disaster, sailed through the House.
</P>
<P>
   But time was running out to consider Isyaku's motion on quelea
birds and locusts. Besides, some members wanted to be heard on
another matter _ the poor state of their housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my tableware is now wet,'' said one representative whose
house had a leaking roof.
</P>
<P>
   Isyaku's motion would have to wait a day.
</P>
<P>
   After a recess was called, as he waited for an elevator, Isyaku
ran into Anthony Aziegbemi, one of 18 members who was co-sponsoring
his motion on quelea birds and locusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honorable, you were not able to present your motion on quelea
birds,'' said Aziegbemi, who is from the rain forest region and had
never seen a quelea bird.
</P>
<P>
   As the elevator door opened, Aziegbemi turned to Isyaku, two
politicians from two completely different corners of the country,
partners perhaps in the new Nigeria. The co-sponsor had a question:
</P>
<P>
   ``What are quelea birds anyway?''
</P>

   SEATTLE _ From the sandpiper-congested shores of the Copper
River Delta in Alaska to the hardwood forests of New England,
volunteers have been out with maps and magnifying glasses this
summer, trying to find scraps of the American Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 4 percent, or 103 million acres, of the nation is
designated as protected wilderness. And this month, the 35th
anniversary of the law that allowed Congress to set aside public
land as forever wild, supporters of more wilderness say at least
another 100 million acres could be added to the system.
</P>
<P>
   But at century's end, the definition of what qualifies as true
wilderness in a country of 260 million people has never been more
elusive. And the purpose of setting aside land in its native state
has never been more contentious. American wilderness has long been
held up as a high esthetic, something that has a right to exist for
its own sake, even if nobody ever visits it. But increasingly,
there is a clamoring for open land as a playground for thrill
seekers propelled by ever-more-sophisticated toys.
</P>
<P>
   By law, wilderness is defined as ``an area where the earth and
its community life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a
visitor who does not remain.'' The intent of the 1964 Wilderness
Act was to rope off a few areas from ``expanding settlement and
growing mechanization.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the biggest wilderness fight in the country is
centered in the slickrock canyons, leathered mesas and expanse of
rust-colored emptiness in central and southern Utah. It is a place
where a shout is never returned, even by echo, on most days. But it
is also part of what was perhaps the most densely populated area in
the America West _ the Anasazi Indian country of 1,000 years ago,
when perhaps as many 250,000 people lived in the broad area known
as the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   The Anasazi, who sealed up their cliff homes and fled for
reasons that remain unclear, left behind thousands of petroglyphs
and pictographs _ the rock art of the Southwest. Wilderness
advocates say the area has returned to a sufficiently wild state,
and thus qualifies for protected status because it now meets the
standard of the law that protects land where ``the imprint of man's
work is substantially unnoticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   That standard has prompted opponents of protecting wilderness to
rush to scar land so that it will not fit the definition.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, people have been racing through the red rock country in
off-road vehicles, trying to imprint the ground with visible
tracks, which are then photographed and brought to Congressional
hearings. In Alaska, a rush is on by timber interests to build a
primitive road through the biggest wetland in North America _ the
Copper River Delta _ in part so it can then be considered
ineligible for future wilderness protection.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists have been just as busy, mapping and
photographing areas the size of tiny Eastern states that the
government has overlooked when it seeks out raw nature. In Utah,
they say they have found 8.8 million acres that could qualify as
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in this debate is the concept that wilderness and
humans should have nothing to do with each other _ that people have
no place in wild country, except as occasional visitors. Some
conservationists now say it may be time to allow a greater human
presence in the wild, which could actually open up more land for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of letting people have extended stays or even live in
the wilderness will soon be tested in Death Valley National Park,
where a deal is close to approval that would allow the 300-member
Timbisha Shoshone tribe to resume what are classified as
traditional activities over 300,000 acres of wild land. The tribe
has lived in the desert for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which must be approved by Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the Indians would be allowed some hunting,
gathering and cultural activities _ but only the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some inherent conflicts,'' said William Meadows,
president of the Wilderness Society, which supports the tribe's
efforts. ``But we have to be careful not to read more into what
qualifies as traditional use of the land. I don't think using off
road vehicles to hunt would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act was created before Jet Skis, paragliding,
helicopter skiing and other outdoor thrill sports became so
popular. The law generally prohibits temporary roads or any motor
vehicle use. There are exceptions _ an airstrip in the Frank Church
River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho and roads to old mining
claims in Colorado among them.
</P>
<P>
   But the participants of the new outdoor sports are knocking on
the door of wilderness, asking to be let in. Aldo Leopold, the most
influential early proponent of wilderness, traversed the Gila
National Forest in New Mexico on horseback. In is unlikely he
envisioned a day when people would want to glide over the same area
with nylon wings.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, like Washington's Sawtooth Range in the North
Cascades, the divisions are jarring. A sign on weather-bent trees
delineates wild land from the non-wild. On one side, the serrated
sound of all-terrain vehicles rises up to what is supposed to be an
area untrammeled by man.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the latest numbers from the Dow Jones industrial
average are flashed into once-private corners, wilderness is
trumpeted as the last hideout from the storm of modern times. Huck
Finn, Walt Whitman and Crazy Horse were evoked when the act was
signed in 1964; wilderness was said to simply be part of the
American DNA.
</P>
<P>
   And later, writer Wallace Stegner memorably labeled wilderness
``the geography of hope'' and argued that it should never have to
prove its utility to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply need that wild country available to us,'' Stegner
wrote, ``even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look
in.'' The question now is whether the road to the edge belongs in
the American idea of wilderness.

   TIMOR-RDP (Dili, Indonesia) _ Guarded by a tight cordon of
security, the streets of East Timor's capital shattered and still
smoking around him, the chief of Indonesia's armed forces, Gen.
Wiranto, conceded Saturday that he had lost control of elements of
his military. And although Wiranto said he was becoming more open
to help from foreign troops, he added that the time was still not
right. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JIANG (Auckland, New Zealand) _ President Clinton and
China's leader, Jiang Zemin, declared an end Saturday to months of
frozen relations following the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, and ordered their trade ministers to meet on Sunday in
hopes of closing a broad deal that would get China into the World
Trade Organization this year. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-CAPITAL (Abuka, Nigeria) _ Once a dormant capital of a
nation ruled by decrees meted out quietly by Nigeria's military
rulers, Abuja is today abuzz with the noisy workings of
representative government. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   GERMANY-POLITICS (Berlin) _ Marking a clear break with the
caution of German foreign policy since World War II, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder has laid out a new vision of his country's
international role, describing Germany as ``a great power in
Europe'' that will not hesitate to pursue its national interests.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-LAUNDER (Moscow) _ Irritated by allegations of money
laundering, some of Russia's leading businessmen insist that the
West has overlooked a simpler explanation for the billions of
dollars that have flowed through several suspicious accounts at the
Bank of New York: the old game of dodging Russian tariffs and
taxes. By Celestine Bohlen and Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KGB-KENNEDY (Washington) _ The KGB fabricated evidence linking
the CIA to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and
passed the material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United
States, according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the
West by a former Soviet officer. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CULT (Tokyo) _ Underscoring the immense fear that the Aum
Shinrikyo religious sect invokes in Japan, a growing number of
cities are using public money to drive its followers out of town,
often buying property owned by the doomsday cult. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-HOLOCAUST (Paris) _ Two members of a commission set up by
the French government in 1997 to establish the facts about the
looting of property from Jews in France during World War II come to
Washington this week to tell American officials that France will
not flinch from a full and final accounting for its actions. By
Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-POLITICS (Mendoza, Argentina) _ Domingo Cavallo, the
former economy minister credited with whipping Argentina's
hyperinflation in the early 1990s, will almost certainly run a
distant third in the presidential election next month. But he will
probably have long enough coattails to elect a substantial
congressional delegation for his small conservative party, and
there is an outside chance he could throw the election into a
second round, which could give him decisive bargaining power over
future economic policy. By Clifford Krauss.

   AFTER-CANOSA (Miami) _ Two years after the death of the
undisputed leader of Cuban Americans in Miami, no single leader has

   FORD-POLLUTION-FIGHT (Detroit) _ Mark Pickrell used to be a
lawyer for Big Tobacco. Now he's representing a one-man Internet
site against Ford, and contends that the auto industry's handling
of sport utility vehicles' air pollution and poor fuel economy is
just like the tobacco industry's handling of smoking issues. Ralph
Nader agrees, and has coincidentally asked the Justice Department
to reopen an antitrust investigation from the 1960s into whether
Detroit colludes not to put advanced pollution-control equipment on

committee assignments and fund-raising help. By Richard L. Berke.

   CHEMICAL-ACCIDENTS (Washington) _ Environmental advocates have
published on the Internet new information about the risks of
chemical accidents, outflanking an attempt by industry groups and

PARKING LOTS NOT DESIGNED FOR SUVs' SIZE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sport-utility vehicles -- those rolling behemoths
with armored bumpers and beefy tires -- are built to conquer
wide-open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, all they conquer are parking spaces -- many
too small to fit SUVs and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   When Andee Pariser wedged her 78-inch-wide Ford Expedition into
a compact space only 96 inches wide, she knew it would be a
nightmare for drivers squeezing in on either side and trying to
open their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if somebody keys me sometime, because
I do get pretty close,'' said the 38-year-old, trying to wriggle
into her SUV, jammed up against a small car. ``Nowadays you really
should make larger spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally. parking experts are starting to listen.
</P>
<P>
   As sales of SUVs and pickups continue to outpace cars,
parking-lot designers, city planners and even parking enforcement
bureaus are scrambling to deal with difficulties posed by these
oversized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Burbank city planners ordered two developers to
reduce the number of compact spaces in their projects to fit an
expected crush of SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   International Parking Design Inc. has begun advising its clients
to allot 10 percent fewer compact spaces than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto police have begun ticketing SUVs that overrun compact
spots, while Los Angeles's parking bureau is considering whether to
change its rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems will only get worse as Americans continue
buying big.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want the capability of off-road, whether or not they
just go to the supermarket,'' said Michael Pak, a research analyst
who studies the auto industry for the New York brokerage firm ING
Barings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the empowerment notion. But common sense dictates it
would be hard to find parking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, three of the five top-selling vehicles in the country
were full-size pickup trucks -- the Ford F-series, Chevrolet C/K
and Dodge Ram. The Ford Explorer SUV ranked third, and the only
passenger car was the fourth-place Toyota Camry. The combined
number of Camrys and Honda Accords -- the most popular passenger
cars -- still didn't equal the number of Ford pickups sold last
year, 830,000 to 836,000. And for 2000, Ford is coming out with its
Excursion SUV -- a massive 80 inches wide and 226.7 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Los Angeles still allows up to 40 percent compact spaces for
all parking lots and garages with 10 or more slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent is very high,'' said Los Angeles city planner
Reuben Arceo. The limit was 15 percent in other cities he's worked,
such as Montebello and La Habra.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles requires that parking spaces be 108 inches wide and
240 inches long, while compact spaces can be 96 by 180 inches, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't abide by the compact stall rules, that's
when you have problems,'' Arceo said. ``The complaints are rising
-- from slamming or jamming doors, an inability to get out, and
large vehicles parking in these areas that are supposed to be for
smaller vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Compact spaces started appearing in parking lots after the gas
crises of the the 1970s, when motorists began buying compact and
subcompact cars. But now the economy is booming, gas prices are at
an all-time low when adjusted for inflation, and drivers no longer
want to fold themselves into Matchbox cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of large vehicles has been coming over the
last few years. There are far fewer compacts to full-size than
there used to be,'' said Greg Parker, senior project manager at
International Parking Design, the 30-year-old consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUES ON SECOND TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen grown men come close to begging,'' he said.
``Parking is such a critical issue to merchants. The City Council
is usually sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many cities, in order to avoid those problems, avoid compact
parking altogether. But some don't. They're trying to be
business-friendly,'' Arceo said.
</P>
<P>
   Pariser said she tries not to use compact spaces, but does
sometimes so she won't have to haul her two small children across a
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally try to be cognizant of other people, because I know
my car is large,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberman parked his Explorer beside another SUV, both in
compact spaces. The 60-year-old said he thinks compact car drivers
should park only in compact spaces, leaving regular-sized spaces
for SUVs and larger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to squeeze in and worry about hitting somebody else's
car. I'd actually search for regular space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Kenworthy said her Chevrolet Camaro is even too large
for some compact spaces she's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have larger vehicles, we should have larger spaces,''
she said. ``It's ridiculous. I think the subcompact days are
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank is reacting to the end of that era. Noting the
proliferation of SUVs, pickups, minivans and other large vehicles,
the Planning Board there asked two developers to cut back on their
compact spaces in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't work that well anymore. There's more and more
behemoths on the road and less and less small economy cars,'' said
Greg Jackson, Planning Board vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects, a 16-screen AMC movie theater downtown,
lost all but 12 compact spaces out of the 1,200 total parking
spaces planned, said Fred Bruning, president of Center Oak
Properties of Torrance, the theater developer. His company erased
49 compact spaces, but the project will still have a surplus of
parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, customers will reward that by buying a lot of
tickets and a lot of popcorn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruning, who himself drives a Jeep Cherokee, added, ``People
will tend to abuse the compact-car only policy. You can go into any
lot anywhere in any town and find that SUV parked in two compact
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens in Palo Alto, the SUV might have a ticket on its
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, police there began enforcing a new ordinance against
big cars, trucks and other vehicles parking in compact spaces.
Anything more than 72 inches wide or 180 inches long has to circle
the lot again, or the driver risks a $30 citation.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto police agent Jim Coffman said that, when someone has
parked too close to his driver's-side door, to get in ``I've had to
climb over the center console of the police car. That's not a
pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Los Angeles, Arnold Schwarzenegger could cram his Hummer
(a whopping 86.5 inches wide) into a compact space and never get
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council has yet to address anything about this
issue,'' said Rudy Carrasco, parking enforcement manager with the
city's Department of Transportation. ``We don't have anything like
that on the books in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the example of Palo Alto, Carrasco said L.A.'s
Office of Parking Management is looking at the problem, but so far
``we are not pursuing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's slow progress is not unusual, though, as parking
strategies nationwide still lag far behind what is actually rolling
into the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, with International Parking Design, said he believes that
in coming years vehicle sizes will start to settle in some middle
range -- between the Miatas and the Expeditions of the world. And
his firm is working on designs for a universal parking space that
will fit them all.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank Planning Department is also crunching the problem,
and the Planning Board and City Council expect to vote on a
one-size-fits-all space in November and December, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But what will fill those universal spaces remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the economy, gas prices, environmental rules and
consumers' whims will ultimately decide what vehicles become
popular in the future -- and just how big their parking spaces will
have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of parking -- it's a very critical issue,'' he
said. ``It is very important, and it's much more involved than
anybody realizes.''

JAKARTA CONCEDES A LOSS OF CONTROL IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ Guarded by a tight cordon of security, the
streets of East Timor's capital shattered and still smoking around
him, the chief of Indonesia's armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, conceded
Saturday that he had lost control of elements of his military.
</P>
<P>
   On a tense and eerie visit with a high-level U.N. delegation to
this small seaside town, Wiranto said he was becoming more open to
help from foreign troops but added that the time was still not
right for their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was still struggling to persuade his men on the
ground to crack down on East Timorese militias, to which he said
they felt an emotional allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not reject the offer of an accelerated deployment of an
international peacekeeping force at all,'' he said. ``The offer of
an international peacekeeping force must be considered as an option
by the Indonesian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his statement a second time, he changed his reference
from ``peacekeeping force,'' to ``security cooperation,'' prompting
a U.N. official to describe his words as ``Delphic.''
</P>
<P>
   International pressure for foreign peacekeepers to deploy in
East Timor has mounted in recent days as militias aligned with
Wiranto's forces ransacked the island territory, terrorizing and
killing hundreds of inhabitants and driving tens of thousands from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton suspended arms sales to Indonesia, and in
remarks on Air Force One en route to New Zealand for an Asian
economic summit said it was clear that the Indonesian military was
aiding and abetting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In New Zealand, the president was asked about a timetable for
Indonesian agreement to deployment of an international peacekeeping
force, and replied: ``Well, I think you'll see a development here
in the next couple of days. I think something will happen. I'd be
surprised if it doesn't. We're working, not just the U.S., people
all over the world are working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials traveling here with the five-member delegation from
the U.N. Security Council said it was not yet clear what effect
Wiranto's statement might have on East Timor. Its inhabitants voted
on Aug. 30 for independence from Indonesia, which invaded and
annexed the territory after Portugal abandoned its colony in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As the Timor Sea sparkled in the sunlight, Dili was silent and
nearly deserted Saturday. Large groups of refugees sat at the
roadsides, surrounded by piles of belongings and staring dully at
the passing convoy of dignitaries. Behind them, shattered
buildings, looted and roofless, still smoldered.
</P>
<P>
   But with hundreds of armed soldiers lining the delegation's
route, Dili was calm for the first time since the vote. ``A
Potemkin operation,'' said Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British
representative at the United Nations. ``But they can't cover up
what happened in Dili. The place has been trashed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The message this scene sent may not have been the one intended
by the Indonesian authorities. ``It illustrates that you can never
know whether these people are going to switch it on or switch it
off,'' Greenstock said, referring to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the U.N. compound, with its 1,000 refugees and its
exhausted staff, was reported to be a place of terror, with militia
gunshots, looting and threats unrestrained _ and even aided _ by
uniformed soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it appeared to be one of the most secure places on
earth, ringed by ranks of alert, all-business soldiers with
automatic rifles at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day we can see the sky _ yesterday, it was
dark with smoke,'' said Nick Birnback, one of 80 U.N. workers who
insisted on remaining here to protect the refugees when the bulk of
the staff was forced to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, there was not a gunshot to be heard in this largely
abandoned town, which one diplomat compared to Phnom Penh in
Cambodia after it was emptied of its residents by the Khmer Rouge
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few thin columns of gray smoke rose into the blue sky
from burning buildings here.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the efforts made to sanitize the city and despite
the blithe and smiling officers who escorted the delegation,
Wiranto voiced something approaching angst.
</P>
<P>
   His orders to halt the violence and restore calm had not yet
been obeyed, he implied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be something which has caused there to be such big
problems,'' he said, ``whether it was caused by a technical or
psychological problem, or perhaps by a false procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have checked in the field, and I concluded that the main
problem is a psychological constraint among our personnel on the
ground _ those who have been living with the East Timorese for so
long,'' he said. ``For more than 20 years, our personnel have been
working hand in hand with the people to develop East Timor. I can
understand that it is very hard for them to shoot their own people,
who have been regarded as their brothers, and who are not really
criminals. And they defend their basic principles emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would take time and delicacy to pull his soldiers
into line, and he asked the outside world for understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his statement about peacekeeping forces reflected a
change in his policy, Wiranto said, ``Yes, yes. It's very
complicated, not only in the region. It's an international problem,
and other countries have their opinions on East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the delegation accepted Wiranto's
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to think that they are having major
difficulties controlling the situation,'' said an official
traveling with the delegation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Look at today and look at election day when everything was
brought under control with the snap of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a coordinated and planned campaign _ evacuating
towns, assassinating moderate leaders, moving huge numbers of
people into forced exile _ that it could only have come from the
top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since invading East Timor in 1975, the Indonesian military has
waged an unending war against separatist guerrillas and forged
close links with those East Timorese who want to remain part of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a remote and small province of Indonesia with
just 800,000 inhabitants, East Timor holds a crucial place in the
history and ethos of the country's military. This territory is
where most senior officers have earned their stripes, where many
have put down roots and grown wealthy, and where thousands of their
comrades have died.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has played a key role in Indonesia since
this country _ the world's fourth largest _ won independence from
the Dutch in 1945, also apparently fears that losing East Timor
could lead to the loss of other rebellious and remote regions.
</P>
<P>
   When President B.J. Habibie declared in January that East Timor
could go free if it rejected his offer of an autonomous status
within Indonesia, the military responded by recruiting and arming
irregular militias in a clear attempt to undercut the referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   That policy, which Wiranto may have fostered or tolerated at the
wishes of officers dedicated to maintaining their hold on East
Timor, appears in recent weeks to have slipped beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Alphons Hamer, a Dutch representative to the United Nations and
a member of the delegation here, said Habibie told the envoys when
they were in Jakarta that a principal reason for resisting
peacekeeping forces was the damage their introduction would do to
the reputation of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a military man, it must be worrying, to say the least, to
see your orders not going down and information not reaching up,''
Hamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the military reacted to the international outcry
by declaring martial law in East Timor, Wiranto's newly appointed
commander here, Maj. Gen. Kiki Shahnakri, indicated Saturday that
progress in restoring control was slow.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the introduction of five battalions of fresh troops,
he said, just 27 weapons had been confiscated from the militias
that have taken over much of the province.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing in the military headquarters _ one of the few
substantial buildings in Dili not to have been vandalized _
Greenstock pressed Kiki forcefully to protect the U.N. headquarters
here.
</P>
<P>
   If not, he said, using the initials for the Indonesian military,
``you must realize that TNI will have to carry the responsibility
for that failure,'' adding, ``The Security Council mission is
therefore asking you, commander, to make absolutely sure that
security for Unamet is comprehensive and continuous.'' Unamet is
the acronym for the U.N. mission here.
</P>
<P>
   The general replied, ``I fully realize what you are saying, and
I am willing to do all I can to secure Unamet.''

KGB TOLD TALL TALES ABOUT DALLAS, BOOK SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication notice: Also moving in `i' news file.) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Soviet KGB fabricated evidence linking the CIA
to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and passed the
material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United States,
according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the West by a
defector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the files turned over by a former KGB archivist to
British intelligence and detailed in a new book, Moscow's Cold War
spy service took several steps designed to link the CIA to the
Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included forging a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to
a CIA officer, E. Howard Hunt, asking for information ``before any
steps are taken by me or anyone else,'' according to the new book,
``The Sword and the Shield,'' written by Christopher Andrew and the
former KGB officer, Vasily Mitrokhin. The book is to be published
by Basic Books later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Oswald letter was supposed to have been written about two
weeks before Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963,
but was actually created by the KGB in the mid-1970s, after Hunt's
name had surfaced in the Watergate investigation, according to KGB
files copied by Mitrokhin while he served as a KGB archivist.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was then passed anonymously to three conspiracy buffs
and entered circulation in the United States when it was picked up
by one writer of self-published assassination books, the authors
report.
</P>
<P>
   The letter led to a brief flurry of interest when a Dallas
newspaper reported that a handwriting expert declared it to be
genuine, but a congressional panel that re-investigated the Kennedy
assassination in the late 1970s later concluded that the letter was
probably a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB's clumsy propaganda campaign never had much of an impact
on the debate over the Kennedy assassination in the United States.
But the archives spirited out of Russia by Mitrokhin appear to
support the longstanding assertions by CIA officials that the KGB
conducted disinformation campaigns designed to raise dark
suspicions about the U.S. government and prominent American leaders
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book also suggests that those efforts were amateurish and
often silly. In August 1967, for instance, the KGB authorized a
plan to discredit the Rev. Martin Luther King by planting articles
in the African press portraying him as an ``Uncle Tom'' who was
secretly being paid off by the government so that he would make
sure the civil rights movement would not threaten President Lyndon
B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB was apparently frustrated that a moderate like King had
emerged as the most influential voice in the civil rights movement,
but Moscow's comical propaganda revealed the KGB's lack of
understanding of American politics and society. The KGB's
propaganda campaign had even less impact than the FBI's separate,
but equally fumbling, efforts to smear King.
</P>
<P>
   ``News that the KGB was attempting to plant false stories in the
African press portraying Dr. King as an `Uncle Tom,' at the very
time when Dr. King was harshly attacking Johnson's conduct of the
Vietnam War indicates that American police agencies were not the
only Keystone Cops active in the 1960s,'' said David J. Garrow, a
historian at Emory University and the author of ``The FBI and
Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist in charge of managing many of the
spy service's secret files until he retired in 1984. When he
arrived in Britain in 1992 and sought out British intelligence, he
brought with him a huge cache of notes that he said he had taken
based on those files, and turned them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrokhin files, which the British considered reliable
enough to share with the CIA and FBI, have offered Western
intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of
historical information about KGB operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while the archives quoted in the book contain only limited
information about Soviet espionage cases, the archives have already
helped identify some spies. In the United States, for instance, the
book reveals that the Mitrokhin files helped lead the FBI to Robert
Lipka, a former code-clerk at the National Security Agency, who
worked as a Soviet mole in the 1960s. Lipka was arrested in 1996
and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage. Information
about other open spy cases contained in the archives were withheld
from the book, including on the case of a former State Department
official, Felix S. Bloch, who was suspended in 1989 and resigned in
1990 but was never charged or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin first attempted to defect to the United States, but
was received a lukewarm reception from a CIA officer when he
approached the agency in a Baltic country soon after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the CIA's Soviet/East European Division had
decided that the KGB was no longer a threat and had instituted a
controversial new policy that led CIA officers in the field to turn
away many defectors. Paul Redmond, who was then the CIA's deputy
chief of counterintelligence, said in an interview that he sought
to take over the Mitrokhin case after other officials had failed to
show interest, but by then Mitrokhin had turned to the British.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond now argues that the CIA's diffident handling of
Mitrokhin's efforts underscored a larger problem, which was that
the CIA decided ``naively'' after the collapse of the Soviet Union
to scale back its espionage operations against Moscow. ABC News
reported on this controversy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA apparently did miss a good bet with Mitrokhin, since his
archives seem to reveal a wide array of intriguing insights into
KGB operations against the West. Among other things, according to
the book, the files show that the KGB planted secret caches of
weapons in Europe and probably in North America as well, apparently

<P>
   They also appear to show that the KGB sought to blackmail German
Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1960s by alleging that he had spied
for Moscow during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While Brandt was living in exile in Sweden during the war, he
had provided information about Germany to the Soviets as well as
the British and Americans, but never committed espionage, the files
show. But in 1962, the KGB attempted to blackmail Brandt by
threatening to use evidence of his dealings with the KGB's
Stockholm residency against him, according to the Mitrokhin
archives. The attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that Mitrokhin's files also pointed to the
existence of a previously unknown British agent who was recruited
on ideological grounds by the Soviets during the 1930s, but who
survived the collapse of the famous Kim Philby spy ring. Melita
Norwood, code-named HOLA in the Mitrokhin files, remained in place
after the others in the Cambridge spy ring were identified or
forced to defect to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that, after being recruited to the Soviet cause in
the 1930s, Norwood began to spy for Moscow after she started
working in the British Non-Ferrous Metals Association in 1945,
providing information on Britain's project to build its first
atomic bomb. She spied for the Soviets for decades, and in 1958
Moscow secretly awarded her the Order of the Red Banner.
</P>
<P>
   The book states that her ``ideological commitment seems never to
have wavered over more than forty years.'' Now 87, she retired
without being arrested and is reportedly still living in England.

   EXP-GERMANY-POLITICS (Berlin) _ Marking a clear break with the
caution of German foreign policy since World War II, Chancellor

international role, describing Germany as ``a great power in
Europe'' that will not hesitate to pursue its national interests.
By Roger Cohen.

   EXP-RUSSIA-LAUNDER (Moscow) _ Irritated by allegations of money

Bank of New York: the old game of dodging Russian tariffs and
taxes. By Celestine Bohlen and Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   EXP-KGB-KENNEDY (Washington) _ The KGB fabricated evidence

KGB TOLD TALL TALES ABOUT DALLAS, BOOK SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication notice: Also moving in `w' news file.) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Soviet KGB fabricated evidence linking the CIA
to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and passed the
material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United States,
according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the West by a
defector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the files turned over by a former KGB archivist to
British intelligence and detailed in a new book, Moscow's Cold War
spy service took several steps designed to link the CIA to the
Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included forging a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to
a CIA officer, E. Howard Hunt, asking for information ``before any
steps are taken by me or anyone else,'' according to the new book,
``The Sword and the Shield,'' written by Christopher Andrew and the
former KGB officer, Vasily Mitrokhin. The book is to be published
by Basic Books later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Oswald letter was supposed to have been written about two
weeks before Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963,
but was actually created by the KGB in the mid-1970s, after Hunt's
name had surfaced in the Watergate investigation, according to KGB
files copied by Mitrokhin while he served as a KGB archivist.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was then passed anonymously to three conspiracy buffs
and entered circulation in the United States when it was picked up
by one writer of self-published assassination books, the authors
report.
</P>
<P>
   The letter led to a brief flurry of interest when a Dallas
newspaper reported that a handwriting expert declared it to be
genuine, but a congressional panel that re-investigated the Kennedy
assassination in the late 1970s later concluded that the letter was
probably a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB's clumsy propaganda campaign never had much of an impact
on the debate over the Kennedy assassination in the United States.
But the archives spirited out of Russia by Mitrokhin appear to
support the longstanding assertions by CIA officials that the KGB
conducted disinformation campaigns designed to raise dark
suspicions about the U.S. government and prominent American leaders
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book also suggests that those efforts were amateurish and
often silly. In August 1967, for instance, the KGB authorized a
plan to discredit the Rev. Martin Luther King by planting articles
in the African press portraying him as an ``Uncle Tom'' who was
secretly being paid off by the government so that he would make
sure the civil rights movement would not threaten President Lyndon
B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB was apparently frustrated that a moderate like King had
emerged as the most influential voice in the civil rights movement,
but Moscow's comical propaganda revealed the KGB's lack of
understanding of American politics and society. The KGB's
propaganda campaign had even less impact than the FBI's separate,
but equally fumbling, efforts to smear King.
</P>
<P>
   ``News that the KGB was attempting to plant false stories in the
African press portraying Dr. King as an `Uncle Tom,' at the very
time when Dr. King was harshly attacking Johnson's conduct of the
Vietnam War indicates that American police agencies were not the
only Keystone Cops active in the 1960s,'' said David J. Garrow, a
historian at Emory University and the author of ``The FBI and
Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist in charge of managing many of the
spy service's secret files until he retired in 1984. When he
arrived in Britain in 1992 and sought out British intelligence, he
brought with him a huge cache of notes that he said he had taken
based on those files, and turned them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrokhin files, which the British considered reliable
enough to share with the CIA and FBI, have offered Western
intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of
historical information about KGB operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while the archives quoted in the book contain only limited
information about Soviet espionage cases, the archives have already
helped identify some spies. In the United States, for instance, the
book reveals that the Mitrokhin files helped lead the FBI to Robert
Lipka, a former code-clerk at the National Security Agency, who
worked as a Soviet mole in the 1960s. Lipka was arrested in 1996
and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage. Information
about other open spy cases contained in the archives were withheld
from the book, including on the case of a former State Department
official, Felix S. Bloch, who was suspended in 1989 and resigned in
1990 but was never charged or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin first attempted to defect to the United States, but
was received a lukewarm reception from a CIA officer when he
approached the agency in a Baltic country soon after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the CIA's Soviet/East European Division had
decided that the KGB was no longer a threat and had instituted a
controversial new policy that led CIA officers in the field to turn
away many defectors. Paul Redmond, who was then the CIA's deputy
chief of counterintelligence, said in an interview that he sought
to take over the Mitrokhin case after other officials had failed to
show interest, but by then Mitrokhin had turned to the British.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond now argues that the CIA's diffident handling of
Mitrokhin's efforts underscored a larger problem, which was that
the CIA decided ``naively'' after the collapse of the Soviet Union
to scale back its espionage operations against Moscow. ABC News
reported on this controversy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA apparently did miss a good bet with Mitrokhin, since his
archives seem to reveal a wide array of intriguing insights into
KGB operations against the West. Among other things, according to
the book, the files show that the KGB planted secret caches of
weapons in Europe and probably in North America as well, apparently
for use in the event of war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   They also appear to show that the KGB sought to blackmail German
Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1960s by alleging that he had spied

<P>
   With good reason, farmers, home gardeners and many others cursed
the severe drought that hit the Northeast this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But some others managed to make hay while the sun shone. Among
them are wine-makers, well-diggers, building contractors, seashore
landlords, apple, peach and blueberry growers, wild-turkey lovers,
cops looking for illicit marijuana crops and good neighbors like
Frank Rudisill of Absecon, N.J., who found an ecologically
acceptable way to paint his brown lawn green.
</P>
<P>
   First, let us hear from Rudisill, a financial planner and avid
gardener, who took ``the logical approach'' and asked for
professional advice after New Jersey announced criminal penalties
for watering a lawn. He found a spray called Lesco Green, which is
used at dozens of sports stadiums to tone up grass for the color
television cameras. Voila, Rudisill found. Instant emerald lawn!
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there was some muttering among neighbors, who
suspected he'd been secretly sneaking out at night with the garden
hose. ``I got a nasty letter put in my mailbox that basically
accused me of being a drought criminal,'' Rudisill said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the truth became known, jealousies disappeared. ``Some
neighbors of mine have a really nice yard, and about six months ago
friends of theirs asked if they could have their wedding in their
yard,'' he said. ``Then, bang, along comes the drought. So I told
them I'd paint their lawn for them this weekend. You use this stuff
and it's like playing God. Let there be green!''
</P>
<P>
   The artificial lawn-coloring industry aside, other industries
have weathered the drought well. From Massachusetts to Maryland,
well-diggers have been flooded with calls. Companies that deliver
jugs of water for coolers or tankers of water for well and cistern
replenishment are drowning in orders. Balmy coastal tourist towns
said they had one of their best summers in years, and seashore
rental agencies were swamped in June and July by people who hadn't
booked accommodations earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Building contractors, blessed with so many rain-free summer
days, couldn't hire enough workers to keep up with their orders and
projects. While lawnmower repairs were off sharply, businesses that
specialize in repairing boat hulls and propellers sailed on
prosperously as boats ran aground or hit rocks on lakes where water
levels had dropped sharply. And pest exterminators made a killing,
as more ants and other parched insects found their way indoors to
look for water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wine growers in the Northeast, now about to harvest
their grapes, say that 1999 will be a banner year _ assuming you
like Northeastern wines. The grapes do well in dry, hot weather
(for one thing, because less rain means fewer weeds and funguses)
and the result is smaller, juicier grapes with higher sugar
content.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same holds true for apples. Shelley Page, a spokeswoman
for the New York State Apple Association, said the bushel total for
this year's crop (New York is second to Washington in total apple
production) will be about 30 percent larger than normal, with
crisper and sweeter apples to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting back in May, with those warm sunny days, we had
perfect conditions for blossoming and pollination,'' she said. ``If
it's rainy and windy, the bees stay home, and icky weather wrecks
the blossoms. The bees were incredibly happy and industrious this
spring.'' With the hot, dry summer, she said, ``there's a great
crop on the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Other crops that did well this summer, for similar reasons, were
peaches and blueberries. (Blueberries are an early crop, harvested
in June mostly, and so were not as affected by the drought.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was good and bad news for another crop:
marijuana. The hot and dry conditions were conducive to robust
growth of marijuana plants, hardy weeds with shallow roots that can
sop up even small amounts of moisture. On the other hand, police
and federal drug-enforcement agents who use airplanes to look for
marijuana crops in isolated areas had an easier job of it this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A green field of pot stands out from the air when everything
else is brown,'' one surveillance officer said. The state police in
rural Maryland and Virginia reported that they were spotting and
seizing more crops this summer. In other major pot-growing states
like New York and Pennsylvania, most cultivation occurs in northern
areas that weren't hard-hit by the drought. ``A lot of yield is in
those places, where everything is still fairly green from the
air,'' said Lt. Col. Chris Cleaver of the Pennsylvania National
Guard, which conducts aerial surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   As the season changes from summer to fall _ autumn's official
first day is Sept. 23 _ the evidence of the drought will likely
linger. Most noticeable, probably, will be a spotty and early fall
foliage season. A spokeswoman for Connecticut's tourist agency
said: ``A lot of the foliage is already starting to turn. It's a
week to 10 days early.'' And hikers all over the Northeast are
being pleasantly surprised to see bursts of wild turkeys in places
they never saw them before. Brad Gunn, a biologist with the
National Wild Turkey Federation, said turkeys _ who are
``opportunists'' as feeders, and whose population is growing
robustly anyway _ are making do in parched, scrubby areas abandoned
by other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of seasonal things, the pumpkin crop is a bust this
year, as evidenced by the gnarled, scraggly offerings just now
turning up in shops and outdoor stands.
</P>
<P>
   And Christmas trees growing in drought-hit areas are not doing
well, farmers say. But not to worry, even if the drought continues
all fall, said Gary Richards of Lasco Inc. in Rocky River, Ohio,
the company that makes Rudisill's grass paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product also works beautifully on Christmas trees,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle for control of Congress in 2000 has set
off a furious tug-of-war among House and Senate leaders within both
parties who are competing to recruit the best candidates with
hard-sell appeals and enticements like choice committee assignments
and fund-raising help.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the parties have viewed the House as the prime
stepping-stone for future senators. But with Republicans
controlling the House with the slimmest majority in about half a
century, House leaders are imploring incumbents to stay put rather
than place their safe seats in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is more likely that the House will change hands than
the Senate _ where Republicans hold a larger majority _ Senate
leaders have not been reticent about trying to raid the other
chamber for candidates. They have aggressively encouraged some
House members to give up their seats to run for the Senate, telling
of the increased influence and prestige in representing an entire
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both House and Senate leaders sense a chance of a victory _
and if only one institution can have a majority, we want it to be
ours,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``It's a civil war being
fought in the family. The weapons are committee assignments,
campaign assistance and a lot of pleas of personal friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said his party's House leaders were
``trading all kinds of things'' to persuade House incumbents not to
try to bolt to the Senate. He said there have been ``payoffs from
not getting into the Senate race,'' but that publicly, ``we don't
like to talk about those things, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This behind-the-scenes jockeying over the past several months
has drawn little publicity. But it may be vitally important in
helping determine the outcome of the House and Senate races more
than a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, both Republican and Democratic House leaders have
enjoyed great success in retaining their members. Only a handful of
House members have announced that they will definitely run for the
Senate next year; roughly a dozen in each party have decided to
stay after sometimes tortuous deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders become unsettled when incumbents threaten to run
for the Senate because incumbents have a far better chance of
winning re-election to the House than newcomers from the same party
have of winning the open seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Gephardt has tried to post a big `no hunting' sign on his
chamber,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ``There has
never been as much pressure on House members to stay put.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In encouraging lawmakers to stay, House leaders note that
control of the House is in far more doubt than control of the
Senate, so their decision could make a difference. They also point
out that it is less risky for a House member to stay put _ and move
up in seniority _ than to gamble on a statewide run that would mean
trying to amass daunting sums of money. By contrast, Senate leaders
argue that their chamber is more prestigious and carries greater
national influence. And senators have to run only every six years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he and House Republican leaders were particularly
aggressive in persuading Rep. James Rogan of California to stay in
the House. He said ``no one else'' in the party could have retained
that seat. His pitch to Rogan, he said, was that as a House manager
of President Clinton's impeachment he was a target of Democrats,
but re-election would be the ultimate revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let him know that it was going to be a very tough Senate
run for him,'' Davis said. ``But being the No. 1 target in the
country, he could be a hero winning that seat in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Davis tried a different pitch with Rep. Mark Foley of Florida,
who eventually decided against running for the Senate. (Rep. Bill
McCollum, another Florida Republican, is seeking the seat.) ``I
took Mark Foley aside and said, `Mark, we just put you on Ways and
Means _ it's a huge investment.'''
</P>
<P>
   The intraparty struggles over recruits are not over. The
decision last week by Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey not to
run for the Senate nomination next year has opened new tensions
between Senate and House interests.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had been viewed as the favorite, but her decision has
left two House members, Bob Franks and Frank LoBiondo, toying with
running for the Senate. Now, Republican House leaders are
scrambling to persuade them to stay. Franks and LoBiondo are
considered to have safe seats that could turn Democratic if they
give them up.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawmaker who is being lavished with attention is Rep.
Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont who usually votes with
Democrats. Sanders is weighing a challenge next year to Sen. James
Jeffords, a Republican. Sanders' wife, Jane, said he was assured by
Senate Democratic leaders that he would be treated like a Democrat
if he were elected to the Senate. But if Sanders stays in the
House, leaders there said they had promised to help him with fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten assurances from Senator Daschle that he would be
treated the exact same way he has been treated in the House _ as an
equal as opposed to being frozen out because of his independent
status,'' Ms. Sanders said. ``He's gotten assurances that he would
maintain his seniority and his status in the House, and if the
Democrats gain control he would be up for a chairmanship on a
banking subcommittee.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders are pleading with Rep. David Minge of
Minnesota not to give up his seat to take on Republican Sen. Rod
Grams. Minge, among others, explained the House Democrats' tag-team
approach: Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, comes on strong,
urging House members not to defect. Then Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader who is hoping to become speaker,
tries a paternal approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is more direct,'' Minge said. ``He said, `I hate to see
you make a mistake here. I'm glad you're planning to drop the idea
of running for the Senate.' With Dick, it's more of a fatherly
visit. He said he doesn't want me to be intoxicated with the
prospect of serving in the Senate because it's not easy to take on
an incumbent _ and there are a lot of opportunities here in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, House members seem more eager to keep Minge than
Senate leaders are to persuade him to run. Several Senate officials
said that while Minge is well-suited to his district, he may be a
bit too conservative to win a statewide contest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders acknowledge that their failure to recruit the
traditional roster of House incumbents to try to jump to the Senate
has resulted in a less impressive field of Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest disappointment thus far for Senate Democrats is in
Ohio, where Rep. Sherrod Brown was viewed by party leaders as the
most potent challenger to Sen. Mike DeWine next year. Brown said he
decided to stay in the House after frenzied lobbying on both sides.
For now, DeWine has no opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recalled how he was wooed by Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, and Torricelli: ``I was
flattered when Torricelli and Daschle came over off the Senate
floor in the rarefied atmosphere. Torricelli and Daschle were very
persuasive. They made the case of everything from quality of life
in the Senate to that I would be one of 100'' members instead of
one of 435 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown we wanted very badly,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said Gephardt reminded him that if Democrats win back
the House, ``I would be chairman of one of the best subcommittees
in the Congress: health and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he played out his decision-making longer, Brown said, ``Who
knows? Maybe I would have gotten more help on appropriations
projects in my district and all that. But I'm not a good enough
poker player to say, `I'm very interested in the Senate race, talk
me out of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Brown said, if the fight for control of the House
were not so close he might have bolted. ``The probability of
Democrats taking the House played a major role in my staying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pressure for lawmakers to stay in the House does
not come only from their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of peer pressure _ this is not just leadership
pressure,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. He said that
if lawmakers with safe seats quit the House, that could ``leave
their colleagues very much in the lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he quit the House, Brown said, that might have been
detrimental to several of his colleagues because he has such a safe
seat he can afford to travel to help the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of stuff to help other Democrats,'' he said. His
departure, he said, would have created ``a bigger hole than just
one seat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another House member from Ohio, Rep. Ted Strickland, also opted
not to try for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members could not resist the temptation to run for
the Senate, like McCollum and Democrats Debbie Stabenow of Michigan
and Ron Klink of Pennsylvania. Others, like Rep. Harold Ford,
D-Tenn., are considering running for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   For some members who decided to stay in the House, the decision
was not so much for the good of their colleagues, but because of a
practical realization that their efforts to advance to the Senate
may be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., had considered running for the
Senate. But he decided to stay: ``In order for me to run I had to
be convinced that I could win the primary, and I wasn't at that
point. It was still a very chancy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added inducement, party officials said they floated the
idea to Pallone that he might eventually take over the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.

   BUCHENWALD, Germany _ The Buchenwald concentration camp, where
the Nazis killed more than 65,000 people, later became one of the
holy shrines of the East German communist state. The camp was a
statutory rite of passage for generations of schoolchildren, who
learned here how the reactionary Hitler regime slaughtered
socialists and communists.
</P>
<P>
   This version of history was not without its kernel of truth:
From its establishment in 1937, Buchenwald served to incarcerate
leftists, including the communist leader Ernst Thalmann, who died
here in 1944 and became an East German icon, immortalized as ``a
great son of the German people murdered by fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the portrayal of the Nazi regime as the ultimate and most
brutal stage of bourgeois capitalism, and the shaping of the
Buchenwald memorial to that end, amounted to a distortion of
history. The fate of the Jews was omitted, as was Hitler's wide
appeal to the German working class.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the East German state a decade ago,
Volkhard Knigge, the western German historian who became the
director of the memorial, has been working to create a more
balanced picture of what happened at Buchenwald. But here, as
elsewhere in Germany, history remains a charged issue. The squaring
of eastern and western memory is elusive even as Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder tries to make the recent move of the government back to
Berlin a symbol of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem exists here, one sometimes referred to as the
``Americanization'' of German memory, a fixation on the Holocaust
that some Germans say excludes an abundantly rich cultural and
political history and oversimplifies the 12 years of Nazism.
Germans are grateful to Americans for productions like the 1970s
``Holocaust'' television series and the Steven Spielberg movie
``Schindler's List,'' which have helped them feel the Holocaust in
a uniquely immediate way. But a certain exasperation has become
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have many visitors to Buchenwald from the United
States, and they are disappointed that there are no gas chambers,''
Knigge said. ``Before, people did not want to the see the truth.
Now they want to see what they expect to see, and we have to
disappoint them and show how rich and complicated history is.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald, like Dachau and other concentration camps on German
soil, was never an annihilation camp for the Jews. In this it
differed from the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex built in Poland, one
of the sites where millions were systematically exterminated.
Though many Jews died at Buchenwald, particularly in 1945 after
being forced to march from other camps farther east, its primary
purpose was the imprisonment and torture of anyone opposed to the
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Does the distinction matter? All the Nazi camps were barbarous,
and a Jew shot or worked to death in Buchenwald was just as dead as
one gassed at Birkenau. Moreover, the enormity of the Holocaust is
such that its dominant place in the history of Nazism is right and
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But another historical distortion would take root if Nazi crimes
were to become synonymous in the popular American consciousness
with only the murder of six million Jews, if all the camps were
seen only as death factories for Jews and if there were no place in
that consciousness for the millions of non-Jewish victims.
Expecting gas chambers at Buchenwald is in many ways to be as
misinformed as expecting only tributes to anti-fascist fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current instrumentalization and trivialization of the
Holocaust in the United States are a terrible mistake,'' said
historian Fritz Stern. ``Details do matter. The concentration camps
were publicly established in 1933, and they were for all political
enemies of Hitler. The gas chambers came later and were a universe
apart. They were connected, yes, but distinct.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of increasingly difficult negotiations between the
United States and Germany over compensation for Nazi-era slave
laborers and forced laborers, such issues of historical accuracy
have acquired much more than academic importance. At stake are
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The talks involve the Jews who worked as slave laborers in the
camps, and many non-Jews who were brought to Germany to work in
factories. ``The Nazi genocide system was complicated,'' said
German historian Hans Mommsen. ``To conflate the concentration
camps and the annihilation camps, as Americans tend to do, or to
fail to distinguish between Jewish slave labor and non-Jewish
forced labor, is unhelpful.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schroeder, now trying to project a forward-looking image,
this rearing-up of a disputed history is unwelcome. The radically
different history taught in the two Germanys over more than 40
years complicates unification. Eastern Germans tend to be more
nationalistic; they were raised not to assume guilt for the
Holocaust, but to see themselves as ``anti-fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   The different mentalities are evident at Buchenwald. Disputes
flare as eastern Germans note that when the memorial went up in
1958, western Germans were doing their best to forget the Nazi
camps. The long-suppressed fact that Buchenwald was used from 1945
to 1952 as a Soviet internment camp (commemorated in a small museum
at the site) is also controversial, with some right-wing western
Germans trying to use this as evidence that Stalin was worse than
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the question of a Jewish-American ``takeover''
of the narrative of German history is highly sensitive for the
government at a time when a vast _ and still disputed _ new
memorial to the Holocaust designed by an American is to be built in
Berlin, and when the forced-labor negotiations are at a decisive
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might do more to consider the German view,'' said Peter
Novick, the author of ``The Holocaust in American Life'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1999). ``What would we think if the Germans said the
Holocaust is a terrible thing, but chose to build a museum in
Berlin commemorating the American oppression of blacks? It would be
grotesque. The problem is that an American encounter with slavery
in a museum would make costly demands on our emotions, while the
Holocaust is in danger of becoming an evasive route to
bumper-sticker moral lessons.''

   There are about 240 million guns in the United States, according
to federal estimates, a total that gives the nation one of the
highest per-capita rates of gun ownership in the world. For
gun-rights proponents, the large numbers of guns are a reflection
of a fundamental freedom and a sign of national strength.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates view the statistic as a cause for national
shame, the easy availability a factor in the 750,000 deaths by
firearms since 1960 and in violent episodes like the killings
earlier this year at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and
a Jewish community center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gun rights continues in Congress, in statehouses
and in the federal courts, where a Texas case may well wind its way
to the Supreme Court as a landmark test of whether the Second
Amendment to the Constitution specifically gives individuals, and
not just state militias, the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight over the guns, the numbers and the laws often
overlooks some surprisingly basic questions: Who owns all these
guns, and why?
</P>
<P>
   Some criminals, of course, steal guns or buy them illegally with
the intent to intimidate or to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This gallery of portraits, assembled by Sarah Weissman, picture
editor of the New York Times Week in Review, reflects gun owners
(all those pictured say their guns are legal) who offer a range of
other reasons for owning a weapon: for sport, for hunting, for
collecting, for self-protection (against rattlesnakes as well as
human intruders), for sentimental reasons and as a financial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   And one man, asked to complete the sentence that begins, ``I own
guns because ...'' answered, simply: ``I can.''

   LIMA, Peru _ Peru is a country of strange, even frightening
wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes and floods come in biblical sizes. One guerrilla
group announced an insurrection some years ago by hanging dogs from
lamp posts, another by stealing the sword of a swashbuckling
19th-century liberator from a museum. The last time the army took
power, it stole from the rich and gave to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori. His tenure has
been marked by extraordinary swings in his popularity. But every
time he mocks human rights and foreign democrats call him a tyrant,
his standing with the voters goes up again.
</P>
<P>
   People outside Peru find this hard to understand, even
infuriating; they associate civilian rule with rising respect for
rights and liberties _ the pattern in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   But not here. In fact, when Peru led South America in abandoning
military rule and embracing civil liberties and democracy two
decades ago, it quickly found itself near collapse in the face of
horrific terrorist violence. So Peru, under Fujimori, responded
with a distinctive formula: electoral democracy that survives
primarily by setting ever stricter limits on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem paradoxical and counterintuitive, but so is much
of Peru's recent political history.
</P>
<P>
   In most other Latin American countries, guerrillas rebelled
against right-wing military regimes and gave at least lip service
to human rights. Here, when the military ruled, it was a left-wing
military. The two main guerrilla groups waited for the army to
return to the barracks before they staged attacks _ against elected
civilian governments and the very principle of moderate peaceful
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both rebel groups bombed public places and mocked the civilian
governments when they appointed liberal judges or circumscribed the
army's powers. For the Maoist Shining Path, revolution meant a
bloodletting complete with executions of officials and soccer games
played with human skulls.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, the two groups have collapsed under
the weight of their own excesses and popular revulsion. And
Fujimori can take credit for defeating them, a claim that most
Peruvians accept. The conventional wisdom here is that he was
saving the country when he dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court
in 1992, held show trials and otherwise upended the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere deep down in the consciousness of many Peruvians
there is the feeling that human rights have helped the terrorists,
and not the victims of the terrorists,'' said Francisco Diaz
Canseco Tavara, a former congressman and a human rights advocate.
``People tell me all the time that human rights are for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a general lesson in this, it may be that even after
a Latin American country shucks off military rule, the civilian
government is going to have to maintain order; if it fails, the
voters could be tempted to follow the man on a horse (even if he is
a civilian).
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, in fact, is beginning to look like another case in
point. Sick of the corruption and failed policies of two centrist
parties that alternated in power for 40 years, Venezuelans this
year elected Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader, as president.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru over the last two months, Fujimori has surged in opinion
polls and is beginning to break away from the two opposition
candidates most likely to run against him. For the first time in
two years, he is considered the favorite in next year's election,
even though Peru is deep in recession and the constitution still
formally prohibits him from running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for this latest comeback in 1997, when he
fired three judges who had upheld a constitutional prohibition of
his expected run. State Department officials, human rights
activists and the Peruvian press protested, but local polls showed
that Peruvians, especially the poor who had been most afflicted by
terrorist violence, were not particularly upset at the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly negative reviews from abroad came last July when
Fujimori withdrew Peru from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American
Human Rights Court after it ruled that four Chileans convicted as
terrorists in Peru had not received a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's approval rating, which had been as low as 33 percent
back in December, rose from 46 percent to 50 percent _ a boost that
was also attributed to the arrest in July of the top remaining
leader of the Shining Path guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of Fujimori rising in the polls every time he abuses
civil liberties goes back to April 1992, when he suspended
democratic institutions and ordered mass arrests of union and
opposition leaders. He was called a tyrant throughout the
hemisphere, Washington cut some aid, and the Organization of
American States approved sanctions. But Peruvians were overjoyed,
and Fujimori's approval rating in a leading Peruvian poll soared
from 53 percent to 81 percent that year. Five months later, the top
Shining Path leaders were arrested, and this served to legitimize
the removal of civil liberties in the eyes of the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Fujimori attacks judges, Peruvians like it,''
said Alfredo Torres Guzman, Peru's leading pollster. ``That's
because in the past judges released so many terrorists for lack of
evidence. Our focus groups show that poor people don't distinguish
between authoritarianism and authority _ and without authority, in
the Peruvian mind, there is chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Fujimori enjoyed a surge in the polls _ from an
approval rating of 52 percent to 67 percent _ was in April 1997,
when he ordered commandos to storm the Japanese ambassador's
residence and liberate 71 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels. When
all 14 rebels were killed on the spot _ some, it is almost certain,
having been executed after they surrendered _ Fujimori was again
criticized abroad. But to the majority of Peruvians, it seems, the
rebels got what they deserved.

24/7: REDEFINING A LIFE OF NONSTOP POSSIBILITIES

   It looks like a top-heavy fraction whose value is a bit larger
than Pi. But to trend watchers, the expression ``24/7'' has worked
its way into the language as an abbreviation for a clock-defying
world where financial markets run continually and news channels
promise never-ending headlines (along with weather and traffic
reports).
</P>
<P>
   Log on to Slate, Microsoft's online magazine, and you'll find a
section called ``24/seven'' that contains columns and e-mails to
the editor. Redbook magazine had ``24/7'' for quick recipes and
life-style tips. United Airlines has used it in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how 24/7 became popular, though, is almost a 24/7
proposition in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how it got into the vernacular,'' said Kurt
Jenkins, a graphic designer who uses the Web address www.24-7.com.
``It's a younger people's saying.'' (This from someone who is all
of 29.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilson, the entrepreneur who owns Jenkins' address and
about 200 others containing alphanumeric variations on 24-7, agreed
that it probably originated with people under 30. ``It began as a
kind of a Generation X term to describe the Internet,'' he said.
``We figured that a lot of older people had tried to capture this
catch phrase with symbols and logos, but they missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where speed counts, syllables are precious. ``It's
just too long to say `24 hours, 7 days a week,' so it was
abbreviated,'' said Andrew Nelson of Britannica.com, the online arm
of the venerable Encyclopaedia Britannica. ``In the Web world, 24/7
is the shorthand for saying `We're live all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it written 24/7 (with the numbers separated by a slash)? Or
simply the consecutive digits 2, 4 and 7? `` 24/7 is the way it
should be written,'' Wilson said, ``but on the Internet the only
punctuation is a dash. I think a lot of people rushed to capture it
and they missed the boat.'' The dash is crucial, he said. ``You
look at 247 and think, `What's that?'' A 7-Eleven doesn't say
`711.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries have yet to take note of 24/7. Not even Microsoft's
new Encarta, which has entries for ``twenty questions'' and
``twenty-twenty,'' defines it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the monumental Random House Historical Dictionary
of American Slang; its third volume, covering entries from P to Z,
has yet to be completed. The project editor, Jesse Sheidlower, said
recently that he had not reached the T's, but 24/7 was certain to
be included. ``The definition will probably be something very
simple like `constantly,''' he said. ``It doesn't mean 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. It refers to things that can't literally be
24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have an example like running
the vacuum cleaner 24/7 for two days in a row.'' Not possible, he
said. ``If you had an example like `He was happy 24/7' or `He was
stoned 24/7,' you'll never know if that's absolutely literal. It
probably means `most of the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to terrified executives who dread having to deal with
round-the-clock customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Shannon, a co-founder and chief creative officer of
agency.com, a New York Internet advertising agency, remembers a
strategy session with one high-powered client a couple of years
ago. ``I was talking about the nature of the Internet and how it's
this two-way thing, not just putting messages out but getting
messages back,'' he said. ``She went, `Oh, my God.' She said, `This
Internet thing, it's like a 24/7 focus group.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist Stephen Bertman maintains that the ``social
speedometer'' has continued to climb in the 1990s. ``We are now
nearing a velocity called `warp speed,''' he wrote in
``Hyperculture: The Human Cost of Speed'' (Praeger, 1998). ``It is
one that can, if we are not wise enough or strong enough, warp the
fundamental nature of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, 24/7 is defined as when people are sitting at a
computer,'' Shannon said. ``But the Palm VII and interactive
television are coming. Right now the Internet is a place you log on
to. It's going to become like a dial tone, all pervasive. That will
be real 24/7.''

is the shorthand for saying `We're live all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it written 24/7 (with the numbers separated by a slash)? Or
simply the consecutive digits 2, 4 and 7? `` 24/7 is the way it
should be written,'' Wilson said, ``but on the Internet the only
punctuation is a dash. I think a lot of people rushed to capture it
and they missed the boat.'' The dash is crucial, he said. ``You
look at 247 and think, `What's that?'' A 7-Eleven doesn't say
`711.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries have yet to take note of 24/7. Not even Microsoft's
new Encarta, which has entries for ``twenty questions'' and
``twenty-twenty,'' defines it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the monumental Random House Historical Dictionary
of American Slang; its third volume, covering entries from P to Z,
has yet to be completed. The project editor, Jesse Sheidlower, said
recently that he had not reached the T's, but 24/7 was certain to
be included. ``The definition will probably be something very
simple like `constantly,''' he said. ``It doesn't mean 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. It refers to things that can't literally be
24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have an example like running
the vacuum cleaner 24/7 for two days in a row.'' Not possible, he
said. ``If you had an example like `He was happy 24/7' or `He was
stoned 24/7,' you'll never know if that's absolutely literal. It
probably means `most of the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to terrified executives who dread having to deal with
round-the-clock customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Shannon, a co-founder and chief creative officer of
agency.com, a New York Internet advertising agency, remembers a
strategy session with one high-powered client a couple of years
ago. ``I was talking about the nature of the Internet and how it's
this two-way thing, not just putting messages out but getting
messages back,'' he said. ``She went, `Oh, my God.' She said, `This
Internet thing, it's like a 24/7 focus group.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist Stephen Bertman maintains that the ``social
speedometer'' has continued to climb in the 1990s. ``We are now
nearing a velocity called `warp speed,''' he wrote in
``Hyperculture: The Human Cost of Speed'' (Praeger, 1998). ``It is
one that can, if we are not wise enough or strong enough, warp the
fundamental nature of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, 24/7 is defined as when people are sitting at a
computer,'' Shannon said. ``But the Palm VII and interactive
television are coming. Right now the Internet is a place you log on
to. It's going to become like a dial tone, all pervasive. That will
be real 24/7.''

   U.S.-WORLDPOWER-REVIEW (Auckland, New Zealand) _ As the U.S.
helped bring one more Mideast peace agreement to fruition, a crisis
broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington was
called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the
ability of the U.S. to make the problem go way by simply swaggering
in proved not so easy. The world has recently come to think of the
U.S. as the one power with enough influence to make just about
anybody sit up and listen. But just what does this singular U.S.
power consist of, and how and where can the U.S. use it? By Jane
Perlez. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   BIG-MERGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mega-mergers, such as CBS-Viacom,
seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics course. They are
intended to efficiently expand a network for the distribution of
goods or services or consolidate overlapping distribution networks.
Yet many such deals are also based largely on ego, hubris and
management fads. Many fail, as post-merger returns for shareholders
often trail market averages. Putting together two large
organizations is a difficult management challenge, even when the
two are a good fit strategically. By Steve Lohr. (`a' category).

<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's controversial
offer of conditional clemency for Puerto Rican militants was far
from a routine action for him. He has granted fewer clemency
petitions than either of his Republican predecessors, Presidents
George Bush and Ronald Reagan. In fact, the number of presidential
clemencies has steadily declined since the mid 1970s, as the
intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up. By David Johnston. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   WILDERNESS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Roughly 4 percent, or 103 million
acres, of the U.S. is designated as protected wilderness. And this
month, the 35th anniversary of the law that allowed Congress to set
aside public land as forever wild, supporters of more wilderness
say at least another 100 million acres could be added to the
system. But at century's end, the definition of what qualifies as
true wilderness in a country of 260 million people has never been
more elusive. And the purpose of setting aside land in its native
state has never been more contentious. By Timothy Egan. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   TWENTYFOUR-SEVEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ To trend watchers, the
expression `24/7' has worked its way into the English language as
an abbreviation for a clock-defying world where financial markets
run continually and news channels promise never-ending headlines
(along with weather and traffic reports). But how did the phrase
originate? By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-BENEFITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Farmers, home gardeners and
many others cursed the severe drought that hit the Northeast this
summer. But others managed to make hay while the sun shone. Among
them are wine-makers, well-diggers, building contractors, seashore
landlords, apple, peach and blueberry growers, wild-turkey lovers,
and cops looking for marijuana crops. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP-TIPS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing world has been
producing so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the
nation now has a viable alternative to counting sheep. Many are
repetitive, recommending familiar habits of healthful living. But
even so, the books may not leave your eyelids droopy _ for a close
perusal yields passages that surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. A

collecting, self-protection (against rattlesnakes as well as human
intruders), sentimental reasons and investment. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   PERU-FUJIMORI-REVIEW (Lima) _ President Alberto Fujimori's
tenure has been marked by extraordinary up-and-down swings in his
popularity. But every time he mocks human rights and is branded a
tyrant by foreign democrats, his popularity with Peru's voters
rises again. When Peru led South America in abandoning military
rule and embracing civil liberties and democracy two decades ago,
it quickly found itself on the verge of collapse in the face of
terrorist violence. Fujimori responded with a distinctive formula:
an electoral democracy that survives primarily by setting ever
stricter limits on civil liberties. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-HOLOCAUST-REVIEW (Buchenwald) _ The `Americanization' of
German memory puts a fixation on the Holocaust that some Germans
say excludes a rich cultural and political history and
oversimplifies the 12 years of Nazism. Another historical
distortion will take root if Nazi crimes become exclusively
synonymous in popular consciousness with the murder of 6 million
Jews, if all the camps are seen only as death factories for Jews
and if there is no place in that consciousness for the millions of
non-Jewish victims. By Roger Cohen. WITH PHOTO.

<HEADLINE>
SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE ARE THE AGASSI AND SAMPRAS HEIRS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I have to admit that I have not spent much time
worrying where the next great American tennis player is coming
from, or if he is going to come at all before Y3K. Maybe this will
become a priority concern when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are
finished carrying the men's game around on their backs like a sack
of potatoes, but, definitely, no sooner than that.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there is no American male heir apparent to Sampras
and Agassi frequently comes up in conversations, especially at this
U.S. Open, which lost Sampras to a back injury. Lo and behold, it
managed to survive that potential calamity all the way to
Saturday's semifinals. If you are of the mind that we need our guys
to authenticate our tournament, then give a bare-chested salute to
Agassi and a shake of the fist to Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Both Americans are 29, which is practically prehistoric in a
sport where the ball has more fuzz than many of the unlined faces
you can stroll past any day in the locker room. Yet here was
Martin, who moves stiffly around the court as if his limbs are
fastened to his body by nuts and screws, first on in the Ashe
Stadium Saturday against France's unseeded veteran, Cedric Pioline.
And then came Agassi, playing more tenaciously than he ever has for
much of this summer, against the talented but unpredictable
Russian, Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk about the sorry shape of men's tennis and the
shaky state of the sport in this country overall, we boosters may
console ourselves with the conclusion that whatever the problem may
be, it's not the Americans. On both sides of the draw, men and
women, we have been holding up our end, and then some. Counting the
sensational Williams sisters and Lindsay Davenport, five of the
eight Open semifinalists were homegrown. And of the first six Grand
Slam singles titles already won this year, half have been claimed
by Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   I know many of my fellow baby boomers are too busy fondling
their five irons and the tennis ratings don't reflect this, but we
are a long way from the days of Ivan Lendl versus Miloslav Mecir.
This is a time that tennis people, who have the annoying habit of
lamenting lost days while hoping for better ones ahead, will fondly
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, 28, has been the decade's dominant men's player.
Agassi, alternately brilliant and invisible, has managed to win all
four slam events in his career, one of the most diverse
achievements in a single sport. Until this past year, Michael Chang
was a top-five fixture. Jim Courier had a nice run, especially in
Paris, early in the early 1990s. Martin, back from an assortment of
injuries to claim the No. 7 seed at the Open, has been a solid if
unspectacular pro right on through.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, with the exception of a Stefan Edberg
here, a Boris Becker there, that world out there has been serving
up a diet of hardcourt fakers and hangdog chokers. Marcelo Rios?
Give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   Next great American? If a dry spell is inevitable _ and I say if
because no one can say when another Agassi will announce himself _
then give our tennis academies a chance, and some needed and
deserved time. Let the Germans and the Swedes, the Czechs and the
French churn out a few colorful champions until we can replenish
the well. Sampras will recover to renew his bid to bypass Roy
Emerson, and Agassi will continue to mine his magnificent tennis
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say at this stage of my life I'm appreciating the
opportunities I have in my career more than ever,'' he said. ``The
motivation really seems to come rather easily now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the decade's noblest names have been stepping aside at
an alarming rate, it is hard to believe Agassi is pushing 30, the
great adult hope with Sampras not around. The one-time teen idol
and shaggy dog is as passe to the kids as a Beanie Baby, but I
recall being at Stratton Mountain, Vt., when Agassi first showed
himself 13 years ago, with his blond punk hairdo with the garish
black highlights. Early in a match against this strange-looking
kid, John McEnroe hit a short approach shot and Agassi nearly
beheaded him with a vicious forehand pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who the hell is this?'' McEnroe said, looking up to his good
friends in the press section behind the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Agassi admittedly has allowed his career
to be defined by a lousy work ethic, which has also enabled him to
reinvent himself at an age when Borg, McEnroe, Wilander and Becker
were, for various reasons, finished as Grand Slam forces. Rare has
been the tennis player who has made himself better at Agassi's
advanced age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends on the individual why an athlete breaks
down,'' Agassi said. ``My game never left me. I fell in the
rankings because I wasn't in shape. But I think athletes playing
great sports into their mid-30s has been proven by a number of
people, not just in tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, 30-plus tennis champions have been the rarest of
exceptions recently. Trust me. We won't need Agassi and Sampras to
hang on until 3000. Just a few more. The next great Americans were
out there Saturday, watching Agassi and Martin, the way they
watched the Williamses and Lindsay Davenport, too. Baby boomers are
aging, and interest in tennis here is waning. As long as we have
champions, it isn't dying.

CLINTON AND JIANG HEAL RIFT AND SET NEW TRADE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ President Clinton and China's leader,
Jiang Zemin, declared an end Saturday to months of frozen relations
following the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, and ordered their trade ministers to meet on Sunday in
hopes of closing a broad deal that would get China into the World
Trade Organization this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. and Chinese officials emerged from the hourlong
meeting, on the fringes of the annual Asian economic summit
conference, brimming with confident assessments of the encounter.
It was the first between the two leaders in over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials appeared particularly pleased that Clinton had
been openly critical of President Lee Teng Hui of Taiwan for his
statements over the summer that described the island as a separate
state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to his national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, told Jiang that Lee ``had made things more difficult for
both China and the United States'' with his comments, which
appeared to inch Taiwan toward independence. But Berger said that
Clinton repeated a warning that if China resorted to military force
against Taiwan ``there would be grave consequences in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the meeting was consumed with discussion of the final
deal to usher China into the World Trade Organization, which would
give the Chinese prestige and protection from economic sanctions
and trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked away from a deal in April, during a visit to
Washington by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China, but soon came to
regret the decision.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, any final deal negotiated in coming days or
weeks is likely to closely resemble the offers to open markets that
Clinton judged insufficient five months ago. The soured political
atmosphere between the two countries appears to have affected the
White House assessment of what constitutes a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   After the accidental embassy bombing, which killed three
Chinese, and charges of nuclear spying by the Chinese in U.S.
weapons laboratories, Clinton's aides apparently view the trade
accord as the one concrete step they can take to begin to repair
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is how quickly a deal can be struck. The U.S.
trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, is expected to open
talks on Sunday with her Chinese counterpart on the three big
remaining differences: automobiles, textiles and the rules that
prevent Chinese industry from ``dumping'' products in the United
States at below-market prices.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official said that ``with the dose of political will,
this is stuff that can be worked out in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's national economic adviser, Gene Sperling,
cautioned against expecting an agreement while the two leaders are
in New Zealand for the summit meeting and simultaneous state
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's enough issues that are on the table that
I would not have significant expectations over the next several
days,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   China's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, also declined to estimate how
long the negotiations might take.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will never accept terms that exceed the economic
capacity of the country,'' he said, referring to the fear in China
that opening markets at a time of severe economic downturn would
worsen unemployment and deflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the United States is flexible, I don't think the
accession will be that difficult,'' he said, using the term for the
process of joining the trade organization. ``But if the U.S.
persists in its high demands, that will be difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States the advantage of an agreement is
straightforward: All of the concessions and reductions of trade
barriers come from the Chinese, with none from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For China, membership is a mixed bag. While it must agree to
open its highly protected markets to foreign competition, as a
member of the trade group it would gain protection against
unilateral sanctions by all of its trading partners. Disputes would
go to the World Trade Organization's court, and China would be able
to challenge efforts by the United States and others to restrict
imports of its goods.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the deal will most likely prove politically difficult
in both countries. At a time of growing economic troubles in China,
Jiang risks accusations that he is allowing the world's most
powerful economy too much access to China's markets. The complaints
have been particularly strong in the telecommunications industry
because the deal proposed in April would allow foreign companies to
own a majority share of Chinese cellular telephone concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must worry about a possible revolt in his own party, one
that would particularly hurt Vice President Al Gore's candidacy for
next year's presidential race. Labor unions have already protested
White House trade policy and some have withheld endorsements of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the United States' biggest unions say they will actively
oppose any trade deal with China. They are particularly incensed
about China's insistence that the United States agree to curb its
powers to act unilaterally in dumping cases. China is already at
the center of several dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Jiang went into detail about these problems
at the session on Saturday, according to officials who were
present. They will leave the hard slogging to the trade
negotiators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders would step in only to resolve serious logjams,''
said one Clinton aide.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang seemed particularly eager to score points on Saturday at
Taiwan's expense, telling Clinton, according to Berger, that the
question of the island's status was ``the most important'' of the
questions Clinton raised on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At a photo session as the two leaders were sitting down, Jiang
said in response to a reporter's question, ``If there were to be
any foreign intervention, or if there were to be Taiwan
independence, then we would not undertake to renounce the use of
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan had not changed.
He was apparently seeking to defuse Chinese suspicions that the
United States was behind Lee's statements that talks between Taiwan
and the mainland constituted ``state-to-state relations.'' The
United States has recognized only one China since President Nixon's
opening to Beijing a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We favor one China,'' Clinton said in the presence of
reporters, eager to show he was not diverging from the policy of
Democrats and Republicans before him. ``We favor a peaceful
approach to working out our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang urged Clinton to stop arms sales to Taiwan, particularly
recent sales intended to counter growing missile threats to the
country. Clinton declined, citing the requirements of the Taiwan
Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton briefly raised human-rights concerns, and Jiang
responded by describing the recent crackdown on Falun Gong, a
religious group that has attracted a huge following and that staged
a silent demonstration outside the Chinese leaders' compound in
Beijing in April.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang called Falun Gong ``a cult,'' and gave Clinton some books
about it. Presumably they were officially sanctioned volumes that
disparaged a group that the apparently rattled Chinese government
banned in July.

COMMENTARY: SURE I WOULD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``She has a sexy mouth, I think. That slight
palatial overbite _ it gets to me. She seems expert at marshaling
her mouth's resources, at inspiring its ingenuity ... When she is
pouncing on the possibility of an idea, her lips extend their reach
into her cheeks and carve out a wolfish, carnal line, as though
nothing could please her more than her own hunger ... Her laugh is
the sexiest thing about her, in fact; it packs a lewd wallop ... '
</P>
<P>
   So writes Tom Junod in the October Esquire. Junod is not
overheating over a pouty starlet with tattoos and a bare midriff.
``The woman of incipient bloom'' who inspires his leers is our very
own first lady. After following the would-be senator on her
political rounds in New York, he declares her ``the most
interesting sexual persona of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable, I suppose, that Hillary would go from saint
to sex object, from brain to bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a society that obsessively constructs, deconstructs
and reconstructs its celebrities. And we have a first lady who
obsessively constructs, deconstructs and reconstructs herself. The
fragmentation of Hillary Clinton's image has always been dizzying
and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all the serial mythologizations, this is the most
bizarre: The no-nonsense lawyer who was eager to show the country
that First Ladies are not paper dolls ends up being celebrated for
her ``pretty ... almond shaped, slightly catty'' eyes and ``mighty
cheekbones,'' and for looking ``lovely in the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hillary I saw was not unsexed _ she was  &UR; re &LR; sexed,'' Junod
writes about her listening tour. Alluding to both voting and
romping, he asks what he considers the ultimate question about
Hillary Clinton: ``Would I? Sure I would.'' He probably thought he
was doing the first lady a favor, setting straight all the guys who
think she's icy or bossy or wonky.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this is that it yanks us back to judging women
on their looks and desirability. That is where women have been
through history, relying on their appearance to get approval and
get ahead, and that can be debilitating.
</P>
<P>
   Female candidates for high office have it tough already. They
can't be too soft and they can't be too hard. They have to prove
that they're manly enough to handle the job _ no tears or flutters
or girlish qualms. At the same time, they have to be womanly enough
not to seem threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Junod, they should be seductive, too. He says
approvingly of Mrs. Clinton: ``One could imagine her talking dirty
... ''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to understand exactly how trivializing it is to
sexualize Hillary Clinton in this way, let's apply the Junod
approach (and much of his own panting vocabulary) to male
candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wears expensive pantsuits, drapey around his legs,
hiding the ankles that some women mistakenly call thick, and flat
shoes. He still looks like the smartest guy at the dance, the guy
not smart enough to escape his vulnerability nor ambitious enough
to escape his longing. Would I? Sure I would.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani's hair is bright and fixed. But sometimes a
tendril of it will come loose and fall into his face and he will
seem open to the intrigue of dishevelment. That radical combover,
that comb-hither look, makes me shiver. Most women seem to miss his
raw appeal: Only a very sexually confident man would slap handcuffs
on Wall Street traders right in the middle of the workday. Would I?
Sure I would.
</P>
<P>
   I think it would be easy to get Alan Keyes flustered. One little
wink would do it. He's a complete fruitcake, but that's what makes
him so irresistibly saucy. Would I? Sure I would.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s eyes, set so close together, squeezed above that long space
between the nose and mouth, give him a strange simian magnetism.
His rather wide ears sport those macho, mesquite tufts of hair.
Cowboys make me weak. Would I? Sure I would.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care that Bill Bradley has a boring voice and a belly
and a bald spot and ratty sneakers. His palatial chin packs a lewd
wallop. It is enigmatic in its capacity for adjustment. It seems
both the origin and repository of his secrets. Would I? Sure I
would.
</P>
<P>
   One could imagine Gary Bauer talking dirty. His lips form a
curving line as though nothing could please him more than his own
hunger. Would I? Let me get back to you on that ...

COMMENTARY: HONEY, I SHRUNK THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ There is a club here in Melbourne, the
Kelvin Club, where they have a rule that really appeals to me: If
you are at the bar and your cell phone goes off, you have to buy
everyone in the bar a drink.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they need such a rule here is that Australia has
become one of the most wired countries in the world, with both the
Internet and cell phones. America is first in PC's per capita;
Australia is second. America is fourth in Internet usage; Australia
is sixth (Iceland is first!). The premier of the Australian state
of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, campaigned so heavily on the Internet
that he is now best known to voters by his domain name, Jeff.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been adopted here with such zeal for a simple
reason: Australia is a million miles from everywhere, and sparsely
populated across a vast continent. The Internet can shrink that
distance between Australia and the world, and between Aussies and
Aussies, for almost no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have been praying for faster airplanes _ we
thought that would be our salvation,'' says Annie Hayes, an
Australian conference organizer. ``With the Internet, we can be so
much more in touch with the world now, without actually leaving
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gilding, the former head of Greenpeace, has an
environmental consulting firm in Sydney: ``Two years ago we thought
we were going to have to leave Australia because you just couldn't
operate a global business from here,'' he said. ``Clients would
say, `We'd love to have you as advisers, but you can't service us
from Australia.' Now we're not only advising DuPont [in Delaware),
but we're able to attract experts to come live in Sydney from all
over the world because they feel they can have the best of our
lifestyle and be connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bacon, the premier of Tasmania, the remote island off
Australia's south coast, has reached for the Web with gusto. And no
wonder. Tasmania has long been known as either ``the beginning of
the end of the world'' or ``the gateway to Antarctica.'' Says
Bacon: ``Suddenly we are connected. We have a little resort on the
coast of Tasmania called Killynaught Cottages. The owners were
telling me the other day they are getting all sorts of bookings now
over the Internet, and just got one from Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Australians will often tell you that theirs has been a
``derivative country.'' They would wait for things to be invented
in the United States or United Kingdom and then adapt them. That
may change, said Matthew Symons, director of Schoolsnet Australia.
``The Internet got adopted here for education very early because we
have all these far-flung schools where you had, say, one art
teacher, working in total isolation _ so there was a real need to
wire them all in. Once they were wired together, though, they
started forming communities, and instead of looking for some
American solution to their problems, they started sharing with one
another and coming up with organic Australian solutions. It is a
fascinating study in network effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Pauline Hanson, a xenophobic,
anti-globalization politician, gained popularity here. One way the
Australian government sought to combat her influence was by wiring
the whole country. ``Hanson gained popularity because rural
Australia felt it was being left behind _ banks were closing,
telephone boxes were being removed. Rural communities felt there
was unequal access to the new economy,'' said Education Minister
David Kemp. ``So the government decided in 1998 to include access
to Internet technology in the basic service package offered to
everyone by the state phone company. She was taking our supporters
and this was one way for us to win them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, of course, is that being wired is always a
two-way street. The Australian mining company Western Minerals took
advantage of the stock market's obsession with ``.com'' companies
by abandoning the mining business and relisting itself on the stock
exchange as a sex products store _ Adultshop.com, offering sexy
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the Australian government set up an ethnic TV station
called Imparja, to give a cultural voice to remote, outback
Aboriginal communities. However, the station developed a taste for
American sitcoms, particularly ``Seinfeld.'' People from all over
Australia _ including the Aborigines _ started watching it to soak
up the worst of Americana rather than the best of the Aboriginal.

SPORTS COLUMN: NO LUCK INVOLVED HERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One believes in luck, the other does not. But neither
Martina Hingis nor Serena Williams believes in sitting around and
waiting for the propitious moment to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis and Williams would meet Saturday afternoon for the
women's championship at the U.S. Open, in which the women _ with
their long points, strong personalities, skill and steel flashes of
glamour; yes, even the bickering and the infighting _ have been far
more captivating than the men.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis has tried to keep girls in their early teens from the
hurly-burly of the circuit, the so-called Capriati Rule. But at
this Open, three of the four semifinalists were still under 20, and
all four are making women in their late 20s almost outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists do disagree on the subject of luck. Serena
Williams does not want to dwell on it, while Martina Hingis courts
its will-of-the-wisp existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechoslovakian-born Hingis and the American Williams are
surely too young to be versed in the collective wisdom of the late
Charles Dillon Stengel, who once simultaneously taught philosophy
and managed the New York Mets just across the boardwalk at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make your own luck,'' Stengel preached.
</P>
<P>
   And Branch Rickey, builder of baseball clubs, was known to say,
``Luck is the residue of design.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, known in her family as the combative one,
believes nobody gave her anything, en route to her first Grand Slam
final.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis works no less hard than Serena, or Lindsay Davenport or
Venus Williams, for that matter. But Hingis reserves the right to
receive that inexplicable ray of light that lands on the impartial
but human mind of a line judge or the fickle frame of a racquet.
</P>
<P>
   One case in point was the first semifinal Friday in which Serena
Williams, approaching 18, outlasted Davenport, all of 23. As Serena
broke Davenport in the seventh game of the third set, one clunker
of a return somehow wobbled over the net to produce a vital point.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 17 years, I say I deserve a break once in a while,
too,'' Serena said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was asked how much luck is involved in surviving the
demolition derby of two weeks in Flushing Meadows, which lost both
Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter to injuries. ``I had a pretty lucky
shot today with that one return,'' Serena Williams said. ``I don't
much believe in luck. I think it's skill. You go out there and you
fight and you work. You don't work hard to have luck; you work hard
to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I'm not lucky,'' Williams added. ``I have to go
sweat in the sun every day when I could be at the pool with some
lemonade. That's not luck; that's work. I'm sure Pat, when he won
his Slams, Pete, I'm sure they were doing a little sweating, too.
It wasn't necessarily luck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second semifinal, Venus Williams, who reached 19 in June,
was outlasted by Hingis, who turns 19 on Sept. 30. One key play,
while Venus was trying to hang on with thigh cramps, was a lunging
backhand stab by Hingis that produced an eerie guided missile that
somehow landed in the deepest left corner on the next to last point
of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was asked the same question about luck (by the same
Nigerian journalist, Jacob Akindele). It should be noted that Venus
and Serena could not possibly have compared notes, but were
separately reflecting the bootstrap self-reliance preached by their
dedicated parents, Richard and Oracene Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if it all came down to luck, I would lay in bed every
morning,'' Venus said. ``I wouldn't get up and start practicing. It
wasn't luck that Martina won the match. Everyone has the right to
believe in what they want. I don't believe in luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that comes, comes for a reason,'' Venus added.
``The reason is hard work or something else. I don't believe things
just happen because the wind blows and luck just lands on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Williamses, Hingis has been prepared by her mother
and coach, Melanie Molitor, to seize the main chance. She tried to
work Williams all over the court Friday, remembering how Venus had
once cramped in a long match in Australia (which Venus won). At the
same time, Hingis was taking long breathers between points. Hingis'
lungs somehow outlasted Venus' thigh muscles, and then Hingis
profited from a foot-fault call on Venus and her own fantastic
lunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Hingis said. ``I was so lucky. I put my
hand there; the racquet just went in.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Hingis believe in the luck of mis-hits, let cords, bad
calls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think luck is always on the side of the better player at the
moment,'' she said, noting that Venus had been lucky at the net
earlier. ``I think at certain stages, you're just the lucky one if
you want it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the gentler of the Williamses, Hingis knew she
had a tough final with a Williams coming along Saturday afternoon _
``another one,'' Hingis said, with a chuckle. She would not turn
down one lucky break. In fact, Hingis almost seems to think she
deserves it.

RUSSIANS SAY BANK SCHEME MAY NOT BE WHAT IT SEEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN and MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Irritated by allegations of money laundering, some of
Russia's leading businessmen insist that the West has overlooked a
simpler explanation for the billions of dollars that have flowed
through several suspicious accounts at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that some Russian money stashed abroad may
have been gained from organized crime or other criminal activity,
they suggest that many of the thousands of transactions now under
investigation can be attributed to Russian importers engaged in old
games of dodging Russian tariffs and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The businessmen agree that laws may have been broken but insist
that they were Russian, not foreign, laws. A government was
cheated, they say, but it was the discredited Russian
administration, not the U.S. government or the International
Monetary Fund. And yes, funds were used in dubious ways to buy
goods, but they were furniture, food and electronics for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that these businessmen have their own
motives in touting this explanation. They want to remove the taint
of money laundering and organized crime that has cast a cloud over
all Russian companies, legitimate and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the context of Russia's chaotic economy and
get-rich-quick approach to capitalism, their explanations appear
largely plausible, if incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in interviews with foreign and Russian reporters,
businessmen described schemes that break or bend Russian law but
are nonetheless common in an economy in which many have learned to
cheat the government. Whenever possible, these businessmen say,
profits are kept or taken abroad, and companies like Benex _ which
is thought to have moved billions of dollars through the Bank of
New York _ are essential to that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying Benex was not partly criminal,'' said Yuliya
Latynina, a respected financial journalist who wrote several
articles on the subject last week. ``But it was a service that
anyone could use, Russian companies or just ordinary people. It was
very, very important for the importers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one leading businessman, who says he has looked
into the practice, the scheme, in its simplest form, works like
this:
</P>
<P>
   A Russian importer buys water at $3 a bottle from a foreign
supplier. But to avoid a heavy tariff, he draws up an official
contract setting the price at $1. The remaining $2 a bottle is paid
under the table using fictitious shell companies and foreign
accounts like Benex, which carry out wire transfers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Schemes to transfer undeclared profits and payments out of
Russia have been an open secret since the country plunged headfirst
into free-market capitalism in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   They were developed by importers who first fed Russia's pent-up
appetite for Western consumer goods and quickly set about finding
ways to duck rigid customs duties. These duties are not only high
but unpredictable, changing profit levels with one stroke of a
bureaucrat's pen.
</P>
<P>
   Such schemes to shift or keep capital abroad may also have been
used, even set up, by organized crime groups, many of which are
linked with Russian importers. In the early 1990s, in the absence
of any civil court and credible banks, such importers were
extremely vulnerable to racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the businessmen say, only the FBI and the people
behind the Benex scheme can make an accurate accounting of where
money came from and where it went, and they are not talking.
Russians concede, however, that the amount of money passing through
the mysterious accounts is huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people in this town are afraid of this
story,'' one leading Russian banker said.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian businessman, who said he had looked into the
allegations, said a total of $6.3 billion had passed through the
mysterious accounts maintained by Benex and similarly murky
organizations, like Lowland and Becs, over the last four years. The
newspaper Kommersant, citing its own sources, estimated the sums
passing through these firms at $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the United States have stated that $4.2 billion to
$10 billion passed through Benex accounts over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Since imports ran at $60 billion last year, and are estimated at
up to $50 billion this year, the sums are credible, some analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Benex clearly has other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major banks, eager to dodge creditors after the August
1998 financial crash, may have used clearinghouse accounts like
Benex to take money out of Russia, the analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had experienced people who targeted this niche,'' the
banker said, so that after August 1998, they were the only ones
with a reputation to pick up where the pseudo-bankrupt banks left
off.
</P>
<P>
   Others used Benex to get money into Russia. One foreign
businessman in Moscow, who said he had contacted a service
recommended by a business associate, said his company had
transferred $70,000 through Benex from the United States. He said
he had used the service when his own accounts in a Moscow bank were
frozen during the financial crisis and he desperately needed
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a money launderer, but I used the
service because it was recommended to me as trustworthy,'' he said.
``They only charged a 1.8 percent commission, compared with the 3
percent I had been paying at my bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Other banks, scouring their accounts, also turned up odd
payments made through Benex. An official at Menatep, a major bank
that has frequently been mentioned in connection with the Bank of
New York scandal, said that an internal audit showed that $12
million had been paid through Benex, used exclusively to buy
apartments in Moscow. Given the size of Menatep's banking business,
the amount was relatively small, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Benex accounts may also have been used by Russians looking
for a safe haven for their money and an alternative to a banking
system that has all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Canadian and Russian economic
institutes, capital flight from Russia totaled about $130 billion
from 1992 to 1998. It continues at a rate of up to $2 billion a
month, according to economists here.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the capital flight, the study concluded, was
legal. Demand for services enabling the flight was large, and the
access to them, while a tightly held secret, was relatively easy
for those with the right contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian businessmen have an almost pathological desire to keep
their money abroad because they feel uneasy about keeping it
here,'' said Alexander Lebedev, the chairman of the National
Reserve Bank and a leader in the Our Home Is Russia party of Viktor
S. Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister and the chairman of the
vast Gazprom concern. ``Criminal money is not the lion's share.
Most of the money leaving the country is legal, but for a lot of
businesses, it is not easy to find a way to do it, so they are
eager to find someone who can offer them a service.''
</P>
<P>
   Several businessmen, fearing that the practices of importers and
other businesses will tarnish everyone, have criticized the
government for failing to conduct a vigorous and public
investigation of the root causes of the Bank of New York scandal.
``The Russian government has to understand that this mess has to be
cleaned up,'' Lebedev said. ``But if the scandal succeeds in
pushing money out of foreign banks, back to Russia, then it will be
a good thing.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But some importers say that unless Russia's tax and customs laws
are overhauled, they and their competitors could not survive
without the kind of services that Benex and other brokers offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I obeyed the law I would pay $110,000 for a shipment of
goods instead of $70,000,'' said one thriving importer who
explained a tax-dodging scheme similar to the one ascribed to
Benex. ``There is no way I could do business. I would be undercut
by all my competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Another importer, an appliance wholesaler, said the scheme was
carried out with a network of dummy companies, banks and the
connivance of corrupt government officials.
</P>
<P>
   This importer faced customs duties and value added taxes
totaling 60 percent of the value of the goods he bought. So instead
of paying for the goods with an aboveboard contract, he turned to a
broker who specialized in under-the-table money transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The broker works regularly with two or three Russian banks,
which the importer said set up dummy companies whose sole function
is to transfer money abroad. The dummy companies transfer money to
accounts like Benex or directly to the supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the dummy companies have a life span of three months,
declaring bankruptcy just when they are required by Russian law to
declare their earnings. No sooner does one company die than another
is born _ sometimes registered in the name of people who have lost
their passports, or alcoholics who have sold their passports for a
drink, the wholesaler said. The final touch is added by the
collusion of government bureaucrats, the importer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have bureaucrats who dreamed up laws that are all but
impossible to adhere to, and then you have bureaucrats who are
supposed to implement the laws,'' he said. ``The latter helps
people find a way around the laws, in collusion with the former.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GAYS IN SPORTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dave Kopay, the former running back known as Psych
for his violent intensity, was choking on tears. ``I know this
isn't politically correct,'' he said, ``but I wish I had outed
Jerry Smith. He might be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years ago, Kopay became the first athlete in a major
American team sport to acknowledge publicly that he was gay. Smith,
his Washington Redskins' teammate and close friend, never
acknowledged his homosexuality outside of gay bars. Kopay thinks
that the only way to have broken the cycle of shame, alcohol, drugs
and anonymous sex that led to Smith's death in 1986 of AIDS would
have been to force him to address his life by disrupting it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the team, according to Kopay, including Coach Vince
Lombardi, knew of Smith's homosexuality and ignored it because of
his contribution; the wide receiver scored 60 touchdowns over 13
years. And as long as Kopay was willing to block on the pass rush,
he, too, was protected from locker-room gay bashers.
</P>
<P>
   Open and emotional, Kopay offered extraordinary testimony in a
historical evening last Thursday, as four athletes moved an
audience at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center to laughter
and tears in a discussion called ``Breaking the Silence: Gays and
Lesbians in Professional Sports.'' Diana Nyad, broadcaster and
long-distance swimming legend, described an attempted rape, when
she was 14, by her coach. Mariah Burton Nelson, pro basketball
player and author, imagined a revolution beginning with even
straight men shouting, ``I am a lesbian.'' And Billy Bean, no
longer the closeted smoothie of a thousand booster breakfasts,
appeared in his first public forum to share the torch that Kopay
has carried alone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two months, Bean, a former backup outfielder for
three major-league teams, has stepped out onto larger and riskier
platforms discussing a nine-year pro baseball career burdened by
his fear of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like never having paid your taxes,'' he once said,
``and you go through life waiting for the IRS to catch up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean's process of coming out began last June, after a college
teammate was killed in a car crash. Bean missed the funeral because
none of their mutual friends had his telephone number. He had
distanced himself from them rather than lying about his life or
risking rejection by telling the truth. That led the Miami Beach
restaurant owner to a revealing conversation with a local reporter,
then calls to the old baseball buddies he had avoided, and last
week to an extensive interview in The New York Times. The response
has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday night, at a forum sponsored by The Times and
moderated by this columnist, Bean spoke haltingly at first, his
voice cracking, about the death in 1995 of his first longterm
partner, hours before a baseball game. Heartbroken, with no one to
share his grief, he played the game. It was the beginning of
choosing a personal life over baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Kopay, 57, just back from a gay cruise to the Greek islands,
speaks openly about his sex life, which he says included other
National Football League players, about checking out male bodies at
sports events, and about the NFL's failure to take a principled
stand against Reggie White, the now-retired star who ``spouts
hate'' in his diatribes against women and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Almost prim in comparison, Bean, 35, finds it difficult to use
the word ``lover,'' claims to have never known or heard of another
gay major-leaguer, and seems grateful that most current players
asked had no problem with him in the locker room, although
executives admitted they would not bring up a gay player from the
minors unless he was enormously gifted.
</P>
<P>
   Were the differences related to the length of time they have
been out, to their age or their sports? Football is ``homo-erotic
although not necessarily homosexual,'' said Kopay breezily, while
Bean still thinks baseball is ``sacred.'' Both men miss the game,
and would return in a coaching or executive capacity ``in a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesbians in sports, agree Nelson and Nyad, have had far more
support from teammates than have gay men, but face more nuanced
problems which include traditional sexism. Nelson, whose books
include ``The Stronger Women Get the More Men Love Football'' and
the forthcoming ``The Unburdened Heart,'' thinks many of the
problems begin when owners and agents put pressure on female pros
to be more feminine, code for heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Nyad, now a National Public Radio and Fox Television Sports
commentator escaped some of the pressure from owners as a star in
an individual sport. But not as a television personality. At the
American Broadcasting Company, she said, she was told not to bring
her partner to company social events and to make sure her
lesbianism stayed in the closet where it couldn't scare the Nielsen
families.

JAPANESE CITIES TRY BUYING OUT A CULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Underscoring the fear that the Aum Shinrikyo religious
sect invokes in Japan, a growing number of cities across the
country are driving out its followers by using public money to buy
up property owned by the doomsday cult.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey conducted by Kyodo, Japan's leading news
service, found that four municipalities spent a total of about $1.4
million in recent months to buy property and facilities linked to
the group.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which distorts tenets from Hinduism and Buddhism into
an apocalyptic mix, gained infamy in 1995 when some of its members
released nerve gas into the Tokyo subway, killing 12 people and
injuring 6,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, without offering specifics, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi told prefecture governors that his administration plans to
push legislation that would restrict the group's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, buying up property is among the tactics being
used in a nationwide effort to restrain the group, which has
increased its membership and visibility in the past year. The Kyodo
news survey found that other cities are also considering using tax
money to persuade followers of the group to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Already many cities will not allow the group's members to
register as residents, in effect denying them access to social
services. Some businesses will not sell goods to the group's
followers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether these efforts have been effective, and
some say that the money used to buy property has served only to
fuel the group's activities. Some people with close ties to the
group suggest that it is simply taking advantage of the opportunity
to sell marginal real estate at elevated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing victims of the nerve-gas attacks and their
families said that the real estate sales shed light on the group's
vast resources, which they believe should be confiscated and used
to pay claims brought by their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very dangerous thing to pay Aum money for its
property,'' said Kenji Utsunomiya, the leader of a group of lawyers
representing victims of the subway attack. ``They are using this
money and money from their computer businesses to buy other real
estate and increase their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, the town of Takane paid the group $139,000 to give up
rights acquired at an auction to buy land and a hotel. Last month,
the town of Sanwa paid $162,000 to buy a printing plant that the
group was leasing.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety over the group has risen since a 19-year-old woman said
she was chloroformed and abducted near her home in Narashino for 12
hours last month. She said the assailants told her that she would
be killed if her family did not drop a lawsuit seeking damages from
the group for the death of her brother, who was killed in another
nerve-gas attack linked to it in 1994 in Matsumoto.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Aum Shinrikyo, Hiroshi Araki, denied that his
group was involved in the kidnapping, and the police have offered
no evidence implicating the group.
</P>
<P>
   After the subway attack, the government stripped the group of
its status as a religious organization, and last year its assets
were liquidated by the courts. It then reorganized without official
religious status. While law-enforcement officials said the group
has about 5,000 members, its officials put the number at 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Victims who had sued the cult were awarded nearly $8 million for
crimes attributed to the group. The police have said that the group
earns about $65 million a year through the sales of computers.

GROUP PUTS DISASTER DATA ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., N.C., Fla., Va.)  (lb) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmental advocates have published on the
Internet new information about the risks of chemical accidents,
outflanking a new law that suppresses this kind of information on
the ground that the details could help terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The published information includes state-by-state summaries of
``worst-case scenarios'' presented by thousands of companies in the
United States to the Environmental Protection Agency, part of an
effort to help government agencies and people who live near
factories prepare for toxic catastrophes like explosions at
chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   The following are among the potential disasters that the
hypothetical summaries describe:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 90-ton rail car of chlorine at a chemical plant in Muscle
Shoals, Ala., ruptures and sends a toxic cloud 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Wilmington, N.C., the consequences of a major accident at a
sulfur products company are felt 25 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1-ton container of chlorine leaks at a water plant in
Bradenton, Fla., sending fumes into a nearby neighborhood and state
park.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's original intention was to
put the entire document online for the public to browse. But
Congress and President Clinton, presented with warnings by security
specialists that electronic dissemination of the information could
provide terrorists with a road map to sensitive domestic targets,
suspended release of the information last month for one year.
</P>
<P>
   But a right-to-know group has published state-by-state executive
summaries of the accident scenarios on its Web site, saying it
wanted to give the public some sense of the risks posed by the
sites as well as the information that the government chose not to
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the futility of trying to restrict public
information,'' said Rick Blum, a spokesman for OMB Watch, one of
the public interest groups that run the Internet site at
http://www.rtk.net.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this information age,'' Blum said, ``information is going
to be used. It will be copied and it will be redistributed. You
can't put the genie back in the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The summaries of the risk-management plans are not heavily
detailed and do not include estimates of how many people live
within reach of a plant-accident site _ a number that critics said
could be used by terrorists to rank targets by potential
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But the roughly 14,000 summaries do include brief descriptions
of the consequences of major events at sites _ usually described as
highly unlikely _ as well as more likely but less severe accident
scenarios, some based on actual past events.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of releasing the information say the compilation of
the summaries, which were not suppressed under the new law, could
show the public that the information was kept off the Internet more
to avoid embarrassing chemical companies than to impede terrorists.
They say that hundreds of accidents occur at plants each year,
although the FBI has acknowledged only a single thwarted act of
sabotage, against a chemical plant in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The summaries can be obtained from the EPA but are not as easily
accessible as the group has made them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping this information out of a national database has never
been a serious barrier to terrorists,'' said Paul Orum, the
Washington coordinator of the Working Group on Community
Right-to-Know. ``To actually combat terrorists, companies need to
improve site security, harden facilities, add fail-safe equipment
and, most fundamentally, reduce the hazard they knowingly bring to
a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Security officials who backed restricting the information said
that publishing it would turn the government into a clearinghouse
for information that could threaten national security.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Burnham, chief of the bureau's domestic-terrorism
section, told Congress in May that ``the FBI has consistently
maintained that the potential release of this worst-case-scenario
data in an uncontrolled manner would provide targeting tools and
new ideas for criminals and terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, in a bipartisan action, agreed to suspend release of
the information, and some expressed outrage that the EPA intended
to make the data easily accessible under the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who heads the Commerce Committee,
said in July that Congress ``never imagined'' that the information
collected from chemical companies under that law would become ``a
worldwide electronic database, easily searchable from Boston to
Baghdad, from Los Angeles to Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case-scenario information is exempt from the Freedom
of Information Act for one year to allow the administration to
devise a system for releasing the information while assessing ``the
increased risk of terrorist and other criminal activity''
associated with posting the information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides involved in drafting the legislation said
they were not overly alarmed by the availability of the summary
information on the Internet, noting that it was not as detailed as
the complete worst-case-scenario report.
</P>
<P>
   The text is often dense when describing the worst possible
disaster at a plant, and it emphasizes the precautions that sites
take in handling hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a worst-case scenario in which acetylene, ammonia
and three other toxic substances are released at a chemicals plant
in Gainesville, Fla., officials at the plant, Archimica Inc.,
emphasize in their summary that their ``prevention program ensures
that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any
risk of a release is minimized.'' The plant does acknowledge three
incidents in the last five years in which chemicals were released,
with off-site consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental advocacy groups hope to win more complete
disclosure in the future, noting that publication of annual
toxic-release audits by the EPA has led many companies to reduce
their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to help anyone create a problem,'' said Blum.
``It is going to help communities make themselves safer.''

A SIGNIFICANT SUMMER FOR FEMALE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NEIL AMDUR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two
years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players
walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a
questionnaire. Their objective: to determine tennis trends and, in
particular, whether spectators attending the U.S. Open would pay to
watch a tournament with only female players.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkably positive response of that informal survey by Ceci
Martinez and Esme Emanuel was a declaration of independence for
women's sports. And if Title IX became the bill of rights for
female athletes, this summer has emerged as the exclamation point
for any equal-rights amendment.
</P>
<P>
   From Women's World Cup soccer to U.S. Open tennis, from the
world track and field championships to the Pan-Pacific swimming
meet, the message has been unmistakably clear: Women can hold their
own on any stage, with or without men.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Weatherspoon's game-winning shot in the Women's National
Basketball Association finals last week was as mind-boggling and
riveting as was Jerry West's dramatic heave decades earlier. And
the Houston Comets' three-peat earned them a legacy alongside other
basketball dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   But the women have also stolen the show. Even minus Steffi
Graf's majestic presence and Anna Kournikova's photogenic tease,
Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay
Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and others have created enough
competitive subplots to justify an equal-pay mantra. Davenport's
bold backhand winner against Mary Pierce from match point down in
their compelling quarterfinal three-setter was the gutsy shot of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the women must play best-of-five sets to earn
singles parity at Grand Slam events (not so at the U.S. Open, which
is the only equal-opportunity employer) is as outmoded as trying to
equate the price of a Broadway show ticket to the length of a
performance. Substance always prevails over style (as Andre Agassi
has learned), even if you need personalities for box-office bait.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, only Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and a
handful of others understood what really mattered. Now the Williams
sisters have rewritten the rules of the road for junior tennis, and
Jong Song Ok's victory for North Korea in the women's marathon at
the world track championships may have opened yet another door into
a closed society just as Tegla Loroupe brought African women out of
obscurity with her New York City Marathon victories. Even Brandi
Chastain's celebrated stripdown at the Women's World Cup final will
be analyzed by the Associated Press Sports Editors in a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of
female athletes. ``We players were unhappy with the status quo,''
she said the other day by phone from her home in San Mateo, Calif.,
where she works in real estate. ``And like all reformers, we were
considered radical in our time, chided for our feminist views
simply because we wanted equal opportunity in all its
ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive results of that study, coupled with an early
sponsorship commitment from Philip Morris, gave women's tennis its
first financial cushion. Now sponsors are using today's pros and
even a former great, Althea Gibson, to sell themselves and this
year's Open.
</P>
<P>
   But the bright lights have also brought murkier, less romantic
overtones to women's sports. At the world track championships in
Spain, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a 39-year-old sprinter who had won
14 medals during a venerable career, was forced to withdraw from
the meet after traces of the banned steroid nandrolone were found
in one of her urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   And lost amid the flurry of world swim records set by South
African Penny Heyns at the Pan-Pacifics in Sydney's Olympic pool
was her disclosure that creatine was an integral part of her
training regimen. Although legal as a nutritional supplement,
creatine has been associated with bulking up male bodies for
football, baseball and the beach more than female swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,'' said
Heyns, who set an astonishing seven world records in her last 10
races. ``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on the
blocks during my career and know that I`ve trained and swum as hard
as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't do
the best I could in. I want to cover all the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   These words are a far cry from the days when pasta,
carbo-loading and electrolyte solutions were considered new-age
nutritional training tools. But Heyns' times will almost certainly
resonate around the world on the road to Sydney next September just
as many coaches have finally moved beyond East Germany's systematic
steroid scandal of the '70s. Free from current doping control
procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality
as the next battle ground for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Title IX has certainly helped,'' Martinez said, of what awaits
women, ``but looking beyond the sports arena, women are still
struggling to break through the glass ceiling in all facets of
life, especially in business, politics and the mass media.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ The crisis of June 29 cried out for a strong leader in
Miami's Cuban exile community.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard had stopped six Cubans aboard a small boat
within sight of land north of Miami Beach. When the Cubans refused
to turn back, the Coast Guard blasted the boat with a water cannon
and squirted the Cubans with pepper spray. All of it was caught by
the television news helicopters that hovered overhead. The six men
were detained, and some or all faced possible repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American leaders, in Miami and in Washington, faxed their
statements of outrage to news organizations and set to work,
through the proper channels, to demand apologies from federal
authorities and to try to free the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   While they seized the moment to send news releases and e-mails,
Ramon Saul Sanchez seized a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, leader of the Movimiento Democracia, one of many Miami
groups working for a free Cuba, walked into traffic on the
MacArthur Causeway and sat down. It was the start of a sit-in
involving hundreds of people that stopped traffic on the Miami
Beach causeway and, Sanchez said, forced federal officials to free
the men.
</P>
<P>
   It was not remarkable, experts on Miami's exile community said,
that a relatively unknown person like Sanchez would offer to lead.
What is remarkable is that, almost two years after the death of the
undisputed head of the Cuban exiles, Jorge Mas Canosa, a void in
leadership remains.
</P>
<P>
   Mas, as head of the powerful Cuban-American National Foundation
from 1981 until his death from lung cancer in 1997, would have been
the voice of outrage in such a crisis, and his outrage would have
registered in the Oval Office. Instead of staging a sit-in,
according to people who knew him, he would have called the
president, and gotten through.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuban-American sections of Miami, which is almost
everywhere in this city, people say there will never be another
Mas. That is, in part, because of the power and strong personality
of Mas, whose organization, with 50,000 members and 120 well-off,
well-connected directors and trustees, gave him a solid platform.
</P>
<P>
   And, some experts said, it is also because Miami's exile
community is much more diverse, swelling with people who were born
after Fidel Castro's revolution, and much harder to bring under one
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially missed among the Cuban-Americans who built
lives in Miami with Mas always in their peripheral vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the exile community has been able to fill that
void,'' said Dario Moreno, a professor of political science at
Florida International University and an expert on the exile
community.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious successor, Mas' American-born son, Jorge Mas
Santos, is seen by many as too young, at 36, and he has the
all-but-impossible job of living up to his father's legacy as
foundation chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is not to walk in my father's footsteps, but to extend
those footsteps,'' said Mas, who has found that operating the
family's huge communications company Mastec _ with $1 billion in
revenues in 1998 and about 10,000 employees _ is easier than
replacing his father in the minds and hearts of many exiles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While he has been warmly received here by crowds of exiles who
chant ``adelante'' _ Spanish for forward _ many will wait and see
if this Mas can hold their loyalty and protect their interests as
his father did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake to place all hopes on a single person,'' said
Jose J. Basulto, a pilot and president of Brothers to the Rescue,
Cuban-American pilots who search the Florida Straits for rafters.
``After Mas Canosa's death, we have become extremely vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Basulto, along with Mas and Sanchez, is often mentioned when
Cuban-Americans talk about new leaders in Miami. But in Little
Havana, at the takeout windows where people stop for tiny cups of
strong, sweet Cuban coffee, there is no replacing the elder Mas.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Rey, 62, of southwest Miami, pondered the question of a
successor as he watched friends click dominoes across a table.
``Nobody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the community will accept someone who just says,
`Cuba si, Castro no,''' said Rafael Penalver, a Cuban-American
lawyer and president of the San Carlos Institute, a Cuban heritage
center in Key West. Castro is still the hot-button issue, Penalver
said, but he must share space on the agenda with Social Security,
affirmative action and other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dream of a free and democratic Cuba is worn smooth around
the edges from use. For most of the past two decades, the man
holding the symbolic sword to Castro's head had been Jorge Mas
Canosa.
</P>
<P>
   He monopolized U.S. policy on Cuba by winning legislation like
the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which tightened the longstanding
embargo on the island, and warred on The Miami Herald because he
disagreed with its editorial stance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moreno and other experts on the community have argued that the
real leaders among Cuban-Americans, many of whom have never lived
in a free Cuba and come without the hatred of Castro, are elected
officials. They include Miami-Dade County's mayor, Alex Penelas,
and three Cuban-American members of Congress: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republicans from South Florida, and Robert
Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. And they, unlike Mas, are the
ones to whom more moderate Cuban-Americans will look for leadership
beyond the question of a free Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But they are hampered by their offices in time of crisis, as on
June 29. Penelas, political experts say, could not put his
responsibility for law and order aside and take part in civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, many exiles say, is a combination of a political
heavyweight and a trusted grass-roots leader, unencumbered by
office, selfish to one cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean there aren't prominent contenders _ there
are three,'' Moreno said, naming Jorge Mas Santos; Sanchez, an
office manager whose grass-roots organization operates from a code
of nonviolence; and Basulto, the respected 59-year-old pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they have all the elements needed to assume
leadership, but not as individuals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge Mas Santos, his son, has inherited the organization and
the money, but has yet to prove himself as a popular leader,''
Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, he said, ``has the charisma, that touch of pueblo.
Movimiento Democracia has a great deal of popular support because
of their policy of nonviolent protest. But Sanchez doesn't have the
coffers or the extensive organizational capacity of the foundation,
nor the fund-raising muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Basulto ``has put his life on the line in the anti-Castro
movement,'' Moreno said. ``There's nothing Cubans like better than
political martyrs for causes.'' But while Basulto has romance on
his side, he lacks financial and political clout.
</P>
<P>
   That aura of romance may be the greatest gap in the resume of
the younger Mas, who was born in this country. But, he responds,
``I was born as a Cuban exile.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, only the young Mas swings the big hammer that
money and influence have forged. In the Miami headquarters of
Mastec, he pauses beside a portrait of his father. The resemblance
is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he is afforded the respect of a visiting head
of state of a government in exile. At the recent presidential
inauguration in Panama, Mas and the foundation were given a section
of honor, right beside the Cuban one.
</P>
<P>
   His father, he said, taught him how to use that power. As
Sanchez sat on the hot asphalt in June, Mas Santos was on the phone
with the State Department. The next morning, when the six men
walked free from a federal detention center, he was at their side.
The foundation's influence, as much or more than any sit-in, had
won their freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is exploring how it can help restore democracy in
post-Castro Cuba. Meanwhile, he continues his father's hard stance
on the U.S. embargo and fights any warming of relations with
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always told me, `Your time will come,''' Mas said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, in a small office hung with pictures of Gandhi and
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Sanchez fights communism on a
shoestring budget. In this city where bombs are still regarded by
some as legitimate weapons against communism, he prefers hunger
strikes and symbolic gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was inconceivable that you would have to struggle
for something so dignifying as freedom with something so
destructive as war,'' said Sanchez, whose organization has no
membership roster and supports itself with donations of $1 or $5 a
person.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Sanchez supported more extreme actions, and in 1982 he was
subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in New York.
Prosecutors believed that Sanchez was a member of Omega 7, the
violent anti-Castro group that had claimed responsibility for
bombings in Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, while denying he was a member of Omega 7, refused to
answer questions. He was convicted of contempt of court, and served
four years in prison. There, he saw brutality and ``made the
decision that when I stepped out of prison, I would begin working
in nonviolent ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has planned and led several nonviolent
demonstrations. He planned the blocking of the Lincoln Tunnel in
1995 _ ``Clinton was sending rafters back to Cuba,'' he explained _
and various sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   He has been rammed by a Cuban gunboat, during a freedom flotilla
that encroached on Cuban waters in 1995, and had his boats
confiscated by U.S. officials who were afraid he would touch off a
war.
</P>
<P>
   Basulto still dreams the dream of many in his generation. In it,
the people rise up and restore democracy to Cuba. For now, his
planes search the Florida Straits, dropping food and water to
rafters. He is not looking for power, he said: ``The power we are
looking for is that in each person in Cuba,'' for the people of
Cuba to make their own change.  &QL;

   MENDOZA, Argentina _ The campaign stop had much potential for
pizazz: the inauguration of a glassy shopping mall complete with
brass band, fashion show and mountains of caviar and champagne. But
as Domingo Cavallo climbed to the stage, his smile was a tad too
broad, his wave a tad too perky and long.
</P>
<P>
   If economics is the dismal science, then Cavallo, the former
economy minister credited with whipping Argentina's hyperinflation
in the early 1990s, is the dismal third-party candidate in the
presidential election next month.
</P>
<P>
   Between shaking hands and lecturing reporters on the benefits of
deregulation and tax cuts, the double-chinned and balding candidate
toured a stereo store and posed for photographers with headphones
on his head. It was an obvious appeal for the youth vote, but the
prop made him look neither hip nor presidential, an impression
reinforced when he ambled over to a fire-red Corvette and other
model cars on display for more shots.
</P>
<P>
   With neither money for television commercials nor a party
machine to get out the vote, Cavallo will almost certainly run a
distant third on Oct. 24 behind the Buenos Aires governor, Eduardo
Duhalde, of the ruling Justicialist Party, and the Buenos Aires
mayor, Fernando de la Rua, of the opposition Alianza coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But Cavallo will probably have long enough coattails to elect a
substantial congressional delegation for his small conservative
party, Action for the Republic. There is an outside chance he could
throw the election into a second round, and that might give him
decisive bargaining power over future economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo scores a bit below 10 percent in the presidential
preference polls, but most analysts see that as an achievement
given the dismal failures of past third-party campaigns in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else his long shot at the presidency achieves, Cavallo
is breaking the mold of populist Argentine politicians like Juan
and Eva Peron and the last two presidents, Raul Alfonsin and Carlos
Saul Menem. Cavallo says that any reasonable showing will create
space for a new kind of politics in Argentina and make him an even
more credible candidate in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two traditional parties are personality, sentimental
parties,'' Cavallo, who is 53, said in an interview. ``Argentines
traditionally have looked for the most sensitive and most
affectionate candidate, not for the best to govern. But every day
the people are thinking more carefully about their vote and my
candidacy is reinforcing that process.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which the two leading candidates offer a lot of
vague promises, Cavallo issues detailed position papers on
restructuring pensions and health insurance and decentralizing
control over the nation's education system. Though his true love is
talking economics, he appears to be most effective when he
discusses the darker side of Argentine society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organized crime is powerful in Argentina,'' Cavallo said on a
local television talk show. ``It has infiltrated the courts, all
levels in government, in the police and in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a three-year string of suicides of people
suspected of being either witnesses to or actors in a variety of
scandals involving the Menem administration was more than a
coincidence. And he even lent credence to charges by Zulema Menem,
the former first lady, that the helicopter crash in which her son
Carlos Menem Jr. was killed four years ago was murder, not an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But Cavallo's powerful indictment on the talk show got watered
down by repeated returns to his pet subject: the ins and outs of
monetary and fiscal policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At one point, Cavallo drove the chatty television interviewer to
exasperation by refusing to let him take a break for an
advertisement before he completed a professorial critique of
International Monetary Fund policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, Cavallo's speeches are little lectures on ways to
bring down interest rates, increase productivity and strengthen
investor confidence. His idea of a snappy sound bite is a 10-minute
theory on how to reduce production costs to generate employment.
His campaign pamphlets are full of graphs, numbers and academic
jargon explaining the ``supply-side shock'' that he proposes to
lift Argentina out of its deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign slogan is characteristically uncatchy: ``Cavallo
has a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fullness of his oratory, and the sparsity of his
campaign resources, Cavallo is receiving significant news-media
attention, in large part because he is widely recognized as the
most important Cabinet member of the early years of Menem's two
five-year terms as president.
</P>
<P>
   As Menem's first foreign minister, Cavallo restored diplomatic
ties with Britain for the first time since the 1982 Falkland war.
Then, as economy minister, he engineered the so-called
convertibility plan, which pegged the value of the peso to the
dollar _ a policy that made him a hero on Wall Street and the most
acclaimed economist in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to resign in 1996, though, after making a speech
before the Congress describing an expanding web of organized crime
with links to the highest levels of the Argentine government.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Argentines, Cavallo is like a doctor,'' said Joaquin
Morales Sola, a columnist for the newspaper La Nacion. ``You don't
have to like him, but you go to him for a cure when you are sick.''

A NEW GERMAN ASSERTIVENESS ON ITS FOREIGN POLICY STANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story was originally slugged GERMANY-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Marking a clear break with the caution of German
foreign policy since World War II, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has
laid out a new vision of his country's international role,
describing Germany as ``a great power in Europe'' that will not
hesitate to pursue its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition of German foreign policy, spelled out by
Schroeder in an article in the last edition of the monthly review
of German unions, appears to signal the formal end of Germany's
self-imposed reserve since 1945 even as it underscores the
country's irreversible attachment to NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany,'' Schroeder says, ``has every interest in considering
itself as a great power in Europe _ something our neighbors have
done for a long time _ and to orient its foreign policy accordingly
within the framework of Euro-Atlantic institutions.'' This policy,
he adds, must be one of ``fully acknowledged self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, and other postwar
chancellors, any reference to Germany as ``a great power'' or to
national ``self-interest'' tended to be studiously avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Germany liked to portray its interests as being
synonymous with those of European integration and the NATO alliance
out of a generally unspoken fear that any other policy would be
regarded as incipient nationalism or a sign that an ugly history
was rearing its head once more.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival in power of a postwar generation led by
Schroeder, and the government move from Bonn to Berlin, have
signaled a distinct shift whose full scope the chancellor has now
articulated.
</P>
<P>
   NATO used to be an organization ``that served to protect
Germany, but also as protection against Germany,'' the chancellor
writes, adding that this concept ``has no value from now on.'' In
its place, he suggests, a Germany without complexes has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the term ``great power'' is generally associated with
a country possessing nuclear weapons _ not the case in Germany. But
Germany's prominent military role as part of a NATO force that
bombed Kosovo signaled an end to the often repeated postwar
principle that ``only peace'' would ``go out from German soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions on European politics appear likely to be
marked, not least on the French-German alliance, the relationship
long at the heart of European integration and one based on a now
exhausted marriage of interests.
</P>
<P>
   As a power under Western tutelage, Germany could look to France
for political muscle, while France relied on Germany to provide the
economic dynamism it lacked. But now Germany has declared its
intention to wield political power commensurate with its economy,
which is one-third larger than the French, while France has fewer
complexes about its fast-changing economy than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``France used to be proud of its historical essence and worried
by its performance, while Germany was proud of its performance but
ashamed of its history,'' said Dominique Moisi, a French foreign
policy expert. ``An alliance on that basis made sense, but now
everything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Schroeder's shift on Germany's relationship with
the United States appears likely to be less strong so long as
Germany's new commitment to ``national interests'' does not involve
deviation from NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schroeder, whose push to wean Germany from Kohl's relentless and
painful history lessons has been generally popular, makes no overt
reference to Hitler or the Nazis in the article and outlines what
he sees as the future of a large European power that has paid its
historical dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partners have shown us that they accept us as equals, and
that is the reason why they now expect us to accept and perceive
our historic responsibility in an offensive way,'' he writes. As an
example of this ``offensive'' responsibility, he cites Germany's
role in stopping killing and ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Germany flew numerous sorties during the NATO bombardment of
Kosovo and has deployed over 3,000 soldiers to the Prizren area as
part of the peacekeeping force there. This role reflects Germany's
new status, Schroeder writes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shift in Germany's policy and self-image is clear,
the chancellor repeatedly alludes to the importance of continuity,
saying that Germany's ``anchoring'' in NATO and the European Union
is irreversible and that its foreign policy will remain ``in
Europe, for Europe and of Europe.''

A SURVIVOR HELPS TRACK FRENCH DEBT OF WARTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Adolphe Steg, a veteran of the World War II Resistance
who later became a famous surgeon, has treated presidents and
received high French civilian honors. But that, he says, is not who
he really is deep down inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also the little boy in the stetl that I left at the age
of 7, studying the Talmud and rolling my peyes with my fingers,
before all that turned into a nightmare,'' he said in his
fourth-floor apartment, on the Quai d'Orsay down the Seine from the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish village where he was born 74 years ago, Nizhny
Verecky, now Ukrainian territory, did not survive the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Steg, his parents, and his two sisters, living in France when
deportations began under the German occupation, did survive, in the
wiggle room between the collaborationist Vichy regime's willing
persecution of French Jews and the compassion of ordinary French
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Steg and a French historian, Claire Andrieu, will try this
week to explain, to American officials who are eager to see all of
Europe try to make up for what it let the Nazis do half a century
ago, that France will not flinch from a full and final accounting
for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Steg is the deputy chairman and Mrs. Andrieu is a member of a
blue-ribbon panel set up by the French government in 1997 to
establish the facts about the looting of bank accounts, insurance
policies, art works and other property from Jews in France during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, whose chairman is Jean Matteoli, a decorated
Resistance leader, plans to publish findings this year and make
recommendations on restoring what still remains in the wrong hands
to the rightful owners or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The two will appear before the House Banking and Financial
Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday, and will meet two days
later in New York with the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi.
</P>
<P>
   While organizations representing Holocaust survivors have
pressed Swiss banks for over $2 billion in compensation for
Switzerland's wartime handling of gold that the Nazis seized from
Jews, Jewish groups in France have been less vocal, preferring to
put their trust in the integrity of the Matteoli Commission rather
than use moral suasion on French financial and insurance
institutions to make them contribute to international funds for the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Steg would not say exactly how much money belonging to Jews he
and his colleagues had found moldering in French bank vaults,
safety deposit boxes and insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have an approximate sum at the end of the year, but that
doesn't mean that this will be the totality of what is owed to
survivors,'' he said. ``There's a moral debt as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced last year that a fund
would be created with assets for which no surviving claimants could
be found, leaving the commission to decide what to do with the
money. ``The banks have agreed to make a significant
contribution,'' Steg said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel had found, he said, that at least 75 percent of all
property seized from Jews in France during the war had been
returned after the Liberation. But it also found the equivalent of
nearly $1.6 million, seized from the 75,721 Jews whom French
authorities sent to Auschwitz from camps in the German-occupied
zone between 1941 and 1944, still in a state bank, the Caisse des
depots et consignations. Only 2,564 of the deported Jews survived
to return.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Steg's father, Martin, who had come to France
from Czechoslovakia in the 1930s but was sent to Auschwitz in 1942.
He came back to France at war's end and later went to live in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty sturdy,'' said Steg, who was with his mother and
his two sisters in Paris on July 15, 1942, when a friend tipped him
off that the police were planning a mass arrest of Jews the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, wearing the star, and 16 years old, and what
could I do?'' he said. ``I went to the concierge of our building,
and the concierge hid us in a vacant apartment. You see, right
there, there's the mixture, which was typical of the whole period,
of cruel efficiency on the part of the Vichy police on the one
hand, and an immense effort of solidarity by the people on the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck followed him and a sister as far as Lyons, where the
French police arrested them for trying to escape into the
unoccupied zone by using false identity papers. They were freed by
a French court three months later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later sent to a French shelter for deported German Jews by a
group called Christian Friendships, he became its deputy director,
he said, because he was the only one of the refugees who could
speak French without an accent. That led him to the Resistance, and
activities for which he was later arrested and tortured by the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   But that, he says, waving away requests for details, is another
story.

 &HT;    Uplifting all kinds of folk
 &HT;    By Candice Dyer

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASSTOWN, N.C. _ Cooking classes at the John C. Campbell Folk
School in the early part of the century relied as much on a globe
as on pots and pans. The Yankee teacher, wanting to give her
mountain students a glimpse of the world beyond the peaks of
southern Appalachia, pointed to far-flung continents to show the
origins of herbs and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folk school was started by outsiders as a way to civilize
mountain people,'' says Jan Davidson, the school's executive
director. ``Today, mountain people run the school to civilize
outsiders from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The John C. Campbell Folk School began in 1925 in Brasstown as a
mission project to educate and assimilate poverty-stricken
highlanders. It now teaches native arts and crafts to a variety of
students _ some professional artists, others yuppie outsiders and
nostalgic retirees intent on beating back urban malaise with a
lathe or a needle. Ironically, today's folk school students
desperately want to flee the city for the backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an insurance claims adjuster, so I come here for my
soul,'' says Lynne Lockie of Hixson, Tenn., as she contentedly
weaves an egg basket.
</P>
<P>
   One of the quaintest-sounding, and most popular, programs is
blacksmithing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best blacksmiths in the country teaching here and
taking classes,'' says Tim Ryan, the resident gardener, nature
studies teacher and board member of the school. He has taken so
many blacksmithing classes at Campbell that he recently started
teaching it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some who take it are artists,'' Ryan says, ``some are
re-enactors or people who work in living-history museums, but most
of them get into it for the same reason I did: nostalgia for a
simpler time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Dolson, a swimming instructor who lives in Helen, Ga., said
she signed up for blacksmithing because her grandfather made a
living by bending hot metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to connect somehow with my grandfather,'' she says.
``I found out you get hot, filthy and sweaty, and you make a lot of
noise. And you have the best time of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In her class, she made a hook, a garden hanger, a letter opener
and something she euphemistically calls an ``abstract conversation
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The leafy campus feels like a homespun bohemia, on the Left Bank
of the Hiawassee River instead of the Seine. The farmhouse
dormitories have no telephones. Students learn at their own pace in
small classes with no grades or certification. After a few days of
eating communal meals to mandolin music and savoring the life of a
cracker-barrel dilettante, at least 60 percent of the students sign
up for repeat visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is creative, productive leisure of a high order that
draws on the whole person: senses, intellect and spirit,'' Davidson
says.
</P>
<P>
   So how did anthropological first aid for farmers evolve into
therapy for the computer-addled mainstream?
</P>
<P>
   To Davidson, the folk school's student-becomes-teacher dialectic
interlaces as logically as any pattern on a loom, and his personal
history forms many of the threads. He grew up in nearby Murphy, and
his family was among the residents who, in an enthusiastic
proclamation, offered ``land, labor and folks'' to the idealistic
New Englanders scouting southern Appalachia for a school site.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Campbell and his wife, Olive Dame Campbell, had studied
the area around the turn of the century when it was viewed as a
barbaric ``mission field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The founders had a sincere desire to educate a region that was
believed to have no culture of its own,'' says Ryan. ``But after
they visited people here, it became obvious to them that mountain
people, while living in the simplest of homes, had handmade quilts,
baskets and clothes that were exquisitely crafted. These people led
simple lives and poor lives, but not crude lives. In fact, because
they were so uncorrupted by industrial civilization, they were the
great preservers of a very rich culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Campbells decided that the Danish folk school system, based
on noncompetitive ``learning by doing'' and plenty of interaction _
so different from the traditional rote memorization model _ could
educate mountain residents without condescending to them. Campbell
died before his plans were realized, but his widow and her friend
Marguerite Butler established the school with the motto ``I Sing
Behind the Plow,'' the title of a Danish poem.
</P>
<P>
   The original curriculum focused on farming techniques and food
preparation. With a dairy, cannery and credit union, the school
quickly became the center of the community, and the teachers used
their agrarian resources for lessons in science, geography and
history whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was bring the world to Brasstown,'' says Clay
Logan, a folk school board member whose first job was milking cows
at the dairy. ``They introduced us to all kinds of knowledge we
wouldn't have had otherwise. And we taught them things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson explains, ``The teachers used genealogy to teach
history, and Olive Campbell would point to the stars and tell the
farmers about Greek, Roman and Norse mythology behind the
constellations. Then the farmers would tell her about planting by
the signs.''
</P>
<P>
   The school began to incorporate the arts into its curriculum
after Olive Campbell noticed some men whittling on a ``loafers'
bench'' at a general store. Irritated by what she deemed idleness,
she instructed them to carve figurines and sell them through the
school to add to their families' incomes. (Regional artisans still
sell their carved wooden figures at the school's store.) Soon, the
school was known as much for its crafts, music and folk dancing as
for its farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny that her New England work ethic took a dim view of
that act of mountain meditation, which is the very thing that draws
people today,'' Davidson says.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls visiting the school as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking that the pottery and Danish folk dancing
were a lot more fun and creative than (my school),'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In such an atmosphere, Davidson soon had an epiphany about
heritage that sums up the spirit of the folk school today. After
listening to his grandmother sing a ballad about the hanging of
``Charlie McGraw,'' Davidson, then in junior high school, looked up
the lyrics in a folklore book. He discovered that the song
originally told the story of Charles Guiteau, who assassinated
President James Garfield in 1881. Davidson visualized his
grandmother's forebears warbling ``Guiteau'' into ``McGraw,'' a
Scots-Irish name they more easily recognized, and he suddenly felt
the sweep of history. The past can be progressive, he decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I realized there was something special
here,'' recalls Davidson, now 51 and wearing a mountaineer's beard.
``The way the ballad evolved was a revelation to me that there are
two main qualities of folklore. One is that it's very old. The
other is that it can be changed and adapted.''
</P>
<P>
   The folk school demonstrated its ability to change after World
War II, when the economy shifted away from agriculture. By 1970,
the school had closed its cannery, dairy and farm programs to focus
on arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what was kindly known as the `homesteading' or `back to
the land' phase of the folk school began,'' gardener Ryan says.
``The folk school was kind of a hippie place, the way so many
things were back then, and it was a time of struggle because some
of the local Baptists didn't approve of what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Davidson, a musician and college student, took
classes and played in concerts at the folk school. From the
bandstand one Saturday night, he spotted a weaving student named
Nanette, and they soon were married under the school's pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, like many sons and daughters of the region, loved the
family farm but itched to leave it for the globe used in those
early cooking classes. After earning a master's degree in English
with a minor in folklore from the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, he studied literature at the University of Edinburgh
in Scotland, and later earned a Ph.D. in folklore, history and
museum studies from Boston University. ``I spent the first 18 years
of my life trying to get out of Cherokee County, and the next 18
trying to get back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He became director of the folk school six years ago, when it was
getting about 2,500 students a year and faced a financial crisis.
It usually closed during the winter, and employees occasionally
worked without being paid.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school bursts at its hand-stitched seams with 4,000
students taking 700 classes 49 weeks a year. The campus has just
added a historical museum, and a sprawling farmhouse-style building
is under construction. The new building will hold a kitchen area
with open-hearth stoves and studios for dance, fiber arts and
music. And employees now get pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were shaky for the school when he took over, and now
it's solvent, almost completely self-supporting and growing,'' Ryan
says.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is usually attributed to Davidson's homeboy
understanding of the region and the force of his charisma. A
musician and amiable wit, he spins yarns and strolls the campus
playing songs on his groundhog-skin banjo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely necessary to have roots here to preserve an
institution like this one,'' says board member Logan. ``You can't
keep alive that special feeling if you don't have it deep down in
your soul. You have to know how hard the times were here. You have
to have lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballad of ``Charlie McGraw,'' with its lesson of adapting
the old, continues to affect Davidson. At the moment the school
lacks a plow to sing behind, as its motto calls for, but he is
reinstating a gardening curriculum and cooking program. Students
once again can learn how to rotate crops and bake bread over an
open hearth. They also can study aromatherapy and Thai curries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people confuse what we do with history, but change is
at the crux of folklore,'' declares David Brose, the school's
official archivist. ``Folklore is a living, breathing, undulating
thing that enables us to draw from the past and move into the
future. We really love what happened in the last century, but we
also love what will happen in the next one.''

 &HT;    Some fear restart of La. waste incinerator
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA, La. _ Gardeners tend to savor a good rain, but Nguyen
Bui used to worry when clouds gathered. Raindrops seemed to carry
the noxious chemicals spewed by the Marine Shale Processors
incinerator a couple of miles away, and his lush garden would
suffer. His flowers, which he gave weekly to the Catholic church
across the street, would wilt or die.
</P>
<P>
   Bui, 94, said he suffered as well when the incinerator was
burning waste. He'd get headaches and feel dizzy or listless, he
said. So would some of his neighbors, who, like him, came to
America as Vietnam War refugees; Amelia, population 2,700, is
almost half Vietnamese, the largest percentage of any town in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, they coughed and wheezed as thick, black smoke
belched from the incinerator's stack. When the putrid smell of
burning plastic got too intense, they closed their windows, turned
off their air conditioners and avoided driving past the plant on
old U.S. 90.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles west in Morgan City, five children contracted a rare
and fatal form of brain cancer in one year, 1987. Neuroblastoma has
been linked to exposure to toxins, but studies did not link the
Morgan City cluster directly to emissions from Marine Shale. But
the families feel certain the incinerator poisoned their babies.
Lawsuits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, federal and state agencies won a protracted court
battle and shut down Marine Shale for violating hundreds of
hazardous waste rules. Marine Shale agreed to pay more than $10
million in penalties. Bui's garden began to flourish, and he
stopped worrying about his grandchildren, who attended the
elementary school a mile from the plant. Six residents who fought
Marine Shale for almost a decade received cash rewards from the
Environmental Protection Agency for their vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for some residents of Amelia, the unthinkable happened. In
February of this year, with the EPA's blessing, the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality gave the incinerator a permit
to reopen. The facility, renamed GTX but still about 48 percent
owned by Marine Shale, will be able to handle 400,000 tons of waste
a year, making it the largest hazardous waste incinerator in the
world. At full capacity, it could burn more than half the nation's
hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   While some residents are not opposed to the plant, and many more
welcome the large number of jobs it would bring, opponents have
gone to state court to fight the permit, claiming that the LDEQ
violated its own rules when it gave the incinerator permission to
reopen. A decision is expected this month.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 Vietnamese families didn't wait for the ruling. Upon
hearing the incinerator might reopen, they simply left town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't trust the government when they say it's safe,''
said the Rev. Francis Bui (no relation to Nguyen Bui), the parish
priest for Vietnamese Catholics in the area. The Rev. Bui, 40, a
small, soft-spoken man who escaped Vietnam in 1979 in a rickety
boat, notes the irony that these families came here under the
protection of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they reopen, they will indirectly destroy the Vietnamese
community here,'' the Rev. Bui said. ``More families will leave.
Why does it have to be so close to a residential place? We are
human beings, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A `white knight'?
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator's new majority owner, Kevin Moody, did not
return phone calls, but he was quoted last year in the Baton Rouge
Advocate as saying he wants GTX to be the ``white knight'' that
cleans up the 350,000 tons of hazardous waste left when Marine
Shale closed. In a consent decree reached with the EPA to settle
its lawsuit, Marine Shale and GTX agreed to clean up the waste
within several years _ if they could upgrade and reopen.
</P>
<P>
   GTX General Manager Tom Fancett said the company is spending $60
million to upgrade the site and turn it into a first-class,
clean-burning facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plant will be safe,'' he said during a tour. ``A truck
driving down the highway will have more emissions than this
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including several city and parish governments, say
the permit was granted for political reasons. Moody and Marine
Shale owner Jack Kent have strong ties to Gov. Mike Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's brother, Pres, was on the St. Mary's Parish Police Jury
_ which functions like a county commission _ when Marine Shale was
given approval to open in 1984. Foster's son, Murphy, was Marine
Shale's attorney during the years of battling the EPA and the LDEQ
in court. Kent spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative
ads against former Gov. Buddy Roemer, who made cleaning up the
environment a priority. Those ads helped Foster defeat Roemer in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator is in Foster's home parish. Foster pushed so
hard to have the road that runs through the parish upgraded to
interstate quality that his transportation director resigned last
fall in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has close ties to the Moody family as well. The
Moodys have a large string of businesses that include oil, gas,
fast food chains, newspapers and the Evangeline Downs racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's connections to Moody and Kent have nothing to do with
his outspoken support for the incinerator, the governor said
through his spokesman, Terry Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   ``His connections (to the owners) are legitimate points for
discussion, but the governor has said all along to the LDEQ that if
there is a scientific reason not to grant a permit, then don't do
it,'' Ryder said. ``Otherwise, proceed as you would with any other
application. There is no question that the way Jack Kent operated
initially pushed the envelope, but the agencies have made their
point. There is a lot of investment down there and a lot of people
who depend on that plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent would not be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Owner beat bribery charges
</P>
<P>
   When Marine Shale was granted a permit in 1984, Kent claimed it
was a recycler, not an incinerator. He had a patent to create a
supposedly harmless aggregate out of hazardous waste by burning it
and then ``vitrifying'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Vitrification cooks the burned waste, a gravelly substance, at
such high temperatures that the resulting material is a shiny,
black, glasslike substance that locks in dangerous metals. Since
the aggregate is nonhazardous, Kent said, it could be sold and used
as road fill. Kent said vitrification would revolutionize the waste
disposal industry. His is still the only commercial incinerator in
the country to have used vitrification, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   But when residents began to complain about noxious odors,
sickness and black smoke billowing from the incinerator's stack,
the LDEQ and EPA took a closer look. Regulators called Marine
Shale's recycling status a ``sham'' cooked up to avoid the costly
and complicated restrictions on incinerators. After taking Marine
Shale to court to force it to conduct environmental tests, the LDEQ
found that air, water, soil and fish in the area were contaminated
with high levels of toxins. Waste was lying underwater in the Bayou
Boeuf, a busy waterway abutting one side of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   When the EPA tested the black aggregate, it found that it could
leach out dangerous lead if heated to certain temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Kent had a lot riding on Marine Shale _ it was listed as one of
Inc. Magazine's fastest-growing companies two years in a row _ and
he fought every attempt the agencies made to regulate the facility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kent was indicted along with two others for trying to
give a federal judge a $2 million bribe for favorable rulings in
the EPA lawsuit. Kent was acquitted, but his alleged
co-conspirators were convicted. Later, another judge said Kent had
a ``virtual contempt for the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 consent decree settling EPA's lawsuit against Marine
Shale bars Kent from having a majority stake in the company and
from participating in the day-to-day operations of the facility. It
even says he can't have an office ``inside the fence'' of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   One building has been left outside the fence. Fancett said he
didn't know if Kent would have an office there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives in Wyoming and he has millions of dollars,'' Fancett
said. ``Why would he want to be here?''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs welcome in community
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents are against the incinerator. Fancett says the
opponents are a ``small, vocal minority.'' He says GTX did a survey
that shows 70 percent of nearby residents are in favor of GTX.
</P>
<P>
   When GTX held a job fair, people lined up for two days to apply
for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Russo, principal of nearby J.S. Aucoin Elementary School,
says she is ``comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've invested millions and they seem to have done their
homework,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fancett said people have nothing to worry about. About $10
million will be spent on state-of-the-art air filtration alone. The
main building will be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Temblet, the LDEQ chief under Roemer, said he has looked
into the new facility and thinks it is the same basic technology as
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may operate it a little cleaner and let's hope they do,''
said Temblet, now a professor of environmental studies at Louisiana
State University. ``The question is, why would Louisiana want such
a thing? We have private incinerators at the individual plants.
There's not enough demand for an incinerator here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are 25 hazardous waste incinerators, three of
which aren't operating, according to the EPA. That number is down
from several years ago because there has been a reduction in
hazardous waste in the United States, said EPA spokesman Dave Bary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has driven the demand for capacity down,'' Bary said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Temblet said, Louisiana is already by far the worst
polluter in the nation, per capita. Becoming the nation's hazardous
waste epicenter won't help the state's dismal environmental
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   State waived buffer requirement
</P>
<P>
   The appeal filed by the incinerator's opponents centers on flaws
in the permit process. The LDEQ's own rules require a hazardous
waste facility to have a 200-foot ``buffer zone'' surrounding it,
in case of accidents. But the GTX/Marine Shale facility looms over
Bayou Boeuf, which is used by thousands of commercial and
recreational fishing boats as well as industrial boats.
</P>
<P>
   The LDEQ said in its brief to the state court that the safety
measures inherent in the design of the facility eliminate the need
for the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, meanwhile, point out that an EPA risk assessment of
the facility projected an elevated risk of cancers associated with
airborne vinyl chloride escaping from the plant. The LDEQ countered
that the EPA, while noting this risk, did not recommend denying a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this question remains: Why is the EPA allowing the state
to permit a site it spent several years and millions of dollars
shutting down?
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say it's because the EPA would have had to force
Marine Shale to clean up the waste at the site if it hadn't agreed
to the consent decree. That would have meant more costly court
battles.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA counters that it has no authority over granting permits
in states where the local environmental agency _ in this case the
LDEQ _ has been given permitting power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their job and their call,'' said Ruben Casso, an engineer
with the EPA's hazardous waste permitting branch.
</P>
<P>
   A `genius' feels frustrated
</P>
<P>
   Many residents feel, quite simply, invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vietnamese community remained silent during the
battle against Marine Shale _ many can't speak English _ they are
beginning to raise their voices. They are a party to the permit
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Subra, who owns a chemistry lab and an environmental
consulting firm in nearby New Iberia, has been working against the
incinerator from the beginning. She won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius grant'' in June, in part for her contribution to shutting
down Marine Shale. She grew up in Morgan City and still has family
there. She spent hundreds of hours this summer poring over
government documents and poking holes in the LDEQ's permitting
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating,'' she said. ``But somebody has to work
for the citizens.

 &HT;    Atlanta bid team wooed Olympic voters' children, too
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Raj Ruhee of Mauritius arrived in Atlanta to
enroll at Georgia Tech for the 1990 fall term, he settled into
convenient digs at City View Apartments. The first five months'
rent already was paid. His apartment was filled with furniture
leased from Aaron Rents.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements, including Ruhee's admission to Tech, were
handled by the Atlanta Olympic bid team.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they care about the higher education of a young man
from an island republic in the Indian Ocean? Because his father,
Ram Ruhee, was one of 86 International Olympic Committee members
who were voting whether to award the 1996 Centennial Summer Games
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released documents that detail the city's bid efforts show
that perks were not limited to IOC voters but were extended to
their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not suggest that Atlanta bidders went to the
extremes of their counterparts in Salt Lake City, whose excesses in
winning the 2002 Winter Games led to the ouster of 10 IOC members.
But they do illustrate a pattern of favors for IOC families that
the Salt Lake team may have adopted and taken to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   As for Raj Ruhee, records show that he was presented a list of
expenses accumulated by the Atlanta group, but nothing in the three
dozen boxes made available to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says
whether he paid reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the bid group's efforts, the young man stayed one
semester, dropped out and returned to Mauritius. The vote on Sept.
18 that won the Games for Atlanta was by secret ballot, so it is
not known if Ram Ruhee returned the favor by siding with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the hearts and votes of IOC members by lavishing
benefits and attention on their children appeared to be at the core
of Atlanta's strategy. It included college assistance, job
opportunities and first-class airplane trips to the city _ with
side excursions to New York City and Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Although Atlanta Organizing Committee heads Billy Payne and
Andrew Young stated in a report to Congress on June 1 that they
only accommodated ``minor children'' traveling with their IOC
parent, records indicate they often invited the adult children to
join their parents in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   They also encouraged the children to make their own
all-expenses-paid visits to the city and other locales. IOC rules
allowed one trip for two people to a candidate city. Documents
indicate that the Atlanta committee violated that rule dozens of
times. Many IOC members made several visits, often bringing spouses
and children along. The first-class tickets cost as much as $7,000
apiece. The report to Congress omitted entirely some celebratory
visits made by many IOC members immediately following Atlanta's
victory in Tokyo. Payne and Young said in the report that the
additional visits were ``appropriate.'' In fact, they urged IOC
members to visit more than once, even though it was against the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haggman of Finland visited with her husband and two young
children in November 1989. Payne fired off a letter telling her how
much the AOC enjoyed their presence and said he looked forward to
the family's return ``in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne wrote that he would be ``delighted to make all your
arrangements including a visit to Disney World as a guest of one of
the members of the organizing committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggman was forced to resign from the IOC as a result of the
Salt Lake bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of discrepancies found by congressional investigators in
the original report and documents found in boxes of materials on
the Atlanta bid, the AOC's lawyers, led by former U.S. Attorney
General Griffin Bell, are rewriting the account.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to investigators are correspondence and
memoranda detailing offers of college assistance to the relatives
of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals to Atlanta, Salt Lake
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships formed the core of Salt Lake City's strategy to
secure votes in its scandal-ridden campaign. While the Atlanta bid
team may have used its influence with local universities to bypass
standard admission procedures, the Salt Lake team actually wrote
the checks.
</P>
<P>
   IOC member Lamine Keita of Mali appealed to both U.S. candidate
cities to educate his youngsters. He approached Young, the Atlanta
bid chairman, in 1990 about scholarship opportunities at
Atlanta-area universities for his daughter, who was just finishing
her secondary education. Young's aide, Elizabeth Clement, wrote in
a July 1990 memo that she suggested Spelman College and that
another bid team member, Linda Stephenson, suggested Agnes Scott
and Oglethorpe. ``Linda will make some calls to get this ball
rolling,'' Clement wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The documents reviewed by this newspaper did not show whether
Keita's daughter attended college in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Keita sought help from Young to get his son,
Moriba, into Howard University in Washington, D.C. Young again
asked Clement to follow up. She reported in a March 1993 memo that
Howard officials told her Moriba would not qualify for a
scholarship until he had permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Keita turned to Salt Lake City, then in the midst of
its bid. There he found a money tree. Before Moriba graduated from
Howard, Salt Lake City bidders had spent close to $100,000 on his
tuition and other benefits. But Keita paid a price for the benefits
_ he was expelled from the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The documents don't paint a complete picture. While many offers
of help were found, the trail goes cold when trying to determine
whether the students were admitted to colleges and who paid the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other documents confirm that bid team member Bobby Rearden told
Pal Schmitt of Hungary, a member of the IOC evaluation team that
ranked the 1996 candidate cities before the final vote in Tokyo,
that he could obtain a tennis scholarship for his daughter at the
University of Georgia. A memo from Rearden said, ``He clearly wants
his daughter to come to the U.S. to college. ... I told him we had
a scholarship for her at the University of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rearden invited Petra Schmitt to travel to Atlanta. ``The
purpose of the visit would be to look at schools to see if she
likes them,'' Rearden wrote in his memo. ``(Schmitt) said it would
be great if Petra is in school in Georgia and Atlanta gets the
Games because I could visit her often.''
</P>
<P>
   Petra instead enrolled at the University of Southern California
in 1992 and was a two-time All-America player on the tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   While documents verify that the IOC members were not shy in
asking for special treatment, they also show that the Atlanta bid
team proffered countless unsolicited favors, not all of which were
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   When the late Mohammed Benjelloun of Morocco visited with his
wife and son in June 1990, the family took a side trip to New York
and stayed two nights in a $469-a-night suite booked by the AOC at
the Marriott Marquis on Times Square. A memo from one bid team
member fretted, ``He wants to pay for it. We will offer again.''
</P>
<P>
   `Good wrestling opportunity'
</P>
<P>
   Payne and his aides were avid researchers, compiling profiles of
the members and developing individual strategies to woo each one.
If their information-gathering found a college-age teen-ager or
job-seeking relative, they were quick to play the benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Rearden wrote in a memo to Payne in July 1990 that he recently
had dined with Germany's Walther Troger and noted the IOC member
was inclined to vote for Melbourne, a rival candidate city. But
there was still hope. During the dinner, Troger mentioned he had a
daughter who was getting a divorce in California ``and might like a
teaching job in the Atlanta area.''
</P>
<P>
   After Troger's daughter apparently was offered Atlanta's
assistance, which was turned down, Payne wrote a letter two weeks
later that practically insisted the bid team be allowed to help
find her a job. ``I know your daughter is reluctant for any help
with universities in our area, but I hope you will emphasize to her
that what we want to do is invite her to visit us and see some of
the institutions and get information for her as she deems
appropriate,'' he wrote. ``We certainly do not want to interfere
with the process, but we would like to help if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Often Payne was successful. At his behest, George Gillett Jr.,
chairman of Vail Associates, apparently offered Russian IOC member
Vitaly Smirnov's son a job at a Colorado ski resort in 1990. Payne
wrote a note of thanks to Gillett, saying, ``As you probably know,
Mr. Smirnov came to us and wanted us to find an opportunity for his
son where we would work him tirelessly, teach him English and most
importantly, give him some parental care and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   The records do not indicate if young Smirnov took the job and
who paid his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Bid team member Horace Sibley, a King &AMP; Spalding attorney,
played host to the son and daughter-in-law of IOC member Flor
Isava-Fonseca of Venezuela. He took them to the Doral Open, a men's
golf tournament in Miami, and apparently arranged a job interview
in Atlanta. In a follow-up letter to Isava-Fonseca in March 1990,
Sibley wrote, ``I hope Fernando had a good visit. I also hope that
his business interview proved successful. ... After Fernando left I
personally spoke with the president of one of the banks. I believe
something can be worked out to Fernando's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Wallwork, son of IOC member Paul Wallwork from Western
Samoa, was a budding wrestler. Payne offered to find him training
in the United States. In a letter written in June 1990, he said,
``We look forward to receiving specific information on Jerry, as I
am certain we can come up with a good wrestling opportunity here in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   After a visit to Atlanta in 1989, Wallwork, his wife and
daughter took a trip to Disney World on the AOC's tab. They stayed
in the luxurious Grand Cypress Hotel. Total airfare for the three
was $19,828. Other IOC members and their families, including Phil
Coles from Australia and Anton Geesink from the Netherlands, also
took the Disney trip.
</P>
<P>
   The bidders did not forget about their friends after Atlanta won
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   They flew the son of the now-expelled David Sibandze from
Swaziland to Atlanta for a weeklong stay at the Marriott Marquis.
The airfare and hotel alone cost the bid team $5,100. They gave
Musa Sibandze tickets to the Atlanta Symphony and picked up his
bill at an exercise studio.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar Chowdhry, president of the international boxing
federation, who wielded considerable influence with IOC members,
sought and received assistance in getting his two daughters into
Georgia Tech. Then he asked bid team member Charlie Battle to help
a federation official get his son into the university.
</P>
<P>
   Battle made some phone calls and arranged interviews ``with the
appropriate people at Tech,'' he wrote to Payne in a January 1991
memo. The student started taking Tech's ``English as a Second
Language'' classes and then began regular courses that spring,
living in the dorm building next to the Chowdhry girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech has been completely accommodating,'' Battle wrote, adding
that the federation official ``truly believes we performed a
miracle.

Russia, one of the least prepared of all industrialized nations to
cope with the Y2K bug. U.S. officials say the nuclear arsenal is
safe. The millennium is not going to touch off World War III. But
the extent to which the rest of life in Russia could be affected by
the bug is not fully known. (Holmes, Cox News Service). MOVED in

FORMER TOBACCO DEFENSE LAWYER TAKES ON FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ill., Mich., Ohio, Ky.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When Mark Pickrell was an associate at a big New York
law firm three years ago, helping to defend a large cigarette
company against anti-smoking lawsuits filed by Mississippi and New
Jersey, a colleague nicknamed him Brimstone, joking that he would
surely go to hell for having represented Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pickrell is in another courtroom struggle. But this time he
is fighting a big corporation, not defending one.
</P>
<P>
   He is representing a one-man Internet newsletter against a
lawsuit filed by Ford Motor Co., the world's second-largest
corporation. And using skills developed in legal battles over
smoking, he is trying to start a legal war over whether Detroit
automakers colluded to avoid the expense of manufacturing sport
utility vehicles that might produce less air pollution while
getting better fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell insists that he sees many parallels between his former
legal work and the current lawsuit. ``As I look at it, I keep
saying, `It's like tobacco.''' Pickrell said. ``The similarities
that I've seen are unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials declined to comment on any issue regarding the
litigation with Lane, any antitrust issues or any comparisons
between smoking and sport utility vehicle issues. Auto industry
officials have dismissed suggestions of collusion in the past,
saying that the auto market is too competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell has already won the first round in his fight. Ford had
sought a preliminary injunction against Pickrell's client, Robert
Lane, who operates the Internet site, www.blueovalnews.com, which
provides news on Ford vehicles for auto enthusiasts. The injunction
would have prevented Lane from using, copying or discussing boxes
full of internal Ford documents that someone had mailed him
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge turned down most of Ford's request last
Tuesday, saying that the free-speech provision of the First
Amendment protected Lane even though the documents might be trade
secrets and might be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruling, Pickrell had engaged in a helter-skelter
legal dash worthy of the recent genre of lawyer novels. Pickrell,
who is the sole lawyer in his law office in Nashville, Tenn., heard
about the lawsuit from a friend on Aug. 27, a Friday. He sent Lane
a fax that afternoon, offering his legal services for a nominal
fee. Lane called back that evening to say that he was due in
federal court in Detroit for a hearing the following Monday morning
and did not have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a 33-year-old nursing student who lives several blocks
from Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., could not afford to
pay for a last-minute, full-fare airline ticket to Detroit for
Pickrell. But Lane is married to a flight attendant for Northwest
Airlines, who sent Pickrell a so-called ``buddy pass'' to allow him
to buy a very cheap ticket at a rate available only to friends of
airline personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Detroit on Sunday morning, Pickrell, who is also 33,
spent all day and night looking up legal precedents on CD-ROMs and
electronic databases on his laptop computer, drafting a legal brief
and making photocopies at a Kinko's store. Lane said that the two
men were able to talk for only 15 minutes about what he would say
on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Whatever you do, don't lie,''' Lane recalled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Ford lawyers mentioned in the hearing that what had
really upset Ford was Lane's posting on his Internet site of
internal Ford documents relating to the Environmental Protection
Agency. One of these documents, for example, discussed problems
that Ford will face in meeting air pollution standards as it moves
to install diesel engines in more of its full-sized sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell contended that the lawyer's comment showed that Lane
should be treated legally not as someone who recklessly disregarded
trade secrets and copyrights, as Ford alleged, but rather as a
journalist who had been gathering news about a public policy issue
involving the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the judge ruled in Lane's favor, Ford's lawyers had
demanded from Pickrell extensive information about the content and
source of the documents in Lane's possession. Pickrell has
responded by asking Ford for extensive documents regarding its
discussions with competitors and the Environmental Protection
Agency regarding air-pollution technologies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   While representing Brown &AMP; Williamson, a large cigarette
company, Pickrell had learned a lot about the issue of whether
tobacco companies deliberately avoided selling cigarettes that
would emit fewer carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds broke ranks with other tobacco companies in 1988
when it began marketing the Premier as a ``safer'' cigarette. While
the Premier was a failure in the marketplace, plaintiff lawyers
responded to it by saying the product showed that less dangerous
cigarettes had long been possible.
</P>
<P>
   With this legal background, Pickrell said that during the
current lawsuit he immediately became interested in Ford's decision
21 months ago to break ranks with other automakers and redesign all
of its sport utility vehicles to emit as little air pollution as
cars. Federal regulations allow sport utility vehicles to emit two
to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some top auto executives have suggested that Ford broke a
``gentleman's agreement'' among Detroit automakers not to compete
on who could build the least polluting vehicles. While Japanese
automakers have done well in the U.S. car market, Detroit
completely dominated the sport utility vehicle market until the
last couple of years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, read a news
report in May mentioning auto industry cooperation and wrote a
letter to the Justice Department urging an antitrust investigation
into whether automakers had conspired to not install
pollution-control equipment, particularly on sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nader became famous in the 1960s partly for persuading the
Johnson administration to file an identical antitrust lawsuit and
then accusing Detroit automakers of conspiring to not develop or
install pollution-control gear; the consent decree from that case
expired during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rose, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the
agency was preparing a response to Nader's letter, but she declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford documents briefly posted this summer on Lane's Internet
site show that the automaker is working on improvements in
pollution and fuel economy. One document, for example, projected
that the fuel economy of Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer
sport utility vehicles could be improved by 26 percent over the
next decade. But the documents gave no indication of the cost or
feasibility of such a change.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell's tobacco experience may not be his only special
expertise for the case. He left New York and returned to his home
state of Tennessee two years ago because of temporary health
problems and a desire to be his own boss. His law practice in
Nashville now specializes in appeals to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Cincinnati; he is a former clerk of the court's chief
judge, Boyce Martin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The court handles federal appeals from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky
and Tennessee, and will receive any appeals from Ford's lawsuit in
Detroit.

ISRAEL RELENTS, LETTING ARAB LIVE FOR NOW IN JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On a visit to East Jerusalem in July, Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky announced that he wanted to end an Israeli
policy that in recent years has stripped some Palestinians of their
right to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to change this policy and to stop canceling
the residence of inhabitants of East Jerusalem,'' Sharansky said.
``We cannot talk about a united Jerusalem without proper treatment
of the residents of East Jerusalem. We need to do everything to
insure that residents of the east receive equal treatment to those
of the west.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics had long condemned the practice of stripping
Palestinians of their East Jerusalem residency as a means of
curbing the growth of the Arab population in this bitterly
contested city.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry figures show that nearly 5,400 Palestinians
have lost their East Jerusalem residency in this way since Israel
captured the area in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. About half lost it
during the three-year term of the rightist government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was defeated in national elections
in May.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Sharansky spoke, a test case landed in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Following standard procedure, his ministry had sent an eviction
letter to another Palestinian, this time a member of a prominent
Jerusalem family that has lived in the city for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Musa Budeiri, 53, a political science professor who has
British citizenship and travels regularly abroad, was served notice
that his residence had expired and that he was henceforth a
tourist, required to leave Israel within 30 days. His British
residence permit, obtained after he married a British woman, was
cited as the reason for this move.
</P>
<P>
   Under ministry regulations, East Jerusalem residence expires if
someone has ``moved the center of his life'' outside the city for
more than seven years, received a permanent residence permit in
another country or become a foreign citizen. Those expelled are
apparently free to go to the West Bank or Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Budeiri stayed home beyond the Aug. 22 eviction deadline, vowing
to fight the order. His predicament drew public protests from
academic colleagues in Israel and abroad and was widely reported in
the press, becoming a high profile test of Sharansky's statement of
intent.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, a former human rights campaigner in the Soviet Union,
came under criticism for violating Budeiri's right to live in his
native city.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has for years sought to maintain a large Jewish majority
in Jerusalem, primarily through restrictions on Arab housing
construction. But while Jews make up two-thirds of the city's
population of 633,000, a recent Israeli study has found that
because of population shifts and a higher Arab birthrate,
Jerusalem's Arab population is increasing at three times the rate
of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry has routinely maintained that in revoking
residence permits it is simply applying the law to the Arabs of
East Jerusalem, which was annexed to Israel in 1980 and whose
inhabitants have been granted the status of permanent residents,
not Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians in search of housing have moved to West Bank
suburbs of East Jerusalem outside the Israeli-drawn city limits and
lost their residence rights, including Israeli health insurance and
social security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Budeiri, who is the founding director of the Israeli studies
program at Al Quds University here, said that the policy belied
Israel's claims that Jerusalem was a united city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If unifying the city means that its 200,000 Arabs can have
their residence revoked at any time,'' he said, ``what do you
unify? The stone?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week brought the first sign of a change. After extensive
consultations, Sharansky suspended the revocation of Budeiri's
residency. However, the Interior Ministry also notified Budeiri's
lawyer that while his client retained his residency, there had been
legal grounds to revoke it, and that the case would be reviewed in
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Budeiri had won a battle, but not the war.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY SEEKS DISTANCE FROM GUN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a significant setback for the nation's largest
gun show, Los Angeles County has adopted a law banning the sale of
weapons or ammunition on its property.
</P>
<P>
   The law, approved by the county's Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday, threatens to undermine the core business of the Great
Western gun show, held four times a year on the county fairgrounds
in Pomona, Calif., about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. The event
draws as many as 2,000 exhibitors and 35,000 enthusiasts and brings
the county an estimated $600,000 a year, the largest share of the
rent it earns at the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is, the county should not be profiting from the
gun business,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, the county supervisor who
sponsored the motion. ``We shouldn't be leasing or renting our
property for the sale of guns or ammunition of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure also bans discussions about firearms sales on county
property, which would effectively limit the gun show to a display
of weapons and their prices.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the event's promoter, Great Western Shows, has
vowed to file a lawsuit, as early as Monday, that accuses the
county of breaching its contract and impinging on constitutionally
protected political and commercial speech. Great Western Shows said
it would also seek a restraining order to block the county from
enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the county officials who supported the law
jumped on a bandwagon that would have little practical effect on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County is among several municipalities in the United
States that have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers, and it
has banned the sale of inexpensive handguns in its jurisdiction
(the county governs areas that are not covered by incorporated
cities). A state ban on cheap handguns was signed into law late
last month by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The county law was enacted in the same week that mayors and
police chiefs from around the country went to the White House and
Congress to highlight what they feel is the need for more gun
control laws, including closing loopholes in the regulation of gun
shows. The shows are increasingly seen as places where guns are too
easily obtained, often for illegal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other states and the federal government, California
has fairly strict regulations covering transactions at gun shows.
All sales must be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer, and
buyers must pass a background check and wait 10 days before
receiving their weapons. But recent events made officials wonder if
the show was simply too large to be policed effectively.
</P>
<P>
   State-banned assault rifles owned by two men killed in a
shootout with police after a bank robbery in North Hollywood two
years ago were traced by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to the gun show in Pomona. Last May at the show,
undercover agents from the California attorney general's office
were able to buy two assault weapons and five converter kits used
to make them fully automatic, without being subjected to a
background check or the waiting period. In another sting, federal
agents last month arrested a man they met at the gun show who sold
them 10 machine guns and a Browning automatic rifle. Yaroslavsky
said hate literature and Nazi memorabilia have been obtained at the
show by members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   The law takes effect in one month, which would bar transactions
at the next scheduled show, in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the event, Chad Seger, said the ban on sales
would hurt the gun show tremendously, because dealers come from as
far as Europe and Australia and do not have stores in the area
where they could conduct sales when the show is over. He said only
10 percent of the booths at the show deal in modern firearms, and
that 30 percent to 40 percent of them deal in antiques and
collectibles. The remainder are taken up by a variety of businesses
hoping to appeal to firearms enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms that are the primary focus of the show ``are ones
nobody in their right mind would use to commit a crime,'' Seger
said. Further, Seger said, the gun show has long been a forum for
political speech and historical discussions that are protected
under the First Amendment; by eliminating gun sales, which draw
most people to the event, the county is undermining that exchange,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seger said there were only five or six other sites in Southern
California big enough to handle the show, and those were all booked
a year in advance. Great Western has been at Pomona for 22 years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA who specializes in free
speech issues and the regulation of firearms, said the county has a
right to control commercial enterprise on its property, even if the
items for sale are legal. And he said the fair could continue to be
a forum for free speech even if gun sales were banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim is not laughable, but I think it is a very weak
claim,'' Volokh said. ``Surely they lose some part of their
audience, but the audience is turning out for a nonspeech activity
that is itself not protected by the First Amendment.''

   WASHINGTON _ The major airlines will disclose this week exactly
what pledges of customer service they are making as part of a
voluntary program they agreed to earlier this year to stave off
federal legislation on passenger rights.
</P>
<P>
   Each airline is supposed to tell the Transportation Department
by Wednesday how it will implement the voluntary plan. David
Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the big
airlines' trade group, said that the airlines would probably post
their plans on their Web sites soon. The promises are to take
effect on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say they hope the plans will help travelers
learn about their rights, even though some of the rights are not
new.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the General Accounting Office says that many of
the guarantees the airlines are expected to offer are already
required by other laws, or are practices that are widely followed
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other guarantees, while offered voluntarily, would become
legally enforceable if published by the airlines, the GAO said. The
agency, an investigative arm of Congress, solicited an opinion from
the Transportation Department, which regulates airlines. The
Transportation Department said that failing to fulfill such
promises _ concerning issues like offering the lowest available
fare to a customer shopping for tickets, or responding to customer
complaints _ would be an unfair trade practice.
</P>
<P>
   By law, airlines must have copies of their legally binding
contracts of carriage, the fine print that backs up an airplane
ticket, available for inspection at ticket counters, but ``most
consumers don't even know what that is, or even ask for it,'' said
one expert, Laurie J. Berger, the editor of the Consumer Reports
Travel Letter, published by Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, some lawmakers tried to write this kind of
guarantee into a new law, but the airlines sidestepped that move by
telling Congress they would act voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new GAO report, scheduled to be released on Monday, compares
the voluntary agreement, announced in June by the Air Transport
Association, with contracts of carriage and with pertinent federal
statutes and rules. It found that many of the new promises were not
mentioned in the contracts of carriage, a point that had been
raised by passenger rights advocates, who questioned whether the
voluntary agreements are enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is in the contract of carriage, a passenger can clearly
bring a breach of contract case if a violation of the contract
occurs,'' said a senior lawyer at the GAO, David K. Hooper.
</P>
<P>
   But, Hooper added, ``if they hold out a promise and renege on
that promise, the Department of Transportation can go after them
under unfair and deceptive trade practices statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who favored legislation and requested
the GAO report, said he was unhappy with the airlines' being
allowed to write their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got here is scattershot gobbledygook,'' he said in
a telephone interview on Friday. ``Some airlines will do a better
job than others, but it's going to take months to sort all of this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 12 voluntary measures, the airlines are promising to
make every reasonable effort to return checked bags within 24
hours. The issue is not addressed in contracts of carriage, but the
Transportation Department said it would be unfair and deceptive not
to deliver bags in a ``reasonable'' period of time, the GAO
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Under the customer service commitment, airlines are also
promising to disclose policies for accommodating the disabled. But
federal regulations already provide specific guarantees, the GAO
noted. The airlines are also promising to establish a policy for
carrying children without their parents. Contracts of carriage
already specify the minimum age for unaccompanied minors (5 years
old) and set conditions for nonstop and connecting flights, the GAO
said.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are also promising to inform customers about delays,
cancellations and diversions in a timely manner. The issue is not
addressed in the contracts of carriage, the GAO found. But the
report said that according to the Transportation Department, it
would be an unfair practice to say that a flight was canceled
because of weather or mechanical breakdown if it was actually
canceled for economic reasons like a lack of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some items in the customer service plan are new, like allowing
customers to hold a reservation while they shop for better deals.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said that the voluntary commitments left out some rights
he would like to establish for fliers. ``The one that concerns me
the most is, if you call this afternoon and they're overbooked,
they won't tell you that before they sell you a ticket,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston had its wettest day in 15 months on Friday when 4.71
inches of rain fell, but high pressure sprawled along the Atlantic
Seaboard will produce very dry conditions from New England to
Georgia Sunday. Sunshine will be abundant in the Northeast and also
the Southeast, though streamers of high clouds will move eastward
from the Ohio Valley into the Middle Atlantic states. After a cool
start, temperatures should rise to slightly above seasonal levels
across most of the East.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore winds will strengthen along the Georgia and Florida
coasts, encouraging rip tides and rough surf. Thunderstorms will be
scattered over central and southern Florida Sunday afternoon.
Meanwhile, Hurricane Floyd will move north of Puerto Rico into a
region less favorable for strengthening as three new tropical
disturbances farther east in the Atlantic strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of warm, humid air from the southern Plains will
instigate a cluster of showers and thunderstorms from Oklahoma into
Missouri. Farther north, more showers and storms will develop in
the western Great Lakes as warmer air returns. Low pressure near
Duluth, Minn., will bring a cool, soaking rain to northern
Minnesota. Meanwhile, thundershowers will attend the cold front in
the middle Mississippi and Missouri Valleys and in north Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Except for residual thunderstorms in New Mexico and southern
Colorado, the West will become brighter with abundant sunshine.
Offshore winds will bring hot air to the north Pacific Coast with
record heat possible west of the Cascades in Oregon. Low clouds
will linger from San Francisco to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Coastal Chill
</P>
<P>
   Clouds help control summer temperatures. During the past few
months, this has been true in the Southwest. July brought frequent
rain clouds to the deserts resulting in a very cool month for Las
Vegas as the mercury failed to reach 100 degrees on more than half
the days. Even along the southern California coast, ocean clouds
have persisted long into the summer days producing the coolest
summer in 66 years at San Diego. From June through the August, the
temperature averaged 3.7 degrees below normal. A cooler than usual
sea surface has undoubtedly contributed to California's coastal
chill as well.

U.N. SAYS JAKARTA IS EASING OPPOSITION TO PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIMOR-RDP)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Saturday that
Indonesia seems to be softening its position daily on the
deployment of international peacekeeping troops in East Timor and
that he hopes to get an official go-ahead from President B.J.
Habibie on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be indications that there may be a shift in the
Indonesian position,'' Annan said as he arrived for the first open
Security Council debate on East Timor, at which perhaps more than
two dozen nations are expected to speak over a period of two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be talking to President Habibie tomorrow morning,'' he
added, ``and I hope I will be able to hear from him directly what
the position is.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Indonesia may be considering allowing a
previously planned peacekeeping operation to be deployed in the
territory ahead of schedule, which would amount to a face-saving
compromise under which Indonesia could avoid appearing to have
caved in to international demands for an immediate intervention
force.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed by Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations on May 5, a peacekeeping force was to have been permitted
to enter East Timor after the Indonesian Parliament had ratified
the results of the territory's vote for independence later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers would then be responsible for law and order as
political power is transferred to the East Timorese and elections
would be held in the new nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday Wiranto was saying in three months time,'' Annan
said. ``Today he seems to have softened the position, indicating
that they may allow the peacekeepers to go in earlier. I hope the
decision will be taken soon, not later.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's unusual open session of the Security Council was
demanded by Portugal, the former colonial overlord of the
territory, which had spent the week pressing furiously for a public
debate. All council sessions on the issue last week were held
behind closed doors, as all member nations balked at forcing a
violation of the agreement with Indonesia by deploying troops
without Jakarta's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go straight to the point,'' said Antonio Monteiro,
Portugal's delegate to the United Nations, said in his speech
Saturday. ``Portugal has repeatedly requested this meeting of the
Security Council to confront the council with its responsibilities
in managing the appalling crisis in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rape of East Timor has taken place before our eyes,'' he
said. ``The United Nations cannot, must not, afford once again to
intervene in a conflict only to stand by while the process then
loses its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the council before his speech, Monteiro told
reporters that the shift in Indonesia's position on troops was
``exactly what we want.'' Portugal, which decided to abandon East
Timor in 1974, has worked for nearly a quarter of a century to
dislodge Indonesia, which seized the territory by force in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative here, told
reporters outside the council chamber before his speech, ``It was
important that the world community have this discussion today, but
the obligation to fix this problem remains squarely with the people
who caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Council session was the first part of a two-day
meeting that will culminate on Monday with a report from a
five-member Security Council team that spent most of last week in
Indonesia, capped by a visit Saturday to East Timor.

SOMEWHERE, A PLACE FOR FORBES, MAYBE 
VENTURA CAN'T MAKE PEROT SAY `UNCLE' 
WHEN $5 MILLION DOESN'T ADD UP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ky., Mass., Minn., N.J., Texas)  (rk) 
 By   B.DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is responsible for rounding up
enough money and strong candidates to guarantee that his party
retains control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   So when Gov. Christie Whitman pulled out of the New Jersey
Senate race on Tuesday, saying that on second thought she would
rather run New Jersey than run for Congress, McConnell expressed
``big disappointment'' and lamented that her exit ``makes it less
likely we'll win the Senate seat in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he began to ponder the matter of a replacement candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't Steve Forbes go for it?'' he asked when some
Republican strategists and members of his senatorial committee
gathered a couple of nights later at a Washington steak house for a
brainstorming session.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a worthy idea and was kicked around a good bit, one
participant recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is a candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, of course. But the focus of the dinner conversation was
on the fact that he hails from New Jersey and, should he run for
the Senate, would start off with good name recognition, an
experienced campaign organization, lots of popular ideas about tax
reform and pockets every bit as deep as those of the wealthiest of
the Democratic Senate hopefuls, Jon S. Corzine, a former Wall
Street tycoon estimated to be worth $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what of Forbes' hopes for the White House?
</P>
<P>
   Not going to happen, the dinner group concluded without serious
dissent or discussion, not with him still struggling to reach
double digits in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   No formal decision was made on broaching the idea of a Senate
race with Forbes. But by noon the next day word of the session had
reached the Forbes camp.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, his people said. Not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   By suppertime that day, word of the session and the ``Forbes
solution'' had trickled all the way down to Texas and the
presidential campaign camp of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Really great idea, said some of the governor's people _ few of
them seriously concerned about Forbes' ability to snatch the
party's nomination from Bush but all worried about his ability to
use a caustic, multimillion-dollar ad campaign to cripple the
governor for the fall race. One of them, a top strategist, floated
a sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Should Forbes jump out of the presidential contest and into the
New Jersey contest, he mused, Bush, for openers, very well might be
willing to campaign for him and maybe even hold a few rallies.
Perhaps even more enticing, the Bush man went on, the governor
might be willing to incorporate some major Forbes political ideas
into the Bush campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes folks didn't bite. Still not going to happen, they
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura Can't Make Perot Say `Uncle'
</P>
<P>
   The forces of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Ross Perot are
squabbling again over control of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who is the party's highest elected official, won the
first round back in late July in Detroit when his candidate, Jack
Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., was elected national chairman at the
party's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan immediately announced that the party's headquarters would
be moved to Florida from Texas, and he said its day-to-day
operations would be more openly run. He also called on Perot, the
party's founder and presidential candidate in two elections, to
withdraw from any active participation in party affairs,
particularly presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Detroit defeat and mounting evidence that the
party's rank-and-file is ready for change, Perot, accustomed to
running things his way, seems bent on retaining as much control
over the party as possible. And, it turns out, he still has some
things going for him _ at least until Jan. 1. That is the date that
Gargan will officially take office. Until then, the man in charge
of the party is the one who has been chairman for the past few
years, Russ Verney, and he is a Perot man, going back almost to the
days when the Texas billionaire founded the party.
</P>
<P>
   So the other day when the party's Executive Committee met to
vote on a site for next year's national convention, set for Aug.
10-13, Verney was able to thwart a move by Ventura supporters to
hold the gathering in Minneapolis. It took several rounds of voting
to head off the governor's forces, but eventually Verney prevailed
and the committee picked Long Beach, Calif., as the site.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan accused Verney of railroading the proceedings by calling
the meeting on too short notice and then taking too many votes to
decide the site issue. He contended that committee members had not
had enough time to canvass party members about where they would
prefer to meet and he said that when the committee could not agree
on a site on the first vote, the matter should have been tabled
until a future meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to poll party members to see which site they
prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with California if that truly is the wish,''
he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Verney says California is, truly, the favored site, in part
because many party members worry that Ventura, despite his
declaration that he will not run for president, would dominate any
convention held in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the convention eventually is held, the Reform Party's
role in the 2000 presidential race could be important, especially
if the contest is close.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura can always change his mind about running and polls
indicate that he might pick up 10 percent or more of the vote
should he be the Reform nominee. Similarly, if Patrick Buchanan,
the columnist and commentator, bolts the Republican Party and ends
up as the Reform candidate, the polls say that he, too, might
capture a significant number of votes, maybe 15 percent or so.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans worry that a Reform candidate might cost their
nominee more votes than the Democrats' nominee. And adding to that
worry is the fact that on the basis of past election performances,
the Reform Party will have more than $12 million in federal
campaign funds to lavish on its nominee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When $5 Million Doesn't Add Up
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has spent a good part of the past seven
years dropping in on places beset with trouble and announcing
federal money grants. It's all part of the political game, a proven
vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   So when he showed up in Boston the other day and announced a $5
million aid package for New England's troubled fishing industry
(too many boats, not enough fish) he was warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   Initially.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on closer inspection, it became clear that Gore was not
announcing a new program but rather was announcing a program that
had been approved almost a year earlier _ after being pushed
through Congress by New England legislators, led by Sen. John F.
Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Anger replaced warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides chided Gore aides for glossing over credit
where credit was due. So did fishing industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really stinks of cheap, election year politics,'' Paul
Cohane, the head of the Gulf of Main Fisherman's Association,
complained to The Boston Globe. ``Gore had very little to do with
this. Yet he came in an took all the glory. He stole the
limelight.`
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office said he did nothing more than make a ``formal
official announcement'' that the aid was available. But he called
Kerry to apologize, The Globe reported.

   DILI, Indonesia _ On the steep hillside behind the U.N.
compound, armed men were shooting at refugees who were trying to
flee to safety. In the crowded courtyard below, a police adviser
from New Zealand was teaching little boys to play cricket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an extraordinary combination of the bizarre
and the obscene,'' Brian Kelly, a U.N. official, said Saturday as
he described that strange recent moment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The fear ebbs and flows, people here said. Sometimes the
gunshots and the blasts of hand grenades are hardly noticed.
Sometimes _ usually late at night _ panic sweeps the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes terrified refugees storm their way into the compound,
tossing their children over its wall and climbing through coils of
razor wire to seek safety. Sometimes the gunfire drives them to
flee again, crawling under the coiled wire at the back of the
compound and scaling the hillside in search of some other place to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The number of people seeking refuge in the compound rises and
falls. At the moment it is about 1,000. Small cooking fires are
everywhere. People with nothing else to do sleep like vagrants here
and there on the ground. The air is filled with the cries and
whines of hundreds of small, dirty children.
</P>
<P>
   Inside an auditorium, a small table is covered with crucifixes
and statues of the Virgin Mary that the refugees took with them
when they fled their homes. Candles are always burning.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival Saturday of a delegation of high-ranking U.N.
officials caused little stir. Only rumors of an imminent attack, it
seemed, could rouse the people here from a passivity born of dread.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched the officials tour the camp, a woman named Maria
burst into loud tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid, please help us, I beg you,'' she cried in
English, accosting Martin Adjaba, the Namibian representative to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize with you,'' said Adjaba, one of five
representatives from the Security Council who visited this stunned
and bleeding city to test the assurances of the Indonesian military
that everything was under control.
</P>
<P>
   The woman named Maria raised her voice. ``If we stay here they
will kill us, all of us,'' she said. ``I beg you. Don't leave us
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   If her manner seemed dramatic _ particularly in contrast with
the people who looked on dully from their cots and cooking fires _
it was impossible not to respect her fears.
</P>
<P>
   Adjaba took her hands. ``We will do everything to make sure your
future is secure,'' he said. ``That is the commitment of the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a commitment the delegation was struggling to implement
Saturday as it urged the military here to quell the irregular
militias that have terrorized East Timor since it voted nearly two
weeks ago to become independent of a 24-year Indonesian occupation.
</P>
<P>
   As residents of the compound can testify, in example after
example, the Indonesian security forces _ far from curbing militia
activity _ are acting in concert with them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is that the same people who are supposed to
protect us are the ones who are terrorizing us,'' said Peter Wyatt,
an Australian security officer.
</P>
<P>
   When the military, in what so far seems to have been an
ineffective gesture, declared martial law here four days ago, a
force of fresh soldiers replaced a contingent of police officers in
guarding the U.N. compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police left on two trucks,'' said Nick Birnback, a U.N.
official, ``and when they did, every single one of them emptied
their weapons into the air. That was their goodbye to us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the picture of East Timor that was presented to
the delegation in a surreal visit to the military headquarters, a
sprawling white building that is one of the few sizable structures
left intact in Dili, and is still festooned with the red-and-white
bunting that marked Indonesia's national day last month.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri presented a slide show of colored
graphs marked: torture, kidnap, arson, killing, looting. The graphs
he said, showed conclusively that martial law was choking off the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of moment that has tested the patience of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces commander, made a
similar presentation in Jakarta. According to an official traveling
with the delegation, Adjaba told the commander, in effect: ``We
don't believe you. You are not convincing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the meeting still under way, the hand phones of the
delegates began to ring. Militia fighters were firing guns and
menacing the compound in Dili, they were told.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto made his own telephone call: No, he said, nothing was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates insisted, and the general _ who speaks English _
made another telephone call to one of his subordinates in Dili.
``I'll call my insubordinate commander,'' he said, in a telling
slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a person traveling with the delegation said, the
general conceded that there was violence, but denied _ incorrectly,
as witnesses here confirmed _ that it was directed at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   As he was waiting for his second reply from Dili, according to
this account, Wiranto made an awkward moment more awkward, offering
light patter about a new golf course he had just built adjacent to
his headquarters in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he wanted us to play golf,'' the person said, ``to which
there was a resounding silence in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Dili Saturday, the U.N. delegation saw enough to convince
them that they were witnessing a major humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely appalling,'' one official said. ``I had tended
to think, even in the worst case, that they would not go so far.
They spit in the eye of the United Nations, of the member states
and the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun began to sink, the delegates hurried from the
compound for a well-guarded convoy back to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   As one man rushed down the steps of the auditorium, picking his
way through a crowd of refugees, he heard a quiet voice just behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget East Timor,'' the voice said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday., Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Despite great infusions of outside assistance and promises to
carry out reforms, Russia appears to be sinking ever deeper into
bankruptcy and corruption. The latest allegations are that Boris
Yeltsin and his family may have taken bribes. Yeltsin dismissed the
charge in a phone conversation with President Clinton last week,
but there are also growing suspicions that aid from the
International Monetary Fund and other institutions may have gone
into the pockets of Russia's new oligarchs. With elections
approaching in Russia and the United States, investigators must
follow the trails of corruption and money laundering and re-examine
policy decisions that may have aggravated the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the communist era, corruption was a part of the
Russian fabric. As the economist Anders Aslund points out, Russian
elites in the final years of the Soviet Union were reaping
fortunes, a practice that helped discredit communism in Russian
eyes. It is now in the West's interest to insure that capitalism,
free markets and privatization are not similarly discredited.
Certainly there are limits to what outsiders, including foreign
lenders, can do within Russia. But U.S. and Swiss banking
regulators can take the lead in investigating this problem, forcing
Russian regulators to act and teaching them some monitoring
techniques at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A separate issue relates to evidence of official corruption,
possibly involving illegal diversion of billions in aid from the
IMF, the World Bank and other institutions. The suspicion is also
growing that in a bid to speed privatization, stabilize Russian
currency and encourage greater private investment, U.S.
policy-makers may have looked the other way when charges of
wrongdoing first surfaced. Some Republicans have suggested that
Vice President Al Gore was among those in the administration more
interested in propping up Yeltsin than in holding his government to
account.
</P>
<P>
   These are significant questions. Later this month, Rep. Jim
Leach of the House Banking Committee will open hearings on what he
says is a Russian kleptocracy. He would do well to give the
administration an ample chance to air its position, which is that
it has encouraged openness and even pressed Yeltsin to sign a
money-laundering bill passed by the Russian parliament. The
committee must also look searchingly at whether administration
officials or banks ignored evidence that economic aid was funneled
out of Russia almost as fast as it was poured in.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, if any investigation discredited
the need for the United States to remain engaged with Russia. The
administration has already begun to shift gears and insist that a
more clear accounting of international assistance be made before
further loans can be granted. At the very least, the IMF needs to
demand greater disclosure of what happens to its aid. But whether
in Kosovo, the Middle East, Iraq, or in nuclear disarmament, Russia
has a crucial role to play. Its leaders will demand to be taken
into account, and they will be able to make things difficult if
they are ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to remember the progress that Russia has
achieved. Although the economy has steadily contracted since 1991,
Russia has 2.7 million legally registered private enterprises.
Aslund and others have pointed to some signs of increased tax
collections and indications that the budget crisis could shrink
unhealthy subsidies to industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the Russians must reform their system.
Outside leverage cannot by itself change old habits, much less
transform a culture. Leach's committee needs to examine foreign-aid
blunders, but its more important task may be drawing guidelines for
how the United States can spend wisely to help Russia's struggling
democracy. Future financial dealings can be safeguarded with full
disclosure, the rule of law and a phaseout of the subsidies, state
regulation and cronyism that have enriched the Russian elite.

EDITORIAL: HOW TO STRENGTHEN TITLE I 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans in Congress are thrashing out changes
to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a program
that has traditionally assured impoverished children special
courses like remedial reading and math that they desperately need
to succeed. Republicans are hoping to expand on a dismal proposal
passed last year that gives the states too much discretion to
redirect federal education financing that was traditionally
targeted at the poorest students. The Democrats, led by Rep. George
Miller of California, are fighting to maintain targeted financing
and to strengthen Title I by requiring that states phase out the
widespread use of uncertified teachers and close the yawning
achievement gap that now exists between poor and middle-class
students.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse toward holding the states accountable for reducing
gaps in both teacher quality and student performance is timely and
important. The pending plan would reward states that do so and
punish states that fail to make a good-faith effort.
</P>
<P>
   Under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
which distributes money based on the percentage of low-income
students, about $8 billion is spent each year on special courses
like remedial reading and math as well as counseling services. Such
financing can make up as much as a third of the budget in the
nation's poorest schools. It is vital to education for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, states often waste the money by allowing poor
districts to fill their schools with teachers who are either
uncertified or who teach subjects they never studied. Nationwide,
disadvantaged children are two to three times as likely as other
children to be taught by uncertified teachers _ a fact that
contributes heavily to the growing achievement gap between children
in poor schools and those from middle-class districts.
</P>
<P>
   A few states are considering pay raises, housing benefits and
other incentives to get qualified teachers to go where they are
most needed. But most states are expected to do comparatively
little unless Congress nudges the country in the right direction.
The proposal to condition Title I money on hiring better teachers
and closing the achievement gap is a step toward improvement.

 &HT;    Rematch veteran Holyfield steps up training for Lewis
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Confident, Evander Holyfield moves to Houston this
week to continue intense training for his Nov. 13 heavyweight title
rematch with Lennox Lewis. He's excited for good reason: Holyfield
is the king of the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Five times Holyfield won second bouts against the same opponent:
Dwight Qawi, Alex Stewart, Michael Moorer, Riddick Bowe and Mike
Tyson. Now, it's Lewis, who contends, like many, that he won the
March bout with Holyfield, which ended in a draw by the judges'
scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can surprise Evander once,'' his attorney, Jim Thomas
said, ``but you can't surprise him twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and his team have been perhaps more diligent than ever
in preparation. The three-time champion began preliminary training
in early July without an agreement on a second bout. He has spent
about three weeks with strength and conditioning coach Tim Hallmark
in Atlanta while also doing serious training under Don Turner.
Those efforts will increase in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, Holyfield's trainer, has reviewed the first fight and is
charting a course of action against Lewis' left jab that was so
effective in the first fight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hallmark is ensuring that Holyfield enters the ring
in his typical flawless shape. Holyfield's new diet emphasizes
natural foods and water, while minimizing strength-enhancing
supplements like Creatine. Holyfield experienced cramps in the days
leading up to the first Lewis fight and during the match, and he
and his camp are hopeful the new diet with eliminate those
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training really is not a burden for me,'' Holyfield said.
``I've been doing it for 15 years. I don't have to go to the woods
to train. A man's going to do what a man wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Holyfield likes to do while training in Houston is go to
schools or YMCAs and speak to youngsters. He is free with his time,
which is where Thomas steps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want as few distractions as possible,'' he said. ``I'm going
to take on every task possible to keep it off of Evander. He is
always giving of himself. It's hard to convince him that to give to
other people he has to first take care of himself over the next
nine weeks.... I want him focusing totally on the fight.

 &HT;    Quarterbacking the D: Free safety's job is no snap
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL free safety is described as the ``quarterback
of the secondary,'' and Eugene Robinson calls his share of signals
for the Falcons. His job is to position defensive backs and change
coverages based on opposing formations. Robinson describes what
happens in the few seconds before and after the ball is snapped:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is, where is the tight end lined up? Then, we
can get everybody lined up on defense. (Middle linebacker) Jessie
Tuggle makes the call; I echo the call, sending the strong safety
to that side. From there, I look at the backfield to see if there
are any adjustments, and then if the wide receivers or tight ends
look like they're going to go in motion. After that, I start
thinking what we're going to change if we get motion. I think,
`What do they like to do from this set?' _ based on what I've seen
watching film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a receiver is split way out, I go, `Do I have to get way
over the top (deep zone) on him, or do I cut down my drop?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different checks that I yell out that will rotate a
zone to the motion side or rotate away from the motion side. We
have one where a linebacker flares out, which might leave a man
(usually a running back) uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``With motion, the corner will give me a signal by tapping a
hand to a certain spot on the body that lets me know I might need
to change my position. It could indicate whether I need to cover
over the top on my side, whether I'm going to take inside cuts, if
I'm going to give him help or if I can just worry about going to
the other side to help there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the yelling I do is just confirming that I see the
signals. Sometimes, the signals indicate I'm covering a certain
route, like a corner route or a curl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a cornerback comes across with a receiver in motion, I
may have to go back on that side. If the strength of the passing
formation is away from me, I'll tell the corner he's normally
isolated, and he has no help. I'll tell him to watch the slant over
the middle because he has no help there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll mess with the quarterback sometimes and try to make it
look like I'm staying in a certain part of the field. Then, when he
turns his head, I'll sprint as fast as I can to another area of the
field, where there might be multiple receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, that's how you get picks.

WASHINGTON POLICE BEGIN TO ENFORCE 1995 CURFEW
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years ago, the City Council approved a youth
curfew. Then, after a long court challenge and a recent campaign to
educate parents, children and the police, the District of Columbia
started last week to enforce the ban on unsupervised children on
the streets late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Young people appeared to be obeying. In the first few days of
enforcement, only six teen-agers were caught by police officers and
released to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moving slowly along the city streets, rarely more than 25 mph,
Sgt. Pamela Wheeler Taylor of the Metropolitan Police Department
monitored night clubs, fast-food restaurants, city parks and
outside college dorms on Thursday night after 11. And from downtown
Washington to quiet, tree-lined residential neighborhoods, the
sidewalks were unusually free of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curfew is a good idea in principle, but the logistics of
enforcing the law concern police officers,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``Of
course, if we can help one child, it is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every child detained for a curfew violation, she said,
one officer must be pulled off his beat or away from his work to
supervise the child, who must be kept away from adult criminal
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Once a child is in custody, officers can search him or her and
run background checks. Handcuffs may not be used unless the child
becomes violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``An officer must use some discretion and a little common
sense,'' Ms. Taylor added. ``You know what kids are doing and what
they are not doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits teen-agers under 17 years of age from being in
a public place unaccompanied by a parent, guardian or any person 21
or older between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Monday through Thursday, and
midnight to 6 a.m. Friday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the curfew, which started on Tuesday, could result in
25 hours of community service for young offenders. But the law
tries to reach the teen-agers through their parents, who can be
punished with fines of up to $500 and community service for
permitting their children to roam city streets during restricted
hours. There are exceptions to the law, however, including running
errands for a parent or guardian, traveling to or from work,
attending chaperoned school events and certain emergencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Terrance W. Gainer, the executive assistant police chief, said
neighborhood patrol officers would contact the parents after
picking up a child. Officers transport the child home, and the
parents must sign a release for custody. If parents or guardians
cannot be reached, the child will be held overnight. The child is
turned over to the Department of Human Services if not picked up by
6 a.m. And the Department of Child and Family Services becomes
involved for any child under 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district's curfew law is part of our overall strategy to
keep our neighborhoods safe _ and we will vigorously enforce the
law,'' Mayor Anthony A. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The curfew law was adopted in June 1995, a result of increasing
crime rates among young people in many urban areas around the
country, but enforced sporadically. Similar curfew proposals died
in 1993 and 1994 here.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled
that the curfew violated minors' rights to free movement and
parents' rights to exercise parental discretion. The decision came
in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is
critical of curfew laws.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
disagreed, ruling that teen-agers did not have an unrestricted
right to gather in public late at night and that the 1995 law did
not infringe on the rights of children or parents.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur B. Spitzer, legal director for the ACLU office in
Washington, anticipates that enforcement of the curfew law may be
``arbitrary and discriminatory,'' with police officers patrolling
certain neighborhoods more than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is virtually inevitable in a situation like this,'' Spitzer
said. ``Some kids have back yards and automobiles. And kids in
other neighborhoods have no place to go other than neighborhood
streets.''

TO APPEASE U.S., KAZAKHSTAN ACTS ON MIG SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and STEVE LEVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ With Kazakhstan's strategic ties with the
United States at risk over the sale of MIG jet fighters to North
Korea, the Kazakh president has ordered a series of arrests,
reformed the government's arms export system and dismissed his
closest confidante and adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that focused on the recent sale, Foreign
Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said the government was aware that
the sale of some 40 MIG jets to North Korea had endangered its
crucial relationship with the United States. Washington considers
North Korea a rogue state for its support of international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed, unhappy and frustrated with what happened
with this incident,'' Tokayev said. ``But what happened has
happened, and the president is determined to punish those who
failed to control the export of conventional arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a development that further complicated the two nations'
relationship, the Russian police late Friday detained Kazakhstan's
main opposition leader, former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin,
on an extradition request by the Kazakh authorities.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats met Saturday with Russian and Kazakh officials
``to tell them we were very concerned about it and that it didn't
look good,'' a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin, 47, who lives in exile in Europe, was detained on
arrival in Moscow on a flight from London. He was later moved under
police guard to a Moscow hospital after suffering what his aides
said were heart palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities said they were undecided whether to
extradite Kazhegeldin, whom the Kazakh authorities accuse of tax
evasion and corruption. A lawyer for Kazhegeldin, Charles Both,
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred one day after the government refused
Kazhegeldin a place on the ballot for Kazakh national elections to
be held Oct. 10. The government asserted that Kazhegeldin had
failed to register properly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. authorities last month learned of the transfer of the
MIGs, 1960s-era fighters that are still effective in an arena like
the Korean peninsula. The transfer has forced the Clinton
administration to consider cutting off annual assistance of at
least $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Soviet breakup, Kazakhstan has maintained a very
close relationship with Washington, leading the way in the
elimination of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. In
addition, President Nursultan Nazarbayev has become one of the
Clinton administration's closest allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the MIG controversy comes at a time of tension between the
two countries over Nazarbayev's six-month-old crackdown on his
political opposition and his promotion of close relatives to key
government posts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just last week, Nazarbayev appointed a son-in-law, Rakhat Aliev,
as a deputy chief of the successor service to the KGB in charge of
the Almaty region, giving him the rank of major general. Aliev is a
vehement critic of Kazhegeldin, the former prime minister, and has
helped lead a long government effort to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   While defending Nazarbayev's progress on democratization and his
record on appointments, Tokayev, the foreign minister, said concern
over the MIG transfer had risen to such high levels that Vice
President Al Gore had discussed the transfer with the Kazakh
president in a telephone conversation last month.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had agreed to a joint U.S.-Kazakh investigation
into who was responsible for the $8 million sale.
</P>
<P>
   Tokayev asserted that the Russian government was not involved in
the sale, but said that at least two Russian officials _ including
Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, a leading candidate to succeed
President Boris N. Yeltsin _ had intervened in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration learned that a trainload
of disassembled MIGs had been shipped from Kazakhstan to North
Korea. That followed a similar incident on March 19, when another
former Soviet republic, Azerbaijan, announced that it had impounded
a cargo plane with its Russian and Ukrainian crew from Kazakhstan
carrying six disassembled MIG fighters; crewmen on the plane said
they were headed to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its previously announced dismissal of two senior
officials _ including Nurtai Abukayev, head of the state Committee
on National Security and Nazarbayev's closest confidante _ Tokayev
said the government had arrested about 12 people, including
subordinates of Abukayev.
</P>
<P>
   Tokayev said he did not believe that Abukayev had personally
benefited from the sale, but that the president had asked for his
friend's resignation because he had failed to control Kazakhstan's
arms cache.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president had revoked the conventional arms sale
licenses of all private companies and the supervisory role of the
Ministry of Defense in such sales. From now on, he said, these
sales will be overseen by the office of the prime minister, who
until now has been regarded as a comparatively weak figure.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law prescribes sanctions against countries that provide
``lethal military assistance'' to any of seven nations that
Washington considers sponsors of terrorism. The State Department
has a range of options, from waiving sanctions to halting all
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of Kazakhstan in Washington have complained that
the administration is trying to make an example of the Central
Asian republic, a relatively weak state whose independence from
Russia is guaranteed by Washington, while it routinely waives
sanctions against Moscow. At White House insistence, they said, the
administration had ignored cases in which Russian officials
appeared to be involved in such conventional arms transfers to Iraq
and other Middle Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
   The administration finally barred three Russian companies from
doing business with the United States for a year after they sold
anti-tank weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kazakhstan affair, Tokayev said his government had
received no money from North Korea and had requested that North
Korea return the aircraft. He said that Kazakhstan had received no
formal response, but that North Korea's envoy in Moscow had told a
Kazakh diplomat there that his country had not received the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Tokayev said repairing Kazakh-U.S. relations was a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important issue is to restore trust between the
countries,'' Tokayev said. ``We used to be very good partners. Big
damage has been brought to our cooperation. I as foreign minister
understand the seriousness of the situation. We are ready to do our
part.''

<P>
   The gaunt, blind musician known as Moondog, who was celebrated
among New Yorkers for two decades as a mysterious and extravagantly
garbed street performer but who went on to win acclaim in Europe as
an avant-garde composer, conducting orchestras before royalty, died
Wednesday in a hospital in Munster, Germany. He was 83.

<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Ilona Sommer.
</P>
<P>
   Day in and day out, the man who was originally named Louis T.
Hardin was as taciturn and unchanging a landmark of the midtown
Manhattan streetscape as the George M. Cohan statue in Duffy
Square. From the late 1940s until the early 1970s, Hardin stood at
attention like a sentinel on Avenue of the Americas around 54th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the weather, he invariably dressed in a homemade robe,
sandals, a flowing cape and a horned Viking helmet, the tangible
expression of what he referred to as his ``Nordic philosophy.'' At
his side he clutched a long spear of his own manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passers-by who dismissed him as ``the Viking of
Sixth Avenue,'' offering him contributions and buying copies of his
music and poetry, were unaware that he had recorded his music on
the CBS, Prestige, Epic, Angel and Mars labels. Hardin's
jazz-accented compositions, generally scored for small wind and
percussion ensembles, often achieved a flowing, tonal symphonic
style.
</P>
<P>
   One of his songs, ``All Is Loneliness,'' became a hit when
recorded by Janis Joplin. He wrote music for radio and television
commercials, and one of his compositions was used on the soundtrack
for the 1972 movie ``Drive, He Said,'' with Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hardin wrote Bohemian broadsides against
government regimentation, the world monetary system and organized
religion. He was celebrated by Beat Generation poets and late-1960s
flower children. His passionate unconventionality drew praise from
some critics and led to interviews on many television shows,
including both ``Today'' and ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many New Yorkers assumed that he had died after he
vanished from his customary post in 1974, Hardin had actually been
invited to perform his music in West Germany and decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He led an extraordinary life for a blind man who came to New
York with no contacts and a month's rent, and who lived on the
streets of New York for 30 years,'' said Dr. Robert Scotto, a
professor of English at Baruch College of the City University of
New York. ``Without question, he was the most famous street person
of his time, a hero to a generation of hippies and flower
children.'' Scotto has just completed a biography of Hardin,
``Moondog: The Viking of Sixth Avenue,'' which has not been
published.
</P>
<P>
   After his performances in Hamburg, Hardin again earned a living
as a street performer, this time in Europe. He soon met Mrs.
Sommer, whose father insisted on taking him into their home and
supported Hardin in his later years. He composed in Braille, and
she transcribed his music and acted as his publisher and business
manager. According to Scotto, they had an intimate working
relationship, but neither of them ever described it as more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Hardin produced at least five albums in
Europe, including a ``sound saga'' titled ``The Creation,'' and
regularly performed his compositions with chamber and symphony
orchestras before glittering audiences in Paris, Stockholm and
cities in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Harding adopted the Moondog name in 1947, identifying himself,
he said, with a former pet who howled at the moon.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Maryville, Kan., on May 26, 1916, the son of an
Episcopal minister. He was blinded at the age of 16 when a dynamite
blasting cap exploded in his hands. A year later, after studying
stringed instruments, organ and harmony at the Iowa School for the
Blind, he became obsessed with becoming a composer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Manhattan in 1943, he established an outpost
outside the stage entrance of Carnegie Hall and met some of the New
York Philharmonic's musicians. They arranged a meeting with their
conductor, Artur Rodzinski. Rodzinski was taken with Hardin and not
only extended an open invitation to attend the orchestra's
rehearsals, but also promised he would conduct an orchestral work
if Hardin ever wrote one.
</P>
<P>
   But because he was blind, he needed help in writing out the
score. Hardin could not afford such assistance, so he made his
living as a street musician, training himself to be a master of
percussion improvisation. He was unable to compose a symphony until
after Rodzinski left the Philharmonic in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, one of his 78-rpm recordings, ``Moondog
Symphony,'' was regularly played by Alan Freed, the pioneering
rock-and-roll disk jockey. But it wasn't until the 1960s that
Hardin had regular access to an orchestra and was able to make his
first longer album for CBS, ``Moondog.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Hardin, acclaimed in Europe, was invited back to the
United States to conduct the Brooklyn Philharmonic Chamber
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Kozinn, a critic for The New York Times, described
Hardin's conducting style as unusual, explaining that he was
``uncomfortable with being an authority figure, so he sits to the
side of the orchestra and provides the beat on a bass drum or
tympani.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotto said that Hardin told him that he married in 1943 and
subsequently divorced. A second marriage, to Sazuko Whiteing, a
musician, in the 1950s, ended in divorce in the early 1960s, Scotto
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scotto and Mrs. Sommer said they thought Hardin was survived by
a younger brother, Creighton Hardin, of Kansas City; a daughter,
June Hardin, and another daughter, whose name and whereabouts they
did not know.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hardin finally yielded to Mrs. Sommer's coaxing and
gave up his Viking outfits. He had refused to alter his dress code
even when, as an aspiring composer, it provoked his eviction from
the Philharmonic rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still love horned helmets and swords and spears,'' he
said in a 1989 interview. ``I like to feel that I'm loyal to my
past. I wouldn't want to be on the street anymore. But you know,
that led to a lot of things.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Martin was the kid in all-whites flailing away
on the remote courts of the National Tennis Center as a junior when
Andre Agassi, in his denim shorts, was bleaching his long locks and
foiling tradition in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a year removed from scraping up laundry money and
lugging books to class at Northwestern University when the gangly
Pete Sampras barged onto the scene and left the grounds with a cup
lofted in the air after winning the U.S. Open in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Martin has always been the tag-along in American
tennis, always stuck in the line of recognition behind Agassi,
Sampras, Jim Courier and Michael Chang. Not anymore. Over the last
dozen days, Martin has showed it is never too late to reveal your
identity to an American public eager to embrace miracle &UR;  &LR; makers.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting this description, seventh-seeded Martin extended himself
in sickness and in health this past &UR;  &LR; week to secure his place in
the men's final with a meticulous dismantling of Frenchman Cedric
Pioline, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2, Saturday in Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' said Martin, who will play second-seeded
Andre Agassi, the winner over third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov in
Saturday's 's other semifinal match. ``I didn't expect to be here.
I knew I could, given the right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't look at the draw. I knew that Pete Sampras was
in my section, but I wasn't aware that Patrick Rafter was on my
half,'' added Martin, who benefited when both withdrew due to
injuries. ``I felt good today. I felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a Windex-blue sky, Martin looked as fresh and crisp as a
dry-cleaned shirt compared to the greenish hue he had assumed
during his last two matches, performances that were fortified by a
buffet of intravenous fluids and chanting partisan crowds. Finally,
he looked healthy, as if the cool, breezy air agreed with him in
the face of the stylish but perpetually angst-ridden Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up this morning I was nervous that I wouldn't be
able to play as well on a full tank as I had been on a half, but I
did,'' Martin said. ``Played pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, grit overcame grace once again as Martin snapped
back returns and pulled winners out of a holster with the kind of
consistency that left Pioline crestfallen before the second set was
15 minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after being broken twice in the first set, Pioline
would find the answers harder and harder to come by. Every
brilliant shot was turned against him, as in the sixth game of the
second set.
</P>
<P>
   A well-placed approach shot, sliced behind Martin deep at the
baseline, looked like the prelude to a winner for the Frenchman.
But Martin, circling back in stumbling imperfection, managed to
whip his racket around and slap a crosscourt passing shot that left
Pioline lunging in vain on his way to being broken and slapped down
into a 1-5 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   A game later, as his backhand floated long on Martin's set
point, Pioline flipped his racket into the air, missed the catch
and knocked himself in the head. This was not going to be his day
to make his third Grand Slam final, it was Martin's moment to
achieve his second.
</P>
<P>
   Since his appearance in the 1994 Australian final, Martin has
faded in and out as a threat on the men's tour because of nagging
injuries that seemed to sabotage every rise he made in the
rankings. In 1996, he finished the year ranked 12th. A year later,
after an elbow injury that put his tennis on hold for seven months,
his ranking had plummeted to a dismal No. 81.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he cannot get through a hotel lobby unnoticed after the two
weeks he has had. ``It's nice; you're carrying your bags, and
people stop you,'' Martin said. ``It's not bad; it's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has only himself to thank for this newfound celebrity.
Instead of fitting himself for a cardigan and bingo, Martin decided
it was not time to retire, but the moment to seize a chance and
come back fighting at the age of 29. For a while, during an
exhausting fourth-round match with Greg Rusedski, when Martin was
nearly undone by a stomach virus, he was down two sets to none and
watching his adversary serve for the match.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, through pride or divine intervention, Martin survived
in a five-set match that left him so physically drained that he was
spread out in the training room for two hours receiving fluids
through a tube.
</P>
<P>
   His revival was stunning enough as he advanced through the
semifinals against Slava Dosedel in four sets. But Saturday, Martin
showed what a nice rest and a healthy glow can do to his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he played too good,'' Pioline said. ``He was reading
very well the ball today, catching everything. Very few unforced
errors and serving big,'' said Pioline, who watched 14 Martin aces
go by in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him play like this,'' Pioline said. ``I think
he has a good chance'' to win in the final.

 (ATTN: Ariz., Texas) 
GIULIANI HAS KIND WORDS FOR McCAIN, BUT NO ENDORSEMENT  
(lh) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the sort of highly publicized event featuring
two politicians gearing up for major campaigns that under most
circumstances would reflect their mutual endorsement: Rudolph
Giuliani, the mayor who would be senator, and John McCain of
Arizona, the senator who would be president, chatting over
antipasto and seafood marinara at DaNico in Little Italy and
pretending not to notice the photographers and television cameras
all around them.
</P>
<P>
   But with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas now the far-and-away
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination with a
record $49 million in campaign contributions, these are not normal
circumstances. So even as Giuliani and McCain have developed a
close friendship, despite their effusive public embrace last week,
close political advisers to the mayor say he has already quietly
committed to endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself acknowledged that possibility on Wednesday,
saying it would not dampen his own support for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may make a decision on who he wishes to support for the
presidency of the United States; that matters little to me,''
McCain said after their lunch. ``What's important to me is to have
Mayor Giuliani in the United States Senate.'' He also said he did
not think the mayor's endorsement would matter in New Hampshire or
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, continued to dance a fine line between his
good pal from Arizona and Bush, who is expected to visit New York
City early next month to raise money. In recent weeks, Giuliani has
often said he believes Bush will be the Republican nominee, though
he tends to add that McCain would be a great choice, too. And last
week he continued to stress that he had not yet made an
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have said is very, very strong and supportive things
about Governor Bush and about Senator McCain,'' Giuliani said when
asked to clarify where he stood. ``And since Senator McCain is here
now, I think all that you'll find wherever he campaigns are words
of strong admiration for him. I think Senator McCain is an
exceptional senator. I think he is an exceptional American. I think
he is an exceptional man and I think he would make a very fine
president. But I haven't made an endorsement yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the mayor said they were in touch with the Bush
campaign and expressed confidence that the Texas governor was not
offended by the mayor's warm welcome of McCain, who was in New York
to promote his new book and attend the MTV Video Music Awards with
his wife and two daughters. In Austin, Texas, a spokesman for
Bush's campaign, Scott McClellan, said, ``Governor Bush thinks it's
great that Republican leaders are meeting with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Republican leaders are not likely to forget that
Giuliani in the past has proved unpredictable in his political
endorsements. Most notably, of course, he crossed party lines to
endorse Mario Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, over George Pataki
in the 1994 gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they know Giuliani has every reason to step in
line because he will need strong support from national Republican
leaders if he runs for Senate next year against Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who is expected to seek the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if Giuliani, who is not known for being self-conscious, felt
any pressure to be less vocal about his warm friendship with
McCain, he did not show it last week. He put the DaNico lunch date
on his public schedule, thereby inviting the New York press corps,
helped McCain promote his book, and even expressed strong support
for the senator's bill on campaign finance reform, saying he would
vote in favor of it if he were a senator.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the last two years, Giuliani and McCain have helped each
other raise money in New York, Arizona and Washington and even
attended the Fiesta Bowl college football game together this year
in Phoenix. They disagree on a number of policy points _ the mayor,
for example, supports abortion rights, while McCain does not _ but
they said their friendship transcended politics, and McCain even
tried to make light of the mayor's probable support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not asked for his endorsement,'' McCain said. ``In fact
I have specifically not asked for it, because I don't think that
friends ask friends to do things that may not be beneficial to them
politically. My first priority is to have Mayor Giuliani in the
United States Senate, and I will do everything in my power.'' He
paused. ``And if that means that he endorses Al Gore, that's OK
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the mayor suggested that the timing of an
endorsement would depend on the wishes of Bush's campaign and would
almost certainly be orchestrated to make the best use of New York's
huge media market. Giuliani visited the Governor's Mansion in
Austin in April, and Bush has a standing invitation to come to New
York. But Giuliani himself said last week that he did not know when
he would make an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said he was in New
York primarily to promote his new book, ``Faith of My Fathers,''
about his family's three generations of service in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on a book tour,'' McCain said, holding up a copy that he
had given to the mayor, even as he clearly anticipated that most of
the attention would be on politics. ``I came primarily to hype this
book rather than see my friend Rudy, who I get to see most any
time. So I hope that you understand what this is really all
about.''

WHITMAN REVELS IN REFOCUSING ON THE JOB SHE HAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ As her abridged run for the U.S. Senate fades
into memory, Gov. Christie Whitman is beginning to sound like
someone enjoying a second honeymoon with her job in the New Jersey
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman stunned the political world on Tuesday when she withdrew
from the race to replace Sen. Frank Lautenberg, saying that the
demands of raising $100,000 a week made it impossible to focus on
the daily issues facing the state. And while the governor conceded
that she had not fully decided what agenda she would pursue during
her final 28 months in office, she warned that it was far too early
to write her political obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits will force Whitman to step down on Jan. 1, 2002, and
because she is no longer constrained by the need to court potential
voters, she suggested that she might use that freedom to tackle
some unexpectedly ambitious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge relief,'' the governor said. ``It will be fun to
think about policy issues without having to factor in the possible
political consequences. It allows you to do what you think is right
and take on some of the sacred cows.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who bristled in recent months whenever her
decisions were interpreted as a tactical maneuver for the Senate
race, seemed buoyant as she discussed plans to fine-tune policies
like her effort to preserve one million acres of open space or
improve the quality of preschool education.
</P>
<P>
   Although she might one day be interested in working for a
Republican administration in Washington, Whitman scoffed at
suggestions that she had abandoned the Senate bid because she had
been offered a Cabinet post by George W. Bush, a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The governor even joked about the New Jersey Republicans who
have publicly criticized her for throwing the state party into
disarray by backing out of the Senate race seven months after
entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better that I did it now rather than seven months from
now,'' she said with a laugh. ``It's still a long, long way until
Election Day. And there's plenty of time to decide on a qualified
candidate, put out a message and win that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's lightheartedness was a stark contrast with her
description of the expected drudgery of the Senate campaign. She
said she agreed to run for the Senate after scores of Republicans
convinced her that she would be the party's strongest candidate.
The seat being vacated by Lautenberg, a Democrat, simply presented
too tempting a political opportunity to pass up. But even when she
announced her candidacy, Whitman seemed more regretful about ending
her second gubernatorial term early than excited about the prospect
of becoming a senator. That ambivalence was magnified, the governor
said, by the relentless need to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Under any circumstance, New Jersey is an expensive state in
which to run a statewide race, because its candidates have to pay
for advertisements in two of the nation's most expensive markets,
New York and Philadelphia. For the Senate race next year,
Republicans also faced the daunting prospect that one of the
leading Democratic contenders, Jon Corzine, a former chairman of
Goldman, Sachs, is willing to tap into his $300 million personal
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's advisers said she expected former Gov. Jim Florio to
win the Democratic nomination. She nonetheless undertook a
withering schedule in hope of raising at least $10 million. ``It
just seemed never-ending,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the governor said, she was growing increasingly weary
of seeing her every move as governor viewed through the prism of
the race. The speculation reached comic proportions last month, she
said, when she declared a drought emergency and heard assorted
suggestions that she was trying to placate some bloc of voters or
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd forgotten how much I hated it, the second-guessing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Whitman family took a week of vacation in Nova
Scotia in late August, Whitman began discussing her plans with her
husband, John, and their two children. At first, her husband urged
her to press on with the Senate bid, but she eventually convinced
him that her heart just was not in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Whitman said, the soul-searching helped her accept
that her personality and management style were far better suited to
supervising than to legislating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do enjoy the role of executive,'' she said. ``It's wonderful
to be able to see a problem, identify a solution and watch things
happen. It's hard to get that kind of direct job satisfaction
elsewhere. It would have been different in the Senate, frustrating
at times, but that doesn't mean you don't do it. You'd have to find
your satisfaction by helping to shape the debate instead of taking
direct action.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Trenton have occasionally made that same
observation about Whitman, and said her imperial style of governing
has caused unnecessarily rocky relations. So it is questionable
whether she can push any landmark proposals through as a lame duck
_ especially because the state's two legislative leaders, Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, are
believed to be positioning themselves to try to succeed her as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Whitman, New Jersey gives more power to its governor
than almost any other state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After weathering opposition in the state Senate, Whitman and her
appointed attorney general will soon be free to press ahead with
their plans to overhaul the New Jersey State Police, a force beset
by charges of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The governor plans to push for several ``smart growth''
restrictions to control suburban sprawl. If she chooses, Whitman
can also champion any number of proposals she has advocated in the
past, perhaps expanded programs for the elderly or school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said she planned to push to hold school board
elections at the same time as existing political primaries, to
increase voter turnout and make school boards more accountable to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she would consult with Cabinet members next week.
``There are going to be new things,'' she said. ``I just don't know
what they are yet, but no, I don't have a surprise 35th tax cut to
unveil today.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Shaw, a lobbyist who was Whitman's chief of staff in 1994
and 1995, said: ``There is still time to be bold. She has talked
about privatizing the Meadowlands, she could be very aggressive in
promoting Jersey City and Bayonne as a deep-water port, and she
needs to follow through on the plan to repair the state's schools
and build new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   If Whitman completes her term, she will also be able to deepen
her effect on the state Supreme Court. She has already appointed
four of the seven justices, and since two more members of the bench
are scheduled to retire in the next two years, she can strengthen
her effort to rein in a court once known for its judicial daring.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have criticized Whitman for diluting the
highly scholarly composition of the bench, but the governor insists
that she is merely restoring the court to its proper role as a body
that interprets law without making new law.
</P>
<P>
   Like all elected officials approaching the end of a final term,
Whitman will also have the opportunity to put the finishing touches
on her record. Perhaps she will even be able to reconcile the
paradox of her public perception.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the state, Whitman has built a distinct national
reputation as a fiscal conservative who is moderate on social
issues like abortion and gay rights. Among New Jersey residents,
however, Whitman's image is surprisingly ill-defined, even after
nearly six years in office.
</P>
<P>
   She was first elected in 1993 as a tax cutter, and even today
Whitman passes up few opportunities to mention the 34 tax cuts
enacted during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey's property taxes are still among the highest in
the nation, so most public opinion polls show that less than a
quarter of all voters have a high opinion of her tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a recent poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at
Rutgers University found that fewer than 30 percent of New Jersey
voters believe that her record includes any major achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's seen as sort of a George Bush Republican,'' said Cliff
Zukin, public policy professor and director of the
Star-Ledger-Eagleton poll. ``She wants to steer the ship safely and
responsibly. But she doesn't want to go any place particularly
exotic or get there very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor disputes that characterization, and contends that
she has been as effective a policy trailblazer as she is a civic
caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already made some very bold moves on taxes, auto reform,
open space preservation, school standards and other issues,'' she
said. ``And I intend to continue running an activist
administration.''

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S UNMET OBLIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Though rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Al
Gore and Bill Bradley are both trying to restore a shamefully
neglected issue to its rightful place at the forefront of public
debate. The issue is health insurance _ specifically, this
country's grievous failure to provide coverage for nearly one-sixth
of its population.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians have turned from this issue ever since
President Clinton's proposal for universal health coverage crashed
in 1993, a victim of political mismanagement. But the problem has
not gone away, and remains a vivid and embarrassing rebuke to
American democracy. As Bradley observed last week in announcing his
candidacy, ``While kings and dictators come to this country for the
best health care treatment in the world, you and I both know that
this care is not available to the 45 million citizens who have no
health insurance at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Congress bickers over regulating health maintenance
organizations and otherwise seeks to improve the system for people
who do have health insurance, the plight of those who do not have
insurance gets worse by the day. Despite an extraordinary economic
boom and an unemployment rate that is at the lowest level in more
than 25 years, the number of uninsured Americans has steadily risen
by about 1 million a year over the past decade. This number will
probably continue to rise as more children are born, more Americans
switch from manufacturing jobs that provide insurance to service
jobs that do not, and more people leave the welfare system, which
provides health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has yet to propose a specific program, although he is
expected to soon. Gore is further down the programmatic road,
having last week unveiled a plan to provide health insurance for 11
million to 15 million uncovered Americans, mostly children. The
proposal is modest compared with Clinton's original plan to
guarantee health insurance for everyone. Gore's rationale for not
being more ambitious is that ``we have all learned that we cannot
overhaul the system in one fell swoop.'' He also notes that his
program seeks to cover one of the most vulnerable segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the plan would expand the Children's Health
Insurance Program, a federally subsidized state-run program created
in 1997 that helps insure children in families earning up to about
$33,000 a year for four people. Gore would raise that income
ceiling so that families earning 2.5 times the official poverty
level, or about $41,000, could qualify. The program would also
allow uninsured parents of children who are eligible for Medicaid
or CHIP to buy subsidized insurance for themselves, and in various
ways would encourage states to seek out and enroll every child who
may be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Constructive as they are, Gore's ideas will still leave some 30
million Americans without any real help. Most of these are working
poor adults, including a disproportionate number of minorities.
Gore may be right when he suggests that after the Clinton debacle
in 1993, only an incremental approach will pass muster with
Congress and the country. It may also be true that if he and
Bradley continue to push health care to the front of their
campaigns, the opportunity may come around again to force Congress
to take a more sweeping approach. But for now, these Democratic
rivals have helped put the question of universal health care back
on the national agenda and, in so doing, have reminded everyone of
America's unmet obligation to 45 million people for whom a medical
setback could mean financial ruin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When C. Mark Pickrell was an associate at a big New
York law firm three years ago, helping to defend a large cigarette
company against anti-smoking lawsuits filed by Mississippi and New
Jersey, a colleague nicknamed him Brimstone, joking that he would
surely go to hell for having represented Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pickrell is in another courtroom struggle. But this time he
is fighting a big corporation, not defending one.
</P>
<P>
   He is representing a one-man Internet newsletter against a
lawsuit filed by Ford Motor Co., the world's second-largest
corporation. And using skills developed in legal battles over
smoking, he is trying to start a legal war over whether Detroit
automakers colluded to avoid the expense of manufacturing sport
utility vehicles that might produce less air pollution while
getting better fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell insists that he sees many parallels between his former
legal work and the current lawsuit. ``As I look at it, I keep
saying, `It's like tobacco.''' Pickrell said. ``The similarities
that I've seen are unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials declined to comment on any issue regarding the
litigation with Lane, any antitrust issues or any comparisons
between smoking and sport utility vehicle issues. Auto industry
officials have dismissed suggestions of collusion in the past,
saying that the auto market is too competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell has already won the first round in his fight. Ford had
sought a preliminary injunction against Pickrell's client, Robert
Lane, who operates the Internet site, www.blueovalnews.com, which
provides news on Ford vehicles for auto enthusiasts. The injunction
would have prevented Lane from using, copying or discussing boxes
full of internal Ford documents that someone had mailed him
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge turned down most of Ford's request last
Tuesday, saying that the free-speech provision of the First
Amendment protected Lane even though the documents might be trade
secrets and might be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruling, Pickrell had engaged in a helter-skelter
legal dash worthy of the recent genre of lawyer novels. Pickrell,
who is the sole lawyer in his law office in Nashville, Tenn., heard
about the lawsuit from a friend on Aug. 27, a Friday. He sent Lane
a fax that afternoon, offering his legal services for a nominal
fee. Lane called back that evening to say that he was due in
federal court in Detroit for a hearing the following Monday morning
and did not have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a 33-year-old nursing student who lives several blocks
from Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., could not afford to
pay for a last-minute, full-fare airline ticket to Detroit for
Pickrell. But Lane is married to a flight attendant for Northwest
Airlines, who sent Pickrell a so-called ``buddy pass'' to allow him
to buy a very cheap ticket at a rate available only to friends of
airline personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Detroit on Sunday morning, Pickrell, who is also 33,
spent all day and night looking up legal precedents on CD-ROMs and
electronic databases on his laptop computer, drafting a legal brief
and making photocopies at a Kinko's store. Lane said that the two
men were able to talk for only 15 minutes about what he would say
on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Whatever you do, don't lie,''' Lane recalled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Ford lawyers mentioned in the hearing that what had
really upset Ford was Lane's posting on his Internet site of
internal Ford documents relating to the Environmental Protection
Agency. One of these documents, for example, discussed problems
that Ford will face in meeting air pollution standards as it moves
to install diesel engines in more of its full-sized sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell contended that the lawyer's comment showed that Lane
should be treated legally not as someone who recklessly disregarded
trade secrets and copyrights, as Ford alleged, but rather as a
journalist who had been gathering news about a public policy issue
involving the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the judge ruled in Lane's favor, Ford's lawyers had
demanded from Pickrell extensive information about the content and
source of the documents in Lane's possession. Pickrell has
responded by asking Ford for extensive documents regarding its
discussions with competitors and the Environmental Protection
Agency regarding air-pollution technologies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   While representing Brown &AMP; Williamson, a large cigarette
company, Pickrell had learned a lot about the issue of whether
tobacco companies deliberately avoided selling cigarettes that
would emit fewer carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds broke ranks with other tobacco companies in 1988
when it began marketing the Premier as a ``safer'' cigarette. While
the Premier was a failure in the marketplace, plaintiff lawyers
responded to it by saying the product showed that less dangerous
cigarettes had long been possible.
</P>
<P>
   With this legal background, Pickrell said that during the
current lawsuit he immediately became interested in Ford's decision
21 months ago to break ranks with other automakers and redesign all
of its sport utility vehicles to emit as little air pollution as
cars. Federal regulations allow sport utility vehicles to emit two
to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some top auto executives have suggested that Ford broke a
``gentleman's agreement'' among Detroit automakers not to compete
on who could build the least polluting vehicles. While Japanese
automakers have done well in the U.S. car market, Detroit
completely dominated the sport utility vehicle market until the
last couple of years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, read a news
report in May mentioning auto industry cooperation and wrote a
letter to the Justice Department urging an antitrust investigation
into whether automakers had conspired to not install
pollution-control equipment, particularly on sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nader became famous in the 1960s partly for persuading the
Johnson administration to file an identical antitrust lawsuit and
then accusing Detroit automakers of conspiring to not develop or
install pollution-control gear; the consent decree from that case
expired during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rose, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the
agency was preparing a response to Nader's letter, but she declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford documents briefly posted this summer on Lane's Internet
site show that the automaker is working on improvements in
pollution and fuel economy. One document, for example, projected
that the fuel economy of Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer
sport utility vehicles could be improved by 26 percent over the
next decade. But the documents gave no indication of the cost or
feasibility of such a change.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell's tobacco experience may not be his only special
expertise for the case. He left New York and returned to his home
state of Tennessee two years ago because of temporary health
problems and a desire to be his own boss. His law practice in
Nashville now specializes in appeals to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Cincinnati; he is a former clerk of the court's chief
judge, Boyce Martin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The court handles federal appeals from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky
and Tennessee, and will receive any appeals from Ford's lawsuit in
Detroit.

JOHN K. TABOR, 78, LAWYER AND OFFICIAL IN COMMERCE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., D.C.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John K. Tabor, a lawyer who was prominent in Republican Party
politics in Pennsylvania in the 1960s and was under-secretary of
commerce in the Nixon administration, died on Monday in Alexandria,
Va. He was 78 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon named him to the
commerce post, to 1975, when he returned to his law practice, Tabor
pursued policies intended to promote U.S. exports and stimulate
minority business enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   He first gained experience in this field in 1963, when Gov. Bill
Scranton of Pennsylvania appointed him to lead the state's Commerce
Department. A few years later, he defeated a popular incumbent and
was elected secretary of internal affairs, the No. 3 office in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   John Kaye Tabor was born in Uniontown, Pa., and reared in
Pittsburgh. He graduated from Yale University in 1943 and later
served in the Navy in World War II as the captain of a mine
sweeper.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he received a master's degree in history from
Cambridge University in England and a law degree from Harvard in
1950, and then worked for law firms in New York City and
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, he reduced
his law practice and began teaching corporate law at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va. He also wrote a privately published
biography of his father, Edward O. Tabor, a lawyer active in civic
affairs in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Kate Williams Tabor of Washington, he is
survived by two sons, John K. Jr., of Portsmouth, N.H., and William
H., of Alexandria, and three grandchildren.

NYC GIRDS FOR WEEKEND OF SPRAYING TO COMBAT ENCEPHALITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As residents of the five boroughs geared up for a
weekend of pesticide spraying, the number of possible cases of St.
Louis encephalitis, the mosquito-borne viral disease, rose to 89 in
the city Saturday, with 31 added since Friday, city officials said.
The number of confirmed cases remained at nine.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the 31 cases is considered ``probable,'' in which
the likelihood of infection is greater than 50 percent, said Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in a news conference at City Hall on Saturday. All
the other new cases fall under either the city's ``suspected''
category, in which the chances of infection are about 1 in 10, or
``low probability'' category, in which there is almost no chance of
finding encephalitis, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the situation as it existed yesterday is pretty
much the same,'' Giuliani said. ``We don't have any more definite
cases. We do have one more probable case.''
</P>
<P>
   Three people have died of the disease since last week, when city
officials first became aware of the outbreak. Eight of the nine
confirmed cases of encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can
be fatal, especially in babies and the elderly, were in Queens. One
case was found in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   To fight the spread of the disease, the city began a
weekend-long land and air insecticide bombardment of mosquitoes
Saturday evening in sections of all five boroughs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Airplanes and helicopters sprayed the insecticide malathion over
the eastern half of the Bronx, southwestern Queens and a section of
Staten Island between 5 and 9:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks roaming through sections of Brooklyn, including the
downtown area and Brooklyn Heights, were scheduled to spray a
different insecticide, resmethrine, between 11 p.m. Saturday and 6
a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 5 p.m. Sunday, aircraft will spray over northern and
eastern Queens, Roosevelt Island, Wards Island and Randalls Island,
and northern Staten Island. Trucks will spray throughout Central
Park between 11 p.m. Sunday night and 6 a.m. Monday, according to
the city's schedule. Midtown and lower Manhattan will be sprayed by
trucks starting at 11 p.m. Monday, although Times Square may be
spared until Tuesday, officials said. In all, the city's Office of
Emergency Management is using 11 trucks, 5 helicopters and one
airplane, which will be used solely over Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, according to maps distributed to reporters Saturday,
every inch of New York City will have been treated. But the mayor
and city health officials stressed that neither spray is dangerous
to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very unlikely that anyone would have any health
effects of any concern, even if they were directly under the
spray,'' said Dr. Bob Hoffman, the director of the New York City
Poison Center, speaking at the news conference. ``People should
really feel comfortable with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani hammered home his own reassurances, pointing out that
very few mosquitoes actually are thought to carry the encephalitis
disease, and reassuring the public about the sprays, which he noted
were being used in small concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was reassured. Manhattan Borough President
Virginia Fields went to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue on
Saturday afternoon to respond to what she said was a flood of calls
to her office from residents worried about plans for the nighttime
spraying of all of Manhattan north of 110th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of shoppers at the Pathmark store on that corner came by
to pick up fliers detailing precautions to take during the spraying
and how to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Most said they were
more concerned about the pesticides than about the mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields said that she had been assured by city officials and
toxicology experts that the pesticide would not hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course this is an issue in question that has been
raised and continues to be raised by people in the community,'' she
said.

U.N. SAYS JAKARTA IS EASING OPPOSITION TO PEACEKEEPERS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Saturday that
Indonesia seems to be softening its position daily on the
deployment of international peacekeeping troops in East Timor and
that he hopes to get an official go-ahead from President B.J.
Habibie on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be indications that there may be a shift in the
Indonesian position,'' Annan said as he arrived for the first open
Security Council debate on East Timor, at which perhaps more than
two dozen nations are expected to speak over a period of two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be talking to President Habibie tomorrow morning,'' he
added, ``and I hope I will be able to hear from him directly what
the position is.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Indonesia may be considering allowing a
previously planned peacekeeping operation to be deployed in the
territory ahead of schedule, which would amount to a face-saving
compromise under which Indonesia could avoid appearing to have
caved in to international demands for an immediate intervention
force.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed by Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations on May 5, a peacekeeping force was to have been permitted
to enter East Timor after the Indonesian Parliament had ratified
the results of the territory's vote for independence later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers would then be responsible for law and order as
political power is transferred to the East Timorese and elections
would be held in the new nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday Wiranto was saying in three months time,'' Annan
said. ``Today he seems to have softened the position, indicating
that they may allow the peacekeepers to go in earlier. I hope the
decision will be taken soon, not later.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's unusual open session of the Security Council was
demanded by Portugal, the former colonial overlord of the
territory, which had spent the week pressing furiously for a public
debate. All council sessions on the issue last week were held
behind closed doors, as all member nations balked at forcing a
violation of the agreement with Indonesia by deploying troops
without Jakarta's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go straight to the point,'' said Antonio Monteiro,
Portugal's delegate to the United Nations, said in his speech
Saturday. ``Portugal has repeatedly requested this meeting of the
Security Council to confront the council with its responsibilities
in managing the appalling crisis in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rape of East Timor has taken place before our eyes,'' he
said. ``The United Nations cannot, must not, afford once again to
intervene in a conflict only to stand by while the process then
loses its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the council before his speech, Monteiro told
reporters that the shift in Indonesia's position on troops was
``exactly what we want.'' Portugal, which decided to abandon East
Timor in 1974, has worked for nearly a quarter of a century to
dislodge Indonesia, which seized the territory by force in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In his first formal speech to the Security Council, the new U.S.
representative here, Richard C. Holbrooke, said: ``It is imperative
that the international community speak with one voice, and our
message must be clear: Indonesia's government must allow an
international security presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reports that the Indonesian government may be
prepared to accept such a force,'' he added. ``We urge it to do so
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Council session was the first part of a two-day
meeting that will culminate on Monday with a report from a
five-member Security Council team that spent most of last week in
Indonesia, capped by a visit Saturday to East Timor.

GIVEN A CHANCE, SOME PLAYERS HAVING BREAKTHROUGH SEASONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early last season, Brian Giles became part of the plan that has
helped make the Cleveland Indians the perennial division champions
they are. With less than two years of major-league service, he
enrolled in the club's long-term signing strategy, agreeing to a
three-year contract worth a minimum of $5.45 million. Seven months
later, however, the Indians traded Giles to the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to trade in winning,'' he said. ``Everybody wants
to do that in their career. Over there I had that opportunity for
three years. But it was getting to the point in my career where if
I didn't get out of there and get a chance to play every day and
show what I can do, I'd be a role player the rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing center field on a regular basis, Giles has had a
breakthrough season. He entered the weekend with a .315 batting
average, 36 home runs and 108 runs batted in. Not since Dave Parker
in 1978 have the Pirates had a player lead them in those Triple
Crown categories with a .300 average, 30 home runs and 100 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   But Giles is only one of a group of players who are having
breakthrough seasons, seasons in which they either get the chance
to be regulars or play themselves into the everyday lineup and
respond with productive performances.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno, for example, never played more than 105 games in a
season, never hit .300 and had a total of 23 stolen bases in 311
games over four seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. With the Mets
this season, he has been a regular outfielder, a .300 hitter and a
base-stealing threat with, at last count, 61 steals.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Mike Sweeney is having a similar experience,
though minus the stolen bases. In four seasons, he had not played
more than 92 games and had career highs of .279, eight homers and
35 RBI. In 128 games before the weekend, the first
baseman/designated hitter was hitting .313 with 20 home runs and 94
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett has received the playing time the past two seasons,
but this season with Houston he has taken greater advantage of it.
He is reaching career highs with 21 home runs and 93 RBI and, with
a .331 batting average, positioning himself to hit .300 for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro has emerged so dramatically in Montreal that he has
knocked Wilton Guerrero from second base to left field. After
splitting the previous two seasons between the Expos and the minor
leagues, Vidro has blossomed with an average hovering around .320.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens has not produced flashy numbers for San Diego, but
after failing the past three seasons to establish major league
credentials with Cincinnati and Milwaukee, he has become a
versatile starter with the Padres. Playing five different
positions, three outfield, two infield, Owens has hit in the .270s.
</P>
<P>
   Among these and other players who are having breakthrough years,
Giles has broken through most substantially. The Indians would miss
him if they did not already have the best hitting team in the
American League, although they would like to have received more
effective relief pitching from Ricardo Rincon, whom they acquired
for Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' the 28-year-old Giles
said. ``Obviously, playing part-time in Cleveland and putting up
the numbers I did, people project what you can do over 500 at-bats,
but I didn't know what to expect and I didn't have any
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two seasons, Giles averaged one home run every 22
at-bats. This season Giles has averaged one homer every 13.4
at-bats. He attributed his improvement to playing every day.
``That's the biggest difference, knowing you're in the lineup every
day,'' he said. ``It takes the pressure off you. After an 0-for-4
game you know you're going to be out there the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   When he missed games, it was by design. ``Geno's been pretty
good with me,'' Giles said, referring to manager Gene Lamont. ``We
kind of have an understanding. If he thinks I need a day, he'll
tell me the day before. Or if I feel I need a day, if I feel tired,
I'll tell him. That approach has taken a lot of pressure off me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Giles signed his contract, for three years plus an option
year, he was a part-time player. Does he regret having done that
considering that now he is a starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Giles said. ``I signed the contract for my own
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Security perhaps? ``That's the first thing you look at,'' he
said. ``When my wife and I sat down and talked about it and made
the decision, I knew what I was getting into. When I signed the
deal, I was happy with it. I'm still happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the possibility of more playing time, the contract
has bonuses for number of plate appearances and a clause that will
raise Giles' salary by $200,000 for any season after he has 600
plate appearances, which he is nearing now.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' departure from Cleveland created additional playing time
for Richie Sexson, who despite his production is not an everyday
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here in Pittsburgh we'd love to throw him out for 550
at-bats and see what kind of numbers he can put up,'' Giles said.
``I hope Richie gets that opportunity; he deserves it. But I looked
at a box score the other day, and he wasn't in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Already at the 100-RBI plateau, Sexson doesn't need a
breakthrough offensively, but a full-time job could take him to
another level.

 ROGERS' REALITY  
 BELLE VS. BELL  
 BRAINLOCK ON 3 OUTS  
 SCHISM AFFECTS GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isn't it time to bury the fairy tale about how Kenny Rogers came
to New York in 1996 and became Ed Whitson, unable to pitch under
the pressure of the city where fans eat losers for lunch?
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who struggled for two seasons with the Yankees, has
started eight games for the Mets and won four, and the Mets have
won seven of the games Rogers has started. The team has won all
five of his starts at Shea Stadium, where he has compiled a 1.95
earned run average. Yet stories about his days with the Yankees
continue to be dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a good story at the time,'' Rogers said in his
soft-spoken way that his critics construe as indifference. ``I
never thought it was a problem where I was pitching. I always knew
exactly what it was. I knew it was how I was pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers acknowledged distractions exist in New York that do not
exist elsewhere. But he said: ``I wasn't able to compete well by
then. Nobody knew about it or really cared about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, whom the Yankees had signed as an expensive free agent,
created his own problems by not disclosing that he had been injured
late in spring training. The bruised left shoulder affected the
team's pitching plans, and Rogers' secrecy soured Manager Joe Torre
on his new left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rogers said: ``I was so happy my first year in New
York it was unbelievable. That's the best year I've ever had
because of everything I went through. Nobody wants to know that,
and nobody knew it at the time. I was so proud of that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for his abbreviated start in the playoffs. ``The
playoffs, yeah, I didn't do very well,'' he said, ``but I got 12
wins when everything was terrible. At the time, it wasn't good
enough for everybody else. I never really cared what everybody
said. If they wanted to blame me, that's fine. I could take it,
whether it was true or not. But I know I can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has proved that in Texas, he has proved it in Oakland and
now he is proving it in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Belle vs. Bell
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since opening day, Albert Belle passed Jay
Bell in a ding-dong of a home run race that has not caught the
fans' fancy as much as the one between guys named Sosa and McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last Tuesday when Belle struck his 33rd home run in
Baltimore's fourth inning. But just as happened on opening day,
Bell did not let the Belle lead stand. The Arizona second baseman,
who in the previous four seasons hit 67 home runs to Belle's 177,
connected for his 33rd in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   In another, even more intriguing race, Sammy Sosa took a 59-56
lead into the Cubs' weekend series in Houston. That was 59 home
runs for Sosa, 56 victories for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Brainlock on 3 Outs
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin suggested that because the Montreal Expos were in
town, ``it might have been the Canadian exchange rate, four outs
for three.'' The San Diego third baseman was talking about the
collective brainlock that occurred in the seventh inning of the
game Thursday. Reggie Sanders struck out for the Padres' third out,
but the umpires didn't realize there were three outs and neither
did the Expos. So Nevin went to the plate and Ted Lilly threw him
three pitches before the Expos alerted Jerry Layne, the plate
umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Layne's out counter said three, but when no one started in from
or out to the field, he figured his indicator must be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The National League office did not take a stern view of the
incident. ``It wasn't that only one person wasn't paying
attention,'' Katy Feeney, the league's senior vice president, said.
``No one ran off the field. From what I understand it was an honest
mistake and fortunately it was caught before anything happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Schism Affects Grief
</P>
<P>
   That the schism between two groups of umpires will not ease soon
was evident last week at the funeral for Kim Coble, wife of Drew
Coble, one of the 22 umpires who lost their jobs in a backfired
labor strategy. The funeral in Graham, N.C., was attended by 10
umpires from the pro-Richie Phillips faction and four from the
insurgent group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very awkward; there's no other way to describe it,''
Steve Rippley, a National League umpire, said. ``You're there
grieving for Kim's sake and you have other issues that are still
active.''

A SLIGHT PAUCITY OF PUMPKINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, N.Y. _ The news from the pumpkin fields of Orange
County is a bit unsettling. Thanks to the hot, dry days of July,
this fall's pumpkin crop will come in shy of bumper. Farmers say
the outlook is not all that bleak. But it is not bountiful, either.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, farmers say, a summer of scant rainfall, below
normal pollination (blame balky bees) and the growing popularity of
the pumpkin will lead to a mild shortage. When the farmers say
``mild,'' they mean that farms and wholesalers will get enough
locally grown and imported pumpkins to roadside stands,
pick-your-own fields and green markets to satisfy everybody. But in
a classic case of demand exceeding supply, pumpkins will cost a few
cents more a pound this Halloween season, they say, than last.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hoeffner, 61 and a fifth-generation farmer, grows 40 acres
of pumpkins on his 400-acre produce farm here. ``At best, we have
half a crop of pumpkins, and that's stretching it,'' he said. Some
of Hoeffner's pumpkin acreage had no irrigation pipes. Irrigated
acres suffered from poor pollination, either because pumpkin
blossoms closed prematurely or bees performed poorly in July's
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like it too cold or too hot,'' Maire Ullrich, an
agent with the Cornell Cooperative Extension Association in Orange
County, said of bees. ``They work best between 70 and 85 degrees
and they get cranky on either end of that spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Shuback also had some pollination problems on the 90
acres of pumpkins he had squeezed onto his 700-acre sod farm in the
fabled black dirt of Florida, down the road from Montgomery. But
his biggest woe was the 10 acres of pumpkins he had planted in
sandy soil next to the black dirt, which sits a few inches above
the water table and is very fertile. Those 10 acres foundered in
the drought, he said. ``It looks like I'll have a decent crop; not
big, but decent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Shuback's customers are garden centers within a 100-mile
radius of his farm. Last year, he said, he sold his pumpkins to the
centers for 12 to 14 cents a pound, and they in turn sold them for
29 to 35 cents a pound. This fall, Shuback's wholesale price will
be 15 to 20 cents a pound. He expects the centers to raise their
prices by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffner is playing it cagey for now. He said he was not quoting
his wholesale price yet and would wait until he saw what the market
would bear. Traditionally, he has sold most of his pumpkins to
suburban garden centers on Long Island and in Connecticut and
northern New Jersey. Some then sell the pumpkins at their roadside
stands. At others, Hoeffner or his helpers leave the pumpkins in
small fields that cater to schoolchildren on pumpkin-buying outings
and families on weekend pumpkin-picking excursions. ``We call them
instant pumpkins,'' Hoeffner said. ``At night, the fields are
empty. In the morning they're full of pumpkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, his customers farthest from Manhattan sold
pumpkins for 29 to 30 cents a pound. Those closer charged 45 to 55
cents a pound, and in some cases 60 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I figure those near New York will be looking for 75
cents a pound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That means that a nice 10-pound Howden, the broad-faced,
thick-skinned pumpkin ideal for carving jack-o'-lanterns, will
command $7.50 in the more expensive centers.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Hoeffner and Shuback said, they did not bother
with pumpkins because demand was skimpy. But the '90s has brought a
steady increase in the popularity of Halloween and the willingness
of people to spend for pumpkins and Halloween's other trappings,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to entertainment and it comes to fun _ and
that's what pumpkins are _ people seem to have enough money,''
Hoeffner said. ``They squawk about food every time they walk out of
our stand. They'll buy three ears of corn for $1 and ask, `When is
the price coming down?' But they'll pay 60 cents a pound for
pumpkins and laugh when they take them out. Price is no problem.
People do it for their children. If the cash market is worth the
while this year, pumpkins will find their way to New York City.''

IN ART-DRIVEN SOHO, DISPUTE BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND TRUCKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's 7 in the morning and the heavens are cerulean. A
gentle breeze whispers through SoHo's southeastern end. But this
artsy precinct of prosperity is not meekly yawning awake. Commerce
is already zipping ahead full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   A forklift on Broome Street ferries stacked crates of garlic and
watermelons from a truck to a warehouse several feet away. A few
doors down, another forklift carts a truckload of broccoli and bok
choy to a warehouse around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   With little notice beyond its borders, SoHo, a community best
known for chichi galleries, restaurants, boutiques, boites and
bars, has also become home to fruit and vegetable wholesalers and
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uneasy mix. In one corner are the wholesalers and
distributors, whose defenders describe them as honest businessmen
who have toiled in the district for years _ longer than many of the
residents now complaining. In the other are the loft-dwelling
artists, restaurateurs and gallery owners who complain that the
four companies are a bullying presence that are heedless of their
neighbors in ways that range from the annoying to the outright
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A civic group called the SoHo Alliance has sued Harry Tran, the
owner of a produce company, World Farm, accusing his employees of
operating forklifts dangerously on the sidewalks, blocking
crosswalks and fire hydrants with their trucks, leaving trucks
idling ``loudly and obnoxiously'' before dawn and using the streets
and sidewalks to store and unload produce.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Rosenstein, a community advocate who is a co-owner of a
loft building down the street from World Farm, is the most vocal
opponent of the wholesalers and distributors. ``This is an assault
on our community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the alliance have encouraged city officials to move
the businesses elsewhere. And they routinely call on the police and
fire departments to issue summonses to law-breaking truckers and
warehouse owners.
</P>
<P>
   Most owners of wholesale and distribution companies either
refused to be interviewed or directed questions to their spokesman,
Abraham Tan, the president of the Chinese Wholesalers and Retailers
Association of Greater New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who is also the owner of Valley View Farms, a produce
wholesale and distribution company in Chinatown, suggested that the
produce proprietors had as much right to be in the area as the
artists. He pointed out that Ban Produce, a wholesale operation,
had been in business for 15 years on Broome Street, longer than
some loft residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was SoHo?'' he asked. ``Nobody wanted it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Community advocates in Little Italy have joined in the SoHo
Alliance lawsuit. John Fratta, a Democratic district leader who was
born and raised in Little Italy, said the wholesalers were clearly
violating the rules of a special zoning district known as the
Mulberry Street Spine, which forbids warehousing. Little Italy,
which is a mere skeleton of its former size because of Chinatown's
expansion, has seen eight wholesalers and distributors move into
the neighborhood, Fratta said.
</P>
<P>
   Some produce wholesalers and distributors _ all of them Chinese
_ have suggested that bigotry is at the core of the objections to
their operations. At a community meeting, one Chinese man rose and
said: ``They're not only ignoring the ideas or opinions of the
Chinese people, they practice racial discrimination against them.
They dislike them because of racial prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the people thought it was racism,'' said a reporter
for a Chinese-language newspaper. ``I don't think it's racism. What
it is, is the SoHo people don't like the produce. They don't like
the traffic and the noise. They don't like businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for SoHo residents said charges of racism were
unfounded. ``It's not their ethnicity we're complaining about; it's
their conduct,'' said Jack Lester, the lawyer for the wholesalers'
adversaries. ``Their conduct would be odious whatever their
ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of World Farm has girded himself for a fight. ``I'm
sure things will go well for my client and he will be fully
vindicated,'' said Stephen Goldman, the company's lawyer. ``There's
a witch hunt going on down there.''

SECOND DEATH FROM E. COLI IS CONFIRMED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state and local health officials confirmed Saturday
that a 79-year-old Gansevoort man was the second person to die in
an outbreak of E. coli bacteria infections in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also raised the number of people hospitalized
with the illness Saturday to 60, two more than on Friday, according
to the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although almost all of the cases have been linked to the
contamination of a well at the Washington County Fair in Greenwich.
The authorities said that four people had become ill since Friday
after attending the Schaghticoke Fair in Rensselaer County, and E.
coli infections were suspected.
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, a spokesman for the State Health Department, said
investigators had determined that two food vendors had moved their
booths from the fair in Washington County to the one in Rensselaer
County, and may have carried contaminated well water with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have not had symptoms of the infection yet, you
probably are not going to get them,'' Signor said. ``The peak has
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the main threat of infection had been from well water
drawn at the Washington County Fair on Sept. 1, and since the
strain of E. coli involved, O157:H7, has an incubation period of
nine days, few more infections were expected.
</P>
<P>
   With health officials on high alert in much of upstate New York,
residents of Phoenix, an Oswego County village 135 miles east of
Albany, were advised Saturday to boil drinking water after
inspectors found E. coli in a test of school water fountains. No
illness was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Signor said state officials believed that the contamination in
Phoenix was unrelated to the outbreak around Albany because the two
were separated by great distances, and because isolated cases of E.
coli contamination are common across the nation, with about 20,000
reported annually.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state health officials, assisted by several local
agencies, continued to monitor the outbreak near Albany Saturday
and to warn people of the symptoms of E. coli infection, which
include diarrhea and abdominal pains.
</P>
<P>
   Signor said the initial cause had been identified as a
combination of heavy rain on Aug. 26 and the proximity of the
Washington County well to a farmyard containing cows, manure and an
area being excavated.
</P>
<P>
   He said the well, which had been tested by health inspectors as
recently as June, had been contaminated by runoff from the rain,
which carried bacteria from the manure into the well water.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two vendors who may have transported some of the
contaminated water to the Schaghticoke Fair ``would not have done
so intentionally.'' Nonetheless, he said people who suffer symptoms
of E. coli after having attended the fair in Rensselaer County
should consult their doctors, particularly if they consumed food or
drinks from either of the two vendors _ O'Sullivan Crows Enterprise
Taco Stand or S&AMP;W Caterers, which sells lemonade, coffee and ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   But Signor said the four people in Rensselaer County might not
have contacted E. coli infections at all, but ``just happened to
get diarrhea.''

THE RETURN OF THE ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hocheiser, a loan officer at Bank of America Mortgage in
Fairfield, N.J., is struck by how much the mortgage market has
changed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 27 loans in my pipeline right now, but only two of them
are 30-year fixed-rate loans, while the rest are adjustables,''
Hocheiser said. ``We're coming into a whole different kind of
mortgage market.''
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, that is not an understatement. While rates for
conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had sunk to less than 7
percent as recently as April, they have been mounting rapidly and
hit 8.31 percent in mid-August, according to HSH Associates, a
financial publisher in Butler, N.J., that tracks the market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the difference in cost between fixed-rate loans and
adjustables has widened enough since the beginning of the year to
make fixed-rate mortgages no longer look like ``virtual
no-brainers,'' said Keith Gumbinger, an HSH vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the pattern of the last two years, in which
historically low rates have made fixed-rate mortgages _ which carry
the same annual rate over the term of the loan _ the
all-but-automatic choice of most consumers, ``we're seeing a
shift,'' said Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, a
mortgage broker based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing people lock in at shorter-term adjustables,
usually where the rates are adjusted every three or five years,''
Bader said. Rates on such mortgages are recalculated after an
initial period, and often yearly thereafter, to reflect changes in
such interest indexes as the one-year Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a real estate market where houses often seem to be
mercilessly scarce and home prices are still skipping upward,
mortgage rates are not necessarily a top concern for all consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At White Horse Financial Services in Bronxville, N.Y., Edna
Haber, a mortgage broker, reports that most of her customers _ in a
market where ``20 people seem to be chasing every house'' _ are
more concerned with simply getting the property they want.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates have softened a bit since mid-August, averaging
7.88 percent as of midday last Thursday. And by historic standards
_ as well as the standards of the 1990s _ such rates are still low,
Gumbinger said. Still, the recent rate increase seems to have
already spurred many consumers to look hard at adjustable-rate
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a huge change in thinking,'' Hocheiser said. ``Even
when the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8 percent some
two years ago, we were still putting people into 30-year fixed-rate
loans. But now people are asking more for adjustables.''
</P>
<P>
   One consumer who recently decided to opt for an adjustable-rate
mortgage over a fixed-rate product is Robert Maina, who works for
an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Maina and his wife, Claire, who now live in Bayside, N.Y, are
buying a three-bedroom colonial-style home in Rockville Centre,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   When Maina began looking into mortgages in early July, he
discovered that the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan would have
been roughly 8.25 percent. He subsequently decided to go with a
30-year adjustable-rate mortgage on which the rate will be fixed at
7.75 percent for the first seven years, and adjusted annually after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As first-time home owners we wanted to be as conservative as
possible,'' said Maina. ``Besides, we view this home as a starter
home and I don't plan on being in the house more than seven years.
After that, if we're still there, we can always adjust our payment
after we refinance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate changes and a renewal in the popularity of adjustable-rate
mortgages are not the only recent developments in the mortgage
market. There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of
mortgage-related information available on the Internet and the
number of lenders participating. New mortgage products include
loans whose rates can only go down, as well as those that can be
used to pay off other debts, like credit-card loans.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal law has been enacted that gives homeowners the
right to cancel private mortgage insurance once their equity
reaches 20 percent. Borrowers who have less than terrific credit
are finding it easier to obtain mortgages than they once might
have. And finally, there has been a dramatic shift by consumers
away from refinancings, which accounted for a whopping 70 percent
of all mortgage volume a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank now offers its customers a home equity line
of credit that carries none of the expenses usually associated with
mortgages _ like closing costs or appraisal fees _ yet still lets
them take a tax deduction on their interest payments, as well as
consolidate outstanding bills, like credit card payments, often at
lower total monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies, including City Line Mortgage, a small
mortgage banker in San Diego, now offer mortgages whose rates
automatically go down when prevailing rates decrease, as a way of
hanging onto customers who might otherwise go elsewhere to
refinance. City Line is licensed to do business in 26 states.
</P>
<P>
   On the mortgage insurance front, the Homeowners Protection Act,
which took effect on July 29, gives consumers who are getting
mortgages the right to cancel their private mortgage insurance once
their equity reaches 20 percent. Such private mortgage insurance _
known as PMI _ is usually required when down payments are less than
20 percent; its costs are added to the monthly payments on the
mortgage itself. Under the new federal law, cancellation is
supposed to become automatic at 22 percent.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Consumers who have less than exemplary credit have benefited
lately from lenders who are willing to overlook bad credit
histories. In August, these mortgage shoppers found that they were
in a better position when using the Internet as well. That is when
Mortgage.com, an online lending site, announced a partnership with
Intuit Inc. to provide ``subprime'' mortgages at Intuit's
QuickenMortgage.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent changes in the mortgage market have had
widespread effects. The rise in interest rates, for example, has
reduced the number of homeowners who are refinancing their
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refinancings have just about completely dried up,'' said
Sterling Edmunds, president of Crestar Mortgage. ``Consumers feel
that because rates have gone up, they've probably missed the boat,
and they're probably right.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Lange, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, agreed. ``Refinancings are the first casualty when rates
rise,'' Lange said, ``and we've seen our refinancings drop from
about 50 percent to about 20 percent'' since the beginning of the
year for the industry as a whole. Lange is also president and chief
executive of Pacific Financial Services in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the Internet by mortgage shoppers, either to look up
mortgage-related information or to get actual loans, has been
rising, and is expected to increase even more.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.,
projects that online mortgage lending will grow from $18 billion in
1999 to over $91 billion in 2003, a figure representing 10 percent
of the value of all mortgages. James Punishill, an analyst at
Forrester, points out that compared with a year ago, consumers now
have a veritable bonanza of choices on line.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are not necessarily lower online, he cautioned.
But instead of automatically going to a mortgage broker, consumers
can save money by quickly comparing rates from dozens, if not
hundreds, of lenders at sites like QuickenMortgage.com,
LendingTree.com and RealEstate.com, which provides rates from more
than 220 lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago the choices were still pretty limited; we had a
handful of lenders, and none had their own products,'' Punishill
said. ``But now consumers have the pricing transparency that can
help them save.''
</P>
<P>
   Punishill has noticed another significant change online: Instead
of encouraging consumers to bypass mortgage brokers, a growing
number of Internet firms, like LoanCity.com, are offering consumers
access to brokers as part of their services.
</P>
<P>
   LoanCity.com offers a ``personalized service'' feature that the
company claims lets consumers work with brokers to complete all the
paperwork and still saves them about a third of the fees involved
in a traditional loan. ``A lot of consumers don't want to eliminate
brokers entirely,'' Punishill said. ``As a result, these firms are
now offering what might be described as `lite' advisory services.''
</P>
<P>
   While most mortgages being issued in recent weeks continue to be
the traditional fixed-rate types, the increase in interest rates in
recent months has changed the focus of many consumers.
Adjustable-rate mortgages are ``the hottest product right now,''
said Lange of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The borrower has become much more sophisticated than even two
or three years ago,'' he said. ``They're looking at mortgages and
are asking themselves how long they really intend to live in their
new home.''
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowers now may decide to go for a mortgage where the first
five years are fixed, and the next 25 years are adjusted,'' Lange
said. ``They've decided that such a product works just fine for
them, and also that they can save between three-quarters and one
percentage point in interest to go from a fixed product to an
adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   Also, by moving from a fixed rate to an adjustable, they can
effectively negate the fact that rates have gone up between one and
one-and-a-quarter percentage points lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange added that relatively attractive terms are helping ease
the risks of adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, he pointed out
that the interest rates on most adjustable mortgages can increase
by only one to two percentage points per year, as well as a
lifetime cap of about six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cap may seem high,'' Lange said, ``but the perception now
among consumers is that the Federal Reserve has a good handle on
inflation, so there is now a higher comfort level switching over to
an adjustable than there was in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The switch to adjustable-rate mortgages has not been a
landslide. Margaret Scott, a senior mortgage consultant at New York
Mortgage Corp., a mortgage broker, said most of her customers
choose 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, like the couple who came to
her in late August. They were thinking of either buying a $1.2
million home or having one built for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started talking to them about other mortgage products, but
they quickly rejected them,'' Ms. Scott said. ``From their
perspective there were so many other things to think about other
than rates, like whether they should put a lot of money down to
reduce the overall cost. Like many people today, they were looking
at their home as a long-term investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, real estate experts say adjustable-rate mortgages
are more popular than they have been in years. Last fall, for
example, adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for just 2 percent to
3 percent of the mortgage business at Crestar, but that number has
now swollen to 25 percent to 30 percent, with most customers
interested in one-, three- and five-year adjustable-rate products,
said Edmunds, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Like many mortgage lenders, many of whom have seen their
business volume shrink as interest rates have climbed, drying up
their refinancing business, Crestar has been busy rolling out more
options for adjustable-rate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come up with numerous mortgages that have all sorts of
features,'' said Susan Huber, a senior vice president of secondary
marketing. Last spring, for example, Crestar began offering a
30-year annually adjusted mortgage that lets consumers pay interest
for only the first 10 years, and whose rates, Ms. Huber said, are
far less than those of similar products.
</P>
<P>
   Crestar's product, she added, is pegged to carry an interest
rate that is just 1.5 percentage points higher than the Treasury
security to which such loans are generally pegged. By contrast, she
said, similar loans now run 2.75 or 2.875 percentage points higher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing appeal of shorter-term adjustable-rate
mortgages, experts urge consumers to look before they leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so used to lower rates, but they should be careful
not to lock in too short a period, perhaps with a one- or
three-year product,'' said Bader, the chief executive at Skyscraper
Mortgage. He pointed out that on a five-year adjustable-rate
mortgage, consumers can still get a rate in the range of ``the low
sevens,'' and if they are willing to pay points _ the up-front fee
of a percentage of the total loan, with one point being 1 percent
of the mortgage _ they can get a rate in the ``high sixes.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommends that consumers pay a few extra points and buy down
their interest rate. Each point paid will lower the interest rate
by roughly 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have all but forgotten about points, but remember that
each point is one percentage point of a loan and two points is
effectively a half-percent of interest-rate reduction,'' he said.
``By paying two points on your mortgage, you can bring rates down
to where they were five months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bader also advises consumers to ask their banks about a
longer ``lock-in'' period _ the time for which a lender promises to
hold a certain interest rate while a loan is being processed _ in
case interest rates keep going up.
</P>
<P>
   While banks usually lock in rates for 60 days, some banks are
starting to tout 90-day locks, he said. He emphasized that the
longer lock-in periods are especially critical in fierce housing
markets like that of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so tight now that sellers can't find new houses
to move into, so they're asking for longer closing periods,'' he
said. At Bank of America, Hocheiser said he has noticed that while
mortgage loans used to close within 35 to 60 days as recently as a
few months ago, they now tend to close within 60 to 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers, however, may find that it pays to speed up the
closing process. Gumbinger said one way consumers can soothe some
of the sting of the recent rate hikes is to ask for a shorter
commitment period, which is the time between when a lender promises
to make a loan _ generally after it has already been approved _ and
the time the loan is actually made.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who have good credit, as well as having their
paperwork in order, may be able to close their loan in just 30
days, he said, allowing them to get a slightly lower interest rate,
perhaps in the range of an eighth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   What about other defense strategies?
</P>
<P>
   Gumbinger advises consumers to consider offsetting the recent
increase in interest rates with a larger down payment, as well as
getting a ``float-down'' option in case rates might actually be
lower by the time the buyer closes on the loan. While a float-down
option usually entails paying a small fee _ such as one-eighth or a
quarter of 1 percent _ they give consumers access to lower rates if
they fall during the closing process.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gumbinger urges consumers not to panic. ``When rates
are higher and rising, it's more important to sit down and really
try to decide how long you plan on staying in a home so that you
can find the best mortgage,'' he said. ``With a 30-year fixed-rate
loan, you're buying stability, but it's expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott also urges consumers to shoot for the future. ``Today,
it's more about a home being a long-term investment,'' she said.
``It's not so much about rates as it is about a good buy.''

 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ It can be tough, being new in the area, and
rich, and a little uncertain about which fork to use, as it were.
You spend a lot of time worrying about your looks, for one thing.
That goes for people, and it goes for places.
</P>
<P>
   Take West Windsor. Until a little over a generation ago, it was
little more than the open farmland that separated Princeton from
the New Jersey Turnpike. But since the 1970s, it has grown into a
sprawl of expensive houses in carefully groomed developments, and
home to nearly 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And like any new place, West Windsor invented itself each step
of the way as it grew, keeping its concern with appearances in
mind. But there have been tensions. Though it was created by the
automobile, the town is intent on keeping car culture at bay. The
effects of this conflict are visible everywhere: in the houses that
turn their backs on highways, in the serpentine writhing and dead
ends _ pardon, cul-de-sacs _ of its residential streets, and above
all in the town leaders' abhorrence of those emblems of suburbia,
the strip shopping center and the fast-food joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Windsor residents have always, for as long as I can
remember, prided themselves with living in a place that is
different from all the other towns in the area,'' said Sam Surtees,
West Windsor's community development director and chief planner.
``They see the commercial development and the strip malls that
other towns have along their major roadways, and they don't want
that stigma here.''
</P>
<P>
   So West Windsor prohibits funeral homes, self-storage places and
commercial gyms, among other things. At its meeting Wednesday, the
planning board considered allowing veterinary hospitals, provided
the animals were kept indoors at all times. But one member asked
about tigers _ after all, a 431-pound one escaped from a private
preserve in Ocean County in January _ and other members could not
agree on whether dogs could be made to do their business inside,
and the matter was tabled.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the town to do about fast food? A burger franchise's
``garish corporate architecture and signage'' conflicts with the
township's ``appearance goals,'' a planning board report put it
last month. But an outright ban on just one kind of restaurant
would probably be illegal. So far, only a McDonald's has crept into
town, but it has no drive-through window. A Wendy's tried to get
in, but its application was ``nit-picked to death,'' by the board,
Surtees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings about the Wendy's went to 2:30 in the
morning,'' said Drewe Schoenholtz, a landscaper who sits on the
planning board and would like to see more restaurants of any kind
in town. ``It was a snob thing, that's what I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Windsor is the wealthiest town in Mercer County,'' he
said, ``and it's the place where everybody wants to be now.'' What
about Princeton, right next door, and traditionally one of the
state's best addresses? ``Forget Princeton,'' Schoenholtz snapped.
``Princeton's over.''
</P>
<P>
   At first the town planners considered simply outlawing
drive-through windows, for what fast-food restaurant could live
without one? But when town lawyers realized such a ban might not
stand up in court, the focus turned to forbidding free-standing
fast-food places in residential areas, allowing them only in
planned commercial developments, where signs and design have to be
uniform. A fast-food joint without its own garish sign, the
thinking goes, may turn into no joint at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what people are saying is,'' Surtees said, ``if you
don't want fast food, what can we do to make it so they don't want
to come here on their own?''

PENN STATE HOLDS ON TO EDGE PITT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ What's with Penn State? What's the deal
with LaVar Arrington? And who's the real quarterback for the
Nittany Lions?
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 2 and still unbeaten, the Nittany Lions left a few
worried fans among their 96,127 customers on Saturday when they
survived Pittsburgh, 20-17, in Beaver Stadium. Penn State lost a
fourth-quarter lead and needed a 24-yard field goal by Travis
Forney with 1 minute 20 seconds left to make its record 3-0. Coming
into the game, the Panthers (1-1) were big underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the lead, the Nittany Lions were reeling at the end.
Pittsburgh ran the ensuing kickoff back to the 50-yard line and
passed on first down to the Penn State 25. But the drive stalled
and a Penn State sack put the Panthers back to the 35. From there,
Nick Lotz of Pittsburgh tried a 52-yard field goal that was blocked
by a leaping Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, an outside linebacker touted by some as a Heisman
Trophy candidate, gave another inconsistent performance that
included a loss of composure. That will probably not impress the
people who vote for various awards.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Penn State used two quarterbacks. The backup Rashard
Casey, a junior, was the most fun to watch, but left the game after
fumbling a first-down snap in the second half. Kevin Thompson, the
senior starter, directed the offense on the winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions broke a 10-10 tie with 14:15 left in the
fourth quarter on a 7-yard touchdown run by Eric McCoo, who swept
left behind strong blocking after taking a handoff from Thompson.
But their 17-10 lead lasted only until 4:34 showed on the clock,
when Pittsburgh tied the score on a 42-yard touchdown pass from
John Turman to Julius Dixon. On this play, and on the one before
that, the Penn State defenders were victimized while trying for an
interception. On the previous play, the victim was Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State had won the previous six games between these
Pennsylvania rivals, who first met in 1893. Although it was the
95th meeting between the Nittany Lions and the Panthers, next
season's game is the final one scheduled in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State fans were looking for an improved performance from
Arrington, a 6-foot-3-inch, 242-pound junior. In the previous game,
a 70-26 victory over Akron last week, Arrington made only one
tackle and was victimized at least twice on a Zips scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   After being knocked over by a blocker on an Akron touchdown run,
Arrington could be seen in animated conversation on the sideline
with at least one teammate and Jerry Sandusky, the defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Akron game, Arrington said: ``I wait for a play to
come my way. When they don't come, I get a little restless. I just
have to learn to be a little more patient.'' He may have been
reacting to some observations that he was over-committing too early
to the initial motion of plays, thereby putting himself out of
position.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's game, Arrington stood out on a first-half play
that cost his team two penalties and could have resulted in his
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   With Pittsburgh punting from the Penn State 46, Arrington fought
off a block and tackled punter Greg DeBolt after DeBolt had kicked
the ball. When Arrington persisted in roughing DeBolt, refusing to
let him up, D.J. Dinkins of the Panthers came to his punter's aid
and Arrington jostled him as well amid the yellow flags.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington went to the bench and sat by himself during the next
Penn State drive, but returned to the field with his teammates for
their next defensive shift. When Arrington knocked down Turman
after a pass, he helped Turman to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams used two quarterbacks in the first half, which ended
with the Nittany Lions holding a 10-7 lead. Penn State's touchdown
drive was led by Casey, who completed four of four attempts for 88
yards in the half, including an 11-yard scoring play to Mike
Cerimele with 4:18 remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In relief of Thompson, Casey often scrambled out of the pocket
to throw on the run, sometimes directing blockers and receivers
with hand motions between pump fakes. He also lost 20 yards on a
second-quarter scramble that put his team out of field goal range.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's other three points came on a 43-yard field goal by
Forney with 7:23 remaining in the half. The Panthers' first-half
touchdown came with 11:59 left in the second quarter on Turman's
16-yard pass play to Antonio Bryant, over Arrington. Early in the
second half, the Panthers gained 33 yards on another pass over
Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third quarter, Pittsburgh successfully
executed a strategic oddity: a quick kick on third down by Turman
that carried 47 yards to the Penn State 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth play of the Lions' drive, linebacker Bryan Knight
of Pittsburgh intercepted Thompson's pass and returned it to the
Penn State 17. But the opportunity evaporated with an incompletion,
a false-start penalty and another incompletion. The Panthers
settled for a 35-yard field goal by Lotz to tie the score at 10-10
with 5:55 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another tough test for Penn State should come next Saturday when
it plays its first game on the road, at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions begin their eight-game Big Ten schedule Sept.
25 against Indiana.

HEALTH-CARE UNION PREPARES TO SHOW ITS MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York's labor leaders have long had a vision of
creating a single, powerful union for the city's health-care
workers. Until now, such a plan was dashed by fierce competition
among the region's rival unions to recruit members.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream of establishing one giant health-care union is
finally becoming a reality now that two medium-size unions are
merging with the city's largest health-care labor grouping _ 1199,
the National Health and Human Service Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   Those mergers, as well as 1199's recent success in several
organizing drives, will swell 1199's ranks to about 200,000
members, making it far larger than any other union in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, 1199's president, said this growth spurt _ the
union now has 150,000 members _ would increase the union's clout in
bargaining, lobbying and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will increase our ability in the political world,'' said
Rivera, who has often thrown his union's considerable weight behind
Democratic candidates. ``It will increase our ability and our
resources to organize new workers. And it will help us in case we
have a strike or a massive mobilization.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's increased power is sure to upset some Republican
officials who fear 1199's muscle in political campaigns and often
dislike its hardball lobbying in Albany. Twice since Gov. George
Pataki came to power, 1199 has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars to broadcast attacks on the governor over planned Medicaid
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In one major move to increase 1199's size, the union will merge
with Local 1115 of the Service Employees International Union, a
-unit based in Westbury, Long Island that represents 15,000
nursing-home workers. Service Employees International is also the
parent of 1199.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's union will gain an additional 22,500 members by
absorbing the home-care unit of Service Employees Local 32B-32J,
which represents janitors and has a large affiliate representing
workers who go to the homes of aging or ailing people to help with
cooking, cleaning and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 1199 has recently succeeded in organizing 4,000
home-care workers with Partners in Care, a subsidiary of the
Visiting Nurse Service, a nonprofit agency that provides nurses,
rehabilitation therapists and home-care aides to thousands of New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said his union expected to gain at least 15,000 more
members by organizing thousands of home-care workers employed by
subcontractors of the Visiting Nurse Service.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 1199 had 105,000 members and was the city's
second-largest union, behind District Council 37 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which
represents 120,000 workers. But it leapfrogged District Council 37
two years ago when Service Employees Local 144 and its 30,000
hospital and nursing-home workers voted to join 1199, after Local
144's president was ousted for extravagant spending.
</P>
<P>
   The union's steady growth has showcased Rivera's knack at
persuading other unions to merge with 1199 as well as his unusual
ability to persuade many hospitals, health-care companies and
health-care agencies not to oppose organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Visiting Nurse Service,
said the agency agreed to work with 1199, rather than fight a
unionization drive, because it believed that 1199's political clout
could help win expanded home-care funding from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the mergers and rapid growth, 1199 is realigning
itself into divisions: hospital, with nearly 100,000 workers; home
care, with almost 50,000 workers, and nursing home, with 43,000
workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jay Sachman, the president of Local 1115, will be the head of
the nursing-home division. ``This organization is going to
represent 75 percent of the nursing home workers in the New York
metropolitan area, which is unprecedented,'' he said. ``With the
power this gives us, we will work to increase staffing ratios and
reimbursement levels for New York's nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Health-care experts said these mergers would not only lead to
more industrywide bargaining, instead of negotiating institution by
institution, but also could lead to far larger strikes than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   With unions seeking to reverse their membership losses in recent
decades, Rivera has vowed to make 1199 one of New York's busiest
union organizers. In August, 500 workers at St. Agnes Hospital in
White Plains voted to join 1199. Also last month, the union got
nearly 200 workers at Catholic Medical Center in Queens to sign
cards saying that they wanted to join.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, close to 300 workers at Doctors Hospital in Staten
Island voted to join 1199. Last week, nearly 150 workers at Hebrew
Hospital Home, a nursing home in Valhalla, voted for membership.
Also this month, clerical workers at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan voted 126-124 to join 1199, although the final results
remain up in the air because of challenged ballots.

REAL ESTATE: UPGRADING A BUILDING'S ELEVATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, this column contained advice for co-op
and condominium boards negotiating elevator-maintenance contracts
for their buildings. As pointed out then, a carefully drafted
contract with a carefully chosen elevator company is essential for
the safety and convenience of residents.
</P>
<P>
   But even an excellent contract with an excellent company may not
be enough to prevent an elevator from succumbing to the ravages of
time, friction and physics. That means that at some point near the
end of an elevator's life span _ often around the 35-year mark,
experts say _ the time will come to take the expensive step of
elevator modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dealing with elevators, you really have to plan years
ahead,'' said Herb Rose, a co-op consultant based in Manhattan.
``You can't just wait for the elevator to fall apart and then
replace it. If you have a 16-story building, you have 16 floors of
responsibility. And whenever you're waiting for something to break,
you're courting disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose pointed out that it is not uncommon for modernization
projects to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and put cars
being upgraded out of commission for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for a building to spend a quarter of a
million dollars upgrading its elevators,'' Rose said, adding that
with numbers so large, it usually pays for a co-op or condominium
board to seek expert advice. And one way to do that is to hire an
elevator consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consultants keep everybody honest,'' said Tom Corsale,
director of sales and marketing for Central Elevator, an elevator
maintenance and installation company in Manhattan. ``Let's face it,
we're not talking about buying a box of doughnuts here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things a consultant will do, Corsale said, is to
provide an independent assessment of the current condition of the
elevator and the projected life span of its major components.
Another, he said, will be to draw up detailed specifications for
whatever work the board determines is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   James Samson, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the primary
concern for boards contemplating an elevator-modernization project
_ once the issue of how to pay for the project has been addressed _
is how to deal with having one or more elevators out of service for
an extended time.
</P>
<P>
   In a building with one passenger elevator and a service elevator
it generally makes sense to upgrade the service elevator first so
that residents can at least use the freshly renovated unit when the
passenger car is taken out of service. In buildings with just one
elevator, Samson said, the stakes are higher and the solutions more
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a client with four seven-story buildings with one
elevator per building and lots of senior citizens,'' Samson said.
``You take one of those elevators out of service and you've got a
real problem on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   One way way to address such a problem, he said, is to provide
residents with as much advance notice as possible of the dates the
elevator is expected to be out of service. Another is to keep the
down time to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a contractor will be able to shorten the time the
elevators will be out of service,'' he said, adding that such an
accommodation is likely to result in higher costs because an
accelerated schedule requires contractors to work through the night
and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also possible that with enough advance notice, some
residents will be able to find somewhere else to stay while the
elevators are out of service,'' Samson said, adding that those who
are not able to do so must also be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may end up having to put them up in hotel rooms or ease
their burden by hiring extra staff,'' he said. ``It's just one of
those things you're going to have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every modernization project requires the immediate gut
renovation of the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Walsh, president of Walsh Associates Ltd., an elevator
consulting company in Manhattan, said that many elevator
modernization jobs can be done in phases. That means that a total
modernization project that might take anywhere from 12 to 15 weeks
could be broken down into separate five- or six-week stages with
the different stages spread out over time.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of such a project, Walsh said, would generally
be to replace the parts of the elevator that get the most wear and
tear _ the elevator door and the mechanism that moves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A door package usually includes a new car door, new hangers
and tracks, and new closures,'' Walsh said, explaining that hangers
and tracks in an elevator are a heavy-duty version of the plastic
rollers and aluminum channels that are used to secure hanging
closet doors in their frames while allowing them to move freely
back and forth. And closures, he said, are the intricate gears,
levers and motors that open and close the door.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of a typical modernization project, Walsh said,
would be an aesthetic upgrade of the interior of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we redo the cab, put in a new panel and install
new hall buttons on each floor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the final phase of a three-phase modernization project,
Walsh said, would be to replace the electrical and mechanical
equipment that controls the movement of the elevator itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 95 percent of cases we can retain the hoist machine,'' he
said, referring to the motor and pulley assembly used in most
high-rise buildings in the city. ``We'll usually have to replace
the generator, though, and we'll always replace the controller.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The controller, Walsh said, is a sophisticated electronic device
that functions as the brain of the elevator. Choosing which type of
controller to use, he said, is one of the most significant
decisions a property owner or board will be required to make when
upgrading an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh explained that controllers can be either proprietary
devices made by elevator manufacturers for use in that
manufacturer's elevators, or generic devices that can be
retrofitted into almost any elevator, including those made by
manufacturers that use proprietary equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complexity of modern controllers, however,
sophisticated electronic tools are typically needed to diagnose
equipment malfunctions. And while generic controllers can be
diagnosed and repaired by any qualified elevator contractor using
generic controller diagnostic tools, proprietary controllers
require the use of proprietary tools for diagnosis and repair.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Walsh said, often makes it necessary for those who
have proprietary controllers installed in their elevators to hire
the elevator manufacturer that made the controller to service and
repair it _ a requirement that limits a board's ability to
negotiate a service contract on the most favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the experts say, boards that hire a company to perform
an elevator upgrade should probably use the same company to
maintain and service the new elevator, at least for the first few
years. In fact, the service contract should provide for a period of
free service in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company that upgraded the elevator did the job right,
there shouldn't be any service necessary for at least the first
year or so,'' said Samson, the lawyer. ``So you should be able to
get at least one year free service without even breathing hard.''

ELLEN HIRSCHLAND, 80, COLLECTOR AND A FRIEND OF MODERN MASTERS

   NEW YORK _ Ellen B. Hirschland, an art collector, teacher and a
great-niece of Baltimore collectors Claribel and Etta Cone, died on
Sept. 3 while traveling near St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 80
and lived in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, said her son Edward.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hirschland was born in Baltimore, the daughter of Sidney
Berney, a vice president at Isaac Hamburger, a clothing store in
Baltimore, and Dorothy Long Berney, a niece of Etta and Claribel
Cone, who amassed a world-class collection of 19th and 20th century
art, including 42 Matisse oil paintings, which they bequeathed to
the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 17, Mrs. Hirschland traveled with Etta Cone to
Paris, where she met Matisse, who became one of her lifelong
friends. She also came to know other modern masters, including
Chagall, Albers, Miro and Louise Nevelson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the year she graduated from Wheaton College, she
married Paul M. Hirschland, who became a Manhattan investment
banker. Hirschland died in 1988. During their marriage, the couple
collected modern art and put together a group of works by artists
ranging from Cezanne to Frank Stella. Mrs. Hirschland was also a
trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Mrs. Hirschland taught art history in the adult
education program in the Great Neck public schools. She also
lectured widely on the Cone sisters and, with her daughter, Nancy
H. Ramage, recently completed a biography about them, which is to
be published by Harry N. Abrams next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son Edward, of Chicago, and daughter, Nancy,
of Ithaca, N.Y., she is survived by another son, Roger, of
Washington.

POLICE ERROR LETS WOMAN SEARCH YEARS FOR DEAD SON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After her son, a sophomore at Queens College,
disappeared in October 1995, Arnita Fowler sold everything she
owned, gave up her job in California and moved to New York City so
she could search for him. And so she did for four years, posting
thousands of fliers and making hundreds of calls to the police.
</P>
<P>
   But her son's body had been found floating in the East River
near 38th Street six days after he disappeared, and he was buried
at Potters Field on Hart Island, in an unidentified pauper's grave.
And, in what police officials called a mistake, a fingerprint check
by the FBI had long ago determined the body's identity, but Ms.
Fowler had not been notified.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, La-Mont Dottin, was 21 when he disappeared on Oct. 18,
1995, after a trip to the post office in Hollis, Queens, where he
lived. Investigators and William H. Allee Jr., the chief of
detectives for the New York police, described the incident as a
simple miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprint checks on the body taken from the river returned no
hits from the New York state police database, and Allee blamed the
FBI for never calling to alert missing persons detectives that they
had found fingerprints on file with the police in Sacramento, where
Dottin had been arrested on a gun possession charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to indicate that the FBI sent us anything
back,'' Allee said, blaming the FBI for the miscommunication and
defending his detectives, even though they did not follow up with
the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after determining that missing persons
investigations in the past were lacking, the Police Department
created the squad to reinvestigate old, unresolved cases, Allee
said. In March, the case was given to the squad.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Ms. Fowler, who now lives and works in Queens,
said she believed that the detectives discovered that her son had
been found only because of a routine call she made to the Missing
Persons Squad to set up a meeting last week. That was the day she
was told that her son had been found. Ms. Fowler said a detective
told her that investigators realized the error when a supervisor
asked him to make the follow-up calls to the FBI that should have
been done years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was an error,'' Ms. Fowler said Saturday. ``He
calls four years of pain an error?''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Dottin's death was accidental, but they plan to
exhume the body to re-examine it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fowler said she planned to attend law school and become a
lawyer to help others with missing loved ones work the system
better.

THREE MILLION FANS' MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen months ago, George Steinbrenner said that if
attendance at Yankee games reached 3 million this season, he would
discuss keeping the team in the Bronx. The Yankees barely missed
that mark last year, but they will surpass it on Sunday against the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing more than 55,000 fans on Saturday, the Yankees
eclipsed their attendance record of 2.95 million, set in 1998. With
more than 55,000 tickets sold for Sunday, the team will exceed 3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, lauded the fans for
their support, but he dodged questions on Saturday about what the
attendance milestone might mean.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reluctant to discuss his team's future, because
he wants the Yankees' priorities to be on winning a second straight
World Series title. He is also awaiting the National Basketball
Association's approval of the proposed Yankees-Nets deal, a
business merger between the baseball and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a telephone interview if the attendance record had
proved to him that fans would flock to the Bronx, he responded:
``We will be making up our minds soon. We're waiting to get the
approval on the Yankee-Nets. Then we'll make a decision on where
we're playing, whether it be in the Bronx, Manhattan or New Jersey.
I just can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002, but
speculation about the Yankees' moving to the Upper West Side of
Manhattan or to New Jersey has waned. Some baseball officials have
said that upgrading the current stadium may be the only option for
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   With seven home games left in the regular season, the Yankees
will also shatter the New York attendance record that the Mets set
with 3.047 million in 1988. ``It's a wonderful achievement and a
wonderful tribute to New York,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has complained for the past decade about traffic
and safety concerns in the Bronx and about the lack of luxury boxes
at the Stadium, saying these deficiencies cost him millions of
dollars and do not allow him to fairly compete with teams that have
modern facilities. While Steinbrenner has refused to reveal what
changes he wants if the team remains in the Bronx, they will
include more parking, ways to minimize traffic congestion, luxury
boxes and 3 million or more fans a year on a consistent basis.

TWO HEADS, THINKING AS ONE, IN THE CAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The relationship between a race car driver and his engineer
during a Formula One weekend is similar to that in a good marriage.
``You need a lot of trust and a lot of respect between the two of
you for it to work,'' said Steve Clark, the race engineer for Pedro
Diniz of the Sauber team.
</P>
<P>
   A white lie by the driver about the reason for a spinout may be
balm for good relations between a driver and his team owner or the
news media. But the race engineer must know the truth, or it could
be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often you find that half of the race engineer's job is as a
psychologist,'' said Clark, who was the engineer for Alex Zanardi
last year in the CART series, which they won. The idea, he said, is
``to try to cocoon, to make a little team within the team to
protect the driver, because his performance is an emotional one. If
he loses confidence, he might as well not get in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 22 Formula One drivers who will make up the
grid at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza Sunday, there will also be
the 22 engineers who work throughout the season with their
individual drivers and share much of the responsibility for their
success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   The senior race car engineer is constantly by the driver's side
in the garage or as a voice in his ear through the radio during the
race. When not racing, the engineer and the driver try to develop
the car or find the ideal setup for a specific track. To do this,
the engineer collects and interprets both the computer data from
the car and the human data of the driver's impressions, which he
must translate into deft technical changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver will say, `I have understeer, or I have oversteer,
or I'm bottoming too much,''' said Heinz-Harald Frentzen, the
German driver who is in fourth place in the championship standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this information from the driver is also accessible to the
engineer through the computer sensors. So I say to him, for
example, `I don't want my car to understeer so much in this or that
corner.' We talk about what we can do. We can lower the right tire,
we can do softer springs, we can do a softer tire on the front, or
softer damping, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Race engineers often follow drivers to other teams, as Ross
Brawn followed Michael Schumacher from Benetton to Ferrari in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brawn is also Ferrari's technical director and the mastermind of
its race strategy. Last July, Schumacher broke his leg at the
British Grand Prix. To maintain equilibrium at Ferrari for Eddie
Irvine and his technical team, Irvine kept his own race engineer
rather than switching to Brawn. But Brawn has worked closely with
Irvine and his engineer while Irvine has taken on the role as
Ferrari's No. 1 driver.
</P>
<P>
   Jock Clear followed Jacques Villeneuve, the former IndyCar and
Formula One champion, from Williams to the new British American
Racing team this year. He did so, he said, because ``ultimately my
job is very much dependent on the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear added, ``He makes me look good or bad.''

BEATING TRIAL HAS 2 VIEWS OF AN INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Brooklyn courtroom this week, prosecutors will
continue to claim that two New York City police detectives acted
like ``common thugs,'' viciously beating a man who was later struck
and killed by a train in a nearby subway station.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers will continue to insist that the detectives
did not assault the man. They are depicting him as a quarrelsome
drunk who argued with many people before committing suicide in the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   The two accounts are being offered as the trial of the two
detectives _ and of two other detectives accused of helping in a
cover-up _ begins its second week Monday in state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The man who died, Reginald Bannerman, 36, worked as a porter at
BBB Soul and Seafood Restaurant at Bedford Avenue and Crown Street
in Crown Heights. Early on Dec. 19, 1997, prosecutors say, he was
savagely beaten on the street outside, after he argued with a group
of off-duty detectives who were drinking at a birthday party at the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is six blocks from the Sterling Street subway
station, where Bannerman died about 45 minutes later. The City
Medical Examiner's office says his death was a suicide. But a
lawyer for Bannerman's family says he was dazed by severe head and
eye injuries from the beating and fell in front of the train.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the prosecutors, from the Brooklyn district attorney's
office, told the jury that two of the defendants, Lloyd Barnaby,
38, and Mark Cooper, 29, were among a group of assailants who beat,
kicked and stomped Bannerman, with Barnaby also using a bottle on
him. When he broke away from his attackers to flee, a prosecutor
said, Barnaby and Cooper were among the detectives who fired their
guns wildly over his head.
</P>
<P>
   One witness told reporters before the trial that Bannerman had
apparently angered the detectives by telling the hard-drinking
group to quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the defendants, Detective Edward Howard, 31, helped
Barnaby and Cooper pick up and hide the spent shell casings, ``to
avoid evidence being found,'' a prosecutor, Charles M. Guria, said
during opening statements. And Guria said the fourth defendant,
Detective Orice Connor, 30, committed official misconduct by not
reporting the violent events to the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``These defendants reverted to common thugs,'' said Guria, an
executive assistant district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnaby's lawyer, Dino J. Lombardi, told the jury that there
had been a ``general confused melee'' in which his client ``never
endangered anyone's health or caused physical injury to Reginald
Bannerman,'' whom he said had been drinking heavily, was
argumentative and was flashing a light in people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's lawyer, Alan I. Friess, told the jury that his client
had nothing to do with any assault on Bannerman and that his death
was not related to whatever happened outside the restaurant nearly
an hour before. Saying that Bannerman had not been chased by
anybody to the subway station, he told the jury, ``For reasons
unknown, Reginald Bannerman jumped in front of a train.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said before the trial that there was no evidence
of a chase. In any event, the judge, Albert Tomei, told the jury
that the cause of Bannerman's death ``is not an issue at this
trial, and you are not to speculate or guess at what caused his
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing both Howard and Connor, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, said the two men had done nothing to warrant the
evidence-tampering charge against the former and the official
misconduct charge against the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The only witness so far has been Bannerman's brother-in-law,
Michael Knight, a part-owner of the restaurant. He described a
sidewalk scene in which about a half-dozen men, including Barnaby,
were stomping and kicking Bannerman ``in the head, the face, all
over his body.'' He said Barnaby used a bottle or a glass.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, the detectives' lawyers sought to convince
the jurors that Knight's testimony was unreliable. Using written
reports by police investigators who had interviewed Knight at
different times, the lawyers stressed discrepancies in details the
reports said he had given.
</P>
<P>
   Bannerman had also worked as a recreation specialist in an
after-school youth program. The detectives, with the Brooklyn South
Narcotics Unit at the time of the incident, are on restricted duty
until the case is resolved. Barnaby and Cooper face the most
serious charges, second-degree assault, punishable by up to seven
years in prison.

 &HT;    N.C. city grapples with deadline to end race-based busing
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ In this city where busing for desegregation
began three decades ago, the color of schoolchildren's skin has
mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools have less than a year to
wipe clean the black-and-white slate.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gives the
nation's 23rd-largest school district until the next school year to
institute colorblind policies in classroom assignments.
</P>
<P>
   In dissolving the desegregation order stemming from the landmark
Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education case, Potter
concluded that the district has acted in ``good faith for almost 30
years'' to eliminate ``vestiges of past discrimination to the
extent practicable ...''
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Charlotte said the ruling by the Reagan
appointee will bring a historic end to forced busing, the city's
primary tool for achieving racial balance among the district's
101,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is watching, again, as Charlotte-Mecklenburg suddenly
finds itself reluctantly freed from federal court supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next problem is going to be how they are going to handle
it,'' said Gary Sams, attorney for the DeKalb County, Ga., school
district, which was under a federal desegregation order from 1968
through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Charlotte, they lived under one set rule for 30 years. It
is going to be very difficult to change a mind-set over one year,
especially when the rule they had to follow is now against the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although school officials had anticipated Potter's ruling,
Superintendent Eric Smith said, ``These are very difficult issues.
It is going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter agreed, comparing the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district to
the Sisyphus, a mythological figure whose eternal punishment in the
Greek underworld was to roll a stone up a steep hill only to see it
roll back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of remedial necessity, the Court will not add
to that conundrum by requiring additional affirmative obligations
that address socioeconomic concerns or societal discrimination,''
Potter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It's a landmark ruling in North Carolina's largest school
district, where public education was so segregated in the 1960s
that a federal judge ordered busing of students beyond their
neighborhood schools to achieve racial balance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 1969 Swann case,
which ushered in urban busing across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the granddaddy,'' said James Hallford, superintendent of
the DeKalb County schools. ``Nationwide, everybody knows Swann vs.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the growing national movement to dismantle desegregation
plans _ in DeKalb County and Nashville, Tenn., among other cities _
Charlotte-Mecklenburg finds itself back in the pack. But it is not
without unique challenges that illustrate the intensifying debate
over race in education.
</P>
<P>
   For Charlotte-Mecklenburg officials, the ruling causes practical
problems. The district doesn't have enough money to build enough
inner-city schools to accommodate the estimated 7,000 black
students who no longer will be bused to primarily white suburban
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run about 1,000 buses right now in Mecklenburg County.
After the judge's ruling, I don't care how we wind up with student
reassignment, we are still going to run about 1,000 buses,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some black parents fear building more inner-city schools could
take several years, a likelihood conceded by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the school district, the NAACP or black
parents who joined the case will appeal Potter's ruling. Parties in
the case have 30 days to decide whether to file an appeal to the
4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal could delay school improvements and prolong
uncertainty among parents seeking stable school assignments for
their children, said Lee Parks, an Atlanta lawyer who was the lead
plaintiffs' lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The original plaintiff, Bill Capacchione, sued in 1997 after his
daughter waited two years trying to enroll in one of the county's
magnet schools. At the time of the lottery for seats, spots
reserved for black children had gone unfilled. A group of white
parents argued that busing and other race-based policies violated
their constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte is right on the edge,'' Parks said. ``If they do not
fix it this year, it will be too late. They have to create programs
to get parents to recommit to public education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want more turmoil and diversity,'' said Smith, the
district's superintendent. ``But we do not want to sacrifice the
quality of education of large groups of students for a year or two
of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke Largess, a lawyer for two black families in that case who
joined the school district in the lawsuit, said his clients would
appeal if the school district doesn't. He said Potter overstepped
his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's saying is you cannot use race in any aspect of
operating the educational system,'' Largess said. ``It's an
interesting legal question whether he can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is how do you justify doing away with busing when
all vestiges of a dual system have not been removed?'' Charlotte
NAACP President Dwayne Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-month trial that ended in June, the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg district asked Potter to extend court
supervision. School officials argued that the district needed
several more years to bring about desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   The district's racial makeup is 60 percent white and 40 percent
black, a level that school officials said they had not achieved in
all of the district's 138 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Potter wrote that he found the board's position to be
``bizarre'' since it put it at odds with its late-1960s predecessor
which ``strongly resisted federal supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the judge noted, the school board is aligned with the
black children's parents who originally sued the board in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Potter concluded that ``quite some time ago''
Charlotte-Mecklenburg had achieved an acceptable level of
desegregation among its students.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Potter declared that Charlotte-Mecklenburg's
schools are ``enjoined from assigning children to schools or
allocating educational opportunities and benefits through
race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that
deny students an equal footing based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision that says Charlotte won't be permitted to
have any desegregated schools unless it happens by accident,'' said
William Taylor, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is vice chairman of
the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights and teaches at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But citing trial testimony, Potter said, ``One (school)
official's unsubstantiated fear that discrimination might reappear
in the absence of a court order is no grounds for prolonged court
supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that ``Charlotte has become one of the most
racially integrated cities in America,'' resulting partly from
``the dispersion of blacks into the suburbs.

BLOCKING IS THE RULE IN INTERCLUB CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't come easy for racers when a regatta calls for the
greater good of sailing. But team racing _ where one boat's
first-place finish may keep the team from winning _ calls for
tactics that bend the rules in uncommon ways.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean that you have to waive a basic principle in yacht
racing: allowing a fellow team on port tack to take right-of-way
over your sailboat on starboard tack if it helps the team win.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle riders use similar tricks, like drafting to allow a bike
behind to benefit from a teammate's position ahead. But in a
yachting competition, racing chicanery often creates daring moves
on the straightaway and logjams rounding the marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole other layer of thinking,'' Steven Wolff, chairman
of Team Racing for the New York Yacht Club, said in a recent
telephone interview. ``Your boat handling has to be top-notch, and
you have to have your speed up. But you also have to be able to
maneuver your boat in tiny, tiny spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran group of Long Island Sound sailors representing nine
yacht clubs in the New York-Connecticut area is scheduled to
compete next weekend in the New York Yacht Club Interclub Team
Race, two days of round-robin competition off Larchmont, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It is the team-race scoring system that encourages gamesmanship
on the water. In any one round-robin race, which pits four boats of
one team against four boats of another, the low point scorer wins.
At the end of eight races, for example, a team that finished 2, 3,
4 and 8 would beat a team that finished 1, 2, 7 and 8. The winning
team would have 18 points as low point scorer, compared with 18\
points for the second team.
</P>
<P>
   The crews soon learn to make the scoring system work in their
favor. Teammates try to block competing team boats from catching up
to a fellow boat. By allowing a teammate to waive the starboard
right-of-way, a team player may give fellow sailors an advantage
over a competing boat just ahead or behind.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling positions at a mark calls for even more calculation. By
trying to allow a teammate to gain the inside advantage, a sailboat
may have to maintain its position in a strong current or rough
seas.
</P>
<P>
   The event marks the annual team championship for the Yacht
Racing Association of Long Island Sound. It also represents a
chance for local bastions of yacht racing to mix it up on the water
without attracting undue attention to any one sailor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of any one boat finishing first,'' Brad
Dellenbaugh, a team-race expert and offshore sailing coach at the
U.S. Naval Academy, said last week from his office in Annapolis,
Md. ``It's how members of your team help each other to gain better
positioning along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the New York Yacht Club, the competing teams include the
Larchmont Yacht Club, the American Yacht Club, the Sea Cliff Yacht
Club, and the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, of New York state;
and the Indian Harbor Yacht Club, the Pequot Yacht Club, the
Noroton Yacht Club and the Riverside Yacht Club, of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In the interclub championship, each association sends 16 sailors
to compete. They race for the Glencairn Trophy, a prize donated two
years ago by the Long Island Sound Yacht Racing Association. Club
teams sail on identical Ideal 18s, 18-foot keelboats that require
two-person crews.
</P>
<P>
   Regatta organizers have planned racing on Friday in the varsity
team division, for skippers 50 and older; there is a similar format
on Saturday for the mixed team division, where age is not a factor.
A series of semifinals and finals is scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Team racing is not altogether new in yachting. Collegiate
sailors thrive on it. But once out of school, most sailors
gravitate to fleet racing under handicap or one-design rules, which
forces competitors to develop a personal approach to sailing rather
than collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about how well you do,'' Wolff said. ``It's
about making an individual sport into a team sport. You have to
communicate with team members on the water, and you have to figure
out how to use the sailing rules to each other's advantage.'' &QL;

REAL ESTATE: A DEVELOPER BALKS AT SELLING TO A LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Timothy B. Liebaert, a lawyer, thought
nothing of mentioning his occupation to a saleswoman at the Fairway
Oaks housing development in this Central Valley farm and oil town.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman reacted to the news by grimacing and warning
Liebaert that the developer, Burlington Homes, sometimes refused to
sell houses to lawyers, he recalled. In the developer's opinion,
Liebaert was told, lawyers are particularly litigious about
defects, real and imagined, in their houses, and are therefore not
good customers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a day later, the saleswoman called Liebaert to tell him
that the company would not sell him a house. Unconcerned that he
would be demonstrating the very characteristic the developer had
deplored, Liebaert responded by filing a lawsuit claiming
discrimination based on his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to exclude people who have any level of
sophistication,'' said Liebaert, 32, who has been an environmental
lawyer for four years. ``Since I'm an attorney, they think I might
try to make them uphold their end of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebaert's case illuminates what real estate experts say is an
unusual practice among developers. By limiting the number of
lawyers it sells houses to, Burlington Homes hopes to reduce legal
fees connected with litigation by homeowners who claim that their
houses have defects, like leaky roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of two or three similar situations with rentals,''
said Sara Pratt, director of enforcement and compliance for the
National Fair Housing Alliance, a consumer advocacy group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not aware of any other case involving the sale of
property,'' she added, referring both to lawsuits filed by
disgruntled lawyers and to developers who are reluctant to sell to
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statutes protect buyers and tenants from housing
discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin,
religion, sex, family status and disability, but do not mention
profession. Most state laws are similar, though some also include
sexual orientation as a protected category.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of cities and counties nationwide have laws that
protect buyers and tenants based on their profession. One is New
York City, which passed a law in 1986 prohibiting discrimination
based on profession after lawyers, among others, complained that
landlords had refused to rent them apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Portland, Ore., where in 1991 the City Council passed
an ordinance that prohibits housing discrimination based on
``source of income.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance makes it illegal to discriminate against people
because of their occupation or because their source of income is
government welfare or Social Security checks. People whose source
of income is criminal activity are not covered, nor are those who
have federal rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Liebaert's troubles started in February, when he tried to buy a
five-bedroom, four-bath home for $145,900 for himself, his wife,
Kelly, and their two infant daughters. When told that he could not
buy a house at Fairway Oaks, and after his $3,000 deposit on a lot
was returned with the word ``void'' marked across the check, he
filed a suit in state Superior Court in Kern County.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Liebaert claimed that Burlington Homes had violated
the state's civil rights law by refusing to sell him a home because
of his profession. The law is typically used to protect people from
discrimination based on factors including race, sex and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Judkins, president of Burlington Homes, acknowledged
that his company was indeed wary of selling houses to lawyers. Such
precautions are necessary, he said in an interview, to keep the
company profitable and prices low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need to do business with everyone who walks in the
door,'' Judkins said, ``just like a lawyer doesn't have to take on
everyone who walks in the door as a client. Being an attorney in
our eyes says, `Open your eyes wider.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But Judkins said his company, which is based in Bakersfield, a
city of 174,000 110 miles north of Los Angeles, did not have an
absolute policy against selling houses to lawyers. In fact, he
said, the company ``consciously'' sold a house to one ``classy''
lawyer who has yet to cause the company any problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, Judkins said, the company once sold a house to another
customer without realizing that he was a lawyer. That lawyer,
Judkins said, ``made our life miserable'' with ``threats and
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judkins would not specify what the buyer's complaints were or
how they were resolved. But in court documents filed in response to
Liebaert's lawsuit, Burlington Homes said it had not suffered any
legal costs as a result of selling houses to the two lawyers with
whom it says it has done business.
</P>
<P>
   Liebaert points to that admission as proof that Burlington Homes
has no legitimate fear of lawyers. But Judkins is unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Liebaert has not had much success with his lawsuit. In
May, Judge Sidney P. Chapin of Superior Court dismissed Liebaert's
claims of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the state's civil rights law does not include
discrimination based on profession as grounds for a complaint.
Developers can legally refuse to sell houses to lawyers, the judge
said, as long as the refusal is made for business reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Liebaert filed an emergency appeal with the state's Fifth
District Court in Fresno. The court denied the appeal, but Liebaert
can file a regular appeal later if he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   When not dealing with a protected category of consumer,
developers and landlords have some latitude in choosing whom to
sell or rent to, and their rights have been upheld in court on a
number of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, developers can use age restrictions to keep younger
people out of senior citizen communities. And landlords can refuse
to rent apartments to unmarried couples based on religious
concerns. In commercial buildings, they can keep out businesses
they consider incompatible with other tenants.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Liebaert, who is renting a house in Bakersfield and is
still looking to buy one, has revised his lawsuit to claim that
Burlington Homes violated his wife's civil rights. He contends that
the company refused to sell her a house because she is married to a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Employment and Fair Housing is also
investigating Liebaert's claim of discrimination. If the agency
finds enough evidence, it could convene a hearing before an
administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   Liebaert is also trying to force Burlington Homes to include
what he calls its policy against lawyers in its sales brochures.
</P>
<P>
   June Barlow, vice president and general counsel of the
California Association of Realtors, said people in some
occupations, especially those dominated by members of minorities,
may have recourse against sellers who refuse to do business with
them even if there are no specific ``source of income'' laws in the
buyer's jurisdiction. For example, she said, migrant farm workers,
most of whom are Hispanic, could claim that policies prohibiting
them from buying a house are really a smokescreen for racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a difficult situation for the seller,'' Ms. Barlow
said. ``I'm not saying that they would lose. But it's an obvious
connection for the jury. The seller would have to show some kind of
legitimate business reason.''

KILLING OF EX-DETECTIVE IS LINKED TO GANG ON NATIONWIDE ROBBERY
SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., N.J.. Mass., Calif., Ohio)  (js) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gunmen who ambushed and killed a retired police
detective outside a Bronx meatpacking company two weeks ago are
members of Colombian gang linked to more than 50 brazen armed
robberies of jewelers and other businesses in six states,
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   The key to linking the cases was an address book found in the
pocket of one of the men, Fernando Colorado, 28, who was killed in
the Bronx attack, investigators said. The addresses led the
investigators to the homes of Colorado's partners in Brooklyn and
Queens, where detectives seized evidence that linked the group to
at least four years of violent cross-country crime sprees,
according to a racketeering indictment. The indictment of 11
suspected members of the group was unsealed Friday in U.S. Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are the subjects of a manhunt coordinated by dozens
of New York detectives, agents of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration and local law enforcement officials in Miami, where
the gunmen are believed to have fled immediately after the killing
of the retired detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pursue these people wherever they go,'' Howard Safir,
the New York City police commissioner, said in an interview on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The seized evidence includes handguns, fake passports and
drivers' licenses, fake police gear, bulletproof vests, police
scanners, walkie-talkies, surveillance cameras and other
communications equipment, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sophisticated robbery group,'' Safir said.
Federal investigators said that some members traveled to Colombia
for plastic surgery to alter their fingerprints and their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the gang was responsible for armed robberies
in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Florida and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the crimes occurred on a late afternoon in midtown
Manhattan in February 1996, when several men wearing knit caps and
carrying guns ambushed and wounded a Hong Kong jeweler outside the
Hilton New York, shooting him in the chest and stealing a duffel
bag containing $1.2 million worth of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The police found the robbers' abandoned car nearby on West 51st
Street, but then the trail went cold.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial clue turned up on Aug. 27, when the police say at
least eight heavily armed men surrounded a car in the Bronx. The
gunmen held up the retired detective, Donald E. Pagani Sr., and his
cousin, who were headed to a local bank with $52,000 from the
company, which is owned by the Pagani family.
</P>
<P>
   But the robbery was thwarted when Pagani opened fire with his
.38-caliber revolver and killed Colorado as the others fled.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani, 69, of Peekskill, N.Y., was killed in the shootout. But
investigators said the fatal shot he fired at Colorado helped to
break the case. The notebook found on Colorado listed the aliases
and telephone numbers of people whom the authorities suspect are
gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are looking for six people in connection
with the killing of Pagani: Alex Restrepo, 25; Nelson Baez, 25;
Jorge Garcia, 34; Carlos Gonzalez, 39; Nicholas Coronel, 17, and
Paola Restrepo, 25.
</P>
<P>
   Five other suspected gang members _ Julian Tamayo, Edison
Santiago Cordova, Wilson Izasa, Pepe Mirand and Carlos Torres _
were also named in the indictment. Except for Mirand, who is 36,
their ages were not given.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mabel Restrepo, 23, the sister of Alex and Paola, was arrested
by detectives on Sept. 1 in New York. She is being held without
bail on second-degree murder charges in the killing of Pagani, but
was not named in the racketeering indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian gang had caught the attention of Federal law
enforcement authorities long before the killing of Pagani.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group have been able to escape capture by using
fake passports and expensive technology, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group have used fake passports to travel to
regions of Colombia and other South American countries that are in
chaos because of government corruption, making it easier for them
to avoid detection by the authorities in the United States,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to interviews with law enforcement officials and the
criminal complaint filed in U.S. Court on Sept. 3, investigators
believe that the group's usual tactic was to case a location
anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of weeks before a
well-choreographed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a group of armed gunmen, wearing ski masks and
bulletproof vests, would surround their victims, as backup gunmen,
armed with high-powered automatic weapons, waited in getaway
vehicles, the authorities said. The group is also suspected in
robberies of drug suppliers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In May, two members of the group were arrested on charges of
stealing more than $500,000 in jewels from a Kay Jewelers store in
Union County, N.J. They used false identification to get released
on $50,000 in bail. They failed to appear in court, then fled,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they suspect that Alex Restrepo, who grew up
in New York, is the leader of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Sean O'Toole, the commanding officer of the Bronx Homicide
Task Force and coordinator of the investigation, said that ``when
they saw news broadcasts that they had killed a retired police
detective, they knew it was time to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, Interpol and the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service are also involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that if the suspects make it overseas he will seek
assistance from federal officials to extradite them, although doing
so might be difficult in Colombia and other similar countries.
Safir added that under federal law, ``we, as law enforcement, could
certainly go to other countries and forcibly return these
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were confident that they were close to
capturing them because of informers who have turned on gang members
and information that has been obtained about their contacts in the
United States and overseas. In more than one way, officials said,
the killing of Pagani was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Pagani, who had been on the police force for 27
years, struck a particularly sharp chord in the New York Police
Department, where his son is a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Pagani's family have offered a
$50,000 reward for information leading to the capture and
successful prosecution of the suspects.

   NEW YORK _ New York city council member Adolpho Carrion Jr. on
Saturday urged New York City's 900,000 Puerto Ricans to build on
their success winning presidential clemency for imprisoned Puerto
Rican nationalists to press for the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy's
``occupying force'' from the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real fundamental issue that the leader of the free
world has fought colonialism and marched around the world to free
societies and create democracies but still has a little colony in
Vieques,'' Carrion, D-Bronx, told an informal hearing in City Hall.
``This must be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrion spoke as part of a campaign by some New York City
political leaders to persuade President Clinton that the U.S. Navy
and the Marines should permanently end their use of the Puerto
Rican island of Vieques for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democratic members of the 51-member New York City Council,
two Democrats in the state legislature and Deputy New York Mayor
Ninfa Segarra, a Democrat serving Republican New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, spoke at the City Hall hearing on the future of military
training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's target range has been a long-term political
issue in Puerto Rico but became an emotional focal point last April
when a Marine Corps' bombing mishap killed a Puerto Rican contract
security guard and injured four others. Since then, the range has
been occupied by protesters and the Navy has suspended target
practice pending a top level review.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of New York's Puerto Rican community said they are
hoping to persuade both First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Giuliani, her most likely election rival, to join their cause. Both
Mrs. Clinton and the mayor are weighing possible campaigns to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Giuliani nor Mrs. Clinton has taken a public position on
the future military use of Vieques, pending the outcome of a review
by a Pentagon panel appointed at the request of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Segarra, Giuliani's deputy mayor for education and human
services, said the mayor has discussed the issue with Defense
Secretary William Cohen. Segarra said the City Hall hearing and
other steps to mobilize public opinion behind demands that the Navy
leave Vieques is ``a way for all of us to put down the mark that we
are a growing political force in this city and state,'' adding:
``We intend to be listened to and we intend to have our issues
debated.''
</P>
<P>
   Political pressure on the White House is likely to mount in
coming days. City Council member Victor Robles, majority whip on
the Democratic-controlled council, said the 51-member council will
approve a resolution Monday calling for the phased Navy withdrawal
from the island bombing range that has been used by the Pentagon
since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Nine city councilors plan to travel to Vieques next week to
conduct public hearings with some of the island's 9,300 civilian
residents.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilor Jose Rivera, wearing a T-shirt proclaiming in
Spanish, that ``All Puerto Ricans are with Vieques,'' said some
members of the city council delegation may temporarily join
demonstrators who are acting as ``human shields'' on the 899-acre
bombing range to prevent resumption of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has suspended target practice and military maneuvers on
the island pending a decision by the president that is expected
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican political leaders are making headway in their
efforts to broaden political support for their campaign to get the
Navy to withdraw from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilor Walter L. McCaffrey, D-Queens, gratefully
recalled at the hearing that Puerto Rican members of the city
council supported Irish-American politicians' efforts to win
freedom for Irish nationalists imprisoned in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand with you,'' McCaffrey declared. ``With you, we are
one.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilor John D. Sabini, whose district includes the
Jackson Heights and Elmhurst neighborhoods of Queens, said his
district has far more residents who are not American citizens than
does Puerto Rico, where the 3.8 million residents are U.S. citizens
by birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet the concept of the military doing target practice in my
district would be laughable,'' Sabini said. ``We don't use our land
and our people as fodder for practicing our bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the political leaders later traveled to a community
college in the South Bronx to watch a videotaped presentation of
Navy bomb damage on Vieques and a performance by Choco Orota, a
prominent female singer from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and Puerto Rico's Catholic
archbishop, Roberto Gonzalez, planned to conduct an ecumenical
prayer service on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr., D-Bronx, said he expected the
end of the month-long controversy over presidential clemency for
the Puerto Rican nationalists would help raise the profile of the
dispute over Vieques, a 33,000-acre island that was seized along
with Puerto Rico by the United States in the Spanish-American War
in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can all focus on the issue we all agree on _ getting
the Navy out of Vieques,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of 16 Puerto Rican nationalists offered clemency by the
president on Aug. 11 were freed earlier this week. Mrs. Clinton
called for the White House offer of clemency to be rescinded three
weeks after the prisoners had not responded to the gesture,
angering many in the Puerto Rican community.

remains. The most obvious successor, Mas' American-born son, Jorge
Mas Santos, is seen by many as too young, at 36, and he has the

his study as he tackles an unexpected workload as a House of
Representatives member. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has
ended nearly 16 years of military rule, and its politicians have
plunged into the new system with typical Nigerian spirit: headlong,
combatively and with a reserve of jaw-dropping surprises.

Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, and
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: ``Torricelli and Daschle were very

ADOPTEES BORN IN KOREA ASSEMBLE IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their names are McGowan and Smith, Isaacs and
Svendsen. They are Christian and Jewish, conservative and liberal.
They were raised in Boston or Texas or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, for the first time in history, they gathered to
celebrate their physical similarities, their common heritage, and
their shared personal experiences. More than 400 of them, all born
in South Korea and nearly all adopted by white parents in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very powerful, very meaningful, very exciting,'' said
Anne Hai Ja Curtis, 32, who grew up in Quincy, Mass., and works for
the National Park Service in Brookline, Mass. ``I wanted to be here
to feel what it is to be among my own. . . . But I also wanted to
be a part of history, to say that I am part of the generation that
started all this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this'' is international adoption, a phenomenon that has
helped to alter the way Americans perceive their country and the
means by which they build their families. Almost half a century
ago, Korea became the first nation from which US citizens began
systematically to adopt children who were not only born abroad, but
also looked unmistakably different from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day meeting in Washington, which ends with a march to
the Korean War monument Sunday morning, is the largest-scale effort
ever to bring together adults adopted from another nation. As a
result, for researchers and others concerned with the subject, it
offers an opportunity to gain unique insights into adoption
practices, biracial and multicultural issues, and the integration
of untraditional families into the American social fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of us working professionally in the field, it lets us
examine what intercountry adoption has looked like and what it will
look like for the years to come. . . . And we can learn a great
deal from that,'' Madelyn Freundlich, a leading expert on adoption
in the United States, said Saturday. ``This is an important way of
finding out what we need to do to make adoption the best that it
can be for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While those attending recognized the broader significance of the
``Gathering of the First Generation of Korean Adoptees,'' as it was
called, their motives were anything but clinical.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of them grew up in white families, frequently as the
only minorities in their schools or their communities. Moreover,
race and ethnicity added layers of intensity and complexity to the
already complicated issues of adoption that helped to shape their
self-perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting this weekend represented the first opportunity most
of these adults have had to feel what it's like to be in the
majority. Even more pointedly, it gave them the chance to interact
with an array of people who not only share their skin color, their
facial structure, and their national origin, but also their
sensibilities as adoptees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something like an emotional rush to be with so many
people I have so much in common with,'' Mark Leibowitz, 27, a
retail store manager from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said Saturday.
``A lot of people probably don't understand how big a deal that is,
but that's because . . . it's normal for them. They're with people
just like them all the time. We're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering's sponsors were a group called also-known-as,
which is a national organization of Korean adoptees; Holt
International Children's Services, the US adoption agency that
started Korean adoptions in the mid-1950s after the war there; the
Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a New York-based research
center that Freundlich heads; and the Korea Society.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the event took place at all, organizers said,
demonstrated how far adoption has come in the last few decades _
metamorphosing from a secretive institution that was tainted by
shame for generations, to a process that is increasingly open and
even celebrated Sunday. They said the addition of a racial
component provided yet another dimension of significance for a
country that is becoming increasingly multiethnic and
multicultural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intercountry adoption split wide open the notion of secrecy,
because people couldn't pretend anymore that they couldn't see the
differences between parents and their children,'' said Susan
Soon-Keum Cox, a Holt International vice president who in 1956
became one of the first Korean orphans to be adopted by Americans.
``Now I think we're coming to realize that when you talk about the
world in a global context, we are the ultimate global citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   While the focus of the meeting was commonality, and the mood was
decidedly upbeat and optimistic, there was no effort to gloss over
the problems of either adoption or race.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone interviewed said they had encountered racial
bias, but insisted they were not scarred by it; similarly, some
said they'd had negative adoption experiences, but the vast
majority described their lives and adoptive parents in positive
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone made a point that experts agree is indicative
of an increasingly public attitude among adoptees of all types. The
Korean-born adults said that, as they get older, they have more and
more interest in their biological and ethnic roots _ along with a
greater and greater desire to search for their birth parents, even
if only to see them once.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants, of all ages, said they were so fully immersed
in their white worlds growing up that they perceived themselves as
being just like the people they always saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I was a Caucasian trapped in a Korean body,'' said
Kylee Harrington, 27, a marketing coordinator from Oak Hill, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The older adoptees, in particular, described being raised by
parents who tried so hard to transform them into ``full-fledged
Americans'' that they made them feel insecure or ashamed of the
part of them that was Korean, and couldn't understand the
alienation and discrimination they endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my parents dearly . . . but they didn't get that they
were contributing to my becoming a wreck inside,'' said Mi Ok Song
Bruining, 38, an artist from Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Thompson-Isaacs, 44, a social worker in Somerville,
echoed those views and laid much of the blame on adoption agencies
that, at the time, counseled prospective parents to put aside their
children's pasts and assimilate them into US culture as thoroughly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   One of the radical turn-abouts in adoption Sunday is that
adoptive parents are given the opposite advice: to embrace their
children's background and incorporate it into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the younger the adoptees in Washington this weekend, the
more likely they were to describe childhoods filled with education
about Korea, summer camps that stressed ethnic pride, and homes in
which the artwork and foods of their homeland were common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten so much that I just didn't feel that there's a
void or anything more I needed to complete myself,'' said Sara
Hurley, 26, who lives in Bartlett, N.H., and works for the
Appalachian Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that a few intense days with her fellow adoptees
have had an effect: ``I used to say I don't want to go back to
Korea. Now I'm not so sure.''

Cuban exile community, Jorge Mas Canosa, a void in leadership
remains. The most obvious successor, Mas' American-born son, Jorge
Mas Santos, is seen by many as too young, at 36, and he has the

his study as he tackles an unexpected workload as a House of
Representatives member. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has
ended nearly 16 years of military rule, and its politicians have
plunged into the new system with typical Nigerian spirit: headlong,
combatively and with a reserve of jaw-dropping surprises.

remains. The most obvious successor, Mas' American-born son, Jorge
Mas Santos, is seen by many as too young, at 36, and he has the

BREAD AND WATER, AND FOR KAYAKERS, NOURISHMENT FOR THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the Hudson, a couple of hundred feet from shore,
Mark Gluck assembled his fellow kayakers. As Saturday's brilliant
morning sun lit up the blue-green-gray river, Gluck took off his
big floppy all-weather hat and put on a knitted yarmulke decorated
with bright flowers. He produced two slices of wheat bread, tore a
chunk off one and passed them around.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as the 21 other boaters held their chunks of bread
aloft, he prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions,'' he read,
``and create within yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.'' With
that, the boaters, all considerably more experienced at kayaking
than at Jewish ritual, threw their pieces of bread into the water
to complete the ceremony of tashlich, the rite of atonement to mark
the beginning of the Jewish New Year, in which Jews symbolically
cast the previous year's sins into the sea and start afresh. As
soon as the bread hit the water, seagulls swooped down and bore it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning's ceremony in Manhattan was unofficial in just
about every possible way. Tashlich is not supposed to be performed
until Sunday _ when the first full day of Rosh ha-Shanah falls on a
Saturday, the Sabbath, tashlich is put off until the second full
day of the new year. And Dr. Gluck, 39, is not a rabbi; he is an
associate professor of neuroscience at Rutgers University's Newark
campus.
</P>
<P>
   And while the ``ecumenical tashlich'' was advertised through the
Partnership for Jewish Life, a group for younger Jews, and was
mentioned in The Forward, a Jewish newspaper, it turned out that
everyone other than Gluck was there only for the boathouse's
weekly, decidedly secular Saturday morning paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gluck figured that ``tashlich lite'' was better than no
tashlich at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who would be interested in this were not Orthodox
Jews, since they would normally be in temple today,'' he said. ``It
was a way to encourage people who otherwise wouldn't participate in
these ceremonies to do it, and to share with non-Jews a nice side
of Judaic tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The kayakers seemed impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of neat,'' said Steve Bury, 28, a civil engineer
from Oak Ridge, N.J. ``Can't hurt, right?''

   WASHINGTON _ The Soviet KGB fabricated evidence linking the CIA
to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and passed the
material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United States,
according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the West by a
defector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the files turned over by a former KGB archivist to
British intelligence and detailed in a new book, Moscow's Cold War
spy service took several steps designed to link the CIA to the
Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included forging a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to
a CIA officer, E. Howard Hunt, asking for information ``before any
steps are taken by me or anyone else,'' according to the new book,
``The Sword and the Shield,'' written by Christopher Andrew and the
former KGB officer, Vasily Mitrokhin. The book is to be published
by Basic Books later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Oswald letter was supposed to have been written about two
weeks before Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963,
but was actually created by the KGB in the mid-1970s, after Hunt's
name had surfaced in the Watergate investigation, according to KGB
files copied by Mitrokhin while he served as a KGB archivist.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was then passed anonymously to three conspiracy buffs
and entered circulation in the United States when it was picked up
by one writer of self-published assassination books, the authors
report.
</P>
<P>
   The letter led to a brief flurry of interest when a Dallas
newspaper reported that a handwriting expert declared it to be
genuine, but a congressional panel that re-investigated the Kennedy
assassination in the late 1970s later concluded that the letter was
probably a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB's clumsy propaganda campaign never had much of an impact
on the debate over the Kennedy assassination in the United States.
But the archives spirited out of Russia by Mitrokhin appear to
support the longstanding assertions by CIA officials that the KGB
conducted disinformation campaigns designed to raise dark
suspicions about the U.S. government and prominent American leaders
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book also suggests that those efforts were amateurish and
often silly. In August 1967, for instance, the KGB authorized a
plan to discredit the Rev. Martin Luther King by planting articles
in the African press portraying him as an ``Uncle Tom'' who was
secretly being paid off by the government so that he would make
sure the civil rights movement would not threaten President Lyndon
B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB was apparently frustrated that a moderate like King had
emerged as the most influential voice in the civil rights movement,
but Moscow's comical propaganda revealed the KGB's lack of
understanding of American politics and society. The KGB's
propaganda campaign had even less impact than the FBI's separate,
but equally fumbling, efforts to smear King.
</P>
<P>
   ``News that the KGB was attempting to plant false stories in the
African press portraying Dr. King as an `Uncle Tom,' at the very
time when Dr. King was harshly attacking Johnson's conduct of the
Vietnam War indicates that American police agencies were not the
only Keystone Cops active in the 1960s,'' said David J. Garrow, a
historian at Emory University and the author of ``The FBI and
Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist in charge of managing many of the
spy service's secret files until he retired in 1984. When he
arrived in Britain in 1992 and sought out British intelligence, he
brought with him a huge cache of notes that he said he had taken
based on those files, and turned them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrokhin files, which the British considered reliable
enough to share with the CIA and FBI, have offered Western
intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of
historical information about KGB operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while the archives quoted in the book contain only limited
information about Soviet espionage cases, the archives have already
helped identify some spies. In the United States, for instance, the
book reveals that the Mitrokhin files helped lead the FBI to Robert
Lipka, a former code-clerk at the National Security Agency, who
worked as a Soviet mole in the 1960s. Lipka was arrested in 1996
and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage. Information
about other open spy cases contained in the archives were withheld
from the book, including on the case of a former State Department
official, Felix S. Bloch, who was suspended in 1989 and resigned in
1990 but was never charged or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin first attempted to defect to the United States, but
was received a lukewarm reception from a CIA officer when he
approached the agency in a Baltic country soon after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the CIA's Soviet/East European Division had
decided that the KGB was no longer a threat and had instituted a
controversial new policy that led CIA officers in the field to turn
away many defectors. Paul Redmond, who was then the CIA's deputy
chief of counterintelligence, said in an interview that he sought
to take over the Mitrokhin case after other officials had failed to
show interest, but by then Mitrokhin had turned to the British.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond now argues that the CIA's diffident handling of
Mitrokhin's efforts underscored a larger problem, which was that
the CIA decided ``naively'' after the collapse of the Soviet Union
to scale back its espionage operations against Moscow. ABC News
reported on this controversy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA apparently did miss a good bet with Mitrokhin, since his
archives seem to reveal a wide array of intriguing insights into
KGB operations against the West. Among other things, according to
the book, the files show that the KGB planted secret caches of
weapons in Europe and probably in North America as well, apparently
for use in the event of war.

</P>
<P>
   They also appear to show that the KGB sought to blackmail German
Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1960s by alleging that he had spied
for Moscow during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While Brandt was living in exile in Sweden during the war, he
had provided information about Germany to the Soviets as well as
the British and Americans, but never committed espionage, the files
show. But in 1962, the KGB attempted to blackmail Brandt by
threatening to use evidence of his dealings with the KGB's
Stockholm residency against him, according to the Mitrokhin
archives. The attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that Mitrokhin's files also pointed to the
existence of a previously unknown British agent who was recruited
on ideological grounds by the Soviets during the 1930s, but who
survived the collapse of the famous Kim Philby spy ring. Melita
Norwood, code-named Hola in the Mitrokhin files, remained in place
after the others in the Cambridge spy ring were identified or
forced to defect to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that, after being recruited to the Soviet cause in
the 1930s, Norwood began to spy for Moscow after she started
working in the British Non-Ferrous Metals Association in 1945,
providing information on Britain's project to build its first
atomic bomb. She spied for the Soviets for decades, and in 1958
Moscow secretly awarded her the Order of the Red Banner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, she also tried to recruit other British
officials to spy for Moscow, and succeeded in convincing at least
one unidentified British civil servant to provide the Soviets with
technical information and intelligence on British arms sales in the
1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She retired without being arrested and, now 87, lives in a
suburb of London, where she spoke to reporters after news of her
past was revealed Saturday in The Times of London. She said she had
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want money,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying.
``It was not that side I was interested in. I wanted Russia to be
on an equal footing with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people, the ones who lived through it, might
understand,'' she added. ``I'm not so sure about the young
generation. I hope they accept it.''

NO REGRETS FOR PIAZZA, PLENTY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Piazza is attempting to focus on the road ahead, on driving
the promising Mets to the postseason. But there is Los Angeles
honking in his rear-view mirror, tailgating and swerving, its
headlights blaring.
</P>
<P>
   He's forced to look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be a professional and turn the page,'' Piazza
said, opting for another analogy. ``I don't think anybody goes
through life without any regrets. Things happen for a reason. But
I'm a Met now, and that's what I'm thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and their fans, meanwhile, are left to contemplate a
meaningless season _ and wonder about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will end the decade without so much as a playoff
victory. By their standards, it was a decade of mediocrity. But
with Piazza, at least they were close. They made the playoffs, even
though they were swept by the Reds and Braves. They contended for
the division, even if they were a player or two short and faded in
the final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 16 months after trading Piazza to Florida for Gary
Sheffield and four other players, the Dodgers are much more than a
player or two away from contending. The Piazza trade began a period
of organizational flux that has yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's impact with the Dodgers was as deep as a meteor crater,
and it hasn't been filled.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had their star in Piazza. Sure, he wasn't the
rah-rah clubhouse leader. He wasn't the greatest defensive catcher.
He fought with the club over his contract.
</P>
<P>
   But he was the ultimate Dodger. The grandson of Tommy Lasorda.
And he had the legendary origins too, drafted in the 62nd round as
a personal favor to Piazza's father, Vince.
</P>
<P>
   He became their handsome icon, their magnetic star, the focus of
their lineup _ and their marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built this team around him,'' said Sheffield, ``and when
he left, the team didn't know how to react.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to replace him with Kevin Brown. They tried
with Todd Hundley and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   All they got were F-bombs and cold stares.
</P>
<P>
   How many fans honestly feel they identify with Brown? If you
don't dislike him for his $105 million contract, then his cold and
colorless personality does plenty to turn you off.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sheffield, he's an explosive player, and not a bad guy
either. But he doesn't have Piazza's charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield wasn't witness to the Piazza era. He was one of five
players the Dodgers acquired from Florida in a salary-dumping deal
for Piazza and Todd Zeile on May 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield has seen the team maneuver wildly since that
trade, changing thr front office, casting off players and signing
new ones, only careening all the more out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what I've experienced in this clubhouse, I can
understand some of the reasons why he left,'' Sheffield said,
declining to elaborate on those reasons. ``If he wanted to be a
Dodger, he'd be a Dodger. But he couldn't find what he wanted here,
so he went somewhere else to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it looks like he's found it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the money, Piazza turned down $87 million from the
Dodgers and signed with the Mets for $91 million _ a negligible
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves one thing to me,'' Sheffield said. ``It proves he
didn't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his reasons for leaving, Piazza is having a blast
in New York. After a rocky introduction, he has them poised to make
the playoffs, dethroning the Atlanta Braves in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Even playing in front of the most ravenous media contingent in
the country, Piazza feels less pressure with the Mets' ensemble
cast. The Mets infield _ Olerud, Ventura, Alfonzo and Rey Ordonez _
was on the cover of last week's Sports Illustrated. Not Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let that one go,'' he said, flashing that poster-boy
smile. ``I've had four SI covers already.''
</P>
<P>
   It's painfully obvious that many Dodgers fans still haven't
absolved themselves of Piazza worship. There have been more jerseys
with his old No.31 in the Chavez Ravine stands this weekend than
for any current Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   He was ruefully booed by many fans, who loathe him for turning
down $87 million. But he was gleefully cheered by a good portion of
the rest, who remember only the opposite-field homers and the
shampoo commercials.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly think more about him than he does of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my time here,'' Piazza said. ``But I've moved on.''

DEION, PRIMETIME FORGE UNIQUE REPORTING APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEION SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders' column, as told to staff
writer Clarence E. Hill Jr., will appear in the ''Fort Worth
Star-Telegram ``every Sunday during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As I sit contemplating about which subject I should speak on, so
many issues come to mind that I want to tackle immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I did say tackle. I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   The media and its ways are things I personally don't totally
understand. And the media doesn't totally understand the athlete in
some cases either.
</P>
<P>
   But we need each other to achieve certain things, so why can't
we just get along. Though there are many reasons, I'll elaborate on
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the athlete nor the media spend enough time trying to
truly understand and walk in each other's shoes, which could enable
both parties to see issues through the others' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Culture and background also play major roles in this
misunderstanding. Being from different backgrounds sometimes makes
us susceptible to both stereotyping and generalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes must also understand that the media is under pressure
to meet a deadline to report or write a story. There is no time for
mood swings, sudden shyness or amnesia when push comes to shove.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the media and I have had sort of a use-use type
of relationship. I used them and they used me. Talk about
dysfunction. We dissed each other, but we both went on to function
well.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm now part of the media, I've come up with a solution
for a wonderful working relationship between me and the media.
</P>
<P>
   I'll interview myself. This way both parties can be satisfied
without the unnecessary pressures of the obstacles stated above.
</P>
<P>
   I was deemed so controversial and misunderstood because there
was 2 in 1 _ Deion and Primetime all in one body (No. 21, get it).
There is Deion whom you see everyday, but when the whistle blows,
it's Primetime showing up on game day.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the next few months, I will discuss a variety
of issues in my column. I will talk about stuff people don't like
to talk about. I want people to understand the athlete and also
give you a clearer view of who Deion/Primetime is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Deion will interview Primetime, and sometimes
Primetime will interview Deion. But it's always going to be real.
</P>
<P>
   We are going to start with Deion interviewing Primetime and shed
some light on the surgically repaired great left toe.
</P>
<P>
   DS: So what's up with the toe?
</P>
<P>
   PT: It's healing fine, maybe even ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   DS: When you initially injured it in the game against Arizona
last year, did you ever imagine it would warrant surgery?
</P>
<P>
   PT: Not in a million years. I've never had an injury this
serious in my 10-year career. I thought the pain would just go away
or that it would heal on its own. It was just a toe, and like most
people, I didn't think it was that big of a deal. But each day when
I woke up and stepped out of bed, the pain was still there and
growing more intense every day.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Were you ever frustrated?
</P>
<P>
   PT: There were times I wanted to play during my injury last
season, and I wanted the trainers to inject my toe \Rto numb it\S
so I would be able to play. But they refused to do so because the
risk factor of further damage to the toe was so great.
</P>
<P>
   DS: But in the playoff game you injected it. What was the
difference?
</P>
<P>
   PT: I was healing to the point that doctors cleared me to have
the shot. Besides, it was the playoffs and the purpose for the
whole season is the playoffs and the Super Bowl. It's all or
nothing at that point. However, that didn't happen and as a result
of injecting my toe I had to be rushed to hospital at 4 a.m. due to
excessive swelling and pain. I thought to myself, ``you are so
stupid, who really cares besides your family.''
</P>
<P>
   DS: Surgery _ why did you wait so long?
</P>
<P>
   PT: We, the Cowboys, doctors and myself, wanted to give it every
chance to heal and we did. Actually, I was in the complex doing
aerobics in the off-season when I realized that this thing wasn't
healing. I knew I needed to do something and that's when I took it
to the trainers and said maybe we should explore the possibility of
going to see a doctor. Two days later we went to a specialist in
Carolina. The specialist looked me in my eye and said this is so
rare you may never play again. Then we went to New York to see the
main guy \R Dr. Bill Hamilton\S, who ended up doing the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Were you nervous or scared?
</P>
<P>
   PT: Not at all. I understood the risk involved. The doctors said
that I might not play gain. I said, ``I understand, but God said
that no weapon formed against me shall prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   DS: Did you worry that the injury might have prevented you from
getting a contract extension from the Cowboys and force you to play
somewhere else, especially considering that you love the North
Texas area so much that you are building a new home in Prosper?
</P>
<P>
   PT: No, because I can play. Not only can I play, but I can play
this game real good. So why would I worry when 30 other teams would
want me? Besides, if I would have had to leave, it would have been
the Lord's will. He would have made it wonderful somewhere else.
But this is going to be my home no matter where I play.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Does it bother you to hear the constant skepticism from
people who say, ``It's just a toe, you aren't really hurt, you're
faking, you didn't really need surgery, you're not tough, why did
they pay you so much when they don't know you can play?''
</P>
<P>
   PT: No, because success comes with that. I could answer every
accusation like, ``Oh sure, I planned my wedding with surgery in
mind. I really wanted to limp down the aisle with a cane and drop
my beautiful bride trying to carry her over the threshold, and I
really wanted to take five weeks off during one of the best seasons
of my career while a long-term contract was at risk.'' I could go
on but why? What people think of me doesn't confuse me with what I
think of myself. I know who, what, where and why I am and I know
where I'm going and how to get there. I know it's not possible to
please God and man, so I chose to please God and pray for man.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Will you play today against the Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   PT: I want to but...
</P>
<P>
   DS: But what? Don't you feel an obligation to your team and the
fans?
</P>
<P>
   PT: Yes, that's why there's a but. Fans, along with my
teammates, want and deserve to see the best product a team has to
offer. But right now, I can't give them that. Though it still may
be good, it's not the best. I can't imagine you buying a can of
Pepsi half full or a cake with two slices missing and be satisfied.
You all deserve that can and cake dish to be full and I want to be
able to give you the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   PT: Yes, I'd like to answer questions from the fans. Beginning
next week, e-mail your questions to chill\nstar-telegram.com and I
will answer at least one each week.
</P>
<P>
   DS: Jesus loves you!

DODGERS MANAGEMENT TEACHES BY EXAMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Mike Piazza in town this weekend, we're
reminded of the six-year, $60 million contract he wanted two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would have kept him a Dodger forever and also would
have allowed Kevin Brown to become a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Peter O'Malley said he didn't want to hand a
potential owner that kind of debt after he put the team up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket change for Rupert Murdoch. A bad memory for everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to mind for a lot of reasons, mostly because Piazza's
Mets are in the middle of a terrific pennant race and the Dodgers
are finishing off another season of despair.
</P>
<P>
   But it also comes up because the Cleveland Indians are now in
the same position with slugger Manny Ramirez. He is making $4.5
million, a pittance for his 142 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes a free agent after the 2001 season and could command
between $12 million and 15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jacobs family, which owns the Indians, is selling and
doesn't want to saddle the new owners with too much debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians might want to look at the Dodgers and avoid the same
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Malley had agreed to that contract, Piazza would have been
locked up until he was 35. At that point, he would have been
looking at a three-year deal at best for a whole lot less than the
seven-year, $91 million it cost the Mets to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fox's pitbull Chase Carey decided he couldn't re-sign
Piazza after the catcher turned down six years for $85 million. The
Dodgers sent Piazza and Todd Zeile to Florida in a blockbuster
trade that brought Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Bobby
Bonilla to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was in the first year of a six-year, $61 million
contract. The Dodgers also had to ante up $2.5 million to get
Sheffield to waive his no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   That meant he made almost $12 million last year and more than
$9.5 million through 2003. Piazza would have cost about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weight of Sheffield's contract, the Dodgers still
signed Brown to a seven-year deal worth $105 million.
</P>
<P>
   On a team with no apparent bottom line, the bottom line is
Piazza is gone and the Dodgers haven't been competitive since.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the savings.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also is leery of giving Ramirez that much money,
thinking it might hurt his motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Many think O'Malley's reluctance to give Piazza the money was
personal. Piazza never bought into the Dodger-first mentality that
helped make the organization great. After the Dodgers refused to
negotiate a bigger deal, he turned down club requests for personal
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight, of course, is a beautiful thing if you don't have
your finger on the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   But every time Boston's Pedro Martinez pitches like he did
Friday night with a one-hit, 17-strikeout performance against the
New York Yankees, you wonder how he ever got away.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of blame to go around. Fred Claire, Frank Jobe,
even the shadow of Martinez's brother Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   But there might have been an even bigger villain: Jody Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the scrappy second baseman in 1992?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of that season, Claire offered Reed, a potential free
agent, a three-year contract worth $7.5 million. The Dodgers had a
policy of negotiating only with their free agents during the
exclusive two-week window after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't break it for Steve Sax, and they certainly weren't
breaking it for Jody Reed. No bidding wars allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was getting nibbles from the San Francisco Giants, who were
talking about $10 million for three years. Reed filed for free
agency and Claire pulled the offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, the Giants decided to retain Robby Thompson,
but by then the Dodgers had decided to trade for Montreal's Delino
DeShields. The offer was Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was never heard from again. The only time DeShields' name
comes up is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Martinez, they're going to the postseason and
probably the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   If the Indians are smart, they will study Dodgers history. And
not repeat it. &QL;

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Martin was the quiet kid in all-whites flailing
away on the remote courts of the National Tennis Center as a junior
player when Andre Agassi was bleaching his long locks and foiling
tradition with his audacious denim shorts in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, the tagalong American who has always stood
in line for recognition behind the likes of Pete Sampras and Jim
Courier, Michael Chang and Agassi has been nudged from the
background with the help of karma, desire and an intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martin, the destined one, will test his star-aligned tour
against Agassi, the chosen one, as the sole survivors of a U.S.
Open men's draw that was diluted after injuries to Sampras and
Patrick Rafter. In the end, the two 29-year olds _ one balding and
the other graying _ outlasted the stylish games of their opponents
Saturday on their way to the first all-American final since Sampras
and Chang met in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions were just right for it. Under a Windex-blue sky
Saturday, the second-seeded Agassi, labeled a sure-thing to land in
the finals, fulfilled the fixes of the Andre junkies that were
stirring in Arthur Ashe Stadium by dusting off his serve and
measuring the wind in time to pry the men's No. 1 ranking away from
the listless third-seed, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this time of my life, it's the best I've ever
played,'' said Agassi, who has lost just four matches _ three to
Sampras _ since his French Open title in May. ``I think you can
only be asked to do so much in each situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last dozen days, Martin did more than was asked as he
showed it's never too late to reveal your identity to an American
public eager to embrace miracle-workers. Fitting this description,
Martin extended himself through sickness and in health to secure
his place in the final with a meticulous dismantling of Frenchman
Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a week, Martin looked as crisp as a
dry-cleaned shirt compared to the greenish hue he had had during
his last two matches, performances that were fortified by a buffet
of intravenous fluids and the chanting crowds. Finally, he looked
healthy, as if the cool, breezy air agreed with him in the face of
the stylish but perpetually angst-ridden Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning and felt fresh,'' Martin said. ``I was
a little nervous that I might not be able to play as well on a full
tank as I did on a half.''
</P>
<P>
   He was even better. On this day, his usual grit overcame grace
as Martin snapped back returns and pulled winners out of a holster
with the kind of consistency that left Pioline crestfallen. At one
point, as his backhand floated long on Martin's set point to close
the second, Pioline flipped his racket into the air, missed the
catch and knocked himself in the head. This was not going to be his
day to make his third Grand Slam final, it was Martin's moment to
gain his second.
</P>
<P>
   Since his appearance in the 1994 Australian Open final, Martin
has faded in and out as a threat on the men's tour because of
nagging injuries that seemed to sabotage his every rise in the
rankings. In 1996, he finished the year ranked 12th. A year later,
after an elbow injury that put his tennis on hold for six months,
his ranking had plummeted to 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few moments that I wondered if I'd play again,''
Martin said. ``Those thoughts stuck with me for another six months
to a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sharpening his bingo skills, Martin decided it was
not time to retire, but the moment to seize a chance. That was
obvious during an exhausting fourth-round match here with Greg
Rusedski, when Martin was nearly undone by a stomach virus. Down
two sets to none, he was watching his adversary serve for the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, through pride or divine intervention, Martin survived
in a five-set match that left him so physically drained that he was
spread out in the training room for two hours afterward receiving
fluids through a tube. No matter, he survived the quarterfinals and
made quicker work of Pioline in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him play like this,'' said Pioline, who
watched 14 aces by Martin pass in a blur. ``I think he has a good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he? Agassi is before him, standing as the big favorite with
Sampras out of his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pete pulled out, I wanted to play the best player on the
other side of the draw, and it's Todd Martin,'' Agassi said. ``He's
done some incredible things to get here. It's been great watching
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier going to bed thinking about Todd Martin than Pete.
You still have a job to do. And the job can be brutally difficult
if you don't take care of the things that you need to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that Agassi, with his strokes as sharp as prongs
and his body as fit as it has ever been, could take care of Martin.
Once Agassi found his serve after dropping his first set against
Kafelnikov, his game fell into place while his opponent fell apart
beneath errors that sapped the drama from the match for the top
ranking in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Given Agassi's dominance, it would seem as if Martin will only
be background scenery for his fifth Grand Slam title. For years,
this has been Martin's position among the Americans, in the
background, far removed from they hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``My peers are mostly guys who could have or did turn pro before
they left, before they were finished high school,'' said Martin,
who turned pro before his junior year at Northwestern. ``Gee, you
know, in comparison to those guys, I had absolutely no fathomable
chance of being at a level anywhere near high enough to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys competed for Grand Slam titles 10 years ago. Yeah,
I'm a late bloomer. But as you see, all those guys are still
playing on a very high level now. They age just as quickly as I do.
It just doesn't show.''

WAKE FOREST FINDS ITS LEGS AT ARMY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Army and Wake Forest, the teams with the best
and worst rushing attacks in Division I-A last season, met Saturday
at Michie Stadium, and the one with 1998's least potent ground game
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest, which averaged only 65.4 yards a game rushing last
season, Saturday had a much bigger and more experienced offensive
line, and the best runner in Morgan Kane, to give the Deacons a
34-15 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kane _ a senior fullback from Ottawa and the only returning
backfield starter from last season's 3-8 team _ gained 211 yards on
32 carries, including two touchdown runs of 10 and 46 yards. Wake
Forest managed something few teams do, outgaining the Cadets on the
ground, 320 to 282 yards. Army averaged 293.8 yards a game in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Army kept it close through the first three quarters before a
crowd of 29,646. The Cadets drew within 10-9 at the end of the
first half when Matt Parker kicked his third field goal, a
48-yarder. Then, with Wake Forest ahead, 17-9, the Cadets scored
their lone touchdown, a 9-yard pass from quarterback Joe Gerena to
Grady Jett, with 4 minutes 52 seconds left in the third quarter.
But Gerena's pass for a 2-point conversion was knocked down in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   That ended the Cadets' scoring. On Wake Forest's next two
possessions Army proved vulnerable on big plays, as it had so often
last season when the Cadets were 3-8, losing three games by a total
of nine points.
</P>
<P>
   First, Kane bolted up the middle for a 46-yard touchdown 2:47
into the fourth quarter. On the Deacons' next possession,
quarterback Ben Sankey raced 20 yards for Wake Forest's final
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some great opportunities, but didn't take advantage,''
Army coach Bob Sutton said after the game. In the first half, the
Cadets got inside the Wake Forest 20-yard line three times but
scored only two field goals. The Cadets also failed to take
advantage of a fumble recovery at the Wake Forest 37-yard line in
the third quarter. And early in the fourth quarter the Cadets drove
to the Deacons' 39 but a Gerena pass was intercepted at the 5-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't convert when we could have,'' Sutton said. ``And we
let a team that doesn't run well run the ball.''

BRAVES GO WITH THE FLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Braves' remarkable success despite critical
injuries can be traced to their ability to make adjustments in
difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, they used either Walt Weiss or Ozzie Guillen as
leadoff men, with dismal results.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, they switched to left fielder Gerald Williams , and
the results have been astounding. In the first 31 games, they went
24-7 and Williams had 19 RBI, 25 runs and nine steals.
</P>
<P>
   He has become the first true leadoff hitter for the Braves since
Marquis Grissom was traded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' getting on base has helped Chipper Jones develop into
a very strong MVP candidate. He has more than 100 RBI for the
fourth consecutive year and has reached 40 homers for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the key piece that we have needed all year,''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan said. ``We needed a boost in the second half and he
gave it to us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which appears to have withstood the Giants' final
charge, has a good chance to have four players with 100 RBI and
four with 100 runs. Matt Williams is already there in RBI and Luis
Gonzalez and Jay Bell could reach it by the weekend. Steve Finley,
who had to cut his own free-agent deal last winter, has 29 homers
and 91 RBI. Bell, Gonzalez and Tony Womack already have scored 100
runs, with Williams closing in. The National League record for
having players reach those numbers is six, by the Dodgers in 1953.
This year's team still does not have anyone with 100 RBI or runs
scored. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red-hot Reds
</P>
<P>
   With nine homers last Saturday and five more the next day,
Cincinnati set a major-league record and kept alive its hopes in
the wild-card race. But the Reds' best hitter all year, Sean Casey,
has not joined in the fun. Reds manager Jack McKeon benched him
twice this past week, hoping to take off some of the pressure. When
McKeon did it in August, Casey responded by hitting .528 (19 for
36) during the next nine games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A little history
</P>
<P>
   An upside to the Cubs being so bad is that they now are battling
Florida and Montreal for the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. The
last time the Cubs had the first overall pick was in 1982 when they
took their former longtime shortstop
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston. While it is too soon to know about 1999 pick Ben
Christensen, the 1998 draft was good for the Cubs. They took high
school outfielder Corey Patterson,
</P>
<P>
   who batted .320 with 20 homers, 35 doubles, 72 extra-base hits
and 31 stolen bases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life after Leyland
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jim Leyland has decided to step down to spend more time
with his family, the Colorado Rockies are looking for a manager and
general manager. The candidates are lining up. The interviews for
GM have begun with Rockies exec Gary Hughes believed to be the
early front-runner. Cleveland assistant GM Dan O'Dowd also has been
in, but the Yankees denied Colorado permission to talk to Mark
Newman. As for manager, Phil Garner has a good chance. But a
sleeper candidate is Oakland's Art Howe, who has the A's in an
unlikely wild-card race. Howe was a hitting instructor in Colorado
under Don Baylor and is a personal favorite of owner Jerry
McMorris'. Howe was the runner-up last year when Leyland took the
job. By the way, Leyland walks away from $4.5 million remaining on
his three-year, $6 million contract. Leyland also had $500,000
deferred from each year of the contract. &QL;

WILLIAMS BEATS HINGIS TO WIN U.S. OPEN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using her racquet like a stun gun to pound and
paralyze her savvy opponent, the No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis, into
submission Saturday, Serena Williams, the 17-year-old follow-up act
to her big sister phenom Venus, captured the women's championship
at the U.S. Open in her first appearance in a Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' breakthrough, coupled with the advance of Andre Agassi
and Todd Martin to the men's final, guaranteed the century's final
Open a patriotic denouement, its first American-born champions
since Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert prevailed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, I won, oh my God,'' the jubilant Williams mouthed,
clasping both hands to her thumping heart, after Hingis motored a
double-handed backhand out of bounds on Williams' third match
point. That sealed a 6-3, 7-6(7-4) upset for the youngest of the
five Williams sister, the one who calls herself the family
extrovert. The victory moved Williams, who dethroned the Open's
defending champion, Lindsay Davenport, in the semifinals, to a
career-best fourth in the computer ranking, just behind her
celebrated sibling Venus, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing; I was always the one who said, `I want to
win the U.S. Open,' and Venus, she always wanted Wimbeldon,'' said
Williams, who fielded a congratulatory call from President Clinton
and his daughter, Chelsea. Williams said they talked tennis, not
politics. ``I'm not into politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her initial reaction to winning, Williams said, was a big blur.
``I thought, `Should I scream, should I yell or should I cry?' And
I guess ended up doing them all. And I guess it was at the apex.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-youngest champion in Open history, Serena Williams,
wearing a sunny yellow dress on a crystalline afternoon, became the
first African-American woman to reign supreme on a Grand Slam stage
since Althea Gibson, who counted the 1957 and 1958 Opens among her
five Grand Slam crowns, became the first black woman to claim a
major title in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The last woman to win the Open on her first visit to its final
was Hingis, who collected her third Grand Slam title of 1997 by
defeating Venus Williams, then an unseeded and 66th-ranked neophyte
with a little sister too young to compete on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5-foot-10-inch, 145-pound Serena Williams, called the
``better, badder, meaner'' competitor of the talented pair by their
father/coach, Richard, made a swift climb after turning
professional at 15. In 1997, she moved from 453rd to 99th in the
ranking, in 1998 she won a pair of Grand Slam mixed doubles titles,
and this spring she went on a 16-match rampage that yielded titles
at Paris and Indian Wells, Calif., and carried her to an
all-Williams finale at the Lipton Championships. Her current streak
of invincibility stretched to 13 with Saturday's victory, her
second consecutive upset of Hingis, whose record of futility when
trying to defeat both Williams sisters at the same event remained
intact _ now 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Serena Williams was less than lethal only
when she fumbled away two match points as a desperate Hingis served
at 3-5 of the second set. The glitch carried over and caused
Williams to lose her composure as she stepped up to serve for the
victory at 5-4 of the second set. As the topper to a mounting pile
of unforced errors, Williams walloped a forehand long at triple
break point that allowed the tenacious 18-year-old Swiss back into
the thick of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always leading, I felt like always being behind, being
defensive, but I was reborn like, when she missed those two match
points,'' said Hingis, who called the final stages of the match ``a
willpower game.''
</P>
<P>
   With her mother, Melanie Molitor, back in her customary coaching
corner after the debacle at Wimbledon, where Hingis' attempt at
emancipation produced a tearful first-round loss, Hingis had
reached her third Grand Slam final of 1999. She won just one of
them, the Australian Open, but unlike the French Open, where her
final against Steffi Graf deteriorated into a spiteful tantrum, she
seemed undisturbed by Saturday's setback, her second consecutive
defeat in an Open final.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I'm still at the top,'' Hingis said. ``I think all of
us, we are pretty much at our limits; I don't think it can get much
better,'' she said of the caliber of tennis she and the Williams
sisters reached at this event.
</P>
<P>
   After Hingis held for a 6-5 edge, it was Williams' turn to
scramble into a tie breaker. It took her five deuces, but she got
there with a blistering down-the-line passing shot. While Williams
wasn't happy with herself for tensing up on her two match points at
5-3 _ she blew the first with a wild backhand that steered way
clear of its sideline target and the second with a netted backhand
return _ Williams relaxed once she found herself in a tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I can't lose in tie breakers; that's when the
serve really counts,'' said Williams, now 6-0 in 1999 tie breakers.
</P>
<P>
   After Hingis leveled the tie breaker at 4-4 by angling a
snarling crosscourt forehand over the net and forcing a forehand
error from the panting Williams, the American snapped right back
with an untouchable forehand down-the-line return that granted her
a 5-4 edge. Another furious rally produced a defensive lob from
Hingis that wafted over Williams' head and, just as she knelt in
surrender after a frantic chase, touched down just behind the
baseline to give her a third match point.
</P>
<P>
   This time Williams had her work done for her by Hingis, who
pumped a backhand long, unleashed a grimace in place of her usual
Cheshire cat smirk, and waited for the winner to absorb her
accomplishment. At net, they shared a brief hug, the most positive
interaction of a two-week stint of sniping instigated by Richard
Williams' prediction that both his daughters would reach the final.
Hingis, who took exception to that, had called the Williams
patriarch a big mouth; Venus Williams, who fell to Hingis in the
semifinals, stayed out of the fray, but Serena attributed Hingis'
outburst to her ``lack of formal education.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the battle lines were drawn up in shots, not verbiage:
Hingis had complained that ``they're three against me,'' but in the
final, it was only Serena Williams who ganged up on her. That was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just better today,'' Hingis said. ``Between Serena and
me, the comments went back and forth, but at the end, it's just
been terrific tennis.''

FOOTSTEPS GROW LOUDER AS RED SOX EDGE YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu glanced toward right field to watch a
ball zooming into the seats Saturday for a home run and then
quickly turned away and gazed at the grass. Irabu trudged behind
the mound, raised his arms up high as if he was doing jumping jacks
and then arched his back. It was only the second inning and Irabu
looked like the poster pitcher for exasperation. He was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The day started and finished in exasperating fashion for the New
York Yankees, who mixed in some exhilarating moments to counter
their frustration before tumbling to the Boston Red Sox, 11-10, at
Yankee Stadium. The Yankees can see, feel and hear the Red Sox
creeping up on them after another loss, a loss in which the Yankees
staged three teasing comebacks only to end up lamenting a sloppy
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When is the last time the Yankees felt this uncertain? Maybe
earlier this season there were stray doubts, but the Yankees have
been in first place for 96 straight days, and things are never as
serious in April as they are in September. The Red Sox, who have
sounded content to try for the wild-card berth, have made the
Yankees nervous after chiseling the Yankees' lead in the American
League East to 4 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's erratic pitching put the Yankees in a perilous position
and caused Joe Torre to replace him after two innings, Nomar
Garciaparra slugged two of the Red Sox' five homers, and Chuck
Knoblauch was booed after he committed another critical error which
led to Garciaparra's three-run homer. General manager Brian Cashman
spoke with a concerned George Steinbrenner by telephone on Friday
night and surely fielded another call Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always alarmed and I'm always looking over my shoulder to
see who is there,'' Steinbrenner said by telephone. ``People say
all you have to do is one of the next two and you're still up by
five and a half, but I don't think that way. We've got to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   It is premature for the Yankees to panic because they would have
to collapse totally in the last 21 games to miss the postseason,
but they do need to end a streak in which they have lost 7 of 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse, Roger Clemens, once an icon in Boston,
will try to prevent a massacre of sorts in the Bronx Sunday as the
Red Sox push for the three-game sweep. It will be up to Clemens to
quiet the brash Red Sox fans who have shocked some Yankees with
their rising decibel level and even by unveiling a derogatory
Yankee banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense any tension or panic mode,'' David Cone said.
``I do sense there is a little bit of urgency in tomorrow's game.
Doing the math is pretty easy. It's five and a half or three and a
half. It's a big swing game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees had won one of the first two games against the
Red Sox, they could relax a bit Sunday. No one is relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to come out and win tomorrow's game,'' Darryl
Strawberry said. ``We put ourselves in a tough situation. It's been
comfortable most of the year for this club. Now it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are uncomfortable despite comebacks Saturday from a
5-0 hole anda 9-4 deficit and almost from an 11-8 disadvantage.
Paul O'Neill's three-run homer highlighted a four-run outburst in
the fourth inning, but it came off Mark Portugal. Portugal is 0-6
with a 7.18 earned run average against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Another four-run splurge, in the seventh, was boosted by three
Boston errors. Finally, after Butch Huskey's two-run, pinch-hit
homer off Mike Stanton in the eighth increased the Red Sox' lead to
11-8, Tino Martinez hit a towering two-run shot that nearly scraped
the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Rod Beck retired Bernie Williams with the potential
tying run on first to end the game, Irabu had failed the Yankees
and angered Torre. Irabu walked the first two batters (both
scored), and he allowed four runs in two innings. Torre did not let
Irabu see the third, and the Yankees never recovered as their
bullpen also fizzled. The Yankees gave up nine walks and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our starter to give us a chance to win every time we
send him out there,'' Torre said. ``Walking the first two guys is
not the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, who has allowed 29 earned runs in his last 35 innings,
would not address Torre's decision. When Irabu was asked if he
would have pitched better if he had stayed in the game, he simply
said, ``I wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concern for the Yankees goes beyond Irabu. They must
regroup and survive September before they can thrive in October.
The postseason looms, but the Yankees were exasperated Saturday.
The Red Sox are within four and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's pressure, so what?'' Torre said. ``We have to deal
with pressure every day here anyway.''

COWBOYS OFFENSE HAS THE MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a slow-go kind of summer for the Cowboys. Missing
football pieces were scattered from here to Wichita Falls. For a
while, it appeared Chan Gailey was impersonating a shade-tree
mechanic, with engine parts strewed across his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, meaning an assortment of injuries, The Theatre
of the Toe, and that one ongoing suspension, Gailey kept saying,
``we aren't where we need to be, but we've still got time to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Chan. Time's up.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Cowboys kick off their 40th NFL season today in
Washington, there is basically no excuse for this team not to have
its motor running.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, all pieces are in place, particularly on
offense. And since the NFL of today is a league based on offense,
and since Gailey was originally hired as head coach to bring back
offensive RPMs, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Show us what you've got, Mr. Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The no-longer-hated Redskins remain a suspect defensive club,
still void of run-stoppers _ as they were last season; plus there's
a lot of single coverage in the secondary _ just what receivers and
quarterbacks love to see.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the Cowboys died last December because of offensive
meltdown. But Gailey and owner Jerry Jones addressed all that, and
offensive revival is expected to come in several areas. Up front,
the Cowboys had a makeover from tackle to tackle. Only Erik
Williams remains at the same line position he played in '98.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest hole was at receiver, and this could now be the
deepest, most talented area on the team. Beyond a healthy Ernie
Mills and new speed in Rocket Ismail, an unexpected bonus surfaced
at receiver. This rookie, Wane McGarity, is a ready-to-go-now
surprise, while second-year man Jeff Ogden has made the necessary
elevation from his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around the country have forgotten us; the Cowboys are
yesterday's news,'' said Michael Irvin, the senior member of the
receivers. ``But we've got a chance with this offense to be
remembered again, and feared again.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, of course, could have also been talking about himself _
remembered again, feared again. This is a pivotal season in the
long football life of Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch him,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman. ``Michael is going
to be Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-school football ... dynasty-days football, those are a
distant memory for the Cowboys. But the names haven't changed. It's
still The Trio. What Aikman does, what Emmitt Smith does, and to a
certain extent, what Irvin does, will determine how good the
offense can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling, and I think it's shared league-wide, is the two
ingredients you have to have are a great offensive mind as coach,
and a great quarterback,'' said owner Jones. ``In Chan, and in
Troy, I see us with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a Jerry dream, or reality?
</P>
<P>
   Also watch for one other offensive development _ tight end David
LaFleur. Privately, Valley Ranch optimism runneth over on LaFleur
becoming an impact offensive force. He's different from Jay
Novacek, with LaFleur being a strong blocker. But the Cowboys feel
LaFleur can become the receiving alternative missing since
Novacek's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, did anyone mention defense?
</P>
<P>
   I'v got three words for you:
</P>
<P>
   Trust in Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strength will be a group of hungry guys who like to run,''
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said Friday. ``We are missing some
veterans we hoped to have. But I don't make excuses. We can win
with what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Through training camp and the exhibition season, Campo mixed and
matched. He had a setback when Quentin Coryatt's physical problems
prevented the free agent from taking over at strong-side
linebacker. There was another minus when veteran cornerback Kevin
Smith went down with a still ailing back. Smith is not what he once
was, but was valuable for the secondary rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Than again, Campo wasn't planning on Leon Lett being around for
today _ and the suspended one won't be. Replacing Lett in the
defensive line isn't easy, but it's not the first time Campo has
had to move on indefinitely without Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the case of Nine-Toed Deion, who might or might not
appear today, at least on the field. More important, Deion did make
deadline as our new esteemed fellow columnist. He will be in charge
of the toe beat.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, now knows Deion is close _ if not today, then
next week. ``And for a long time, no one was sure how long it would
be,'' said Campo.
</P>
<P>
   While the defense needs Campo magic, the offense is ready. Just
how ready is what this season-opening intrigue is all about.

VIKINGS' RANDY MOSS PLANS TO `WORK HARDER' FOR ENCORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the hands. Randy Moss has hands so big that when he
extends them for a greeting you wonder if he's going to shake your
hand or just palm you altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the legs. Long, even for a guy who is 6-foot-4.
Kindergarteners drawing stick-figures don't scribble legs that
long.
</P>
<P>
   Big hands. Long legs. And what do you get ... man's best friend?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like throwing a Frisbee to a dog,'' Moss said of how he
uses his million-dollar talents. ``You throw a Frisbee to a dog,
and he's going to go get it. Like me. When you throw me the ball,
I'm going to react, and if I have to jump over a guy to get the
ball, I'm going to jump over a guy to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After a rookie-of-the year season in which Moss made NFL
defensive backs dog-tired chasing him while he caught a
rookie-record 17 touchdowns, just one question remains: What can
Moss, the cocky, talented, opinionated Minnesota Vikings wide
receiver, do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I have to work harder to show that last year was no
fluke,'' Moss said as he sat on a bed in a lobby at the Vikings
training camp headquarters last month. ``The things I did were all
really expected from myself. I mean, 17 touchdowns! Heck, I did
that in college. ... Football is easy. The only difference between
the NFL and college is that in the NFL, you have grown men trying
to feed families and your job is to go out and make the other guy
look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons' secondary, which Moss and the Vikings face
today in the season opener, gets the first look at Year 2 of the
Randy Moss story. Moss has supplanted Jake Reed as the starter
opposite Cris Carter and will get more looks on first and second
down. Vikings coaches expect opponents to double-team Moss much
more in 1999 and put more of an emphasis on jamming the lanky
receiver at the line of scrimmage in order to keep him from running
free into the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Moss acknowledged that that kind of coverage frustrated him at
times last season but not enough to keep him from becoming a
first-team All Pro selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have problems with press coverage every now and
then,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't recommend for a coach to put his
cornerback on me one-on-one with no help, either. It's either a
catch, pass interference or a touchdown. Sometimes, it'll be a
drop. But probably about 95 percent of the time, it'll go to my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham's ability to throw
long, Moss did most of his damage running deep routes in 1998. He
averaged an NFC-leading 19 yards per catch and had a team-record 10
touchdown receptions of 40 yards or longer. Yet despite his success
the knock on him became: ``Yeah, but can he catch a pass over the
middle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't ask him to run a lot of underneath things or catch a
lot of balls across the middle last year _ we felt the best thing
for him at that stage was to give him things he could do really
well to build confidence,'' Carter said. ``What he could do was
run, and he could play the ball well with his tremendous height and
speed advantage against most defensive backs. So he wasn't asked to
do more than that, and he didn't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss contends he can run any pass route. He claims, in fact,
that he was run ragged by all the deep balls, and that an ankle
injury he suffered early in the season never completely healed
until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, \Rformer Vikings offensive coordinator Brian\S
Billick had me running too many \Rdeep\S routes,'' Moss said. ``I
ran them in practice, in training camp, and when it came toward the
end of the season, my body was really worn out by all those deep
balls. I was beat. \RNew offensive coordinator\S Ray Sherman came
in and told me, `Man, that's extra running.' So this year there's a
lot less deep balls in practice. Game time, I'll probably run
some.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster of cornerbacks who will try to undo Moss's run into
the record books include Atlanta's Ray Buchanan, Oakland's Charles
Woodson, and if healthy, the Cowboys' Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders on the bench last Thanksgiving Day in the
Vikings-Cowboys' game, Moss caught three passes for 163 yards and
three touchdowns. Unwilling to talk about what he could have done
if Sanders played him and unwilling to relive his emotions about
the Cowboys' _ and 18 other teams' _ decision to pass him up on the
draft, Moss refused to talk to the media after that game. But on a
breezy day in Mankato, Minn., last month, Moss had no problems
opening up about playing against Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't look forward to playing Deion because I
practiced against him in the Pro Bowl,'' Moss said. ``I look
forward to playing anybody on Sunday, and the fact that it's Deion
Sanders makes no difference. I know how good he is, his style, how
quick he is, how fast he is. I know that. But I don't want to look
at him in that way because that'll probably get me carried away
from what I'm trying to do. If I know I've got a guy one-on-one,
that's going to get me excited because I've only got one man to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball is thrown, I plan on catching it _ no matter
who's on me.''

IF OFFENSE ROLLS, JONES SEES SHOT AT SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones' second decade as Cowboys owner begins in earnest
today when the Cowboys play the Redskins in the season opener. He
remains unwavering in his optimism about his franchise. Jones
recently sat down with Star-Telegram reporter Clarence E. Hill Jr.
to discuss his first 10 years with the Cowboys, his outlook for the
coming season and his hopes for the future: S-T: What is the key to
the Cowboys success in 1999? JJ: ``We must move the football. If
that happens, that means we've developed the continuity we wanted
in the offensive line. That means that our tight end situation with
David LaFleur is sound. That means that quarterback Troy Aikman is
healthy and that backup running back Chris Warren is healthy.''
S-T: Are the Cowboys legitimate Super Bowl contenders? JJ: ``I
believe so. If we can sustain all the way through and have a good
December, we can definitely contend for the Super Bowl.'' S-T: You
were more active in the free-agent market this year than ever
before, signing three front-line players in center Mark Stepnoski,
receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker Quentin Coryatt. Have you
changed your past philosophy of placing a higher premium on
re-signing your own free agents rather than outside free agents?
JJ: ``There was no philosophy change. These weren't hard calls. We
needed help at center. We wanted to improve our speed. I've always
addressed needs. ... Another significant free-agent year was when
we got Deion Sanders. Obviously, we wouldn't have done that in 1989
or 1990. But I thought it would help make a difference in a Super
Bowl.'' S-T: Are the Cowboys still the team to beat in the NFC
East? JJ: ``Considering how we played last year and we are
significantly better team this year, I like our chances.'' S-T:
What about the Cardinals, considering they beat you in the
playoffs? JJ: ``There is a perception Arizona is a young team on
the way up, and there is a perception that we are an older team
than we are. But I'm just looking at how we played last year,
looking at where we were in the games we played and looking at the
personnel. I like our quarterback. Arizona has a good quarterback.
But I like our quarterback. I like our running back and our
offensive and defensive lines. Where I feel pretty good about
things on a competitive basis is that I don't see us as a team on
the beginning of a down turn. And if you buy into the fact that we
are improved and we did beat them two out of three times. Where
does that put us?'' S-T: What player will break out the most this
season? JJ:''Greg Ellis is playing right now at the level like the
eighth pick in the draft. And that's from everybody's perspective.
And he was there last year from my perspective. People were too
critical of what he did last year as a rookie. I understand the
criticism by criteria of sacks. But I don't buy into it, especially
when you compare him to the other defensive line prospects that
were drafted.'' S-T: Looking back on the past 10 years, what are
your biggest regrets about your tenure? JJ:'' Not spending more
time on education and counseling and not doing more to have
thwarted the criticism of our teams' off-the-field activities. I
could have done a better job. I should have done a better job. I
was so focused on having the best players and so focused to doing
the things on and off the field to win that I could have done more
when we had issues.'' S-T: How do you improve on what has been a
great decade? JJ: ``I don't know. But I do have the luxury of the
total 10 years. In 1989 I didn't know how it was going to be
because I didn't know what I was in for. I think I know better how
to do it for the next 10 years than I did in 1989. The rules are
different but we are set to compete because I think the staffs
around us got a lot experience of the last 10 years. I certainly
like where we are starting from today better than where we started
from in 1989 and '90. The future is brighter than it was then.
Besides, I'm better fit to be an owner. I'm better fit to be a
general manager and president. I know I'm better to manage on a
day-to-day basis. I was criticized for not hiring an NFL person
when I came in. In essence when I start the next 10, I'm hiring an
NFL person. I feel pretty good about the experience that's here.''

AGASSI TAKES NO. 1, SETS SIGHTS ON OPEN TITLE

<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Andre Agassi left no doubt yesterday
about who's No. 1 in men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In a match to determine the top spot, Agassi recovered from a
nervous, slow start to rout Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3,
in the U.S. Open semifinals. Agassi, ranked No. 2 to start the
tournament, climbed to the top of the rankings, a spot Kafelnikov
would have claimed with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a goal that I have,'' said Agassi, who has the
best chance of his career to finish the season No. 1. ``It's not
just a number. It's a big accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Agassi wants to celebrate by winning the U.S. Open
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi plays Todd Martin today in an all-American final. Martin
made it to the title match with an impressive 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 victory
against Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man has to have his priorities,'' Agassi said. ``Winning the
U.S. Open is most important right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi ascended to the top for the second time this year. He had
gotten there earlier after he won his semifinal match at Wimbledon,
completing a remarkable comeback from a career free-fall that took
him all the way down to No. 141 late in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, he lost the Wimbledon championship to Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he intends to justify the No. 1 ranking with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open is what I want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wimbledon, he enters today's final as a heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little easier going to sleep thinking about Todd Martin
than Pete,'' he admitted. ``But you still have a job to do, and the
job can be brutally difficult if you don't take care of the things
that you need to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not playing Sampras because Sampras isn't in the U.S. Open.
Agassi's rival was ranked No. 1, and would have retained the top
spot with a good showing in the Open. But Sampras had to withdraw
with a back injury that's expected to keep him out for at least a
month, opening the door for Agassi to finish the year on top.
</P>
<P>
   It also opens the door to the debate of, no matter what the
rankings say, who's really the best player. Sampras' victory in the
Wimbledon final was one of three over Agassi this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, though, has no doubts after Agassi dissected him in
the final three sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely this year, belongs to him,'' Kafelnikov said.
``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi certainly has a good case. He's in the final of his third
consecutive Grand Slam, winning the French and losing to Sampras at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be better if he defeats Martin today. Although
Agassi is the favorite, Martin is capable of an upset if he plays
as he did in yesterday's semifinal. Martin, the stealth contender,
advanced to a Grand Slam final for the second time in his career _
the 1994 Australian Open was the other _ with a surprisingly quick,
easy victory against Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played good,'' Pioline said. ``He was hitting very well,
very few unforced errors and serving big. He was playing much
better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, despite being the seventh seed, was a huge long shot to
make it to the final before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something a couple of weeks ago I didn't expect to
happen,'' Martin said. ``I knew I could, given the right
circumstances and playing well. ''
</P>
<P>
   The right circumstances came along when Sampras and defending
champion Patrick Rafter pulled out with injuries. Then Martin took
care of the playing well part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a couple of times against Todd, and I've never
seen him play like this,'' said Pioline, who held a 5-3 edge before
yesterday. ``If he plays this way tomorrow I think he has a good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin remains a long shot against a higher ranked, more
physically talented opponent. Still, he isn't conceding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to play great,'' Martin said. ``You only have
to play better than the other guy, and that's what I'll try to do.

AMWEST-FAA _ The Federal Aviation Administration in Washington
waived a $2.5 million fine against America West Airlines in July
despite objections from the agency's Phoenix inspectors. America
West, slapped with a $5 million fine last year over safety and
maintenance violations, had not fully complied with an agreement to
fix the problems, according to the FAA inspectors in Phoenix who
oversee the airline. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAY-MILITARY _ Whether Steve May, a gay Arizona legislator, should
remain in the military reserves has been debated on national news
and talk shows. On Saturday, May taught military strategies to
reservists as a media pack looked on. Story will move in the ``A''

 &QL; 
WALMART _ Wal-Mart's plans to build at least 16 huge supercenter
stores in Arizona have transformed the state into the latest
battleground in the retailer's effort to barge into the nation's
grocery business. City governments, neighborhood groups and
grocery-union members are throwing blockades in front of Wal-Mart's
plans and killing off some of them. Story will move in the ``A''
and ``F'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) _ ``I know you mean well, but you really have to
let me grow up.''That's a line from a new television series this
fall. So what? you say. What precocious teen hasn't uttered the
same words to her parents? But that's just it _ it's not a teen who
says it. It's a grown woman. A mother herself. A judge, no less.
That pretty much sums up the new fall season. Think young,
attractive actors. Then chop a few years off what you're picturing.
Add a couple of levels of beauty, subtract a measure of maturity
and you've got the idea. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in

   WASHINGTON _ The Soviet KGB fabricated evidence linking the CIA
to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and passed the
material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United States,
according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the West by a
defector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the files turned over by a former KGB archivist to
British intelligence and detailed in a new book, Moscow's Cold War
spy service took several steps designed to link the CIA to the
Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   These steps included forging a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to
a CIA officer, E. Howard Hunt, asking for information ``before any
steps are taken by me or anyone else,'' according to the new book,
``The Sword and the Shield,'' written by Christopher Andrew and the
former KGB officer, Vasily Mitrokhin. The book is to be published
by Basic Books later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Oswald letter was supposed to have been written about two
weeks before Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963,
but was actually created by the KGB in the mid-1970s, after Hunt's
name had surfaced in the Watergate investigation, according to KGB
files copied by Mitrokhin while he served as a KGB archivist.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was then passed anonymously to three conspiracy buffs
and entered circulation in the United States when it was picked up
by one writer of self-published assassination books, the authors
report.
</P>
<P>
   The letter led to a brief flurry of interest when a Dallas
newspaper reported that a handwriting expert declared it to be
genuine, but a congressional panel that re-investigated the Kennedy
assassination in the late 1970s later concluded that the letter was
probably a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB's clumsy propaganda campaign never had much of an impact
on the debate over the Kennedy assassination in the United States.
But the archives spirited out of Russia by Mitrokhin appear to
support the longstanding assertions by CIA officials that the KGB
conducted disinformation campaigns designed to raise dark
suspicions about the U.S. government and prominent American leaders
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The book also suggests that those efforts were amateurish and
often silly. In August 1967, for instance, the KGB authorized a
plan to discredit the Rev. Martin Luther King by planting articles
in the African press portraying him as an ``Uncle Tom'' who was
secretly being paid off by the government so that he would make
sure the civil rights movement would not threaten President Lyndon
B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB was apparently frustrated that a moderate like King had
emerged as the most influential voice in the civil rights movement,
but Moscow's comical propaganda revealed the KGB's lack of
understanding of American politics and society. The KGB's
propaganda campaign had even less impact than the FBI's separate,
but equally fumbling, efforts to smear King.
</P>
<P>
   ``News that the KGB was attempting to plant false stories in the
African press portraying Dr. King as an `Uncle Tom,' at the very
time when Dr. King was harshly attacking Johnson's conduct of the
Vietnam War indicates that American police agencies were not the
only Keystone Kops active in the 1960s,'' said David J. Garrow, a
historian at Emory University and the author of ``The FBI and
Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist in charge of managing many of the
spy service's secret files until he retired in 1984. When he
arrived in Britain in 1992 and sought out British intelligence, he
brought with him a huge cache of notes that he said he had taken
based on those files, and turned them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrokhin files, which the British considered reliable
enough to share with the CIA and FBI, have offered Western
intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of
historical information about KGB operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while the archives quoted in the book contain only limited
information about Soviet espionage cases, the archives have already
helped identify some spies. In the United States, for instance, the
book reveals that the Mitrokhin files helped lead the FBI to Robert
Lipka, a former code-clerk at the National Security Agency, who
worked as a Soviet mole in the 1960s. Lipka was arrested in 1996
and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage. Information
about other open spy cases contained in the archives were withheld
from the book, including on the case of a former State Department
official, Felix S. Bloch, who was suspended in 1989 and resigned in
1990 but was never charged or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin first attempted to defect to the United States, but
was received a lukewarm reception from a CIA officer when he
approached the agency in a Baltic country soon after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the CIA's Soviet/East European Division had
decided that the KGB was no longer a threat and had instituted a
controversial new policy that led CIA officers in the field to turn
away many defectors. Paul Redmond, who was then the CIA's deputy
chief of counterintelligence, said in an interview that he sought
to take over the Mitrokhin case after other officials had failed to
show interest, but by then Mitrokhin had turned to the British.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond now argues that the CIA's diffident handling of
Mitrokhin's efforts underscored a larger problem, which was that
the CIA decided ``naively'' after the collapse of the Soviet Union
to scale back its espionage operations against Moscow. ABC News
reported on this controversy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA apparently did miss a good bet with Mitrokhin, since his
archives seem to reveal a wide array of intriguing insights into
KGB operations against the West. Among other things, according to
the book, the files show that the KGB planted secret caches of
weapons in Europe and probably in North America as well, apparently
for use in the event of war.

</P>
<P>
   They also appear to show that the KGB sought to blackmail German
Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1960s by alleging that he had spied
for Moscow during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While Brandt was living in exile in Sweden during the war, he
had provided information about Germany to the Soviets as well as
the British and Americans, but never committed espionage, the files
show. But in 1962, the KGB attempted to blackmail Brandt by
threatening to use evidence of his dealings with the KGB's
Stockholm residency against him, according to the Mitrokhin
archives. The attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that Mitrokhin's files also pointed to the
existence of a previously unknown British agent who was recruited
on ideological grounds by the Soviets during the 1930s, but who
survived the collapse of the famous Kim Philby spy ring. Melita
Norwood, code-named Hola in the Mitrokhin files, remained in place
after the others in the Cambridge spy ring were identified or
forced to defect to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that, after being recruited to the Soviet cause in
the 1930s, Norwood began to spy for Moscow after she started
working in the British Non-Ferrous Metals Association in 1945,
providing information on Britain's project to build its first
atomic bomb. She spied for the Soviets for decades, and in 1958
Moscow secretly awarded her the Order of the Red Banner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, she also tried to recruit other British
officials to spy for Moscow, and succeeded in convincing at least
one unidentified British civil servant to provide the Soviets with
technical information and intelligence on British arms sales in the
1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She retired without being arrested and, now 87, lives in a
suburb of London, where she spoke to reporters after news of her
past was revealed Saturday in The Times of London. She said she had
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want money,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying.
``It was not that side I was interested in. I wanted Russia to be
on an equal footing with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people, the ones who lived through it, might
understand,'' she added. ``I'm not so sure about the young
generation. I hope they accept it.''

HOW USC RECRUITS ARE PROGRESSING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A look at how some of the players who have orally
committed to USC did on the first weekend of high school football:
</P>
<P>
   _Strong safety Jason Leach of Bishop Amat had two sacks and a
fumble recovery to lead the Lancers past Dominguez 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that although Leach said he has orally
committed to the Trojans, he still intends to visit other colleges,
including Arizona State and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC's my No. 1 right now,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   _Chatsworth quarterback Matt Cassel completed 17 of 23 passes
for 320 yards and four touchdowns in a 61-28 victory over Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   _Taft tight end Gregg Guenther had four catches for 36 yards in
a 49-19 loss to Banning.
</P>
<P>
   _A wide receiver being heavily recruited by USC, Hueneme's Keary
Colbert had a 56-yard touchdown reception in his team's loss to
Alemany.
</P>
<P>
   _Banning tailback Chris Howard, who says he strongly favors the
Trojans, had 22 carries for 241 yards and scored four touchdowns
against Taft.
</P>
<P>
   _Another recruit, tailback Mike Lemon of La Mirada, broke his
leg on the fourth play from scrimmage against West Torrance and
will miss the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wide receiver Craig Mitchell of West Los Angeles
College, who did not qualify academically last month, is being
recruited by Oregon and Hawaii. Mitchell has received his
junior-college degree but did not meet USC's requirements. He will
enroll at a Division I school in the spring.

TRINIDAD IS DUG IN FOR DE LA HOYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAJARDO, Puerto Rico _ Felix Trinidad could not appear more
confident going into his fight with Oscar De La Hoya next weekend
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be confident here, far from the confrontation. The
sun is shining on Trinidad's training camp at the base of a
five-star Wyndham resort hotel an hour from San Juan. The sea slaps
against the rocks with a rhythm not unlike a fighter's hands
spinning a speed bag, and not 10 yards from where a heavy bag hangs
on a metal hook, solitary and silent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out the window of his stucco villa, Trinidad doesn't see
the fierce figure of De La Hoya waiting for him; he sees a private
island with a nude beach just a free boat ride away.
</P>
<P>
   Safe in this harbor of family and supporters, the International
Boxing Federation welterweight champion smiles freely when talking
of De La Hoya. Can a man living in such a place know anything about
pain and loss?
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad promises the fight will not go six rounds, something he
has said before, quickly assuring anyone listening that he is ready
to go all 12 rounds if he must. Either way, though, the fight can
end only one way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring the victory home to Puerto Rico,'' Trinidad says
without a second thought. ``Let Oscar come out however he wants.
Aggressor, not aggressor. What does it matter? He is the least of
my worries.''
</P>
<P>
   They are brave words considering that De La Hoya is as
undefeated as he is and has faced stiffer competition on the road
to this inevitable confrontation. It is a fight many are comparing
to the first Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns meeting, a welterweight
clash that made more than noise. It made history, and promoters Don
King and Bob Arum are confident these two young Hispanic boxers
will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Each man's promoter promises more than a million pay-per-view
sales, which would be a first for any weight class other than
heavyweight. Each promoter and each fighter also promises victory.
That is the nature of their business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a difference in their statements. While De La Hoya
exhibits his usual self-control during a phone conversation from
California, saying he is ready for anything and believing in the
end he will survive it all, Trinidad and his father are not as
diplomatic. If they are to be believed, this is not going to be a
fight at all. It will be a drum solo, a beating pounded out to a
Latin tempo by the grand champion of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as Oscar is, we will show he is not the best boxer in
the world,'' Don Felix, Trinidad's father/trainer, says as he sits
on his safe island, more than 3,000 miles from where De La Hoya
lies waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be a great fight like Leonard-Hearns. No! It
will be a one-sided fight. It will be like a lion against a monkey
when the monkey's hands are tied. Who's going to win that? The lion
or the monkey? Keep that saying in mind and after the fight let me
know if it is the truth or a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, sitting by the sea, it is all a joke, but on Saturday,
the monkey's hands will not be tied and the Trinidads and the rest
of the world will find out whether there is one lion in that ring
or two.
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   When the Nov. 13 Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch was
officially announced in Las Vegas, Lewis refused to have his
picture taken with King, whom he blames for manipulating the judges
in the first fight so that it ended in a controversial draw.
``You're biased against me,'' Lewis said to King. ``I don't want to
stand there so he can put his arm around me and pretend he's with
me.'' Several days later, King said, ``Imagine that! I done paid
him nearly $40 million and he don't want to have his picture taken
with me. The rematch will do more pay-per-view than any fight has
done because of the alleged scandal. That took this fight to areas
it would never be seen or heard. Now in places where they have no
interest in boxing the people want to know (who is the best
heavyweight). Places where they go to sheep-shearing contests or
corn-raising contests want the fight. We got a shot at 2 million
buys because nobody believed Lennox Lewis was no kind of fighter
until that fight. The fact is this: By him getting that draw, it
put him on the big screen in England. In America they had headlines
and bylines and sitting grand juries speaking his name.'' . . .
Only months after the FBI raided King's offices in Florida with 74
agents, a helicopter, and a crew of computer experts who left with
every machine and file in his office, he stands to make millions
with Lewis-Holyfield and Trinidad-De La Hoya. For the short term,
at least, King seems to have gotten the last laugh. ``I'm so
happy,'' King said. ``I got no accounts receivable. I got no
accounts payable. They got all my records and files. But I got the
gators (Trinidad and Holyfield) to the pond. Now they just gotta
swim through the sharks. Wouldn't it be something if Don King had
Felix Trinidad knock out Oscar De La Hoya and Holyfield knock out
Lennox Lewis with nobody having no futures on either guy?'' King
also has yet to be indicted by a sitting federal grand jury in New
Jersey, which reportedly is looking into boxing's murky business
practices. A host of minority groups have begun to inundate
Attorney General Janet Reno's office with howls of protest,
demanding to know why only King's operation has been so
consistently investigated. ``It's not a prosecution, it's a
persecution,'' said King. ``Why is it only me they're investigating
in boxing? They launch an all-out investigation of boxing and all
they can find is the black guy? The Boston Strangler didn't get
this much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, World Boxing Association super
welterweight champion David Reid made his second successful title
defense in six weeks when he won a one-sided decision from former
champion Keith Mullings, yet the victory left many unsatisfied
because Reid (14-0) was taken the distance for the fourth straight
time. A small crowd at the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas booed Reid
for boxing an intelligent but uninspired fight and occasionally
taunting Mullings more than hitting him. Despite that, the 1996
Olympic gold medalist did what he knew needed to be done. He kept
alive big-money matches in 2000 with IBF champion Fernando Vargas,
his Olympic teammate, and possibly 1992 gold medalist De La Hoya.
``We love the matchup of the two gold medalists,'' said Dan
Goossen, Reid's promoter. ``The two gold medalists would generate
tremendous interest. But if Vargas is out there and it makes sense,
that's where we will go. But the two gold medalists is the fight
everyone really wants to see.'' . . . Undefeated World Boxing
Organization light heavyweight champion Darius Michalczewski kept
the pressure on Roy Jones Jr. when he stopped Montell Griffin cold
in four rounds for the 16th successful defense of his 175-pound
title. Minutes after it was over, Michalczewski (41-0, 34 KO's)
once again called Jones out. ``I want to fight Jones because he's
one of the best _ after me.'' No reply from Jones, who couldn't
care less about a Polish fighter who never boxes outside of
Germany, where his promoter lives.

THE `OTHER' MARTINEZ IS STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although Pedro Martinez is sailing toward another
Cy Young Award, brother Ramon is having trouble returning to form.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with the Red Sox last spring, the former Dodgers
right-hander finally returned to the mound in late August after
missing more than a season with a torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox acquired closer Rod Beck from the Chicago Cubs,
Manager Jimy Williams put Tim Wakefield back in the rotation and
put Martinez in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Williams will try Martinez out of the bullpen,
but Ramon's shaky mechanics make that a scary proposition. The Red
Sox originally planned to get him back in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But they are in a pennant race now, and it's not the time to let
a struggling pitcher try to get back his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez signed with the Red Sox because he didn't think the
Dodgers were offering enough guaranteed money. He was more than
their ace for 10 years. He was the conscience of the club's Latin
community.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Red Sox are on the hook for $5.25 million next year.
Martinez had a base salary of $750,000 this year with a $1 million
signing bonus. &QL; 
More pain
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields was injured and ineffective throughout most of
his time with the Dodgers, making the trade for Pedro Martinez all
the more painful. He revived his career in Cincinnati and St. Louis
to earn a three-year, $12 million contract with Baltimore. The
result? He broke his thumb during the first intrasquad game in
spring training, missed April with a bad back and went on the DL in
June with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he has been out with a bruised groin. Fortunately for
Baltimore, second base is one position where the club has a future.
Jerry Hairston has stepped up in DeShields' absence and taken over
the position. &QL; 
Showdown
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers went 7-3 against the Cleveland Indians this
year, winning the season series for the fourth consecutive season.
Although the Rangers acquired left-hander Jeff Fassero to balance
their rotation for the playoffs, the pitcher Cleveland really
doesn't want to see is struggling right-hander John Burkett.
Against the rest of the league Burkett has an ERA of over 6. But
against the Indians, he is 2-0 with an 0.61 ERA. ``His ball moves
so much you think he's cheating,'' said Cleveland's Richie Sexson.
``But he doesn't. He just can't throw a ball straight.'' &QL; 
Cal countdown
</P>
<P>
   Oft-injured Cal Ripken has returned to the lineup, and he has
been moved up in the order to get more at-bats. But it is unlikely
that he'll reach 3,000 hits this season. Ripken, who figured to
reach 3,000 in late August, has been sidelined much of the second
half with a bad back. He needs 27 hits in the last 23 games, an
average of 1.3 per game. Even when he was at his best this season,
he did not average that many. &QL; 
Poor Frank
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing saga of Frank Thomas, the two-time White Sox MVP who
has slumped badly the past two seasons, might be over for the
season. Thomas, who has ditched first base for a designated-hitter
job, is done for the year with a bone spur in his right ankle. If
Thomas is done, he'll end the year hitting .305 with 15 homers and
77 RBI. It will mark the first time in nine full seasons that
Thomas has failed to drive in 100 runs in the big leagues. He had a
streak of five consecutive, 30-home run seasons end last year when
he hit 24. &QL;

SINDEN MANEUVER A BONUS OF CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a hot topic in the fall of 1997 when Bruins
president/general manager Harry Sinden signed rookies Joe Thornton
and Sergei Samsonov to three-year contracts. The deals had
complicated bonus structures that shaped all subsequent bonus
structures for entry-level players. They covered everything _ ice
time, goals, assists, points, plus-minus, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Neil Smith was critical because the
deals posed a giant hurdle for him when attempting to negotiate
with first-round pick Manny Malhotra, No. 7 overall in 1998.
Chances are, they have meant headaches for other teams as well in
negotiating the twists and turns of bonuses to get players signed.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said it was probably the first time in his long career
that he felt he had to veer from the straight and narrow to ensure
the competitive future of the Bruins. He knows there are those who
disagree with his philosophy, and that's fine, but Sinden also has
been an outspoken and sometimes lone voice with regard to keeping
salaries in check. In this case, he had to make an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care about them with Joe and Sergei,'' said Sinden,
referring to his GM brethren. ``I didn't care about anyone, for a
change. I had no interest in any other team in the league when I
signed Joe Thornton. He was not going to be the sacrificial lamb in
that situation, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden admits the potential for hefty payouts wasn't his first
choice, but it was his only choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of setting a bonus structure for a first pick, it was
lousy but I didn't care how bad it was,'' said Sinden. ``I didn't.
But I get the impression that's the way a lot of people operate
with every single player. They don't care at all. I admit with Joe
and Sergei, I had no interest in any other team. I didn't care what
effect it had on them. What they wanted us to do is not sign him, I
guess. Anything I could've done, I would've done. Anything within
reach, especially for Joe. He was the No. 1 pick. We just finished
the worst season in 30 years, so I didn't care about it at all. If
I was going to hurt everybody, I couldn't have cared less.
(Commissioner Gary) Bettman probably didn't like it; nobody liked
it, but I didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   With Samsonov and Thornton due for new contracts at the end of
this year, it will be interesting to see how that bonus structure
affects future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith responds
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Smith, the Rangers' boss politely took issue with
this writer's assertion last week that his club routinely chucks
aside the rules of the collective bargaining agreement while
spending a fortune on some stars and some less-than-marquee
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done that has gotten people upset, which is not a
CBA issue, is we've spent a lot of money,'' said Smith, referring
to shopping for unrestricted free agents. ``That is a
how-you-want-to-use-revenue-and-how-much-of-it-you-choose-to-spend
issue and how much of it you want to make or lose depending upon
your business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   One area in which Smith agreed with this space was how
ridiculous it is that the Players' Association refuses to use the
system despite the fact the players agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the clubs that are saying, `We refuse to use the
system,' it's the players,'' said Smith. ``The player membership by
and large does not understand the intricacies of the CBA; never
mind the intricacies, they don't even understand the basics, but
the agents do. You sit down with a player and tell them about the
CBA and they look at you with puzzlement. When the club has rights,
the cry is, `The club should be fair.' What happened to dealing in
good faith? When the player has the rights, there's no mention of
that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person decides they no longer want to be a journalist,
they don't have to be a journalist, and if a person decides they no
longer want to be an executive, they don't have to be an executive.
If a person wants to be a hockey player, live under the rules you
agreed to, or else quit being a hockey player, go be a piano player
or an accountant or go do something under another system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nilan Rule
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bonuses, when trying to figure out a fair package
for goalie Byron Dafoe, Sinden said one bonus he'll never pay any
player is for participation in the All-Star Game. ``We don't give
any bonuses for that,'' Sinden said, ``ever since Mike Milbury
picked Chris Nilan. We wouldn't give five cents for being selected
to the All-Star Game. The fans vote for it, the coaches fool around
with it, and all of a sudden he picks some guy on your team and he
gets a $50,000 bonus but he's really (only deserving of a 10
percent raise in his contract).'' . . . Bruins coach Pat Burns said
that although the offseason was shorter this past summer, he's
happy this year is going to begin earlier than last because it
means the end will be earlier, too. ``I think it got carried away
when people are watching hockey in late June, and Gary Bettman is
probably making a good move here in trying to get things up a
little bit quicker and maybe get it over,'' said Burns. ``Interest
gets lost if you're not in the city that's still in it by the start
of July and the interest gets lost along the way. I think this is
probably a good move.'' There seems to be wide acceptance of the
new rule about referees calling goals rather than relying on
replay. ``Leaving the discretion to the referee on the call instead
of going to the video puts a little more onus on the referee to
make a decision,'' said Burns. ``When we didn't have that, there
was no onus on the referee so it was a passing-the-buck affair.
Now, the referee has to make his decision and live with his
decision and come over and explain to me his decision. I think
that's probably going to be a little bit better there.'' . . .
Pittsburgh coach Kevin Constantine's contract is up for renewal at
the end of the year and GM Craig Patrick isn't planning an
extension any time soon, although he said Constantine is doing a
good job. Patrick said the ownership transition to Mario Lemieux
and attempts to sign Darius Kasparaitis outweigh the urgency of the
coaching situation . . . Despite the acquisition of 36-year-old
goalie Grant Fuhr for a third-round pick, things are tough in
Calgary. The team used to have a season-ticket base of 16,000, with
7,000 more waiting in the wings. Now that base is only 9,000. Part
of the problem is that the club has missed the postseason the last
three years and hasn't won a playoff series since capturing the
Stanley Cup in 1989. GM Al Coates was honest to say part of the
attrition is also due to the renovation the Saddledome underwent in
1995. ``We had to relocate roughly 6,000 season ticket-holders from
the lower bowl to the second tier. Well, a lot of groups who had
been coming together, having dinner together for years, they were
split up and put all over the building. I think it's fair to say,
in my own opinion, that we lost 4,000 season ticket-holders
directly as a result of the renovation. We haven't been able to get
those people back.'' . . . Former Bruin Greg Hawgood is attending
the Vancouver Canucks' training camp on a tryout. Hawgood, who was
the IHL's best defenseman last season with 74 points in 76 games
for the champion Houston Aeros, could help the Canucks on the power
play. ``That game is changing, and skill is more important than
brawn was,'' said coach Marc Crawford, referring to Hawgood's
less-than-imposing 5-foot-10-inch, 190-pound frame. ``He's here
because we all feel he has the opportunity to play here. He was one
of the top defensemen not playing in the NHL last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr takes short cut
</P>
<P>
   His on-ice brilliance certainly won't change, but Penguins star
and NHL MVP Jaromir Jagr is sporting a new look. He chopped off his
long hair during a vacation in Italy. He joked that he told the
hairdresser to make him look like an Italian, though he confessed
he wasn't sure exactly what that meant. ``I just decided I was
going to cut my hair,'' Jagr said. ``It's just a new look. I think
I'm old enough to have short hair now, no more of that girl
stuff.'' What's funny is that Jagr didn't do it in one haircut. It
took several trips, with the stylist clipping it a little shorter
each time. Jagr said he's going to keep his new 'do. ``It's gone
for good,'' he said. ``New image.'' . . . Meanwhile, down South,
don't be looking for new Florida goalie Trevor Kidd to trim his
trademark locks anytime soon. He did dye his hair blond, however.
``With my long hair and a goatee, everybody thinks I'm a little
crazy,'' said Kidd, who is also a heavy metal fan. ``Coming from
Calgary to Carolina just allowed me to be myself. It didn't matter
what color my hair was or my pads were.'' . . . Sad to see it, but
it was inevitable: Maple Leaf Gardens is for sale. ``We're going to
explore, develop, or sell,'' said Richard Peddie, president and CEO
of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. ``All we know is that it
can't exist in its present form.'' Little has taken place inside
the building since the Maple Leafs moved to the Air Canada Centre.
About 40 events have been held, not nearly enough to support the
building. Word is that it could be a shopping mall, a condo
complex, or a theater . . . A Ranger payroll of some $54 million
apparently doesn't include a second-line center. The candidates
seem to be former Bruin Tim Taylor, the 19-year-old Malhotra,
18-year-old Jamie Lundmark, rookie Michael York, or wings Adam
Graves and Todd Harvey. ``We're all thinking about the second
slot,'' said coach John Muckler. ``As of yet, I don't think we've
found a second center-ice man in this training camp. Whether we
will or not, I don't know. He's obviously not going to be a
playmaker if he is. He's going to be a good, solid, checking
center.'' . . . Senators star Alexei Yashin, who is refusing to
honor the final year of his $3.6 million contract, is headed for
Switzerland and plans to skate with a European club. The Senators
suspended him and threatened to sue. The player and his agent, Mark
Gandler, made a laughable proposal to the Senators that would have
kept the salary at $3.6 million this year, with a total of $23
million to follow in the next two years. Yeah, right. That proposal
is actually supposed to fool someone? . . . 20 days to opening
night.

   NEW YORK _ Maybe they'll slump, and Oakland will make a charge,
and we can resurrect those annual Red Sox stories about choking,
folding, and Calvinist clouds of doubt covering New England.
</P>
<P>
   But not now. There were several dicey moments in Saturday's
11-10 win, but your Red Sox are surging through their ``crucial''
road trip like Rod Rutledge barreling north on I-95.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when George Costanza of ``Seinfeld'' had success doing
the opposite of everything he usually does? That is the Red Sox in
September 1999. They are winning after Labor Day, and now it's the
haughty Yankees who are hearing footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days indeed. New York's lead of 8 1/2 games (Aug. 30) is
down to 4 1/2. And only Roger Clemens stands in the way of a Boston
sweep in New York. How's that for role reversal? What must Don
Zimmer be thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams downplayed the surge, saying, ``We
know where we are and they know where they are. We just have to
take care of our own the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the hall, Yankee manager Joe Torre was being asked
about ``holding off Boston'' and ``letting somebody back in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about letting somebody back in the race,'' said
Torre. ``We're 30 games over .500. You have to give Boston credit
for the way they've played. They won't go away, and I give them
credit for their resilience. We've played some tough series with
them (the Sox are 7-4 vs. New York). They keep coming at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Jimy went national with their message  &UR; yesterday &LR; ,
hitting five homers and beating the world champs in a Fox-televised
game that no doubt caught the attention of the Cleveland Indians
and Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Life is beautiful in Red Sox Nation. The once-reclusive,
ever-pilloried Dan Duquette is doing live standups with TV types,
Williams is keeping a lucky Baby Ruth candy bar on his desk, and
MVP candidate Pedro Martinez has served notice that the Sox will be
a serious opponent in any potential/proverbial short series.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro downplayed the great Yankee chase. ``We're just worrying
about keeping ahead of Oakland,'' said the Cy Young designee. ``A
short series is all we want.''
</P>
<P>
   How well are the Sox going? They couldn't even lose on a day
when they made four errors and handled the baseball like it was a
live grenade. They couldn't even lose with the combustible Mark
Portugal pitching in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal went into the game with a career record of 0-6 and ERA
of 6.96 against the Pinstripers. Moreover, he was 0-4 with a 6.15
ERA in his last six Sox starts. He hasn't won since Aug. 4 and he
didn't get the win  &UR; yesterday &LR; , but he got five runs of support
before giving up four in his fourth and final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is 6-2 since leaving Fenway, and the wild card lead over
Oakland has grown. By the time the Tuna is finished with the
Patriots in Jersey  &UR; today &LR; , the Red Sox could be 3 1/2 behind these
Yankees with 19 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The surge has not gone unnoticed in New York, where another
55,422 (many of them New Englanders) filled the Stadium
 &UR; yesterday &LR; . Torre admitted that he thought the Sox were finished a
month and a half ago, but he and his players are impressed with a
Boston team that has cut New York's lead almost in half since Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still pretty confident we'll win the thing,'' said Jim
Leyritz, an ex-Sox. ``But the Red Sox are a good-hitting ball
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Costanza, these Sox are the opposite of every Boston
baseball team you have ever known. They did not hit a home run in
their last Fenway homestand yet won six of the seven games. They
play defense ( &UR; yesterday &LR;  being an exception), move runners over,
and occasionally go from first to third on soft singles. Duquette
has assembled a National League pitching staff. To paraphrase Pete
Carroll, the Sox are a little dangerous right now. Sometimes they
aren't pretty, but they're effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a road trip that could have been hazardous, but we've
played well so far,'' said Mike Stanley, an ex-Yankee. ``But those
guys over there know what it takes to win and they're going to come
out  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  like gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   Weird. Suddenly, there's a mini-pennant race and we never saw it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been feeling like a pennant race to me for a while,''
said Sox outfielder Darren Lewis. ``I'm not sure what the Yankees
are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   They are thinking about Boston. In September. The Sox are
charging and the Yanks are vulnerable and it's a bizarro baseball
world in the Bronx  &UR; today &LR; . For Sox fans, it's the opposite of
everything they've been trained to expect.''

PARCELLS AS DRIVEN AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The bedroom closet in his dream house at Sea
Girt, N.J., contains more than one ensemble. It's just that he
chose to wear the bulky green Jets sweatshirt, green shorts, white
ankle socks, and white sneakers to work last week. Three days in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a fashion statement of allegiance or a hygienic
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said Bill Parcells in mock indignation, ``I showered.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man reeks of compulsiveness. Right down to the clothes
that might have been sticking to his back by the time he changed
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear them home,'' he explained, ``because then I don't have
to worry about what I'm going to wear to work the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Because work is all the Jets coach/football ruler wants to think
about. Ever. Especially this past week while he approached his 15th
_ and perhaps last _ season opener as an NFL head coach, Sunday at
Giants Stadium against his old chums, the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I wear the same thing all the time,'' he said.
``But the week of the opener is always hectic with all the
preparation involved. And I've had this Chrebet thing to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the loss of trusty wide receiver Wayne Chrebet,
sidelined at least six weeks with a broken foot suffered in last
week's exhibition finale. That gives Parcells one more thing to
obsess about, one more reason that he can't dwell on such
incidentals as outfits.
</P>
<P>
   As his fabled career that has produced two Super Bowl champions
with the Giants and another Super Bowl visit with the Patriots
heads toward a horizon, the 58-year-old Parcells is still consumed
by the process. Football is never on his mind more than 24 hours a
day. ``I have no idea what's going on in the outside world,'' he
said. And anything that diverts him from thinking about his team
and what he needs to do to make it better is his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he'll often leave his car parked outside the Jets'
Hofstra University practice complex, ``so I don't have to wait for
the guy to bring it out'' for the 1 1/2-hour commute home after 13
hours at the office. If he's particularly preoccupied, he'll take a
helicopter at his disposal that lands on the Jets' practice field
and transports him to a helipad near his home.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these shortcuts around real life's nagging
essentials is perfectly logical to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance,'' he said. ``In this business, if you
go to the bathroom, you're 20 minutes behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by competition
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells always has tried to stay ahead of the game. That is
his sole purpose in life, and it has been ever since he started out
coaching the defensive line at a football nowhere, Hastings College
in Nebraska, 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember my first game, against Colorado School of
Mines,'' he said. ``We won, 24-0. I thought it was the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been that way ever since. Every game is as significant as
the one before it, the one after it. Even now that he is on the
threshold of NFL history, in line to become the first man to lead
three franchises to the Super Bowl, his resurrected Jets having
missed by one game last year and favored in many circles to take
the final step this time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to him, the outsiders just don't get it. They think it's the
quest for the rings and dictatorial control that keep him going,
that brought him back from a two-year hiatus forced on him by poor
health resulting in coronary bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for a heart attack even though I fooled the
doctors for six months because I was still exercising,'' he said.
``I was smoking. I was fat. Leaving coaching wasn't of my own
volition. I felt I had more to do when I came back.
Retrospectively, it gave me a better perspective. I was a windmill
fighter. For a long time, I chased windmills. I still look at
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   But his priorities are not the ones that others impose on him,
the external demands that cause him to shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the New York papers saying that if we don't win the
Super Bowl, the Jets are a failure, Parcells is a failure,'' he
said. ``I mean, come on, give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones who get it, who know what makes this supposed
autocratic mythic figure go without a change of clothes for days at
a time, realize what catalyzes the mechanism. The job titles and
demands for authority _ which triggered his toxic departure from
the Patriots and owner Bob Kraft three seasons ago _ are only a
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I've been portrayed as a guy who's
power-hungry, ego-driven,'' said Parcells. ``If that's what it
takes to win . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Then consider him guilty. He's told his current team, ``I'm too
old to lose,'' but he has fit that description from the day he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the competition,'' he said. ``That's what it's all
about. It's the same thing as when I was down at the gym as a kid
and I'd get my guys and you'd get your guys and we'd find out who's
the best. It doesn't matter who's watching, who's covering, what
the teams are.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter if it's the second Sunday of September or
the last Sunday in January. Parcells wants his guys to beat your
guys. More important, he wants to do everything in his power, use
every shred of his energy, to make sure that his guys are at least
at their best, if not the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want my legacy to be,'' he said, ``is that, `He tried
to get his teams ready to win. Maybe he was tough. Maybe we didn't
like it. But he did what he could to give us the best chance to
win.' My goal is to get my team to play to its potential as I see
it. Maybe that's not good enough to win, but I have to know that at
least I had them ready.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he was taken aback for probably one of the few times
in his career last week. The Jets were preparing for their
exhibition windup against the Vikings, and defensive back Jimmy
Hitchcock _ a Parcells whipping post in New England, now a star in
Minnesota _ approached him on the Giants Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I didn't like it, but you made me mentally tough and
I want to thank you,' '' recalled Parcells. ``Here's a young man I
hadn't seen since I left New England and he came and sought me out.
It was nice. I was touched.''
</P>
<P>
   So overcome by sentiment was Parcells that his team merely
thrashed the Vikings, 38-17, completing a 3-1 exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   No hidden agendas
</P>
<P>
   These Jets are his latest work in progress, his latest
reclamation project. Just as he did with the Giants and Patriots,
he took over a team that was the dregs of the NFL _ 1-15 in the
calamitous final days of the Rich Kotite regime _ and turned it
around. The Jets jumped to 9-7 the season after Parcells bolted New
England. Last year they overcame an 0-2 start, captured the
division title in the vaunted AFC East, and led the eventual Super
Bowl champion Denver Broncos in the second half of the AFC
Championship game before succumbing.
</P>
<P>
   A nice run, Parcells figured. And thoroughly irrelevant now.
That's why the Jets were greeted on the first day of training camp
with a uniform addendum that established the theme of 1999:
T-shirts with ``START OVER'' emblazoned on the back. It's why just
outside the trainer's room is a green frame with ``NEW YORK JETS''
on the top, ``SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS 19??'' on the bottom, and
scrawled across the blank space reserved for a group photo the
challenge: ``Are you in this picture? When will it be taken? It's a
team picture only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is you have to try at least the best you can to
create a mind-set with the players that you aren't going to be
successful if you don't do the things you're supposed to do,''
Parcells said. ``You can't hopscotch fundamentals. They don't stay
in place. It's not like we pick right up 20 minutes from the Super
Bowl. Any team I've had to tell to play hard hasn't been worth a
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   The players get the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how Bill is,'' said wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
``It's `yeah, yeah, yeah, you did it last year but don't think it's
going to be a cakewalk this year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And they buy it. They really don't have a choice. Parcells's pro
pedigree is his calling card, his acidic wit both goads and
disarms, his divine right authority to hire and fire is his
ultimate weapon, and his devotion to detail is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the players tend to focus on is week to week,
practice to practice,'' said offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, a
veteran of both Parcells New York regimes. ``It's sort of like his
personality filters down to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ulterior nuances to that personality, no hidden
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is Bill,'' said running back Curtis Martin, who followed
Parcells's trail from New England to New York last year. ``He's
going to say exactly what's on his mind. He's going to be up front
with you. He's very fair, but at the same time, he's very
demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And consistent. Parcells will adjust to his personnel
strategically, but he won't budge psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's exactly the same as he was in New England,'' said former
Patriot and current Jet center Mike Gisler. ``I guarantee you the
players in New England could tell you exactly what he's going to do
and say if they were here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many more days does he have left in this job? Parcells
says he feels no particular sense of urgency this year, and he
certainly isn't conveying it to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I know, his career is winding down,'' said Johnson,
eyebrows raised in skepticism. ``His career is not winding down.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Parcells acknowledges ``this is a young man's game,''
and he knows his future no longer is measured in indefinite terms.
Yet if this is indeed his last hurrah, he's not betraying any misty
nostalgia. That would detract from the job, the process, and then
there'd be no reason to be doing this, championships be damned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the practice, the preparation,'' said Parcells. ``I
like it when my (salary) cap man, Mike Tannenbaum, comes into my
office at 6 o'clock and I can say, `Where has the day gone?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The AFC East challenge
</P>
<P>
   After 32 years of coaching, 14 years of coaching at the top, he
still finds something new to keep him occupied as those days
disappear, to keep him fresh, to consume his mind and his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any comfort level; I never do,'' said Parcells.
``It's tough to explain even what I was thinking this morning. I
was going over the list of draft choices who've been cut and the
unsigned free agents. Now I know that. It's a very narrow thought
process. I'm thinking about one thing _ getting my team prepared
for this week, this practice. It's so narrow it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is irresistible to him. Football just happens to be the
forum. If he were trying to meet a sales quota or teach kids
algebra or deliver newspapers, it would be no different. There
would still be the competition, the process, to drive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I have the right personality or the wrong personality,
I can't say,'' he said. ``It's the way I am. It's been formed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's a finished product, but each of his teams is a
blank canvas, a new challenge. This one is highly regarded by the
prognosticators, but Parcells scorns them because they never
consider the pitfalls. He knows the Jets could be good. He also
knows they face 10 teams that made the playoffs last season,
starting with the Patriots; that their ownership situation is
unsettled since the death in May of Leon Hess, who gave Parcells
unbridled control of the football operation; that they're working
in five new starters on offense and four on defense; that they're
in a division where the shared wealth is such that the teams may
knock the stuffing out of each other, rendering the survivor
mincemeat by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never have a real good gauge of what your team is going to
do at this point,'' he said. ``I really don't have any idea whether
my team is going to be any good or competitive or what they're
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an exercise in anxiety, he'll tell you, and he isn't
expressing false modesty. He has acquired a reputation for bullying
and blustering, and he certainly is capable of such behavior. But a
Parcells press conference features as much soul-searching as
sparring. It's as if he's honestly trying to sort things out,
convince himself that he's on the right track after all these
years, even as he provides definitive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in my ability that I can prepare my team,''
he said. ``I have confidence that I have enough experience that I'm
not going to screw it up too badly. But I still could screw it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, he likes to surround himself with a certain
type of player, and one of the qualities he's looking for often is
experience. Fifteen of his current Jets are at least 30, and three
more will reach that age during the season. Loyalty is another big
item. Those versed in the Parcells Way, those he trusts, tend to
follow him from stop to stop, as evidenced by the presence of
Elliott and five former Patriots on today's Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you've got to do when you come to a team _ and
I don't think the media understands because you get criticized for
doing it _ is you've got to get guys to hold the fort,'' said
Parcells, launching into a soliloquy without prompting. ``If you
don't get some guys to hold the fort, then they storm the gates and
you don't have a fort. Once you do that, you can start building,
but if you don't get it stabilized . . . and that's why it never
stops. And that's the same thing that's happened here. It hasn't
blown down yet. We're going to be under attack here soon, so we'll
find out. We've been under attack the last month. So far, we've
held 'em off. But you never know when they've got too much for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's survival of the fittest, my guys against your guys. Just
like down at the gym. Just the thing that keeps Bill Parcells
ticking.

RYDER WILL BE A CROWDED CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With no tickets to the 33d Ryder Cup matches available except
through exorbitant package deals, the best advice to golf fans is
to save your money, avoid the traffic headaches and the difficulty
of trying to watch golf in surroundings not designed for
spectators, and watch the action from Brookline on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Ryder Cup setting will be chaotic,'' said
Dick Haskell, who recently resigned after more than a
quarter-century as executive director of the Massachusetts Golf
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, who has seen competitions ranging from the 1968 US
Juniors to the 1988 US Open at The Country Club, where he is a
member, is concerned that the event ``is taking on a party
appearance already.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hordes of people, the pavilions, and the hospitality tents
are the ingredients for the `World's Largest Lawn Party,' '' said
Haskell. ``The only people at the Ryder Cup that will be able to
move will be the players on the course. It will be next to
impossible to walk the course with a particular match. You would
have to be 6-2, 225 and very, very aggressive. Pushy. The problem
is simple. The Ryder Cup has been oversold. I think that the PGA of
America has sold 10,000 more tickets than they should have.''
</P>
<P>
   While the matches are being contested Sept. 24-26, the
surrounding streets will be closed to vehicular traffic, off limit
even to taxis. The MBTA has canceled weekend days off in order to
provide maximum service.
</P>
<P>
   There will be seven Jumbotrons scattered about the course and
15,000 bleacher seats. Some of the fairways are bordered by rocky
terrain on which only mountain goats could tread. This isn't the
Tournament Players Club at River Highlands in Cromwell, Conn., a
stadium course built for spectators. This is The Country Club,
which was built for golf.
</P>
<P>
   The area for corporate tents at the 1988 US Open was 40,000
square feet. It is 250,000 square feet for this Ryder Cup, and
$15.2 million worth of on-site corporate tents were sold nearly
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add up the volunteers, the officials, the press, the
PGA professionals, and the service people, you could have close to
40,000 people on the property,'' said Haskell. ``That could be
spectacular gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of 0 to 10, The Country Club would rank about a 2 as
a spectator course. It is an old-fashioned layout. It does not have
spectator flow. There is limited fairway viewing access on a number
of holes, and should there be heavy rains in this season of
tropical storms, parking would be nightmarish. Mandatory reading is
the spectator guide currently available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The green locations do not offer good viewing,'' said Haskell.
``Big crowds will further impede getting close enough to see. They
are small greens to start with. Hole No. 5 and No. 10 have some
viewing elevation. The grandstands present an opportunity to see
each match with a degree of comfort on that hole. You can probably
see more watching one of the Jumbotrons located around the course.
If you have any aversion to a throng, stay away from The Country
Club during the Ryder Cup matches.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the US Golf Association opened the floodgates on Monday
of US Open week when it sold an extra 5,000 practice-round tickets
for that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost sunk the club on the first day,'' said Haskell.
There was a move afoot to keep media outside the ropes for Monday's
playoff, but a compromise was worked out. There were 400
credentialed media in 1988, more than 1,300 for the Ryder Cup
matches, where armbands will be extremely limited. It's going to be
survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA has already sold out Pebble Beach at 32,500 for next
year's US Open, and there was a reported head count of 50,000 on
hand for a given day at this year's tournament at Pinehurst No. 2.
But there was plenty of land at Pinehurst; there is limited acreage
at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll be so hard to get there, people will get
discouraged,'' said Haskell. ``I think most of the golfers I know
are going to take a look at this place and end up watching it on
TV. We had a guy on our committee who went to Oak Hill (for the
1995 matches) and watched it all in the men's grille.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Golf writer and broadcaster Ben Wright, whose public and
professional world came crumbling apart after his remarks about
lesbianism on the LPGA Tour in 1995, tells his full story in a new
book, ``Good Bounces &AMP; Bad Lies,'' which is published by the
Sleeping Bear Press and reportedly is selling briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's life certainly has not been uneventful since his
dismissal by CBS early in 1996. He checked into the Betty Ford
Clinic in an attempt to control his drinking problem; he had a
court appearance Friday near his home in North Carolina to face
contempt of court charges for nonpayment; and he is currently
guiding a golf group to Ireland. He has designed a course, Cliffs
Valley GC in Traveler's Rest, S.C., and the beat goes on. Wright
started up a business, The Wright Group, and started receiving
orders for plumbing supplies. Through it all, Wright says, ``I'm
getting on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has also launched Wrightway Productions, and he says he
has Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus on board for his broadcasting
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been struggling along trying to make a breakthrough,''
he said. ``We're going to do a lengthy documentary, and that's a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of a breakthrough he has made in ``Good Bounces &AMP;
Bad Lies'' remains to be seen, but there are extensive Ryder Cup
stories and a chapter titled, ``If you ever go across the sea to
Ireland,'' in which he takes the reader through his adopted home
golfing turf. It's an easy, pleasant read and maybe, just maybe, a
moment of triumph is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Maine event

   The 26th New England Open, a fixture for the past 19 years at
The Quechee Club in Quechee, Vt., sets up for its three-day run
Monday in Maine at Portland CC and The Woodlands. It's the first
time the competition will be contested in the Pine Tree State, but
defender John Hickson out of the Bethel Inn &AMP; CC lends some
home-state flavor. The field of 173 pros and 10 amateurs will split
between the two courses the first two rounds, and Wednesday's final
round, involving the low 60 and ties, will be contested at Portland
CC. There is a record purse of $55,000, with $9,000 first-prize
money. The field includes former champions Paul Barkhouse (1975,
Indian Ridge) of Woburn, Lee Danielian (1980) of Framingham, Jeff
Bailey (1988) of Norwood, Jeff Lewis (1989, 1991, 1993) of Cape Cod
and South Florida, Rich Parker (1992) of the Vermont/New Hampshire
region, and Hickson, who beat Joe Cioe with a birdie on the first
hole of a playoff a year ago. The field also includes stalwarts Tim
Angis of Biddeford-Saco CC and mini-tourists Rod Butcher of North
Kingston, R.I., who won the Massachusetts Open a year ago at Oak
Hill CC, and Pete Morgan of Cape Cod . . . The countdown to the
47th Wogan Award, presented to the NEPGA's top player, is in its
final stages. Entering the New England Open, the top five in points
are Paul Parajeckas (60.5) of Woburn, section champion Mike San
Filippo (54.5) of Nashawtuc, Kirk Hanefeld (49.5) of the Ridge
Club, Nickson (45.6), and Frank Dully (45) of Kernwood. There are
20 points available for a victory in the New England Open and 10
for qualifying for the National Club Pro Sept. 29-Oct. 2. Hickson
(1995, 1998) and Parajeckas (1989, 1997) have won the Wogan twice,
San Filippo (1990) once . . . The phenomenal interest in
mid-amateur competition is reflected by the record 442 who have
entered the 16th Massachusetts tournament (Oct. 4-5) at Longmeadow
CC. They will be split among five venues Monday and one Thursday to
fill 94 spots. There are 26 who are exempt. ``This is right up
there with the State Amateur in terms of interest,'' said MGA
executive director Tom Landry . . . It's perhaps scary to note that
had Scituate club champion Fordie Pitts, who started his round with
a double-bogey 6, shot two strokes lower in the Boston Globe/MGA
Tournament of Club Champions, he would have shot his age (69) and
won a tournament he has played in 46 out of 47 years. He settled
for a 71, as Jim Tyrrell of Weston GC won by a shot. Pitts is an
organizer/founder of the Cape Cod Senior Open, to be held Sept.
20-21 at Hyannis GC, which he and Joe Keller own. Also upcoming is
the 39th State Seniors (Sept. 27-28 at Hatherly CC), an event Pitts
won in 1985 at Wellesley and in 1989 at Pocasset, and the New
England Seniors (Sept. 23-24) at Tumble Brook CC in Bloomfield,
Conn. . . . The latest bulletin from Augusta National GC indicates
changes will be in place for the Masters next April on holes 10,
12, 13, 14, 16, and 17. The 10th and 16th greens have been rebuilt,
and new pin placement options have been established on the 12th and
13th with the recovery of green edges lost to encroachment. Four
trees have been planted to the right of the 14th fairway, two trees
to the right have been removed on the 17th, and three trees have
been added between the 15th and 17th fairways. ``The changes on the
17th will continue to place a premium on accuracy off the tee,''
according to tournament chairman Hootie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The last round
</P>
<P>
   Billy Max, who was one of the Boys of Winter in the days of his
restless youth in the late 1960s, would journey to the West Palm
Beach area in the company of Barkhouse, Bob Menne, and Bruce Dobie
and they would try to scrape by on the course. ``We were all single
and freewheeling,'' Max recalled in 1974 when Menne won the Kemper
Open and fulfilled their dream of dreams. ``We'd just get by. The
four of us would go to the Bahamas for a tournament. If one of us
made money, then we'd all get off the island. We'd eat steaks that
week. If nobody made any money, it'd be hamburgers.'' So they all
toasted Menne's triumph; and now it is time to sing a song of
sorrow for Max, a former assistant pro at Pine Valley in Pelham,
N.H., who died Friday in a hospital in Hanover. He was one of the
good ones.

SOX A PERSISTENT THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette spoke for just
about everyone in and out of uniform Saturday in Yankee Stadium as
he boarded the elevator for the clubhouse following Boston's 11-10
win over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going into our fifth hour until Rod Beck mercifully
ended it,'' Duquette said, ``and I mean mercifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was watch this game, and I'm drained.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon in which seven home runs were hit, five errors
were made, and 349 pitches were thrown by 11 pitchers who walked 16
batters, the Sox were not assured of victory, despite twice holding
five-run leads, until first baseman Mike Stanley squeezed his glove
around a throw from Jose Offerman on Bernie Williams's game-ending
one-hopper to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I'm tired,'' Stanley said. ``I'm tired mentally,
physically, emotionally. (Bret) Saberhagen said he was worn out and
he wasn't even playing. He said during the seventh inning he had to
go up to the clubhouse. I wish I could have gone up there with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have this place packed (55,422) and they get this
place as loud as they get it, the fans getting on their feet, for
an opposing team this is a very difficult place to play. Safe? No,
not in this ballpark, not against that lineup. Even when we were
up, 9-4, I thought there was still quite a bit of game left. You're
never comfortable against those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just take the bottom line. You don't take anything
else. You take the bottom line, be thankful, go out to dinner, and
be ready to go out there again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for the Sox, who hit five home runs _ including
two by Nomar Garciaparra and one foul-pole banger by Troy O'Leary _
but also made four errors, including two on one play by Offerman,
is this: With a two-run, pinch-hit home run by Butch Huskey in the
eighth inning providing the ultimate margin of victory that Beck
preserved in the ninth, they won for the ninth time in 11 games and
sixth time in eight games on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   They're within 4 1/2 games of the first-place Yankees, the
closest they've been to the top spot in the American League East
since they were four out on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands between the Sox and a three-game sweep of the
Bombers, who already have lost 7 of 11 to Boston in dropping a
season series to the Olde Towne Team for the first time since 1996,
is Roger Clemens. And the Rocket has misfired more often than not
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're thinking over there,'' said
Garciaparra, who hit a bases-empty home run in the third to give
the Sox a 5-0 lead, then hit a three-run homer with first base open
in the sixth to give the Sox a 9-4 advantage. ``All we're thinking
about is playing hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   With just 20 games to be played, the Sox assured themselves of
having no worse than a three-game lead over Oakland in the
wild-card race this morning. If they break even the rest of the
way, they will finish with 91 wins, one fewer than the '98
wild-card entrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things happened, I'm not sure what happened,'' said
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, whose bullpen was doubly taxed by
the short stint of starter Mark Portugal, gone after four innings
after Paul O'Neill's three-run home run cut the Sox lead to 5-4,
and the bellyache of reliever Rich Garces, who was limited to one
inning after losing his lunch because of what he suspects was food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long game,'' Williams said of a nine-inning exercise
completed in an untidy 3 hours 50 minutes. ``A lot of things
happened to both teams. Good plays. Not-so-good plays. Good
pitching. Walks. Home runs. Everything. But it was a good victory
for us. We hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the way this series began _ Pedro
Martinez's one-hit, no-walk, 17-strikeout masterpiece Friday night
_ and the sprawling mishmash that followed couldn't have been
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``Jimy, last night you said you never saw pitching
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams: ``Today I saw pitching I've never seen. But
fortunately, it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee starter Hideki Irabu lasted just two innings, his
shortest start of the season. O'Leary singled home a run and
Stanley knocked in two more in the first, and rookie Trot Nixon hit
a bases-empty home run, his 11th homer of the season, in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's successor, Allen Watson, gave up two home runs, to
Garciaparra and O'Leary, who hit one no more than 5 feet from the
top of the right-field foul pole in the fifth. Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch kicked away a ground ball for an error that
led to three runs off reliever Ramiro Mendoza in the sixth, as
Garciaparra hit the first pitch he saw from Mendoza into the
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees picked themselves up once more, scoring four
times in the seventh despite hitting just one ball out of the
infield, Tino Martinez's solid single to center. Garciaparra
backhanded a ball in the hole, but the ball fell out of his glove
for an infield hit. Offerman dropped Knoblauch's grounder, then
threw wildly to first for a double dip on which two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like I was out there forever,'' said reliever Derek
Lowe. ``It seemed like an eternity. Guys were fighting pitches off,
crazy things were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's day grew even longer in the eighth, when Martinez's high
fly to right just dropped over the fence for a two-run home run
that made it 11-10. With Lowe crouched behind the mound in
disbelief, Jimy Williams paid a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I knew what the score was,'' Lowe said. ``He
said we were still winning. He was laughing when he said it. He
said, `Go back out there and throw strikes.' I was able to go back
and get three outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled back, they battled back, but fortunately we
squeezed by.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck needed just two pitches to get the first two outs in the
ninth. Knoblauch rolled to Garciaparra, and Derek Jeter popped to
Offerman. O'Neill then drove an opposite-field single to left, but
Offerman gathered Williams's soft one-hopper on the edge of the
grass and delivered the last out to Stanley's grateful hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a hitter's day,'' Beck said after his second save in two
tries for the Sox. ``I'm just glad they swung at the first pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennant race, anybody?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get in,'' Stanley said. ``Anything can
happen after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys don't know a whole lot about pressure. You know
they're going to come out tomorrow like gangbusters, and make sure
we don't sweep.''

NEW YORK GOOD GUY IN CUP CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In five weeks, competition begins in New Zealand in the first
series of challenger round-robins for the Louis Vuitton Cup,
leading to the America's Cup in February.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New England, the betting, by heart anyway, is firmly on
the New York Yacht Club's campaign, Young America, led by Cup
veteran John Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Yorkers are just one of five US challengers, with
another seven non-US challengers, not to mention the one big
defender, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   If the New Yorkers, whom we can loosely adopt as New England's
Team (after all, they are not the Yankees), can prevail against
fairly good odds, the Cup could be back in the Northeast by March.
</P>
<P>
   But, putting aside our dream of seeing the Cup return for one
more of those crazy Newport summers, what do cooler heads and
rational minds have to say about New York's chance to beat New
Zealand?
</P>
<P>
   We turn to one of the steadiest and most learned eyes on the Cup
waterfront, Gary Jobson. As ESPN yachting analyst since 1986,
Jobson has a deep background and is a professional student of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really three tiers,'' said Jobson by phone from his
office on the Annapolis waterfront recently. ``In the first is New
York, Italy, Paul Cayard (San Francisco), and Japan. These groups
have money, two boats, good teams, and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second tier is Dennis Conner (San Diego), France,
Spain, and (John) Kolius (Hawaii).
</P>
<P>
   ``Third tier are the Swiss, the Russians, and Young Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobson's criteria begins with the two-boat programs. It's hard
to imagine a program that can get one boat up to speed without a
benchmark boat newer than the 1995 generation, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jobson says his four top-tier syndicates are ``by themselves,
ahead of everyone else.'' Even the New Zealanders? The ultimate
question, of course. Answer below.
</P>
<P>
   New York has Marshall, head of the design team that helped
produce the 1986 Cup winner, Stars &AMP; Stripes, and a man very long
on experience, including the Young America campaign in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Fox/ESPN mini-debacle last winter, the New Yorkers
will have plenty of money to launch their full plan. But if money
alone were the key, Italy would have to be the odds-on favorite,
says Jobson, since it is awash in cash. The Italians also have
German Frers, Bill Koch's armada, and they've been at it for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's America One challenge has money, a strong team, a Bruce
Farr boat, and Cayard himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conner has just one boat, but a very strong and experienced
team, including such heavyweights as Ken Read, Mike Toppa, Peter
Isler, and Peter Holmberg.
</P>
<P>
   With six boats in the semifinals, rather than the usual four, a
US presence is all but guaranteed, and 2-4 US boats probably will
be there.
</P>
<P>
   As for The Question, whether anyone can beat the Kiwis in their
home waters, Jobson has two scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   --With plenty of money, racing in the waters they grew up in,
armed with the extensive local knowledge needed in tricky Auckland
conditions, and starting with the fastest IACC benchmark in
existence (Black Magic), the Kiwis win in a walk and retain the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   --With no defense trials to toughen them, with the pressure of
sailing at home, having lost a winning designer (Doug Peterson) to
Italy, and considering the fact that challengers have won three of
the past four Cups (not counting the looney-tunes catamaran show),
New Zealand gets beaten by one of the four big defenders if (a huge
if) none of them defects to tune up the Kiwis in the end.
</P>
<P>
   If, as tradition holds, the challengers stick together even
after they get eliminated, Jobson believes it will be difficult for
New Zealand to tune up enough to compete with the challenger that
survives five months of tough competition.
</P>
<P>
   But if some challenger agrees to sail with the Kiwis, all bets
are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US groups may all hate each other,'' says Jobson, ``but in
the end they ought to close ranks against the defender. It's an
extremely important question.''

MARTINEZ OBSERVERS STILL AWESTRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEDRO'S CONQUERED TERRITORY, USA _ It is the sober light of the
Day After. You are David Cone. You have been quoted as speaking of
the Friday night Pedro Martinez performance in apocalyptic terms.
You have now had the benefit of a good night's sleep. Like members
of Congress, who are permitted to alter remarks to their
satisfaction before they are committed to history in the
Congressional Record, you are now being offered an opportunity to
rethink, or, as Roger Clemens would say, to ``re-correct'' yourself
for the official Baseball Record.
</P>
<P>
   That said, David Cone, what is your final and unalterable
reflection on Pedro's one-hit, 17-strikeout embarrassment of the
Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best-pitched game I've ever seen,'' asserts the
great Yankee hurler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excluding my perfect game, of course,'' jokes Cone.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, proves to be a throwaway line, for Cone really
does believe Pedro's masterpiece was a more dominant pitching
display than his 27-up, 27-down dispatch of the Montreal Expos on
July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything better,'' reiterates Cone. ``He had
three completely dominant pitches: a great fastball, a
knee-buckling curve, and a parachute changeup. Other than that,
what else do you need?''
</P>
<P>
   To Cone's way of thinking, Pedro's repertoire is nothing less
than unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Orel) Hershiser's great year in '88, and he basically
did it with one pitch, a hard sinker,'' says Cone. ``Nolan Ryan had
a fastball and a curve. Mike Scott, when he was at his peak, had a
fastball and a splitter. Dwight Gooden was another one with a
fastball and a curve. Pedro has three great pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk context. Roger Clemens fanned 20 Seattle Mariners in
late April 1986. The Mariners turned out to be the strike-outingest
team anyone had ever seen. Ten years later, Roger Clemens fanned 20
Detroit Tigers in a meaningless late September game while they were
en route to establishing a new whiff standard. What Pedro Martinez
did the night before last was on an entirely different plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it here, in Yankee Stadium, in a pennant race, when the
team really needed a win,'' reminds Cone, who is always capable of
seeing the Big Picture.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Big Picture, the time has come to slot Pedro in
the MVP race. The Cy Young race is over, of course. With 21 wins, a
2.20 ERA, and 274 strikeouts, he has nailed down the pitching
triple corwn with three weeks to go. No, really. He can't lose.
He's got five more wins and 104 more strikeouts than anyone. His
ERA edge of damn near a full run per nine innings (Cone is second
with 3.10) may be the most astonishing lead of all. Throw in his
league-leading .207 opponents' batting average and there really is
nothing else anyone needs to know. Pedro Martinez will win his
second Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP award is a different matter. Some people _ OK, me _ are
put off by the idea of pitchers winning the MVP. The Cy Young Award
should be their ultimate honor. How can you compare the kumquat
that is an everyday player with the squash that is a pitcher?
Others _ OK, most everyone else _ say it's not that difficult when
you ask yourself the following question: Where would the team be
without him?
</P>
<P>
   Let us, as they say, do the math. The Red Sox are plus-20 for
the season. Pedro is plus-17. This may not quite be the 1972
Phillies/Steve Carlton discrepancy (minus-44/plus-17), but it is
impressive and meaningful and about as good an argument as any one
player in the American League has when the simple subject under
discussion is his inherent value to his team. I'm still a guy who
believes the MVP should go to the (Everyday) Player of the Year,
but I'm not voting and so I am here to predict that Pedro wins 'em
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pitcher,'' says Cone, ``and I understand the debate. But
I think it's pretty clear. You take Pedro away from Boston, and
where are they? That sounds like an MVP to me.''
</P>
<P>
   This all presupposes more superb Pedro outings. Given that he is
4-0 with a 0.58 ERA in his last four starts (not to mention 11 hits
allowed in 31 innings), that's practically a given, isn't it? There
haven't been too many dead spots in his spectacular season. And
consider this: With the DL stint, he's actually saved a little wear
and tear on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' confirms Cone. ``I'm down to pitching once a
week now, and I can tell the difference. I feel much fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone is 36. Pedro is not yet 28 (Oct. 25). The veteran admits to
being a bit envious of the prime-of-lifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kidding him at the All-Star Game,'' Cone says. ``I said,
`Hey, it's easy being you. Anybody can win when they throw 97. Come
and see me in seven years or so, and let's see if you can win when
you're throwing 83.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for hitters, as Cone reminds us, is that Pedro
Martinez does a lot more than throw in the mid 90s. Exhibit A was a
Ricky Ledee at-bat in the eighth inning Friday. This time the
raconteur is Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started him off with two changeups on the outside,''
recalls the GM. ``Then a curveball to go 1-and-2. If you're Ledee,
what do you look for now? Pedro just blows a fastball by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches. A mid-90s fastball. The ``knee-buckling curve.''
The ``parachute changeup.'' Superb control. Top-drawer competitive
instincts. Off-the-scale baseball intelligence. Only one man on
earth has all this, and it's Pedro Martinez, the best pitcher in
baseball.

PATRIOTS HAVE THREE FOR THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The central story line is still Tuna,
the Jets, and the opener of the 1999 season, for better or for
worse, but it is also the debut of three Patriots rookies whose
performances _ good, bad, or ugly _ could significantly affect
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   With center Damien Woody, middle linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer,
and running back Kevin Faulk all in key positions, this marks the
first time since 1991 that the Patriots have had three rookies
(offensive tackle Pat Harlow, running back Leonard Russell, and
strong safety Harry Colon) in the starting lineup on Opening Day.
The 1991 Patriots went 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   Woody will have to concern himself not only with the snaps to
Drew Bledsoe but also with making the blocking calls at the line of
scrimmage _ he needs to match up his mates on the line against the
Jets defensive front, look for potential blitzes, and make sure
that every pass rusher is accounted for, so Bledsoe doesn't suffer
another injury.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer must be effective in stopping Curtis Martin, which
means shedding blockers, mainly All-Pro center Kevin Mawae, and
must be able to defend against the pass as well.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, the running back du jour, must hold on to the football,
first and foremost _ he mustn't do anything frivolous that would
give the Jets good field position. The Patriots are looking for a
sustained, patient running game. The goal of 4 yards per carry is
lofty, but necessary if New England is to grind away at a 3-4
defense that rarely allows big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go out there, I'll see something different,''
said Faulk. ``One of the biggest adjustments (from college) is the
speed of the game. And now they're telling me that the speed of the
regular-season games is faster than the preseason games. So that
part will take getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't fear it. I'm looking forward to it. I think I can
run the football. I don't think there's too much difference in
running it: You still have to find your holes and make the most of
every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk will split time with veteran Terry Allen, who likely will
be used on third down in a short-yardage situations because he has
a history of getting tough yards. And the rookie also will be used
in tandem with Tebucky Jones on kickoff returns. The question is,
will the Jets' John Hall, who had 24 touchbacks in 84 kickoffs last
year, give Faulk a chance to show his return skills?
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make some plays,'' said Faulk, ``whether it's on
the kickoffs or running it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jets' 3-4, Woody will line up face to face with
Jason Ferguson, a 6-foot-3-inch, 305-pound third-year nose tackle.
The rookie will have his hands full, for Ferguson is one of the
most underrated guys at his position. In 16 games last season, he
had 63 tackles and four sacks. But Dave Wohlabaugh did a nice job
against him in both 1998 games, and Woody is quicker than his
predecessor at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been prepared pretty well for the game,'' said
Woody. ``I haven't gone up against this defense yet, so that will
be new, but they've prepared me for different situations and what
to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' scout team, which mimics the next week's
opposition in practice, has thrown everything possible at Woody.
All week the center has had to make blitz reads, and the coaching
staff thinks he's done a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, who missed some practice during the week after
sprained his right ankle in the Carolina game, has been cleared to
play but will have to be at full strength to handle what the Jets
will be throwing at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand when you're a rookie you're going to be tested,''
said Katzenmoyer. ``I've never shied away from that or been awed by
that. I've been tested a lot, and I'll handle whatever they throw
at me. I'm just looking forward to my first pro game, to get one
under my belt and truly understand what it takes to make it in this
league. The adrenaline is going to be flowing, but I just have to
make sure I keep my cool and composure so I know what I'm doing out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll agrees, saying Katzenmoyer and his fellow rookies
will have to show ``great poise'' on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to trust our preparation,'' said the coach, ``and if
we do that, everything should take care of itself. I think we've
prepared these guys to play at a high level.''

BROWNS IN GOOD HANDS WITH PALMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wasn't supposed to be a tough guy, and most of the time, he's
not. At least not in the classic, growling Vince Lombardi sense.
But Chris Palmer has proven one thing to the satisfaction of the
new Cleveland Browns: He is tough when he needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing, you do not want to cross him,'' says
offensive tackle Lomas Brown of the bespectacled ex-Patriots
quarterback coach who will lead the Browns into battle for the
first time Sunday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the field, he's more like a father figure, but he's like a
typical football player on the field. He's a gentle giant off the
field but on the field he's a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer would never advertise himself as any kind of giant or
even a bear (unless he moved to Chicago). Nor would he try to make
the case that he's a tough guy in the mold of his former employers,
Bill Parcells and Tom Coughlin. But he wouldn't disagree with
Brown's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always agree with the players, I say,'' Palmer joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think I've changed from the days I was at BU
or New Haven. Just because you say hello in the hallway and you're
nice to them doesn't mean you don't know how to do this job
properly. We want certain things done or there will be discipline.
That's part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting job, to be sure. After being named head coach
of the expansion version of the Browns on Jan. 21, Palmer set out
to build from scratch a team that can compete against franchises
that have been in existence in some cases for more than 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is an optimist, Palmer is also a realist. The job,
he understands, is all uphill in a town that is wild-eyed about the
return of the Browns after the hated Art Modell took the original
team to Baltimore under cover of darkness three years ago, trading
long tradition for long green.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tradition born of years of success dating back to Paul
Brown's days in the 1950s and of a knowledge of the game that runs
deep throughout the state. Ohio is football country, and Cleveland
is the capital of that country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just how deep this tradition and understanding of the game
runs Palmer didn't begin to understand until one of his first trips
to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been more than I expected,'' Palmer said. ``Fans
here have such a passion for the team that until you're part of it,
it's difficult to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my wife and I first flew in to look for a house, we're
waiting at the airport and a Hertz bus pulls up. The guy opens the
door and says, `Coach, get the quarterback (Tim Couch). Get what
you know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What Palmer certainly knows is quarterbacks, having tutored two
of the game's best young ones in Drew Bledsoe and Mark Brunell. But
more impressive is that he found ways to win with other players,
men with considerably less going for them than Bledsoe and Brunell,
men like Jonathan Quinn last year and Rob Johnson a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer won in Jacksonville with both after Brunell was injured
and then he won some more when Brunell returned. In New England,
Bledsoe's improvement after Palmer took over as quarterback coach
in 1996 was equally impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer's effect on an offense doesn't stop there. When he
tutored the Houston Oilers' receivers, the team led the league in
passing each season, and when he handled New England's receivers,
they became the first group in league history to have five players
with 50 receptions or more. You see production long enough and you
conclude that it's a trend, not an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Palmer knows how to run an offense, and he's
shown this summer, at least to Lomas Brown's satisfaction, that he
also knows how to run a team. Of course, he's had a little help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so busy I think I've only been out one time with my
family since we got here,'' Palmer said. ``I took my wife and kids
to dinner and I went to the men's room and there were a couple of
guys in there who'd had a few drinks. One of them says, `Hey,
you're the coach,' and I say I am and nice to meet them and go into
a stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing I hear is a guy tapping on the stall saying, `Hey,
coach, throw the ball more.' When I got back to our table I told my
wife, `The bathroom wants me to pass more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer may actually pass less than people expect this season, at
least as long as veteran Ty Detmer is in the lineup ahead of Couch.
It had been Palmer's plan all along to start Detmer and bring Couch
along slowly, but he also promised both that the best player would
start.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear now that the starter will be Detmer, but not solely
to protect young Couch from bewildering NFL defenses and his own
team's shortcomings. Detmer will be the starter because that's the
way Palmer said it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim would be the starting quarterback in a lot of
situations,'' Palmer said. ``He played well this summer. But so did
Ty. I told them the best guy would play at every position. Ty
started the summer as our No. 1 quarterback and he played well
enough to hold Tim off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At New England, when Drew arrived, he was so clearly the best
player he had to play. Tim is closing the gap, but it's not the
same situation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, on the eve of his first game, Cleveland's new tough guy
is just as glad it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the situation we're in,'' Palmer said. ``We
understand we have to play as a team to win because we don't have a
game-breaker. In New England, Drew could turn to Terry (Glenn) or
Shawn (Jefferson) and say, `Run deep,' and they can run deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've told our players this. You can believe what you hear
and read or you can go out and do more. We don't have guys who
strike fear in a defense, but that doesn't mean we can't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do, these new Browns could make an old town proud before
this night is over. If they don't, they could make a tough guy
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion deadline nears
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move, Expansion Committee co-chairmen Bob Kraft
and Jerry Richardson have been added to the list of people who will
meet with prospective franchise owners from Los Angeles and Houston
Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of the Expansion Committee and commissioner Paul
Tagliabue last week in Washington that one owner described as
filled ``with a lot of divergent opinions,'' Kraft and Richardson
were asked to the meeting, which was called to study the state of
the LA stadium proposals before Wednesday's deadline to either go
forward with a vote that gave the expansion team to Los Angeles or
withdraw that approval and go back to either Houston or the drawing
board.
</P>
<P>
   A full owners meeting is set for Oct. 6 in Atlanta, and there
will be an Expansion Committee meeting Oct. 5 to formulate a final
recommendation on a situation that has become a mess.
</P>
<P>
   LA's Coliseum group is clearly in retreat, with little or no
public money behind it. Meanwhile, Marvin Davis, the oilman and
failed baseball team owner, has waded in and convinced some owners
that he's ready to put a ton of money up for a franchise fee if his
Hollywood Park stadium plan is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Davis holds an option on the Hollywood Park property and some
believe he and Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis may be conspiring to
allow Davis to move his franchise back to Los Angeles. Davis's
group and the Coliseum group will appear in New York Monday, as
will Bob McNair, who is spearheading the Houston bid.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners like McNair's plan, which is believed to be the best
financing and stadium plan ever presented to the league. Others
want him to pay a higher franchise fee than the $500 million under
discussion. Problem is, they cannot even begin to talk to him about
that until after Wednesday. Otherwise they risk a lawsuit from the
Los Angeles representatives, who hold the exclusive rights to the
franchise until then.
</P>
<P>
   It was written here several weeks ago that the league is likely
to tell McNair to go ahead with his stadium construction, though he
will not know for another 18 months whether he's getting an
expansion team or an existing team. There are two problems with
such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   First, the league has been told privately that some, possibly
all, of the public financing now on the table that makes the
Houston plan so compelling could disappear if McNair is not the
owner of the team because local politicians know him and trust him
and have based their strong support on his being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Second, McNair is not interested in being told by the NFL which
team would come to Houston if he doesn't get the expansion
franchise. If he is not going to be awarded that 32d franchise,
McNair would just as soon negotiate his own deal to buy one of the
current teams, rather than have the league decide who's coming. He
does not want to get the stadium built only to see another owner
move into his house.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has said little publicly and continues to maintain that
he understands the league's reasoning for wanting a team in Los
Angeles, the nation's second-biggest TV market. He has been well
schooled by Richardson, the Panthers owner and a friend dating back
to their college days.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Richardson cautioned McNair to stay focused on
getting a team and not engage in public complaints or controversy.
But if Oct. 6 comes and the LA proposal remains muddled while his
continues to be ignored, he may run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Out of malignment
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells was asked what he thought of the ``much maligned''
Bledsoe. He reacted in typical Parcellsian fashion. `` `Much
maligned?' '' Parcells shot back. ``Put him on the free agent
market and see how much maligned he is. They didn't win many before
he got there and they've won many since he arrived.'' . . .
Whenever the Tuna Bowl approaches, old Parcells stories surface.
This past week, Patriot cornerback Ty Law recalled his first
encounter with the irascible coach. It was during the initial
minicamp after Parcells had drafted Law on the first round in 1995,
a move considered surprising by some. Law had worked out diligently
all winter and spring after deciding to leave Michigan early but he
finally tired and took some time off as the draft approached. By
the time of that minicamp, he had ballooned to 205 pounds and ran a
poor 40 time, which led Parcells to bellow at him. ``He says, `Law,
you look like you got the mumps! You're going to be the first
first-rounder cut,' '' Law recalled with a grin. Despite a new
contract that carries a $14.5 million signing bonus, Law continues
to motivate himself with memories of such slights. ``After I signed
my new contract, people started asking how it would affect me,''
Law said. ``It won't. I can't see anything changing for me. People
don't know why I train like I train and do what I do. I never
played for money. I still remember the only time I made the cover
of Sports Illustrated was when Michael Westbrook caught that Hail
Mary pass (over Law and half the secondary to beat Michigan on the
final play in 1994). I'm going to make the cover for doing
something good. People still want me to sign that Sports
Illustrated cover. At first I didn't want to do it, but then I
started thinking, `OK, that's me. I'll sign.' I don't dwell on the
past _ good or bad. I look to the future. Money didn't change
anything.'' . . . Parcells had a tough day when he had to release
old favorites Corwin Brown and Keith Byars, but he again retained
special teams anchor and backup quarterback Ray Lucas, a move
looked upon with surprise by some in New York. ``I just feel he's a
better player than you guys thought,'' Parcells explained to
reporters. ``Ray brings something to the game and I wanted to have
him around.'' Still, it was an emotional moment for Parcells,
because he has grown so close to Brown that last winter he brought
him to the annual combine workouts in Indianapolis because Brown
one day hopes to become a coach himself. ``One of the most
difficult cuts I've had in many years,'' Parcells said. ``He's one
of those guys who have been in the foxhole with me for a long time.
He wants to coach and I told him I'd be interested.'' . . . Both
the Patriots and Jets will have a rookie starting on the offensive
line Sunday. New England has center Damien Woody (as well as
relatively untested guard Heath Irwin), while the Jets have
second-round pick Randy Thomas at guard. Parcells chose to cut Ian
Beckles, who had started 122 of 127 games in his career, including
16 last year for the Eagles, to keep three rookies and converted
tackle Kerry Jenkins at the guard position . . . Speaking for the
first time since his 45-day holdout began, Seattle wide receiver
Joey Galloway said that while he is loyal to the Seahawks, he's
more loyal to his family and to good sense. ``I can't accept
playing for something that's way below market value,'' said
Galloway, who was asked to be the key man in the Seattle offense
this fall for $1.6 million. He has turned down a seven-year, $35
million extension that includes a $7 million signing bonus and is
seeking a shorter deal (five years) for less money ($25 million)
but more up-front cash ($10 million signing bonus). New head
coach/GM Mike Holmgren appears to be making a stand with Galloway,
one of the league's most productive receivers the past four years,
saying he had made his final offer and would begin reducing it each
week he believes Galloway will be unable to play. The major
sticking point, Galloway said, is that Green Bay receiver Antonio
Freeman just signed a bigger contract than what Galloway is being
offered, yet ``everyone has had a chance to see my numbers have
been better than his.'' Holmgren, who coached Freeman in Green Bay,
says it depends on how you look at things. Each entered the NFL in
1995, and over that four-year span, Galloway has 261 receptions for
4,122 yards and 36 touchdowns while Freeman has 229 receptions for
3,706 yards and 36 touchdowns. But if you throw out their rookie
season, when Freeman didn't start a game and had only eight
receptions while Galloway started 16 and had 67, the numbers look
different. Over the past three years, Freeman has 221 catches to
Galloway's 194, for 3,600 yards to 3,083, and has 35 touchdowns to
Galloway's 29. Holmgren reiterated that he will not trade Galloway,
even though at least 15 teams have contacted the Seahawks about
him.

 &HT;    FBI officials reportedly were warned of likely fire at Davidian
compound
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ FBI officials were warned that the Branch
Davidians might start a fire if the agency launched an assault and
that their compound was a tinderbox, according to a former member
and a visitor who sneaked into Mount Carmel during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   One-time Davidian Marc Breault told the Tribune-Herald that the
FBI was concerned enough in 1993 about the possibility of a fire to
contact him in Australia just three days before flames consumed the
Davidians' residence 10 miles east of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Breault said he was contacted by law enforcement officials in
Melbourne, acting on the FBI's behalf, who showed him numerous
Scriptures taken from letters written by David Koresh during the
51-day siege. All mentioned fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid based on some of the things he had written
that if they tried to assault the compound he would start a fire,''
said Breault, a former confidant of Koresh. ``They were afraid if
they sent people into the compound there would be explosions, there
would be fires set. They had lots of Scriptures, all he had gone
over with us many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Doyle of Waco, a Davidian who survived the fire, said
Koresh taught that the Davidians would move to Jerusalem where
there would be a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end, he kind of hinted that things might start
happening before we went to the Middle East or Jerusalem,'' Doyle
said. ``But I don't know if he ever specifically taught that it had
to be by fire. I'm sure there is prophecy about people being killed
by fire and other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Breault, who left the Davidians in 1989, said he told
authorities that fire was very much a part of Davidian prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Scripture in Daniel 11 that talks about how the
righteous will fall,'' Breault said. ``Some are taken captive; some
die by the sword; and some die by the flame. Two parts of that
prophecy had already been fulfilled, according to their beliefs.
That was the problem. The Davidians thought they were seeing
prophecy fulfilled before their very eyes. Flames were the only
thing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schwein, former special agent in charge of the El Paso
Division, said the FBI had a lot of concerns _ not just the
possibility of a fire starting at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a concern they would burst out of the building
shooting,'' said Schwein, a shift commander during the Davidian
siege and now retired. ``There was a concern they would use the
children as shields. I know at one point they intended to come out
wired with explosives and set them off to kill FBI agents. We had a
lot of concerns. We tried to plan for every eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the FBI contacted former Davidians all over the
world, Schwein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find out as much as we could what this was
all about,'' he said. ``Frankly, we wanted to give our negotiators
more tools to work with. I have no way of knowing if Breault's
information even got back in time to use it. It's possible. I just
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Alaniz, the Houston man who sneaked into Mount Carmel less
than a month after the ATF's botched raid, wasn't really thinking
about the place being a fire hazard when he talked to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Davidians' residence on April 17, 1993 _ two days
before the fire that led to the death of Koresh and 75 followers.
FBI and ATF agents _ and even, Alaniz claims, the CIA _ grilled him
into the early morning hours after he left Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz left hoping to act as a mediator of sorts between the
Davidians and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for a pad and paper,'' said Alaniz, who now lives in
Louisiana and works as a sheet metal drafter. ``I drew a diagram of
the building. I wanted to help resolve it. I gave them a complete
layout. I told them, 'These people don't want to fight. But if you
go in, do it in a way that you don't hurt anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   He told authorities that hay was stacked against Mount Carmel's
walls and lanterns were in some rooms, Alaniz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them there was hay up against the wall and in the foyer
trying to stop bullets,'' Alaniz said. ``They thought they were
going to be shot at again.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texas law enforcement official, who asked not to be named,
confirmed that Alaniz reported the Davidians were using hay as a
barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said he decided to sneak into Mount Carmel after hearing
people talk about the Davidians while riding a bus in Houston.
People were saying the government should kill all of them, he said.
After praying, Alaniz took a Greyhound bus to Waco and somehow
walked through an armed perimeter right up to the Davidians' front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians didn't know what to make of Alaniz or Jesse Amen, who
also sneaked into Mount Carmel, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wondering if they might be spies for the government,''
Doyle said. ``But David's attitude was that they were souls to be
saved so give them a Bible study.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are still suspicious of his motives, Alaniz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy nobody knows sneaks in past hundreds of ATF and FBI
agents and after he comes out the government goes in and burns the
place down,'' Alaniz said. ``Yeah, it does look strange. Believe
me, I had to go through a lot. I've been called baby burner and
everything else in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his time at Mount Carmel was spent reading the Bible and
talking with the Davidians, Alaniz said. He sensed while inside
that things weren't going well and decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much aggression going on that I knew they were
fixing to do something,'' Alaniz said. ``The government was cursing
them, mooning them, shooting the finger at girls standing in the
windows. I saw more evil on the outside than I did on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the Davidian children, Alaniz said he told
authorities that there was a nursery on the second floor where the
infants slept. Lanterns were kept there, he reported, to give the
mothers light while they bathed their children.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said there was no central nursery at Mount Carmel.
However, he said all the women did sleep with their children on the
second floor. Men, who were forbidden by Koresh from having sex
with their wives, slept on the first floor. Diagrams of Mount
Carmel printed in the Tribune-Herald and elsewhere before the fire
noted the segregated living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said he was shocked to see a tear gas boom rip into the
second floor on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to hit that spot?'' Alaniz asked. ``That
told me they didn't care. If they did, they wouldn't have pumped
gas inside there where the infants were. No, sir, they can't lie to
me no more about caring about those kids. They wanted them all
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials at the time said they believed the Davidian women
would flee with their children in the face of a tear gas assault.
It was just another in a line of government miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   In light of what he told the FBI, Breault was also surprised to
see the tear gas assault on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely worried about the possibility of a
fire,'' Breault said. ``So I'm surprised they had any incendiary
devices there. They knew there was hay stacked up and lanterns
about. If one of them was knocked over, it could have caused a
fire. Then they went and started knocking things down. I think they
just lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic bugs inside Mount Carmel picked up voices yelling,
``Start the fire,'' and ``The fire is lit,'' among other things.
Davidians, however, claim the tanks ramming Mount Carmel caused the
fire, possibly overturning the lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   It would take firefighters 15 minutes to arrive after the FBI
called for help.
</P>
<P>
   Government concerns about the possibility of a fire at Mount
Carmel went back to early April 1993, according to the Justice
Department's report on Waco. Assistant U.S. Attorney LeRoy Jahn
raised the issue. Despite Jahn's concern and what people like
Breault and Alaniz told them, the FBI balked at having firefighting
equipment on standby at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI did not let firefighters approach the burning building
until 31 minutes after the fire was first reported.
</P>
<P>
   Schwein still supports the FBI's decision not to have
firefighters at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have had no protection whatsoever,'' Schwein said.
``We couldn't move around except in Bradley Fighting Vehicles.
Bullets were flying at our guys. We had put a plan together. We all
know the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI never got a good grasp on Koresh, said Breault, who
calls Koresh by his given name of Vernon Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they decided Vernon didn't believe any of this
stuff,'' Breault said. ``They thought he was a con man. They failed
to take into account the level of his belief and that of his
followers. They couldn't believe there was anyone that dedicated to
an apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwein willingly admits the FBI never figured out Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone really understood what he was all
about,'' Schwein said.
</P>
<P>
   Although critical of the FBI, Breault stresses that he believes
that Koresh and the Davidians played a leading role in their
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should keep in mind that in his theology the
apocalypse was inseparable from fire,'' Breault said. ``I've always
believed Vernon started the fire at Mount Carmel or set up a
situation where an assault would start a fire. It's possible the
FBI inadvertently _ you might say negligently _ set the fire. But I
think Vernon set it up.''

SERENA TAKES VICTORY OVER HINGIS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Serena did what her big sister could not.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams turns 18 in a couple of weeks. Saturday, she
helped her family get a little revenge and enjoyed an early
birthday celebration as she beat Martina Hingis, the world's No. 1
player, in a scintillating performance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams prevailed, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to win her first major title.
Hingis had beaten Venus Williams in Friday's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Serena had never reached the quarterfinals of a major
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   She had never faced this kind of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves? Never.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe a little. Serena did falter a bit in closing out the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis wriggled free of a couple of match points in the ninth
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset with myself,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4-4 in the second-set tiebreaker and Hingis was serving.
</P>
<P>
   First serve: fault. Second serve: Williams whacked a forehand
winner and it was 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Williams served and moved to the net. She drilled a couple of
backhands deep and Hingis tried a desperate lob to get Williams off
the net. It fell just long and Williams was a point away.
</P>
<P>
   Williams turned her back to the net and caught her breath. She
kicked a serve wide. After a short volley, Hingis hit a backhand
long and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Williams staggered back behind the baseline for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `should I scream? Should I yell? Should I
cry?' '' Williams said. ``What should I do? I guess I did them all.
It was so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a glorious moment.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, the first African-American woman to win the US
Open since Althea Gibson won a pair in 1957 and '58.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, avenger of her sister's semifinal loss.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, collector of $750,000 for her win.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, US Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she was at the net to accept congratulations from Hingis.
Then she headed into a corner of Arthur Ashe Stadium and pulled
herself up into a box of seats to kiss her mother, Oracene. Her
father, Richard, who long has predicted championships for his
girls, came down to meet her on the court.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, President Clinton called from New Zealand to
congratulate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure my day couldn't get any better,'' Williams
said. ``Next thing I knew, someone was telling me, `The President
of the United States wants to talk to you.' I was thinking, `wow.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in control most of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a step late,'' Hingis said. ``She was always
leading. I felt like I was always behind. I was always being
defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, down a break in the second set and serving at 3-5, was
in deep trouble at 15-40. Williams had two match points. But could
not convert them.
</P>
<P>
   On the first, Williams hit a backhand wide and long. On the
next, a backhand into the net. Hingis held on but faced more
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Williams served for the match. And Hingis broke her at love.
Hingis held serve and then had a break point in a long Game 12, but
could not get it and it went to the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Williams dictated play throughout. In the first set, she had 25
unforced errors, but 19 winners. The totals for Hingis: five
unforced errors, one winner.
</P>
<P>
   For the match, Williams had 57 unforced errors and 36 winners.
Hingis had 24 and seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' she said of the 57 errors. ``I mean, imagine if I stop
making those errors?''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up finish put a bookend finish on this year's majors
for Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   She won the Australian, lost in the finals of the French to
Steffi Graf (she was so upset she had to be led back to the awards
ceremony by her mother and coach, Melanie Molitor). At Wimbledon,
she asked her mother to stay away and lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's back and smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   Informed that Richard Williams had said she was scared at the
end of the match, she replied that Serena seemed more scared and
had trouble finishing her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chances and I didn't take them,'' Hingis said.
``There are many more years to come against the Williams sisters.
It didn't happen today, but there are many more Grand Slams and
finals to come. Hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   And Serena?
</P>
<P>
   She did a round of interviews and then headed out to play a
doubles semifinal match with her big sister.

AGASSI, MARTIN WIN IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is an all-American final for the 1999 US Open
men's tennis title. It's just not the all-American final
anticipated when this tournament began nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi was expected to be there. Todd Martin was not.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals Saturday, second-seeded Agassi survived a
rough start to beat No. 3 seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3,
6-3. No. 7 Martin survived a rough two weeks and then cruised past
unseeded Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matchup of not-so-young Americans. Both finalists turned
29 earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi is 9-5 against Martin and they have split the last four
matches. But Agassi has the edge on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he can play great tennis really on any surface, because he
has the ability to play aggressively and to hit through any court,
even clay,'' Agassi said. ``I mean, if he's really on his game, he
can take returns early and hit them hard, deep and low, get behind
it. He's 6 foot 6. It's hard to get the ball behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was certainly on his game Saturday, and Agassi expects to
see the best of him Sunday. He may have anticipated facing Pete
Sampras (before the No. 1 seed was forced to withdraw with a bad
back), but he's not about to take Martin lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some incredible things to get here,'' Agassi said.
``It's been great watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Agassi completed his latest comeback when he won
the French Open for the first time. It was his fourth major title
and gave him the cycle: He has won each of them once. This will be
Agassi's fourth US Open final. He beat Michael Stich in 1994 _ in
his first comeback _ and lost to Sampras in both '90 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time Martin has made a major final. He
lost to Sampras in the '94 Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets helped clear the way for both players; Kafelnikov was the
first seed Agassi faced.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi and Kafelnikov split two uninspiring sets. Agassi, who
was not serving well at the start, broke serve in the opening game
of the third set and began to take control of the match.
</P>
<P>
   He was rolling in the fourth set _ recording nine of his 11 aces
_ but he had a little trouble closing out Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov was serving at 2-5 and Agassi squandered one match
point. Ahead, 5-3, Agassi served for the match and fell into a
15-40 hole. He dug his way out, missed another match point, and
then put it away with a service winner followed by a Kafelnikov
forehand into the net.
</P>
<P>
   While Agassi was making his way through the bottom half of the
draw, the top half opened up for Martin. No Pete. No Patrick
Rafter. And Martin had to face only one seeded player on his way to
the semis _ no one rated higher than his No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But he faced plenty of drama, even after Sampras pulled out and
Rafter was taken out by Pioline, retiring in the fifth set of their
first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   There was a first-round match when he was up two sets on
qualifier Stephane Huet and then had to rally to win in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fourth-round test, when he was out on his feet
against Greg Rusedski (down two sets) and somehow pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
   There was little drama in his semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin just crushed Pioline and in the process livened up the
finale. Maybe it won't be automatic for Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Martin played great, but he isn't necessarily counting on doing
that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to play great,'' he said. ``You only have to play
better than the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly did Saturday. This was no contest. He picked
Pioline apart.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ripped returns. He hit groundstrokes deep. Angled
volleys. Tickled the lines.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Pioline was talking to himself, shaking his head,
and kicking balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played too good,'' Pioline said. ``He was reading the ball
very well today, catching everything, very few unforced errors,
serving big.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioline peaked in the very first game. And that had Martin a
little concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline had four break points on Martin's serve. But Martin
served out of trouble each time, saving serve with a pair of
service games.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Martin had his first service break. Pioline got that one
back late in the first set. But in the next game Martin broke right
back, ripping a return that Pioline could not handle, and he rolled
from there.
</P>
<P>
   The first set took 42 minutes. The rest of the match took 54.
And by the way, Martin never disagreed with Kafelnikov's statement
after his third-round match that either he, Agassi, or Richard
Krajicek was going to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be here myself,'' Martin said. ``Given the
right circumstances and playing well, I thought I had a great
chance to be in the final. When somebody speaks in the
quarterfinal, it's going out on a limb, regardless of who you pick.
I told CBS the other day I agreed with him.''

EWING'S ANKLE A SORE SPOT FOR KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, wouldn't you like to have been the proverbial fly on the
wall in those Madison Square Garden boardrooms last week? Franchise
center Patrick Ewing, who is in the breakdown lane of his NBA
career, says not only that he is still sore, but, well, sayonara to
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The partially torn Achilles' tendon has mended, he said. But the
tendinitis in the area (left ankle) is still there and Ewing won't
put on a uniform until it's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be ready for camp. Hopefully, the regular
season,'' he said at the Wheelchair All-Star Game in New York.
``I'm in the mindset to get healthy and that's it. I'm not going to
play on it, then sit out. I'm not going to go through what I went
through last year. I'm not going to play until I'm sure I'm healthy
and won't reinjure it. I did the same with my wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. After missing most of the 1997-98 season with
a shattered wrist, he returned in the second round of the playoffs
and the Knicks went out and lost just fine with him. He was there
and his wrist was so-so and he didn't make much of a difference.
This past season, after being in and out of the lineup, he finally
pulled up lame in the conference finals against the Pacers. He
watched the NBA Finals in an expensive suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, of course, is doing the right thing. At 37, the body
doesn't heal or respond the way it did when he was 27. (Wait till
he hits 40.) Using standard sports logic, it'll be more beneficial
to have him healthy for the playoffs. It makes sense for him to be
completely healthy assuming, of course, that such a blissful state
exists for him at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Ewing is being indefinite about any
timetable (``when the swelling goes away, I'll be ready''), and
that's not a situation anyone likes. It's also New York and we all
saw what happened last year when he sat out. Jeff Van Gundy found
out he had a bench and a fast team that played differently _
sometimes better _ without Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Van Gundy has to know now what he has. (Hint:
Marcus Camby is No. 23, the big guy with the Chinese scrawl on his
arm.) He has to know what's in store. (Hint: Latrell Sprewell likes
to get up and down the floor.) And, yes, Charlie Ward and Chris
Childs are still the point guards. (Two out of three isn't bad.)
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Ewing's revelation was probably some news that the
Y2Knicks could have done without. The Knicks feel a healthy,
contributing Ewing is essential to claiming a championship flag.
But the only flag we saw this past week was a red one, with Ewing
carrying it. He has every right to wait until everything feels
fine. The two questions he can't answer are how long that will take
and how he will know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't even run on the ankle yet _ and training camp starts
in a month. His backup is also hurt. Allan Houston is even
volunteering to man the middle, adding, ``Believe me, we've been
through worse.'' And most of those times have been when Ewing has
been on the sideline, as he is now.
</P>
<P>
   Cross off Kris
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 NBA draft may go down now as an official Waste of Time
for the Celtics. The player they drafted, Kris Clack, the Texas
guard that they ``couldn't believe'' slipped all the way to 55,
won't even be invited to training camp. ``We feel Kris needs more
time and seasoning to get to the NBA level,'' GM Chris Wallace
said. ``He's not going to get that with us.'' Clack played for the
Celtics in their summer league, but not well enough to warrant an
invitation. ``He really needs to work on getting his body in shape
and learning what his game is,'' Wallace said. The Celtics would
like Clack to play in the new International Basketball League,
whose Baltimore franchise has his rights. Another option is the
Continental Basketball Association. As of now, the Celtics have 15
players on scholarship and Rick Pitino may decide to leave it at
that. ``He's not a big believer in bringing in players just to be
in camp,'' Wallace said. Of those 15, however, two (Greg Minor,
Pervis Ellison) are potential injury-list candidates . . . Kenny
Anderson also showed up at the Wheelchair Games and didn't seem all
that upset about the loss of Ron Mercer. (Maybe because it means
more shots for him?) ``I like our team right now,'' said Anderson.
``What it does for me is put more responsibility on me in the
backcourt. And I like that, because I didn't feel I had that last
year.'' (What planet was he living on?) Anderson also said Mercer
``was asking for X amount of money and didn't do, you know, X
amount of work. It's kind of strange.'' Did he think Mercer wanted
out of Boston? ``I think so. But you know, sometimes the grass
isn't greener on the other side. He's in Denver now. What's the
difference there? It's a business thing, but did he re-sign with
them? No. Now you've got to play out a season to get his money?
It's a rough situation. Now you've got him on a Nick Van
Exel-(Antonio) McDyess team. I hope it works out for him. I've got
no gripes or bad things to say about him. But sometimes, being in
the league long enough, you learn the grass ain't greener on the
other side.'' . . . As for former Pitino favorite Bruce Bowen, he
was in Las Vegas working out with the Milwaukee Bucks. He's been
getting some one-on-one attention and Milwaukee did lose Michael
Curry via free agency. Bowen also has drawn interest from Seattle,
Miami, New York, and San Antonio, but agent Steve Kauffman has yet
to hear those magic words: ``guaranteed contract.'' The Spurs may
decide to opt for Chucky Brown and then there's a drought at small
forward (Shandon Anderson excepted). However, teams like Orlando
will be forced to make cuts, further flooding the market. ``As far
as the supply/demand goes, the numbers look bad,'' Kauffman said.
``It's really out of whack. And it's not fun relating this to my
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing channels
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fiorentino, who has been a part of the Miami Heat's
basketball operation since Day One and is the last holdover from
the pre-Pat Riley days, has been moved over to the television side.
Riley has brought in Marc Iavaroni from Cleveland to join Bob
McAdoo and Stan Van Gundy on the bench . . . Speaking of the
Cavaliers, center Zydrunas Ilgauskas has been cleared to play after
missing most of last year with a broken foot. That came as welcome
news to new coach Randy Wittman . . . Television viewers in San
Antonio are seeing the first wave of commercials promoting the
construction of a new ``Save The Spurs'' arena. Voters will decide
Nov. 2 whether to approve increases in both rental car and
hotel/motel taxes to pay for the $175 million building. While the
ads suggest that San Antonio will still have low hotel taxes, those
in the biz think the spots are misleading. In addition, city
officials are still upset that the Spurs wouldn't back an arena
proposal that would have been funded by an increase in the sales
tax. The Spurs say they cannot compete in the Alamodome and will
have to move if a new arena is not built . . . The Houston Rockets
are the latest NBA team to take a flyer on former Celtic Thomas
``Big Ham'' Hamilton. No word on how much he weighs . . . Agent
Bill Duffy is heading to China, which could well be the next great
frontier for the NBA. The Mavericks drafted Chinese center Wang
Zhi-Zhi in the second round (No. 36) in June and may well have him
for the 2000-01 season. (He's in the People's Army right now.)
Duffy also is high on 19-year-old Yao Ming, who happens to be 7
feet 5 inches. ``He'll probably be in the draft not next year but
the following year,'' Duffy said. Duffy represents Bateer Menk, a
23-year-old, 6-11 Chinese player who appeared in the Desert Classic
last spring and may end up in the IBL in Las Vegas. ``These players
all have ability,'' Duffy said. ``The problem is that they play a
completely different game, almost genteel. You don't have anyone
like Anthony Mason over there. It's not a very physical game. They
don't get into your face.'' . . . Speaking of Mason, he also was at
the Wheelchair Game and didn't mince words about the rule changes
that will attempt to eliminate gratuitious roughness, a Mason
trademark. ``I thought it was garbage,'' Mason sniffed. ``Every
year, you're going to have people changing something. You've got a
bunch of people on the (rules committee) who don't play anymore.
When they played, it was basically wrestling. Now, they're trying
to make the game more sissified. In the WNBA, the girls are allowed
to play harder than we're allowed to play. The rules will slow the
game down.'' The changes, whatever they are, will be adopted by the
NBA Board of Governors prior to the league meetings two weeks from
now in Vancouver. However, the league will offer a video
presentation to the teams at the meetings and hope the message gets
transmitted down to the common folk . . . Atlanta's new arena opens
this weekend with an exhibition hockey game and then, a bit later,
officially, with an Elton John concert. ``We still need every day
we can get through October to get it ready,'' said Hawks president
Stan Kasten. The Hawks, however, decided to play their ``home''
exhibition game against the Celtics in Biloxi, Miss. Wait until the
players find out there's a casino next door to the arena . . . So
Michael Curry, how hard was it to leave Milwaukee and go back to
Detroit? ``It was an easy decision,'' he said. ``If Milwaukee went
five years, like Detroit did, it would have been a tough decision.
But when you're a year and $2 million off, it's an easy decision.''
Curry said he had six or seven legitimate offers of three or more
years.

CARTER A SECONDARY TARGET OF JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde will be on the other side of the line, sure to
be looking for him even if he might not be looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our slogan this year is, `Start over,' '' said Testaverde, the
New York Jets quarterback. ``Last year means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Chris Carter will not be starting over, but
starting out, New England's last line of defense at safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be nervous,'' said Carter. ``Just a little
something called anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   This, anxiety and all, is a role he relishes. The anxiety will
disappear, he's sure, once he hits his first Jet. After that, it
will be football, Testaverde ``starting over'' by going after
Carter, and Carter hoping to keep his cool, hoping to keep his
wits. He will be a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general rule, go after the new guy, or if somebody goes
down, they go after the guy who comes in, that's the general
rule,'' said Carter. ``But I'm not looking forward to their going
away from me; I'm looking forward to their coming after me. And
when I see that, my eyes get bright, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other defenders can make mistakes and teammates can help. But
when the free safety makes a mistake, only white lines are between
the opponent and the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's words are sure and his analogy quick when talking about
this do-or-die role of his. He reaches for his other love in life
beyond football to make his point. Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning on going to med school and studying cardiology,''
said New England's new free safety. ``As a cardiologist, you're
pretty much the last line of defense. If you mess up there, it's
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   One cannot be faint of heart as a cardiologist or a free safety.
</P>
<P>
   Carry on the analogy. Patriot fans have palpitations heading
into the new season Sunday, palpitations over their team's defense.
New faces and new bodies are on that defense, Carter's being one of
the more prominent. Hearts flutter and questions leap out; how good
will these new players be?
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde openly stated what Patriot fans fear, that teams will
try to run the ball against New England's defense until the
Patriots show they can stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked on our running game very hard this training
camp,'' said Testaverde, ``and that will help us keep teams
off-balance. Hopefully, it will keep New England off-balance this
week. We really want our running game to work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But, take this to heart; the Jets will also throw the football.
And then will come the battle between the wily veteran and the
young safety who, admittedly, will be feeling some anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a better quarterback than I was even a year ago,''
said Testaverde. ``That's because I understand this offense better.
And, most of all, I'm trying to go to the right spot with the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Football may be the ultimate team game, but there are 11
one-on-one battles each and every play that decide the trend of the
game. One of the more significant battles will be Testaverde versus
Carter. The Jets' game plan surely will be to try to confuse the
new safety.
</P>
<P>
   And Testaverde is the wily veteran, the veteran who prides
himself ``on staying very calm when the lawnmower starts.'' The
lawnmower? That was Baltimore coach Ted Marchibroda's phrase when
Testaverde played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's all this noise around you but you have to
stay cool,'' said Testaverde. ``And I think I've gotten better at
that since last year because this system we have here allows me to
stay focused on my job and my job alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Carter will try to stay cool when that lawnmower revs
up and Giants Stadium grows very loud. The game _ and the Patriots'
season, to be blunt _ could well swing to a large degree on how
well Carter does his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get out there, mentally I'll be going over what I'm
supposed to do and I'll try to get relaxed and be focused,'' said
Carter. ``I'll be anxious but by game time I'll be ready to play.
This is the greatest game in the world, the NFL. You can't get any
higher than this. `Exciting' is an understatement for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is very bright (National Honor Society in high school,
national academic honors at Texas), and his pre-med focus was in
kinesiology. Yet his job in football is that fine blend of hitting
other players very hard while at the same time being a defensive
quarterback who must instantly recognize what formations the other
team lines up in and what untold number of moves the offensive
players can make from those formations. Sometimes, Carter conceded,
there can be too much thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Patriots' persistent problems last year in giving up
first downs when they went into nickel and dime packages on
third-and-long situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we tried to overplay a lot of teams on third down,''
said Carter. ``We tried to outthink them and we tried to do things
to take away their best thing, and teams adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this year, we're planning on just doing our basic things
and winning our one-on-one matchups. Everybody has their matchups
on third down, one of our tackles on their guard, Willie (McGinest)
coming off the end, one of our linebackers on their backs. We all
have one-on-one matchups we have to win and that's what it comes
down to on third down.''
</P>
<P>
   If enough spotlights are not on Carter already, the brightest
one is still being warmed up. Carter, after all, replaces wily
veteran Willie Clay, who was dumped two days before camp opened.
Comparisons between Clay and Carter will be made all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't add any pressure on me at all,'' argued Carter.
``I'm a different player from Willie. All players are different.
Maybe Willie makes a tackle by grabbing the right leg and I grab
the left leg. We're just different people. I'm not thinking about
Willie because the cohesiveness of the defense is the main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   All he can do, said Carter, ``is work hard. Anytime you're
stagnant, you're falling back. It's always a constant effort to go
forward, to push forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bill Parcells and Testaverde will be coming at him Sunday
afternoon. Work has gotten Carter this far, but the next step?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' he said. ``They can come at me any way they want to.
I'm prepared.''

 &HT;    Floyd lashes out toward Bahamas; Southeast keeps watch
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt and Larry Hobbs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Floyd got stronger and headed
toward the Bahamas Saturday, packing 110 mph winds and leaving
weather pundits wondering whether it will hit South Florida this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers and county emergency workers were on alert, while
some anxious people in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast
stocked up on storm supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was
expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and
it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131
mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a strong hurricane,'' said meteorologist
Edwin Campos. ``The whole thing is where it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands on
Saturday, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding. The hurricane
itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast
of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. It was expected to move
west-northwest at 12 mph.
</P>
<P>
   While forecasters say they can't predict where Floyd will go
after Tuesday, they said Floyd's center could reach the East Coast
by Thursday at its current speed. Residents could experience its
wind and rain much sooner. Tropical-force winds extend 175 miles
from the center, while hurricane gales reach out 105 miles, the
hurricane center said.
</P>
<P>
   If the hurricane keeps on the predicted course, a citizen's
information line could be activated as early as today, said Bill
O'Brien, Palm Beach County's emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the same thing as everyone else: We're watching
it,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is ready to open 11 shelters in Palm
Beach County, including one for people who need breathing
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there have been no special water releases from
canals, said Ann Overton, a spokeswoman for the South Florida Water
Management District.
</P>
<P>
   The district's two meteorologists were working staggered shifts
this weekend to watch the storm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Area grocery stores reported a small run on nonperishables, but
grocery managers are anticipating a crush on such items in the next
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, it's happening already _ started this morning,''
said Fred Price, manager of the Publix on Village Boulevard in West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The store sold 550 1-gallon water jugs Saturday. ``If it keeps
coming like it is now, we'll get hit hard,'' Price said. ``It will
be outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Line, manager of a Winn-Dixie in Stuart, plans to order
extra nonperishables today after a run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of hours it was pretty wild in here today,'' he
said. ``We'll order heavy on those items tomorrow, because the next
truck won't come until Tuesday and if it's coming it'll be in full
swing by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware stores were ordering more hurricane supplies as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several calls today asking about plywood, anchor
screw and other items, asking if we had any readily available,''
said Donald Chamberlain, a salesman at the Home Depot on Lake Worth
Road. ``But there's been no real noticeable rush yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton's residents may be less concerned. ``We haven't
gotten any calls at all today,'' a Home Depot employee there said.
``No one's really thinking ahead.''

DOWNEY LOOKING FOR A FIGHTING CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ The numbers tumble from Aaron Downey's tongue
with unabashed enthusiasm. He knows them by heart. No need to
consult hockey's official guide and record book or pull a tattered,
yellowed newspaper clipping from his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A fighter's hands aren't made for carrying resumes. He's got all
the vitals memorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got good numbers,'' declared Downey, not quoting his
goals and assists, but rather his total penalty minutes each of the
past five seasons. ``I've got 320, 358, 338, 407, and 401. And the
best part about 'em, I never cost my team, not once. I've always
taken a guy with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is not yet so politically correct that contenders such as
Downey must pretend their greatest attribute is something that it's
not. He's a fighter, an enforcer, a man for hire. As a member of
the Baby Bruins the last two years, the 25-year-old right wing has
led the American Hockey League in PIMs both seasons. If he's going
to make it to Boston this year, or anytime soon, he'll be delivered
there by the strength of his steeled knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimistic guy,'' said Downey, who grew up on his
parents' farm in Shelburne, Ontario, some 90 minutes north of
Toronto. ``I come from a good family farm, and I just do the best I
can every day, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out _
but it won't be because I didn't try. I just put myself in a
scenario where I want to do the best I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario, in Downey's mind, would find him on a line with
Ken Belanger, his former teammate in Guelph (Ontario), two tough
wingers paired with a pivot that could form a formidable crash line
_ like the Bobby Holik-Mike Peluso-Randy McKay combination that
helped the Devils to the Stanley Cup in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd make a heck of a line,'' said Downey. ``I think
we could bring some real energy to the FleetCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless things change dramatically in the two-plus weeks leading
to the season opener, Belanger will be Downey's greatest obstacle.
There are only so many jobs on the police force and Belanger is the
returning beat cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what he does in the exhibtion games,'' said
ex-cop Pat Burns, the Bruins' coach, whose club took on the Sabres
here Saturday night in each team's exhibition opener. ``I think
Belanger is your legitimate tough guy. The question is: how many do
you need? Now, if (Downey) could do something else, maybe beat
someone out for a different job _ who knows? _ we might need a
fourth-line type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, there are open jobs on Boston's front
line. Tim Taylor is now a Ranger. P.J. Axelsson hasn't come to
contract terms. Dmitri Khristich won big in arbitration and then
lost bigger when the Bruins cut him loose as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   If Downey can mix in some unexpected skill over the next
fortnight, as he believes he can, then he could be reciting some
new numbers _ NHL games played _ after the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's like being on the farm,'' said Downey.
``They don't tell me much, but I've got a job, and I know how to do
it. Back on the farm, if I've got a $100,000 piece of equipment out
there, then I'm out there cultivating potatoes. That's the job, and
you've got a lot at stake with that machine and with what's in the
ground. And here I am now, in the NHL, playing with the elite
players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What all that shows me is, I've got a job, right now, and I've
got to make the most of it.''

SERENA WILLIAMS PROVES FATHER KNOWS BEST IN WINNING U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Richard Williams turned out to be a
prophet after all.
</P>
<P>
   Not two weeks ago, when he predicted a U.S. Open final between
daughters Venus and Serena, but last year, when he was asked which
sister would be the better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena is the best one,'' he said then. ``What makes me think
she will be better is she had years to sit around and watch Venus
and see what Venus' mistakes were. She always was a better athlete
than Venus to start off with. She hits the ball harder. She returns
serve better. She places the ball better.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena succeeded yesterday where her big sister failed. Venus
lost to top-ranked Martina Hingis in the semifinals, but Serena
struck a blow for family pride with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) upset victory
in the U.S. Open women's final before a raucous crowd at the
National Tennis Center. She became the second African-American
woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, joining Althea Gibson, who
won the last of her five singles titles in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, the 17-year-old who wasn't considered mentally
tough enough, who never before had advanced past the quarterfinal
of a Grand Slam tournament, became the first member of the family
to win a major singles event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty exciting,'' she said. ``I was thinking should I
scream, or yell, or cry, what should I do? I think I ended up doing
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as she did when they were growing up, Serena learned from
her older sister. After watching Hingis win in the semifinals on
Friday, she immediately headed to a practice court.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw Martina had won, I thought I had to go out and
improve also,'' she said. ``I hit some groundstrokes and serves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the serve that proved to be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Serena's serve remained a weapon all during her match. She
continued to hit her first serve in on the big points and managed
to keep pressure on Hingis even with her second serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can serve it,'' she said. ``Even if I miss my first
serve I'm still going for it, because I feel I can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' serve, on the other hand, was ineffective. Williams
picked on her soft second serve, stepping well into the court to
crank winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't push the ball over the net,'' Hingis said. ``She
just kills it. I didn't serve very well. That's the biggest thing I
have to improve in my game. I have to put more of those first
serves in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis entered the match as the favorite. She is the top-ranked
player in the world, and owns five Grand Slam singles titles. But
after needing three sets and two hours to beat Venus, she was a
step slow yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stay focused and concentrated,'' she said. ``I
usually react better. Today I was moving in slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the prevailing pre-match theory, it shouldn't have
mattered. Her first Grand Slam final was supposed to reduce
Williams to a quivering mass of nerves. The butterfly that Venus
wears around her neck was supposed to be in Serena's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she came out firing. She broke Hingis the first time
she served and, despite facing break points in each of her service
games, she didn't fold.
</P>
<P>
   She made mistakes _ 25 unforced errors _ but made up for it with
19 winners on her way to winning the first set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams appeared to be on her way to an easy victory when she
broke in the seventh game of the second set, held for a 5-3 lead
and, with Hingis serving again, earned two match points with a
forehand winner.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when the nerves arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The match points disappeared on a wild backhand and a forehand
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I lost those two match points I was very upset with
myself,'' she said. ``I was like Serena, this can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis held, but Williams still was serving for the match. She
didn't win a point, though, committing four unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something went dreadfully wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It continued to go wrong the next time she served, and Hingis
held a set point. Williams, though, gave herself a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time when you have to stop caving,'' she said. ``I
said you're going to have to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams held to force the tiebreaker and won the match when
Hingis made the final mistake, hitting a backhand long.

 &HT;    Keeping rare chemistry tough for team on rise
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The game will be played today in front of a sold-out
Georgia Dome crowd of 70,000, with millions more watching on
national television. But the Falcons began building for this
showdown with the Vikings, building for this season, halfway
through 1997 _ when they were 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, even after winning just a single game in the first
half of the season, character was most apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at two years ago,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said. ``A
lot of the same guys still in this locker room were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in so many situations where, at that point, guys
tank,'' said Chandler, who has played for five other NFL teams.
``They're done. They want to get the season over with. And they
have a tendency to clash with guys who are true professionals, who
want to keep playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, two years ago, it never happened. There were very few,
if any, guys who stopped caring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won six of their last eight in the '97 season and
then went 16-2 last season before losing to the Broncos in Super
Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a cliche. But as the Falcons try to put together
consecutive winning seasons for the first time in their 34 years,
it bears repeating: Chemistry matters. The cohesion in the Falcons'
locker room is rare at the pro level, and it appears to be there
again for this season.
</P>
<P>
   A dining-hall scene in training camp illustrates the team's
chemistry. Sitting at a table were defensive linemen Travis Hall
and Ed Jasper, one a starter and one a reserve, one black and one
white. With them were star running back Jamal Anderson and a cast
of rookies and since-released players; several were white and
several were black.
</P>
<P>
   All were laughing as Anderson ripped them.
</P>
<P>
   Another example, from two nights ago: Dozens of players, coaches
and their wives _ white and black _ showed up at the home of Bob
Whitfield's mother for some of Eartha's chow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we don't have disagreements,'' defensive end
Chuck Smith said. ``But we're cool. Heck, I hang out with (kicker)
Morten Andersen. We live on the lake together'' at Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare in Atlanta, since I've been here,'' said Smith, who
joined the team in 1992. ``We always had guys who had underlying
beefs. It was pretty bad until (coach) Dan (Reeves) got here'' two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he said early is, `We're going to need everybody if
we're going to win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday nights throughout the season, players gather at a
different teammate's house to watch the NFL game on TV. Golf
outings include offensive and defensive players. Many players took
vacations together in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for the Colts 1993-96, cornerback Ray Buchanan has
a sense of how special the Falcons' atmosphere is. He and his wife,
Sheree, are close with Chandler and his wife, Diane. One family is
black, the other white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it the other way, where people break off into
groups,'' Buchanan said. ``Here, it's mostly a matter of ... good
people, and Dan not going out and picking up peanut-heads from
other teams who will cause distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves and his staff are not unique in trying to sign free
agents and draft players with solid character. But circumstances
have changed. With success comes expectations. For the Falcons,
nine starters can become unrestricted free agents after the season,
and two more can become restricted free agents. As some re-sign,
jealousies could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson having held out to get a five-year contract for
$32million, the Falcons' chemistry might be more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know about the attitude of your football team until
you face adversity,'' Reeves said. ``It's easy when you're
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler sees the possibility for problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the unspoken things have a chance to come out,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, it never happens, but yeah, there are different
pressures this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves concedes that any team's relationships always are
tenuous. At practice Friday, for example, he had to pull aside
Smith and tight end O.J. Santiago and mediate a disagreement
between two players whose lockers are next to each other. ``It's
been surprising to me,'' first-round draft choice Patrick Kerney
said. ``You do research on draft picks and free agents, but
everybody has got skeletons in their closet. They've been pretty
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's not arguing and he's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the exact definition of chemistry,'' he said.
``But a big part of it is liking each other. If you don't, it
probably ain't going to happen. It's a lot easier to play hard when
you care about guys who are going to be affected by how you play.

 &HT;    Martin tests Agassi in all-American final
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Agassi and Todd Martin do have this in common:
Their tennis careers were feared kaput two years ago, and today,
the 29-year-old Americans will play for the U.S. Open singles
title, both claiming they're playing the best tennis of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, a four-time champion in the Grand Slams, wasn't sharp
until the end Saturday but defeated Yevgeny Kafelnikov 1-6, 6-3,
6-3, 6-3 to claim the No. 1 ranking. Martin, advancing to his first
major final in five years, has rarely played better than his 6-4,
6-1, 6-2 rout of Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the tournament started, I said that if I was in the
finals, I would like to be playing Pete Sampras, assuming he's the
best playing on the other side of the draw,'' Agassi said. ``When
he pulled out, I still wanted to play the best player on the other
side and it's Todd Martin. He's done some incredible things.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt who the favorite will be.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi played in his first U.S. Open semifinal in 1988, the same
year Martin was in the semifinals of the U.S. Open boys division.
In 1986, when Agassi played his first U.S. Open, Martin didn't even
qualify for the national 16-and-unders.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin isn't surprised to reach his first Grand Slam final
since the 1994 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations and belief are two different things,'' Martin
said. ``I believed it from the beginning; I just didn't expect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A wrist injury in 1997 kept Martin off the tour for seven months
as his ranking fell out of the top 75. Now, he's headed for a
career-high No. 4 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, whose ranking bottomed out at No. 141 in 1997, is in his
third straight major final. Kafelnikov yanked Agassi around in the
first set while Agassi struggled with his serve in the wind, making
just 27 percent of first serves. But Agassi lost only nine points
on serve in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year belongs to him,'' Kafelnikov said of Agassi, ``no
question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first all-American final here since Sampras
defeated Michael Chang in 1996.

 &HT;    Serena Williams: A new power in tennis
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too much power, too much speed, too much serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, making the strong case that she's the world's
best hardcourt player if she can just get a hold of her nerves, had
a hard time swallowing her first U.S. Open championship Saturday
but finally washed it down in a 6-3, 7-6 (4) victory against world
No. 1 Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the first African-American woman to win the U.S.
Open since Althea Gibson in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``You totally prepare for this all your life, and I was always
the one to say, `I won the U.S. Open, I won the U.S. Open,'''
Williams said. ``With (sister) Venus, it was Wimbledon. With me, it
was always the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 26-3 hardcourt record this year is the best on the WTA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the start that Williams' first appearance in a
major final was hers to win or lose. She struck 36 winners to
Hingis' seven but also had 57 errors against Hingis' 24. It was
Williams' serve, and Hingis' lack thereof, that gave Williams her
biggest edge. Williams had 62 aces in the tournament, 40 more than
anyone else. In the first set, Williams faced break points six
times, at least one in every service game, but Hingis could get
only one of the bullets back in play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't face any break points in the second set until it
came time to win it, at 5-4. Having mismanaged two match points in
the previous game, Williams then sprayed four errors and lost her
service at love.
</P>
<P>
   Serving at 5-6, Williams missed another easy cross-court
backhand that would've forced the tiebreaker but still got there
after withstanding two set points and a 20-point game. Williams
turned the deciding game with a forehand return winner up the line
to lead 5-4. Hingis missed a top-spin lob, then hit a forehand long
for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you have to stop caving,'' Williams
said. ``You get so tired of having to go down because of one simple
problem. I told myself I have to perform.''

 &HT;    Giants extend Glavine slump
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Braves have lost only four times in their
past 21 games, and the latest was a 3-2 loss to the Giants on
Saturday, their third loss in Tom Glavine's past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine gave up six hits in the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back singles by Rich Aurilia and Scott Servais to start
the third inning gave the Giants a 1-0 lead when F.P. Santangelo
drove Aurilia in with a ground-out. Back-to-back singles by Aurilia
and Servais in the fourth inning stretched that lead to 3-0 after
Glavine had loaded the bases on a Barry Bonds double, an Ellis
Burks walk and a J.T. Snow single.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is not let it get me frustrated or dejected,''
Glavine said. ``I've got to keep working hard and know if I
continue to pitch like I did today we're going to win most of those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' double in the fourth was the 2,000th hit of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because it was off one of the best left-handers in
baseball,'' Bonds said. ``He's beat me up so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rallied to score a run on closer Robb Nen in the
ninth inning but watched a rusty Randall Simon strike out on three
pitches to end the game with Otis Nixon at second.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, 11-11, is back to .500 for the first time since Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were lulled to sleep offensively by left-hander Kirk
Rueter, who beat them for the second time in five weeks. Especially
telling was the sixth inning when the Braves had Gerald Williams at
third base with one out. Chipper Jones bounced a fielder's choice
grounder to the mound, and Rueter threw to third to get Williams
trying for home.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams was tagged out at home by Servais in a rundown,
Jones was caught leading off first base toward second, ending the
inning on a double play to keep Rueter's shutout intact through six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter broke it up with an RBI double to follow a Jose
Hernandez single in the seventh to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a bad day,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We got lucky last
night, they got lucky today. We gave it right back to them.

 &HT;    Military-style tear gas grenades focus of a still-secret
document
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a battle across two courtrooms Saturday to
keep from having to immediately make public a Texas Rangers' report
on the Branch Davidian evidence, state officials revealed what will
be a focus of the still-secret document: the military-style tear
gas grenades used by federal agents that were capable of starting a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came during a running legal battle Saturday in
which the 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin, in a rare Saturday
decision, ordered the report released just as state District Judge
Paul Davis had done Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to
have the report immediately made public, after Texas Department of
Public Safety officials decided to withhold it until noon Monday _
a delay they said would allow federal officials time to possibly
block its release.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, DPS Commission Chairman James B. Francis Jr.
had publicly discussed new disclosures in the ongoing investigation
and argued for a full public accounting, much to the chagrin of
federal officials who had turned over the Davidian evidence to the
Rangers years ago to complete a criminal investigation of the
51-day Davidian siege and fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   One thing missing from the inventory was any mention of the
``classified'' military secrets that DPS officials, in arguing why
the report should not be fully made public, had said repeatedly
Friday was included.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to a court filing Saturday was a DPS memo from Ranger
Sgt. Joey Gordon, the report's author, stating that a ``technical
data packet'' for the M651 E1 tear-gas cartridge was considered
``proprietary'' by the Pentagon and ``should not be released to the
public because it fully explains how to build this military
munition.''
</P>
<P>
   DPS Commission Chairman James B. Francis Jr. and other DPS
officials did not return phone calls Saturday night to explain what
the earlier-cited ``classified'' material included.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon Saturday, Texas Assistant Attorney General
Don Walker appealed Davis' order, arguing that the report should
remain under wraps for now because DPS lawyers had not yet
determined what could be made public and what could not. Statesman
attorney Randall D. Terrell countered that DPS had already decided
to make the report public, and that any delay would allow DPS ``to
delay the release of public information to suit its own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Within about three hours, on a day when courts are normally
closed, 3rd Court Chief Justice Marilyn Aboussie and Justices B.A.
Smith and Lee Yeakel agreed the report should be made public now.
</P>
<P>
   DPS immediately asked the Texas Supreme Court to block the
release. And the court _ also ruling on a day when it normally is
closed _ quickly did so, saying it would review the issues Monday
just hours before DPS' scheduled release.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Davis had ordered DPS to make public by 5 p.m.
Saturday whatever sections of the report it had deemed were public.
Nothing was.
</P>
<P>
   But in its court filings, the agency offered a first glimpse of
what will be in the report: The narrative plus 15 attachments that
include photographs, specifications, manuals and other information
about the M651 tear-gas grenades used by federal agents during the
51-day siege _ and during the final day when a fire erupted and
leveled the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The M651 E1 round is a military-issue grenade loaded with CS
riot gas, a type of tear gas. The 4.5-inch round, made to be fired
by a single-shot grenade launcher attached to an M-16 rifle, is a
green cartridge shell topped by a gray round with a red band, an
Army manual states.
</P>
<P>
   The military projectiles are slightly larger than those used by
many law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tear-gas projectiles used by civilian police forces, the
M651 can cause a fire, a fact mentioned several times in the U.S.
Army's manuals for urban warfare and the grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   A 1979 Army manual states: ``Effective in driving the enemy from
bunkers, buildings, subways or sewers using a tactical agent (CS),
the round has some incendiary characteristics. It could be a fire
hazard when used in buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI documents have stated the agents fired so-called ``Ferret''
rounds _ also noted as an attachment in the Ranger report inventory
_ into the Davidian compound during the final hours of the siege.
Those tear gas shells, which also spew CS gas, use a liquid form of
CS gas that reacts with a chemical to produce a nonburning cloud of
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Four federal agents were among the 88 adults and children who
died during the 51-day siege at the compound east of Waco, with
most of them killed in the April 19, 1993 fire. Sect leader David
Koresh, the target of a federal firearms investigation that
triggered the standoff, was among those who died.
</P>
<P>
   Other items to be in the Rangers' report: An Aug. 30 letter from
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston of Waco to U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno, presumably the one warning her ``individuals or
components within the Department of Justice'' may have long
withheld evidence from her and the public about the FBI's use of
pyrotechnic grenades on the day the Davidian compound burned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had repeatedly insisted previously that no
such fire-starting devices were used in the final assault.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's letter and other disclosures about pyrotechnic shell
casings found at the scene after the fire _ ones apparently
discussed in the Ranger report _ have prompted the House Committee
on Government Reform to launch a new investigation into the
Davidian case. Reno last week appointed former U.S. Sen. John
Danforth of Missouri to head an independent inquiry into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' report was forwarded Thursday to the House
committee, and DPS officials said in court Friday they also plan to
forward a copy to Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   The report, completed Thursday with 13 pages of narrative and
about 200 pages of attachments, was ordered in June by Francis
after he learned that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters may have been
fired by federal agents in the waning hours of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego military affairs writer James Crawley contributed to
this report.

 &HT;    Bradley campaign finds encouragement in Iowa
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ Amid the parched cornfields that have
devastated the farming economy here, presidential candidate Bill
Bradley is finding some fertile soil for his uphill battle against
Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley completed a three-day swing through Iowa on Saturday,
his 16th visit since announcing his campaign last year, and
everywhere he went he found Democrats eager to greet him and lend
their support.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were sometimes small. But many who came shared a
common refrain. After seven years in President Clinton's shadow,
Gore is too tainted by the Clinton scandals to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need some new leadership,'' said Mike Perry, a
social worker from Drakesville, Iowa, who came to meet Bradley at a
stop in Ottumwa, Iowa. ``The Clinton administration has some
negative baggage to carry. Mr. Clinton's vice president, no matter
who, is not going to be our next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's concerns about Gore, in different variations, greeted
Bradley everywhere he went, from the Mississippi town of Keokuk in
southeast Iowa, to the western reaches of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Iowa public television Saturday, Bradley
said he had no deliberate plan to tap into ``Clinton fatigue,'' a
trend some recent polls are finding in voter attitudes toward the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really understand what that word means,'' Bradley
said. ``I do think that many people in this country want a fresh
start. I do think that more people are looking to the future and
who's got a program for the future. So there is no calculation to
take advantage of how the people may or may not feel about
President Clinton. This is an attempt to turn the page and move on
to a new time in our politics and to a new presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley may be building a loose coalition of disaffected
Democrats, it remains to be seen how well he will do in peeling
away those voters who are content with the Clinton presidency and
see Gore as the appointed heir.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that he needs to do ``better than expected'' in the
Iowa caucuses on Jan. 31 in order to build some momentum heading
into the New Hampshire primary a week later. A recent poll showed
Bradley about even with Gore in New Hampshire, but Bradley is less
well known in Iowa and Gore has done a better job lining up the
Democratic establishment here.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a popular figure in Iowa and a former
presidential candidate himself, endorsed Gore last week and has
already campaigned for Gore at several high-profile events,
including a party fund-raiser Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has sought to counter the advantage by portraying
himself as the underdog against a better-financed and better-
connected rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up against establishment power,'' Bradley said. ``I'm up
against resources, and all I have is reaching out to people.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Johnie Hammond, a Democrat, said she was initially
concerned about Gore's electability, and considered Bradley
carefully. But said she believed Gore's problems would fade. But
Bradley is also picking up some support from Iowa Democrats who
said they believe that Gore has steered the party too far to the
middle. These voters said they liked Bradley's positions on gun
control and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley favors national licensing of all handguns and supports
public financing for congressional elections to take ``special
interest money'' out of politics. Throughout his stops in Iowa,
Bradley repeatedly held up those positions as a way to contrast
himself with the vice president, who favors new gun control
legislation and more limited campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, they are similar, but Bradley seems open to new
ideas,'' said Phil Zaring, a retired college professor at Iowa
State. ``I think Gore is moving too close to the center of the
party.

METS HAVEN'T LET VALENTINE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The questions didn't have much pace. They were
lobs, really, so Bobby Valentine could reflexively return them
without diverting his gaze from the television mounted on the wall
in the manager's office in the visiting clubhouse at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Some two hours before Friday's game between Valentine's Mets and
the Dodgers, a herd of reporters shuffled into Valentine's office
to find the former Dodger and Angel player sitting with Dodgers
executive Tom Lasorda, both entranced by an unfolding drama.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't watching an L.A. car chase, though regular
television programming had been interrupted earlier in the day to
show one. What Lasorda and his protege were watching was the New
York version of a spin-out and crash ending.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, it wasn't a replay of the Mets' 1998 finish.
</P>
<P>
   This was live theater, Venus Williams frittering away a 3-2 lead
in the decisive third set of her U.S. Open semifinal against
Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   If Valentine simply had to watch, well, managers these days are
nothing if not masochistic. Look what Terry Collins kept going back
to every day for two solid months in Anaheim before finally
resigning earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mets moved into position for their first postseason
berth of the darkening decade, Valentine was a beleaguered manager
looking to make some kind of statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a $70 million payroll and 27 wins in their first 55
games, not exactly a resonant return on the dollar. When three of
his assistant coaches were axed the first Saturday in June,
Valentine was astute enough to know the bloody blade would
henceforth be pointed at him.
</P>
<P>
   He won himself a reprieve by stepping close enough to the cold,
steel tip to be grazed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am not doing my job as good as I should be,''
Valentine volunteered. He then vowed to use the next 55 games as a
self-evaluation period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put the rope around his own neck,'' said Mets pitcher Orel
Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Californians inured to the impertinence of their pro
athletes may be surprised to hear Valentine's ballplayers didn't
hurry to hang him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, going into Saturday's game against the Dodgers the Mets
were 59-28 since Valentine put his future on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what inspired the turnaround,'' Valentine said,
sounding oh-so-bored to be asked. ``I don't remember what I said
yesterday, (much less) on June 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Further efforts to jog his memory produced this: ``I thought we
were a good team from the first day of the season. I think we're a
better one now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have so many weapons, it doesn't take an arrogant
streak the size of Manhattan's (or Richard Williams') to suggest
the World Series could be an All-in-the-New-York-family affair.
</P>
<P>
   The defending world champion Yankees sit atop the AL East.
Meantime, the Mets have arguably the best defense in the league.
They've allowed just 18 unearned runs (the Dodgers, by comparison,
have yielded 54).
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' lineup is harder for opposing managers to solve than
The New York Times puzzle, given the first seven batters (and eight
on the roster) are hitting over .300. Add to the mix the speed of
Roger Cedeno and relic Rickey Henderson and a starting rotation
that goes six deep, and the Mets' three-game cushion over
Cincinnati in the National League wild-card race seemed on Saturday
very firm indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, it would appear, is on the verge of shedding his
label as the best manager never to have led a team to the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's no unrestrained joy in Metsville. To the contrary,
ask Valentine anything about the playoffs and his expression grows
as taut as a hamstring on the verge of snapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postseason is not an inevitable situation on this team,''
he said, flinching.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later he would wince as he watched a U.S. Open
trainer tend to Williams' cramping thigh muscles shortly before
Hingis closed out the match.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Valentine could feel Williams' pain, having
watched his own team knot up horribly at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Mets took a one-game lead in the NL wild-card race
into the final week and squandered it. They lost their final five
games _ two to Montreal and three at Atlanta _ by a combined score
of 25-10.
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams' double-fault-itis in the final four games Friday,
the Mets' collapse was a breathtaking implosion. Consider: They
stranded 32 runners over the final three days.
</P>
<P>
   So far the 1999 Mets haven't left Valentine stranded. He called
a suicide squeeze play and his Mets are running for home. In 19
games, we'll know whether or not they are safe. &QL;

<P>
   BUHLER, Kan. _ A 4 1/2-acre field two miles east of here _ even
in the sunshine of hot September afternoon _ can be eerie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cornfield planted for silage, which, in this age of
hybrids, still grows even higher than an elephant's eye. But it's
more _ a prime example of what's becoming a popular attraction from
Washington to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin to California.
</P>
<P>
   What's on Leon and Ruth Gaeddert's farm is a corn maze.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow passages lead through the 10-foot-high khaki-colored
stalks. Some lead to other paths, some to frustrating dead ends. To
walk is to puzzle. There are few straight lines. The corn blocks
out everything, even part of the blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow what was just a humdrum patch of land alters itself into
a labyrinth, a confining mesh, an impenetrable web. Those ears are
more than just corn on the cob. They're Cary Grant huddled between
the corn stalks in ``North by Northwest.'' They're James Earl Jones
disappearing amid the ripening stalks of corn in ``Field of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And mazes? Who can forget Jack Nicholson lost among the
intricate evergreen hedges in ``The Shining''?
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Gaeddert farm, seeds were planted, a plan was drawn,
markers were laid out, and then Ruth's trusty 54-inch, zero-radius
riding mower created what can not only be a little eerie in the
afternoon but downright spooky as darkness falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come with flashlights,'' she said. ``Now that's
something to see, lights bobbing around in the corn. People love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far 500 to 600 people have plunked down five bucks ($3 for
youngsters) to walk the mile or so of paths that wind through the
maze. And 1,000 to 1,500 more visitors are expected this week with
the Kansas State Fair running in nearby Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get lost in there,'' said Sandra Kopaev of Wichita,
who walked the maze with her 7-year-old daughter, Maria, and a
friend, Carol Truex. ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth said corn-maze enthusiasts are diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had big groups,'' she said. ``We've had people in
wheelchairs. We've had exchange students. Everybody seems to have
just the best time. You know, it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   That difference, said Andrea Hughes, who helped create the 1998
Wisconsin Sesquicentennial Corn Maze that drew 50,000 visitors, is
that such a simple attraction stands in stark contrast to much of
today's high-tech tourist entertainment _ the zooming roller
coasters, virtual-reality video stations and what's usually passive
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corn maze is something most people have no prior experience
with,'' said Hughes. ``It's simple. It's low-tech. It's out in the
open. And it's a puzzle the whole family can work on together to
solve. Who's to say which way to go _ this way or that? The
parents? The kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who runs Event Management Co. of Madison, Wis., said she
is already getting reservations for a seminar Feb. 5-6 in Madison
that will focus not only on creating a corn maze but increasing
attendance and profits. The seminar price isn't cheap _ $325 a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``With commodity prices and the way we're losing farmers, the
agricultural community is looking for any way to survive,'' Hughes
said. ``What we call agritourism is one way. And people love mazes.
They're coast to coast anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Including two in Kansas. The other one, designed by artist Stan
Herd, whose work has appeared on television and in magazines,
opened this summer on the Jack and Karen Pendleton farm east of
Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The Herd/Pendleton maze, on a 5-acre plot, took the form of a
turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth said her family, unaware of the Lawrence area maze until
recently, chose Noah's Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Gaeddert Martisko, one of the Gaedderts' daughters, had
visited Eden Prairie, Minn., last year where, of all things, there
was a corn maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' said Tonya. ``And I got to thinking about
home. We grow corn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The Gaedderts are big farmers _ cattle, corn and
soybeans. Their farm sits on the western edge of the Equus Beds, a
huge aquifer that allows irrigation in this part of Kansas. Plant
it here and it will grow.
</P>
<P>
   But more than being big farmers, the Gaedderts haven't stood pat
as livestock and grain prices tanked over the past few years. If
you can grow feed corn, said Ruth, you can surely grow sweet corn,
that delicacy a lot of people consider one of the best parts of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gaedderts, sweet corn is their ``value-added'' crop,
meaning they get their price plus the middleman's, too. Or $2.50
for a dozen ears at the farm, $3.50 in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a premium product,'' said Ruth. ``That's what we
sell. It's picked the day you buy it. You know what you're getting
and who you're getting it from.''
</P>
<P>
   With Leon working with his brother John and his family, Gaeddert
Farms has eschewed the traditional selling out of the back of a
pickup or one of those weathered roadside stands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at seven off-farm locations, people in south-central
Kansas have only to look for the neat kiosks with big yellow and
green canopies that declare ``Gaeddert Farms Sweet Corn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have changed,'' said Ruth. ``They like things to look
nice. They see our stands and know what they'll be buying isn't
some corn that who knows is how fresh and maybe was shipped in from
out of state days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So the corn maze was a small leap for the Gaedderts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it'd be fun,'' said Tonya.
</P>
<P>
   Plus it would get their name out and sell some sweet corn.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya designed the maze so that keel of the ark parallels the
east side of the Gaeddert driveway. The sails and the wind are on
the east. Corn has even been used to replicate ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tricky,'' said Tonya. ``The problem with making a corn
maze is that you only get one chance. You plant the whole field to
corn. But then when you cut in your design, you better not get it
wrong or you'll ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth said cutting the paths was a nervous time, especially this
year as the corn took hold and grew rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used silage corn,'' she said. ``That grows real nice and
tall. Not like feed corn. But it grew so fast. When we started
laying out the design it was only knee high. By the time we were
finished, it was up to your waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the paths were made, a garden tractor with a disc was used
to smooth them. Cut-out animals representing what Noah took aboard
the ark were placed to lead visitors in, a concession stand was
installed, and then the Gaedderts watched the corn grow.
</P>
<P>
   The maze opened in late August. Visitors started showing up from
the first. It will remain open until next Sunday. Then it will be
cut for silage, stored or sold.
</P>
<P>
   And next year?
</P>
<P>
   Tonya and Ruth said there will be another maze, maybe even
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about the design yet,'' said Ruth. ``That's
a surprise.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

KC-FILMED `RIDE WITH THE DEVIL' GARNERS PRAISE IN NORTH AMERICAN
DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BUTLER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Wowing its audience with a heady blend of bloody
action and heartfelt humanism, the Kansas City-filmed ``Ride With
the Devil'' made its North American debut Friday at the Toronto
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Sun critic Bruce Kirkland called it ``the fest's most
powerful historical drama...an evocative tale of murder, revenge,
racial confusion, love and renewal. Jewel is a revelation. Tobey
Maguire is a rising star.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing director Ang Lee's Civil War drama to an audience
of nearly 1,600, festival director Piers Handling described
``Devil'' as ``a quiet, delicate film about how once you release
violence, how difficult it is to then escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that Lee, a native of Taiwan, has created such an
``extraordinary film'' on such a quintessentially American topic
was, Handling said, ``just terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the gala screening in Roy Thompson Hall, Lee,
writer-producer James Schamus and stars Maguire, Jewel, Skeet
Ulrich and Jeffrey Wright took their bows from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The attention was largely on Jewel, the 24-year-old pop singing
star who makes her acting debut in the film. Toronto newspapers
published color photos of Jewel taken at the gala _ a testament to
her immense popularity.
</P>
<P>
   A jet-lagged Lee, Schamus and Maguire arrived in Toronto early
Friday evening from Deauville, France, where on Thursday ``Devil''
opened that city's annual Festival of American Cinema and received
a standing ovation from an audience that included Robin Williams,
Lauren Bacall and Kirk Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French audience absolutely loved it,'' said Vicky Henley
of the Kansas Film Commission, who with Kansas City Film Projects
director Patti Watkins attended both festivals. ``They were very
responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real test of the film is at Toronto, said Steven Flynn,
vice president for marketing of USA Films, which will open
``Devil'' on American screens Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto has the world's pre-eminent festival, in my opinion,
because by debuting a film here you get instant international and
domestic press exposure, and you get a good feel not only for
critical reaction but for how the moviegoing public will respond to
your picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto audiences _ which this year will see 319 films from 52
countries in just 10 days _ are valued by film distributors as
representing a blend of mainstream and art-house sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the town seems to go movie-crazy for the festival.
Department- store window displays often are movie-themed, and
screening tickets are so valued that this year a public lottery was
initiated to ensure an equitable distribution: In the past, most
tickets went to those who spent all night on a sidewalk outside the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   Torontonians are so accustomed to movies being made under their
noses that they no longer react to lights and cameras in the
streets. But during the festival everyone seems to go star-crazy.
It's easy to get the bug _ during just 10 minutes on Friday evening
a gawker in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel could claim
celebrity sightings of actors William H. Macy, Steve Zahn, Illeana
Douglas, Bill Pullman, Mary Louise Parker and Kansas City native
Chris Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The response of Toronto filmgoers to ``Ride With the Devil,''
which was shot in the Kansas City area in the spring and early
summer of last year, was easy enough to gauge. Audience members
could be seen flinching in some of the film's more violent moments,
and in one scene depicting the amputation of a character's arm,
many turned their heads away.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Devil'' _ which is based on Missouri writer Daniel
Woodrell's Woe to Live On _ offered an unblinking glimpse of the
horrors of the Kansas-Missouri border war, it also buoyed the
viewers' emotions with humor.
</P>
<P>
   In depicting the growing friendship between Maguire's Jake
Roedel, a Huckleberry Finn-type innocent caught up in the war's
madness, and Wright's Daniel Holt, a former slave riding with
Confederate guerrillas, the film develops warmth and affection. And
moviegoers responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it,'' a beaming Schamus said after the screening.
``What I've found is that if you get the film's humor, you get what
the film's about. It may be set in the Civil War, but basically
it's a relationship movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City audiences will find the film steeped in local
history and peppered with references to familiar places and events.
</P>
<P>
   They will also see familiar faces of Kansas City actors in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins and Henley, who work to attract film production to the
Kansas City region, said ``Devil'' made their jobs easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to New York in November to try to sell Kansas
locations to filmmakers, I'll be able to tell them to take a look
at the new Ang Lee movie. That has a cachet that will get their
attention,'' said Henley.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins described the film's location footage _ it was shot on
both sides of the state line _ as ``absolutely beautiful. It really
showcases our landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake, they say, are millions in potential earnings from
movie production. Watkins' office studied how the $35 million
budget of ``Ride With the Devil'' was spent and determined that $21
million remained in Kansas City to pay local workers and to
purchase goods and services.

JAKARTA CONCEDES A LOSS OF CONTROL IN EAST TIMOR  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with Clinton's remarks, made on Sunday)   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Guarded by a tight cordon of security, the
streets of East Timor's capital shattered and still smoking around
him, the chief of Indonesia's armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, conceded
Saturday that he had lost control of elements of his military.
</P>
<P>
   On a tense and eerie visit to this seaside town with a
high-level U.N. delegation, Wiranto said he was becoming more open
to help from foreign troops, but added that the time was still not
right.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was still struggling to persuade his men on the
ground to crack down on East Timorese militias, to which he said
they felt an emotional allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not reject the offer of an accelerated deployment of an
international peacekeeping force at all,'' he said. ``The offer of
an international peacekeeping force must be considered as an option
by the Indonesian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his statement a second time, he changed his reference
from ``peacekeeping force,'' to ``security cooperation,'' prompting
a United Nations official to describe his words as ``Delphic.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the statement on East Timor was unclear.
International pressure for peacekeepers to deploy in East Timor has
mounted in recent days as militias aligned with Wiranto's forces
ransacked the island territory, terrorizing and killing hundreds of
inhabitants and driving tens of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, said Saturday that he
hoped for an official go-ahead on Sunday for deployment of an
international force.
</P>
<P>
   (On Sunday, President Clinton said that the United States might
provide an international force with logistical support that ``might
require our presence in a limited way,'' but _ in keeping with his
other statements on the issue _ left open the question of whether
any Americans troops would enter East Timor.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meeting reporters in New Zealand, after the United
States and then Britain suspended arms sales to Indonesia, was
asked about a timetable for an Indonesian agreement to a
peacekeeping force. He replied: ``Well, I think you'll see a
development here in the next couple of days. I think something will
happen. I'd be surprised if it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's inhabitants voted on Aug. 30 for independence from
Indonesia, which invaded and annexed the territory after Portugal
abandoned its colony in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As the Timor Sea sparkled in the sunlight, Dili was silent and
nearly deserted today. Large groups of refugees sat at roadsides,
surrounded by piles of belongings and staring dully at the convoy
of the five-member delegation from the U.N. Security Council.
Behind them, shattered buildings, looted and roofless, still
smoldered and smoked.
</P>
<P>
   But with hundreds of armed soldiers lining the delegation's
route, Dili was calm for the first time since the vote. ``A
Potemkin operation,'' said Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British
representative at the United Nations. ``But they can't cover up
what happened in Dili. The place has been trashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The message may not have been the one intended by the Indonesian
authorities. ``It illustrates that you can never know whether these
people are going to switch it on or switch it off,'' Sir Jeremy
said, referring to the violence.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the U.N. compound, with its 1,000 refugees and its
exhausted staff, was reported to be a place of terror, with militia
gunshots, looting and threats unrestrained _ and even aided _ by
uniformed soldiers. Saturday, it appeard to be one of the most
secure places on earth, ringed by ranks of alert, all-business
soldiers with automatic rifles at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day we can see the sky _ yesterday, it was
dark with smoke,'' said Nick Birnback, one of 80 U.N. workers who
insisted on remaining here to protect the refugees when the bulk of
the staff was forced to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, there was not a gunshot to be heard in this largely
abandoned town, which one diplomat compared to Phnom Penh in
Cambodia after it was emptied of its residents by the Khmer Rouge
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few thin columns of gray smoke rose into the blue sky
from burning buildings here.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the efforts made to sanitize the city and despite
the blithe and smiling officers who escorted the delegation,
Wiranto voiced something approaching angst. His orders to halt the
violence and restore calm had not yet been obeyed, he implied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be something which has caused there to be such big
problems,'' he said, ``whether it was caused by a technical or
psychological problem, or perhaps by a false procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have checked in the field, and I concluded that the main
problem is a psychological constraint among our personnel on the
ground _ those who have been living with the East Timorese for so
long,'' he said. ``For more than 20 years, our personnel have been
working hand in hand with the people to develop East Timor. I can
understand that it is very hard for them to shoot their own people,
who have been regarded as their brothers, and who are not really
criminals. And they defend their basic principles emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would take time and delicacy to pull his soldiers
into line, and he asked the outside world for understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his statement about peacekeepers reflected a change in
his policy, Wiranto said, ``Yes, yes. It's very complicated, not
only in the region. It's an international problem, and other
countries have their opinions on East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the delegation accepted Wiranto's explanation
for the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to think that they are having major
difficulties controlling the situation,'' said an official
traveling with the delegation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Look at today and look at election day when everything was
brought under control with the snap of a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a coordinated and planned campaign _ evacuating
towns, assassinating moderate leaders, moving huge numbers of
people into forced exile _ that it could only have come from the
top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since invading East Timor in 1975, the Indonesian military has
waged an unending war against separatist guerrillas and forged
close links with those East Timorese who want to be part of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a remote and small province of Indonesia with
just 800,000 inhabitants, East Timor holds a crucial place in the
history and ethos of the country's military. This territory is
where most senior officers have earned their stripes, where many
have put down roots and grown wealthy, and where thousands of their
comrades have died.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has played a key role in Indonesia _ the
world's fourth largest country _ since it won independence from the
Dutch in 1945, also apparently fears that losing East Timor could
lead to the loss of other rebellious and remote regions.
</P>
<P>
   When President B.J. Habibie declared in January that East Timor
could go free if it rejected his offer of an autonomous status
within Indonesia, the military responded by recruiting and arming
irregular militias in a clear attempt to undercut the referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   That policy, which Wiranto may have fostered or tolerated at the
wishes of officers dedicated to maintaining their hold on East
Timor, appears in recent weeks to have slipped beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Alphons Hamer, a Dutch member of the U.N. delegation, said
Habibie told the envoys when they were in Jakarta that a principal
reason for resisting peacekeeping forces was the damage their
introduction would do to the reputation of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a military man, it must be worrying, to say the least, to
see your orders not going down and information not reaching up,''
Hamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, four days after the military reacted to the
international outcry by declaring martial law in East Timor,
Wiranto's new commander here, Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, indicated
that progress in restoring control was slow.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the introduction of five battalions of fresh troops,
he said, just 27 weapons had been confiscated from the militias
that have taken over much of the province.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing in the military headquarters _ one of the few
substantial buildings in Dili not to have been vandalized _ Sir
Jeremy pressed Kiki forcefully to protect the U.N. headquarters
here.
</P>
<P>
   If not, he said, using the initials for the Indonesian military,
``you must realize that TNI will have to carry the responsibility
for that failure,'' adding, ``The Security Council mission is
therefore asking you, commander, to make absolutely sure that
security for Unamet is comprehensive and continuous.'' Unamet is
the acronym for the U.N. mission here.
</P>
<P>
   The general replied, ``I fully realize what you are saying, and
I am willing to do all I can to secure Unamet.''
