<HEADLINE> Park Service Backs Gettysburg Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed visitors center at the Gettysburg  
battlefield is still drawing complaints of commercialism despite 
the National Park Service's efforts to scale back the project. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to public criticism, the agency already struck a  
big-screen IMAX theater from its plans and reduced the size of a 
restaurant and the number of retail shops at the Civil War site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, for us, the final straw when the agency charged with  
protecting sacred ground allows the money lenders in the temple, or 
in a more modern context, a fast-food restaurant in the middle of a 
cemetery,'' said Walter Powell, president of the Gettysburg 
Battlefield Preservation Association. 
</P>
<P>
	At a House Commerce parks subcommittee hearing Thursday, Powell  
called the proposed visitors center and retail complex ``a mall on 
the battlefield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service defended the $40 million, privately  
funded proposal as a good way to complete needed improvements 
without public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me if we can protect Gettysburg park without  
taxpayers' money, the $40 million would be available for other 
uses,'' Deputy Director Denis P. Galvin testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the agency had a 10-year wish list of about $1  
billion in projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gettysburg National Military Park is the site of the  
three-day Battle of Gettysburg July 1-3, 1863, and Abraham 
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on Nov. 19 of that year. It draws 
nearly 2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some preservationists and community groups complained that the  
Park Service failed to consider other alternatives for replacing 
existing facilities that agency officials consider cramped and 
``below atrocious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin said the agency held 50 public meetings, looked through  
4,600 public comments and scaled down the proposal in response to 
concerns raised by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMAX theater was replaced by a traditional-format theater  
that could show a film on the Civil War, while the size of the 
planned cafeteria was cut in half. The visitors' center would have 
stores, but not as many as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground could be broken as early as 2001 if the financing comes  
through. Under the proposal, private developer Robert Kinsley would 
build and operate the center under the direction of the Park 
Service and would collect money for a period of years before giving 
the land and the center to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Park Service has been criticized for allowing a  
private developer to construct a 310-foot tower overlooking the 
battlegrounds and for swapping three acres of land near a railroad 
cut close to town for 46 acres of developed land owned by 
Gettysburg College. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that land-swap deal in 1990 effectively gave away a  
portion of the battlefield for less historic land. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you are looking at is the steady erosion of the park,''  
said Franklin R. Silbey, a former congressional aide who had 
organized hearings on the land swap. ``What will they come up with 
next, tasteful hot dog stands on the Arizona'' battleship memorial? 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget request includes $5.7  
million for buying the tower property and nearby lands. The tower, 
built in 1972, would be torn down.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco -- surprise! -- ranked as the most  
wired city in America for the second year in a row, according to a 
recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, Texas, and Seattle netted the No. 2 and 3 spots,  
respectively, indicating Silicon Valley may be starting to lose its 
dominance as newly wired cities start to flex their technological 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, for instance, has more people logging onto the Internet  
from home than any other city. And San Jose, Calif., is No. 1 for 
people logging on from work. 
</P>
<P>
	``People assume the Internet is where people are putting  
together computers,'' said Ben Greenman, executive editor of Yahoo! 
Internet Life, which conducted the survey. ``But as time goes on, 
it will be seen as a medium. The amount of Internet business can't 
be contained. It's everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second year the magazine has conducted the survey,  
which appears in the March issue. The magazine goes on sale 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities were rated on population (over 1 million), percentage of  
adults logging on at home and work, the number of commercial 
domains, the number of computers connected to the Internet, the 
number of sites dedicated to the town and quality of the sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin leads in home use of the Internet with 32.4 percent of  
adults logging on from home. San Jose follows with 25.1 percent, 
followed by Denver, Nashville, Tenn., Oakland, Calif., and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose leads in the use of the Internet at work, with 37.9  
percent. Washington is next with 31.4 percent, followed in order by 
Austin, Oakland and San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Sent to White House Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of an e-mail that White House Chief of Staff John Podesta  
sent to staff on behalf of President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank you personally for all you are doing for this  
administration and our nation. Working at the White House is a 
great privilege, but I know it is also often a burden on you, and 
on the family and friends to whom you turn for support. That has 
meant long days, late nights, and many weekends here -- and I want 
you to know how grateful I am. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year has been especially difficult for you. I know  
that my actions and the events they triggered have made your work 
even harder. For that, I am profoundly sorry. In all this, under 
the most extraordinary of circumstances, you never lost sight of 
your first obligation -- to serve the people of our nation. For 
that, I am profoundly grateful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The remaining years of this administration can and must be a  
time of great achievement for our nation. I know you share my pride 
in what we have accomplished already to strengthen America at home 
and abroad, including over the past year, when we created the first 
surplus in three decades and continued dramatic advances in 
education and other vital areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, together, we have much more to do to meet our obligations  
to future generations. We have set our goals before the American 
people -- from saving Social Security and Medicare, to strengthening 
education and health care, to advancing peace and security around 
the world -- and I know you share my determination to act on those 
priorities. Today, the nation we love is strong and confident. In 
the months to come, we can move beyond the divisions of the past 
year to build a nation that is stronger and more united as it 
enters the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dedication and loyalty have meant more to me than you can  
ever know. The best way I can repay you is to redouble my own 
efforts on behalf of the ideals we share, and to make the most of 
every day we are here. I thank you again for everything you are 
doing -- and I ask you to keep working hard in the months ahead. 
Together, we can achieve great things for the American people.

<HEADLINE> Weary Nation Welcomes the End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They were united, if only in their weariness.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans universally welcomed an end to the multimillion-dollar  
saga that has consumed their political system for more than a year, 
with many agreeing that Bill Clinton's place in history was ruined 
or at least seriously tarnished. But the issue that split them in 
the first place -- should he have been impeached? -- still made for a 
divided, annoyed public. 
</P>
<P>
	``These Republicans have made a Democrat out of me,'' said Gil  
Branton, 76, a retired court reporter from Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, in dozens of interviews, Americans sounded a  
common theme of relief at the impeachment trial's end. They lashed 
out at the president. At Congress. At the media, which they said 
aggravated the situation. They expressed disbelief at the high 
cost, fiscal and social, that grew out of a fiftysomething man's 
fling with a twentysomething intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Antonio Gregorio of Newark, N.J., said  
during a break in the action at Daytona International Speedway. 
``How long has it taken? A year? It should have taken only a 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some, Clinton's acquittal on perjury and obstruction of  
justice charges was the correct and welcome outcome. Others 
lamented a nation and a process that, they said, could officially 
excuse a leader's lying and immoral conduct. Many seemed willing to 
separate Bill Clinton from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a president, I have no complaints,'' said Michelle Moore, a  
26-year-old consultant working in Newark. ``As a man, I don't think 
he's all of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this was no moon landing or O.J. Simpson verdict. Few seemed  
glued to their televisions. In fact, few seemed to care much at 
all. They knew it was going to be over and they knew how it was 
going to turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kangas, 38, a Lansing, Mich., mail carrier, was one of  
dozens relieved the trial was over. He said it could have been 
avoided entirely with a strategic answer at a crucial time. ``He 
should have said, `As a gentleman, I am not even going to answer 
that question,''' Kangas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole thing even divided couples. Jim and Judy Morris of  
Annapolis, Md., offered differing takes as they ate sandwiches 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did was wrong, but it wasn't impeachable,'' Morris  
said. Countered his wife: ``I think he's a liar and he should be 
removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the verdict gave Americans tired of the  
Clinton-Congress tennis match time to reflect on all the twists and 
turns the story took during the year. And reflect they did. 
</P>
<P>
	On journalism's role: ``If I had a remote control for life, I'd  
turn off the media forever,'' said Patty Melanson, 40, of 
Pawtucket, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	On the explicit material that aired on the news during the past  
year: ``I had to explain a lot of things that I didn't think I'd 
have to explain so soon,'' said Mary Riitano, an office manager in 
Helena, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	On truth: ``They need to do something to punish this man. Lying  
is not right,'' said Angie Harr, 35, a sales executive from Omaha, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	On where America is: ``We've come a long way from George  
Washington,'' said Anthony Alberigi, 40, a mall employee in 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	On privacy: ``I just pray that no one will start looking in my  
closet. Politicians should always have a private life,'' said Dan 
Orey, 57, of Brandon, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	On the post-Lewinsky Clinton: ``This has tarnished the  
president's place in history,'' said Tom Shafer of Springfield, 
Ill. ``His legacy is going to have a negative asterisk attached to 
it forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And amid all the rumination, Brian Girard, 8, a third-grader at  
Beechwood Knoll Elementary School in Boston, offered a bit of 
wishful thinking about what really happened between the president 
and the intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he probably kissed that woman,'' Brian concluded,  
``and that's about it.''

<HEADLINE> NFL: Redskins Owners Can't Run Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The NFL has declared that the people who own  
the Washington Redskins cannot run the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	That is commissioner Paul Tagliabue's way of resolving a  
bitterly chaotic situation until the league's owners approve the 
sale of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	So an air of normalcy to returned Redskin Park on Friday, the  
first day of the free agent signing period and one day after 
Tagliabue gave president John Kent Cooke, who lost a bidding war to 
buy the team, ``full authority'' to run it. 
</P>
<P>
	With the team's owners -- the trustees of the estate of the late  
Jack Kent Cooke -- no longer able to call the shots, the younger 
Cooke and general manager Charley Casserly welcomed free agent 
offensive lineman Orlando Brown, who spent the last three seasons 
in Baltimore and had expected to be the Ravens' designated 
franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm strictly a right tackle,'' said Brown, who would displace  
Shar Pourdanesh at that position. ``I like to beat guys up. That's 
the brute side. The left side is speed and finesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was also scheduled to visit the New York Jets.  
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins top free agent, quarterback Trent Green, will also  
be traveling. Green's agent, Jim Steiner, said his phone was 
ringing ``fast and furiously'' this morning. He said three teams 
expressed serious interest in the quarterback, and he's already 
scheduled a trip to St. Louis for Green on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That journey could have been avoided had the Redskins been able  
to sign Green before Friday, but Cooke and Casserly claim their 
hands were tied at the negotiating table by the trustees -- a claim 
supported by Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees, through lawyers Richard Cass and James Schwab,  
flatly deny those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way did the trustees prevent the Washington Redskins  
from signing any player to a contract,'' the lawyers said in a 
statement. ``Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's intervention was the climax of a power struggle that  
had been brewing since the trustees, acting under the direction of 
Jack Kent Cooke's will, agreed Jan. 10 to sale the Redskins to a 
group headed by Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder for a record $800 
million. John Kent Cooke finished well behind in the bidding in a 
failed effort to keep the team in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there have been behind the scenes allegations that  
John Kent Cooke has played the role of sore loser and has refused 
to cooperate with the trustees. He's been buoyed by remarks from 
NFL owners, some of whom have said they would prefer that the 
younger Cooke purchase the team. The trustees claim Cooke did not 
keep them up-to-date on the details of contract negotiations with 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, some in the Cooke camp say that the trustees, abiding  
by the sale contract, have allowed the Milstein-Snyder group to 
voice opinions regarding team decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	This rankled the NFL, which has ``the right to determine who the  
owners are,'' according to Tagliabue. To break the stalemate, and 
to keep the Redskins from getting burned in free agency, Tagliabue 
came down on the side of Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of the owners must approve the sale of the team,  
and that won't happen until mid-March at the earliest. Milstein met 
with Tagliabue for about an hour Thursday, but left with no clear 
indication from the commissioner regarding the status of the 
approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's move opens the question as to whether the trustees,  
as owners of the team, could fire Cooke or take any other similar 
action that owners normally have the right to take. An NFL 
spokesman declined to elaborate on Tagliabue's statement Friday, 
saying, ``It speaks for itself.'' Cooke, Milstein and Snyder 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources told The AP that the league has yet to find  
anything wrong with the Milstein-Snyder bid. If the owners rejects 
it, the NFL could find itself back in court, where it historically 
has not fared well.

<HEADLINE> Woman Convicted of Killing Surgeon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A former nurse who claimed her plastic  
surgeon failed to warn her that her breast implants might leak has 
been convicted of killing him at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Ramirez was found guilty of first-degree murder Thursday  
in the death of Michael Tavis, 53, who performed breast implant 
surgery on her following a mastectomy. The Petaluma doctor was shot 
four times in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also convicted of attempted murder for critically  
wounding Tavis' office manager, Kay Carter, 60, who has permanent 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ramirez, a former nurse at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center  
in Santa Rosa, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without 
parole, with a sanity hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Ms. Ramirez 
had entered pleas of innocent and innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ramirez, 46, had sued Tavis, claiming he failed to warn her  
about the potential for leaking implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tavis had been sued a dozen times in Sonoma County, mostly in  
medical malpractice complaints. At the time of his death, he also 
was named in two accusations of negligence and incompetence before 
the state Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Ramirez was found with two guns, including  
the murder weapon, when she was discovered four days after the 
killing in a San Francisco hotel room, unconscious in a diabetic 
coma.

<HEADLINE> Byrd, Spence Lead Australia Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Greg Norman avoided missing the cut  
for the second straight week, rebounding with a 5-under-par 68 on 
Friday to get within range of Craig Spence and American Robin Byrd 
in the Australian Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence, who opened with a 64, shot 73 on the Huntingdale course  
to share the lead with Byrd (70) at 9-under 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Two strokes back were 1990 PGA champion Wayne Grady, Greg Turner  
and Craig Parry. Turner needs to finish in the top three this week 
to qualify for the Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, still making his way back from shoulder surgery that  
kept out for seven months last year, was at 142. He missed the cut 
last week in his own Greg Norman International, the first time he 
failed to advance to weekend play in an Australian event since the 
1976 Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to get out there and knuckle down and focus on what I  
have to do, but sometimes it's not that easy,'' said Norman, 
seeking his sixth title in the tournament. ``I've got a base and 
I'm not very far away. If I can shot another 68 tomorrow it will be 
just the tonic I need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at 142 was Gary Player, the 63-year-old winner of nine  
major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Grady, who hasn't won since the 1991 Australian PGA Championship  
and was Peter Thomson's assistant captain in the Presidents Cup, 
had a 65 for the best round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had much to enjoy lately, but I think I've kept my  
sense of humor,'' Grady said. ``The last two years have been very 
difficult. I've thought about retirement every day for the last 12 
months.''

<HEADLINE> Delgado, Renteria Avoid Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Usually in arbitration, players win, lose or  
settle. On Friday, a hearing got postponed by weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Matt Lawton's case against the Minnesota Twins was  
put off because one of the arbitrators on the three-man panel 
scheduled to hear the case was unable to get to Tampa, Fla., due to 
weather problems affecting his flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The date for Lawton's hearing was not immediately reset.  
</P>
<P>
	Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado, whose $6.5 million request  
was the highest figure submitted by a player this year, settled 
Friday for a one-year contract worth $5,025,000. New St. Louis 
shortstop Edgar Renteria agreed at $1,975,000, avoiding a hearing 
scheduled for later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	One hearing was held, with Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter  
asking arbitrator Jerome Ross to award his request of $2.75 million 
rather than the Tigers' offer of $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who made $562,500 in 1998, hit .254 last season with  
four homers, 36 RBIs and 42 stolen bases in 54 attempts. A decision 
is expected Saturday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have won all four of the decisions issued thus far. Nine  
players remain in arbitration, including Lawton, with hearings 
scheduled to conclude by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, who made $2.4 million last year, set career highs last  
season with a .292 average, 38 homers, 115 RBIs, 94 runs, 43 
doubles and 314 total bases. He missed the first 20 games of the 
season while recovering from shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had offered $4.2 million, and a hearing had been  
scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria's new salary is more than seven times the $255,000 he  
made last season. In addition to his base salary, he would earn a 
$25,000 bonus if he has 625 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis acquired Renteria in December in a trade that sent  
three minor-leaguers to the Florida Marlins. Renteria is a career 
.288 hitter who stole 41 bases last season. He is expected to bat 
leadoff this season for St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria was the Marlins only representative in last year's  
All-Star game and ended the 1997 World Series with a two-out single 
off Cleveland's Charles Nagy in the bottom of the 11th inning of 
Game 7, giving Florida a 3-2 victory.

Security rescue plan in President Clinton's budget proposal might 
prove a financial burden to future generations.

	``The administration's proposal risks saddling our children with  
more debt,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,  
disagreed, saying Clinton ``is setting aside money to fund the 
promises that Congress has already made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel accused Republicans of criticizing the plan rather than  
``offering a constructive counterproposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have agreed with Clinton that 62 percent of  
expected future government surpluses should remain untouched while 
lawmakers work out a plan for Social Security's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on how to bridge the Social Security  
cash shortfall expected when baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Thursday, Archer argued that if the surpluses  
simply were left alone, the financial benefits to the government 
would snowball in a cycle that would reduce the national debt 
faster than under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential Republican also echoed a separate concern that  
some economists share: Clinton's plan would earmark general tax 
revenue to Social Security for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, however, have offered no alternative plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials say they fear that without some  
concrete plan, the financial benefits resulting from the nation's 
current prosperity might never reach Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Temptation runs high for Republicans and Democrats alike to use  
any extra money for tax cuts or spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan ``makes it dramatically more likely that  
the debt reduction will actually take place instead of being 
overturned and spent by future Congresses,'' White House adviser 
Gene Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use about $2 trillion in surpluses to pay  
back public debt -- money borrowed by the government from 
individuals and others who have bought Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say reducing that public debt puts government  
finances on a stronger footing because interest payments are not as 
high and the economy thus gets a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting on those effects as collateral, Clinton would then  
place new IOUs in Social Security's trust fund, representing enough 
money to keep it healthy for about 20 years longer than now 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has called for bipartisan talks about what else  
might be needed, he has so far proposed no changes in Social 
Security benefits or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, Clinton's plan would promise that when the special  
payroll taxes that have traditionally been Social Security's 
exclusive source of money run short -- as is expected in 2032 -- the 
government would make up the difference from general revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are not alone in questioning that part of Clinton's  
proposal: A blue-ribbon commission two years ago unanimously 
rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's chairman, Edward Gramlich -- now a member of the  
Federal Reserve Board -- this week warned lawmakers of ``serious 
drawbacks'' to Clinton's plan, including that it could put 
retirees' needs in direct competition with other programs.

<HEADLINE> 21 Hospitalized by Fumes on Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Authorities today ruled out their earlier  
suspicions that someone intentionally sprayed a substance that 
sickened people on an Atlanta commuter train. They still were 
unsure what sort of fumes caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 who fell ill, including a crew member and five  
paramedics, were taken to a hospital Thursday complaining of chest 
pains, breathing problems and eye irritation. All but one were 
released late Thursday night and early today. A 14-year-old boy 
remained hospitalized with breathing problems; he was in stable 
condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who were released were given green hospital scrubs to wear  
because their clothes were confiscated by the FBI to identify the 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially suspected that an unknown man had sprayed  
a substance after boarding the train. Dee Baker, spokeswoman for 
the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, said today the 
man boarded the train during the end of the evening rush hour, but 
was already coughing when he got on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one actually saw the gentleman spray anything,'' Ms. Baker  
said, adding that authorities now believe he was already exposed to 
whatever sickened the rest of the passengers before boarding the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Videotapes from cameras at the MARTA stations were being  
examined for further evidence, and the FBI was trying to identify 
the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be as simple as pepper spray, or any type of fume  
that could be airborne, that could cause individuals to have these 
type of symptoms,'' Fire Department spokeswoman Connie Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Deportation Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of longtime resident illegal  
immigrants facing deportation under a new law can stay in the 
United States while they try to win legal residency, a federal 
appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Thursday probably affects several thousand immigrants  
in the United States for more than seven years who claim they are 
eligible for suspension of deportation orders, said Marc Van Der 
Hout, a National Lawyers Guild attorney representing the 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld  
a judge's injunction blocking deportations during a lawsuit over a 
new federal law severely limiting eligibility for future legal 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling applies only to the 9th circuit, which covers nine  
Western states. Similar deportations have taken place elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
was not returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the case started in 1997, Congress has changed the law to  
exempt immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba and 
some eastern European countries from the limits at issue in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	An illegal immigrant who has lived in the United States  
continuously for seven years can get a deportation order suspended 
by showing good moral character and the prospect of extreme 
hardship if deported. Suspension of deportation makes an immigrant 
eligible for legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 federal law placed a 4,000 annual limit on the number of  
immigrants eligible for suspension of deportation and transfer to 
legal residency status. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit covers the period from one October to the next. After  
3,900 deportation orders were suspended between October 1996 and 
February 1997, the chief federal immigration judge and the chairman 
of the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered immigration courts not 
to approve any more suspensions until at least April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law also made immigrants ineligible for suspension if  
they had been given notice of deportation before attaining seven 
years of U.S. residency. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 9th Circuit ruled that the new standard applied only  
to post-April 1997 deportation orders, thousands of immigrants 
rushed to have their suspension cases heard before April, only to 
be thwarted by the immigration officials' orders.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his final impeachment trial opening prayer  
today, the Senate's chaplain offered thanks for the tenor of the 
debate and asked for healing for President Clinton and his family.

<HEADLINE> Part of ADA Law Is Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that  
states can charge disabled people for some things such as 
handicapped license plates and parking placards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a  
regulation regarding fees contained in the Americans with 
Disabilities Act is unconstitutional. The decision applies only in 
the appeals court jurisdiction -- Virginia, Maryland, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal courts have ruled that states can't charge for the  
license plates and placards. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest ruling stems from a case in North Carolina. Five  
disabled residents sued the state, saying the Department of Motor 
Vehicles broke the law by charging $5 for handicapped parking 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents argued that the ADA prohibits states from charging  
for programs that give the disabled equal access. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge dismissed the case. The 4th Circuit upheld the  
district judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does not affect the rest of the ADA, a broad federal  
law designed to protect disabled people from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said department  
lawyers were reviewing the decision and had no comment.

	Clinton Acquitted on Both Charges  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted President Clinton  
of perjury and obstruction of justice. Senators voted 50-50 on the 
impeachment article accusing Clinton of obstruction of justice in 
concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, far short of the 
two-thirds required for conviction. Earlier, senators rejected the 
charge of perjury by a 55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans joined the 
Democrats. Senators then rejected an effort by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., to force a vote today on her recommendation to 
censure the president for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' 
behavior. 

</P>
<P>
	Daschle: Acquittal Is Not Vindication  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said  
Clinton's acquittal should not be seen as vindication for his 
behavior. ``This was a rebuke. There is no question,'' Daschle said 
of the impeachment. In defeat, the lead House prosecutor said his 
team had nothing to be ashamed of, rejecting any idea that the GOP 
House's effort -- which proceeded despite public opposition -- 
tarnished its credibility. ``All Americans can take great 
comfort,'' Rep Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said. ``Congress has 
strengthened, not weakened the ties that bind our nation 
together.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Says He's Sorry  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's ``profoundly  
sorry'' for what he said and did that brought the impeachment 
burden onto the Congress and the American people. Clinton, in a 
brief statement outside the White House, said it ``can be and must 
be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Linda Tripp Says She'd Do It Again  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings triggered  
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, says she considered it her ``patriotic 
duty'' to expose a relationship between President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky. Tripp says Clinton ``abused, used, discarded'' the 
former White House intern. ``People think this'' relationship was 
``consensual and that I inserted myself somehow'' but ``it was 
not,'' Mrs. Tripp said in an interview that was being aired today 
on the ``Today'' show.

	Aide: Hillary Will Consider Senate  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Now that her husband's impeachment trial is  
over, Hillary Rodham Clinton will consider running for the Senate 
seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an aide 
said today. ``In the backdrop we've been in for the past few weeks, 
she wasn't in a position to do that,'' Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman 
for the first lady, said. ``Clearly, there's a change in that 
situation, and at some point in the future I'm sure she will be 
giving thought to it.''

	U.S. Jet Bombs Iraqi Gun Position

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An American warplane bombed an Iraqi  
anti-aircraft artillery site Friday after the jet was fired on in 
the third ``no-fly'' clash in three days, U.S. officials said. The 
incident over northern Iraq occurred at 1:30 p.m. local time (5:30 
a.m. EST) north of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad, said the U.S. 
European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. The official Iraqi News 
Agency said one civilian was killed and another injured. American 
military officials said damage was still being assessed.

<P>
	Triple Olympic gold medalist Gail Devers is scheduled to make a  
rare appearance, running 60 meters against Sri Lankan Susanthika 
Jayasinghe, who is competing with the threat of an IAAF drug ban 
hanging over her. 
</P>
<P>
	The entries also includes high jump world record-holder Javier  
Sotomayor of Cuba, compatriot and world long jump champion Ivan 
Pedroso, and Britain's 110-meter hurdles world record-holder, Colin 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But Britain's European 200-meter champion Doug Walker, who is  
under threat of suspension after failing a test for steroids, has 
pulled out of the meet. Organizers say that Walker, who has 
declared his innocence, withdrew to avoid taking too much attention 
away from the other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie broke the 2,000 world mark at the same meet last  
year and was mobbed by his countrymen who invaded the track even 
before the other runners had crossed the line. About 500 Ethiopians 
will be at the National Indoor Arena again in a sellout crowd of 
8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie set world outdoor records at 5,000 and 10,000  
meters last year with countryman Million Wolde as his pacemaker. 
The 19-year-old is back to help him set the world mark this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Komen has the support of former Olympic 800 gold medalist  
William Tanui. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the world's top two distance stars are in separate  
races is a bonus, Komen said. He doesn't like Gebrselassie's race 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Haile's a good guy and he's my friend off the track,'' Komen  
said. ``But we're big rivals on it. He doesn't contribute when we 
run the same race. He sits on my shoulder and lets me do the hard 
work, I'm almost acting as his pacemaker and I don't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Komen holds four world records: at 3,000 meters and two miles  
outdoors, and at 3,000 and 5,000 meters indoors. Yet he regards 
Gebrselassie as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, Haile is the best,'' he said. ``But I'm  
catching up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola is in good shape to recapture the 800-meter record. She  
set the best time in the world this year, 1 minute 58.16 seconds, 
in Sweden Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mozambique thought she had set a world record of 1:56.36 at  
Lieven, France, last year, but the mark was disallowed because she 
ran out of her lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers, who ran only a few races last season in a year dominated  
by Marion Jones, is scheduled to face world indoor record-holder 
Irina Privalova and Jayasinghe, who has scored impressive 60 
victories at Stuttgart and Malmo in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jayasinghe's drug case is soon to go to arbitration with the  
IAAF unhappy that the 1997 world 200-meter silver medalist was 
cleared by her federation after she tested positive for the steroid 
Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Wells, the 100-meter gold medalist in 1980, and two-time  
Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson will compete in special 
Legends of the Track 60-meter race.

<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Manuel Febus makes Elizabeth Taylor look  
like a novice when it comes to marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the New Yorker has been married more than 11  
times. But the romeo allegedly wasn't promising eternal love, just 
a green card. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused in federal court last month of illegally helping  
immigrant women gain permanent residency by marrying them. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least one case, he allegedly charged a fee. A woman  
married Febus on Valentine's Day 1997 after agreeing to pay $5,500 
to an associate of Febus to find her a husband, according to court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the brides submitted a photo of themselves with  
Febus as part of their applications to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you file photographs of yourself, eventually you're going  
to get caught,'' immigration lawyer Melvin R. Solomon said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report Ordered Open in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Northeastern University has been ordered to turn  
over a drug-use report sought by a doctor sued for malpractice by 
the widow of Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued by a special Northeastern commission that  
investigated drug use by university athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to include results of drug tests given to Lewis  
in 1987, when he played for the Northeastern basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	In Suffolk Superior Court Thursday, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith  
ordered the university to give the report to lawyers for Dr. 
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers hope to use the report in defending Mudge in the  
suit brought by Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said that 16 days before Lewis collapsed at a  
practice, he acknowledged using cocaine in the past, but said he 
had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was 27 when he died at that practice session July 27,  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He had collapsed during a game earlier, and one team of doctors  
who examined him said he had a life-threatening heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge led a second team of doctors to treat Lewis, and diagnosed  
a less-harmful condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintains he could not have made a proper diagnosis  
because he didn't know Lewis allegedly used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has denied her late husband used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	In ordering Northeastern to turn over the report, Fremont-Smith  
said any information in it on possible drug use by other players 
will be impounded and not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeastern argued against turning over the report, saying it  
would hinder future investigations because the university could not 
guarantee confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeastern spokeswoman Janet Hookailo said the university's  
lawyers were reviewing Fremont-Smith's order, and considering 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that Northeastern's general counsel,  
Vincent Lembo, can be deposed by lawyers for Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in trial of the suit was scheduled for April 26.

</P>
<P>
	Q: ``If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you  
beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?''

then, that you were alone with (Ms. Lewinsky), but you have no 
specific recollection of that ever happening?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``Yes, that's correct. It's possible that she, in,  
while she was working there, brought something to me and that at 
the time she brought it to me, she was the only person there. 
That's possible.''

listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to 
lie. Not a single time. Never. These allegations are false. And I 
need to go back to work for the American people.''

</P>
<P>
	``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in  
early 1996, and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was 
wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse. They 
did not constitute sexual relations, as I understood that term to 
be defined at my January 17th, 1998 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they did involve inappropriate, intimate contact. These  
inappropriate encounters ended at my insistence in early 1997. I 
also had occasional telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that 
included inappropriate sexual banter.

subpoena called for the production of, among other things, all the 
gifts that you had given Ms. Lewinsky? You were aware of that on 
December 28th, weren't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``I'm not sure, and I understand this is an important  
question. I did have a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky at some time 
about gifts, the gifts I'd given her. ... And I told her that if 
they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them whatever she had, 
that that's what the law was.''

<P>
	Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony:  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``What I was trying to determine was whether my  
recollection was right because (presidential secretary Betty 
Currie) was always in the office complex when Monica was there, and 
whether she thought she could hear any conversations we had or did 
she hear any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Ms. Currie testified that these were not really questions  
to her, that they were more like statements. Is that not the 
truth?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``Well, I can't testify as to what her perception was.  
I can tell you this: I was trying to get information in a hurry. I 
was downloading what I remembered. ... So I was not trying to get 
Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful.''

legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted but Tarnished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
Clinton declared he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said and 
did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to 
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five  
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort  
led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Several 
Democrats said they did not expect the issue to resurface when 
lawmakers return to the Capitol after a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said one Republican,  
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who twice voted to convict the 
president and strip him of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for  
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, asked Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to autograph a blank Senate roll call form, 
then used it to record the results. Hyde the leader of the 
prosecution effort, sat silently as the verdict was sealed. So, 
too, the legal team that had defended the president. 
</P>
<P>
	For each article of impeachment, a clerk read the charges aloud,  
then Rehnquist said, ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, 
William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the lawmakers rose at their seats to respond. Sen.  
Spencer Abraham of Michigan was first, Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon 
was last. Between the votes, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West 
Virginia sat at his seat, perusing his breastpocket copy of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes, the trial -- the first since Andrew Johnson  
sat in the White House in 1868 -- was over. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was exercising  
in the White House when he received word of the first vote in a 
phone call from his chief of staff, John Podesta. The president had 
returned to work in time to learn he was finally free of the threat 
of removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said later in the Rose Garden that he was ``humbled and very  
grateful for the support and the prayers I have received from 
millions of Americans over this past year. Now I ask all Americans, 
and I hope all Americans here in Washington and throughout our land 
will rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and 
building our future together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The votes, coming several months after the dismissal of Paula  
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, marked the second consecutive 
major legal and political victory for Clinton. He still faces the 
threat of an indictment from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, 
either before or after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, the 74-year-old, white-haired chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee, said he hopes that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, he told reporters that despite the verdict  
``I have no regrets. We fulfilled our oath of office to discharge 
our duty according to the Constitution. And when people do that, 
when elected representatives do that, democracy works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had not been any doubt for weeks about the outcome, the  
only suspense coming over whether either article of impeachment 
would gain a majority. In the end, neither did. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia Snowe and  
Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter 
of Pennsylvania, voted to acquit the president on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	On perjury, there were five other Republicans voting to acquit:  
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard 
Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was harsh, bipartisan condemnation of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In comments late Thursday night, as senators were emerging from  
a third long day of closed-door deliberations on Clinton's fate, 
Utah Sen. Robert Bennett said that ``over and over again from both 
sides of the aisle,'' senators had denounced the president as a 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who alone among Democrats had  
voted earlier against dismissal of the charges, said ``President 
Clinton has disgraced himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts were broadcast nationally to a public that had long  
since said it wanted the trial over -- but seemingly never tired of 
watching, reading and joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the politicians said it was time to move on, other key  
players in the sex and cover-up drama were only just starting to 
speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is expected to write a book and make several media  
appearances in the coming months. Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded 
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky helped propel Starr's 
investigation, is also embarking on a series of media appearances 
to refurbish her image. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation began in January 1998, when the nation awoke  
to the shocking allegations that the president had had a sexual 
relationship with a young woman in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	His denials were famously forthright -- ``I did not have sexual  
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' he said a few days 
later. But that depended, it later developed, on the definition of 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a string of embarrassing disclosures, and at one point  
it turned out that Ms. Lewinsky had evidence of a sexual encounter, 
a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress what he said was evidence of impeachable  
offenses in September, 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of pages of salacious material was released to the  
public at cyber-speed. Republicans and Democrats went to war almost 
immediately in the House, and by year's end, the GOP muscled 
through a formal impeachment inquiry unlimited in time or scope. 
</P>
<P>
	Their drive was stalled at the elections, though, when the GOP  
lost seats in a campaign that was widely viewed as a referendum of 
sorts on the president's fate. Republicans returned to a lame duck 
session determined to wrap up the case speedily, and narrowly won 
approval of two of four articles of impeachment that had been 
approved by the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened in the Senate on Jan. 7, with the unforgettable  
sight of Rehnquist mounting the dais, senators vowing to do 
impartial justice and walking to the front of the chamber to sign 
an impeachment book. 
</P>
<P>
	The two legal teams clashed for days on end, but the real  
struggle played out in closed-door party caucuses. There, 
Democratic support for Clinton hardened. Republicans, sensing 
political damage, fractured, most importantly on whether to call 
witnesses and how many. In the end, they allowed only videotaped 
depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict in, senators praised one another for working  
together and thanked Rehnquist, who had presided, sometimes with an 
impish sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work as a court of impeachment is now done,'' he said he  
walked from the chamber for the final time.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted but Tarnished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
Clinton declared he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said and 
did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to 
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five  
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort  
led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Several 
Democrats said they did not expect the issue to resurface when 
lawmakers return to the Capitol after a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said one Republican,  
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who twice voted to convict the 
president and strip him of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for  
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, asked Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to autograph a blank Senate roll call form, 
then used it to record the results. Hyde the leader of the 
prosecution effort, sat silently as the verdict was sealed. So, 
too, the legal team that had defended the president. 
</P>
<P>
	For each article of impeachment, a clerk read the charges aloud,  
then Rehnquist said, ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, 
William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the lawmakers rose at their seats to respond. Sen.  
Spencer Abraham of Michigan was first, Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon 
was last. Between the votes, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West 
Virginia sat at his seat, perusing his breastpocket copy of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes, the trial -- the first since Andrew Johnson  
sat in the White House in 1868 -- was over.

<HEADLINE> Weddings Abound at TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Folks who work in TV news are often  
married to their jobs. At KGET, they're also married to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon co-anchors Jim Scott and Robin Mangarin wed nine years  
ago. Weekend co-anchors Nerissa and Drew Sugars got married six 
years ago. Education reporter Maryellen Ford tied the knot with 
weatherman John Elliott and they recently had their first child. 
The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad situation if they move because you've got two spots  
to fill,'' said Jack Bowe, news director at the NBC affiliate. 
``But it's good for the station because couples tend to stay 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mangarin said she ``couldn't stand'' Scott when they first  
met, paired as co-anchors on another Bakersfield station. In fact, 
they began dating only after Lisa McRee, late of ABC's ``Good 
Morning America,'' showed up in town and separated the anchor team. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments on the set? ``We've learned to turn it on and off in  
the two minutes of commercials,'' Ms. Mangarin said. By the next 
commercial break, ``we've forgotten what the problem might have 
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cupid has touched others at Channel 17, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Eleven o'clock news anchor Charlotte Starck is married to Steve  
Hall, the station's creative services director. There's Brandy and 
John England. She's the afternoon assistant editor and he's morning 
editor and audio operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and information services specialist Bill Rydia is hitched to  
Cheryl in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe said station owner Ackerley Communications, based in  
Seattle, has no policy against such things, except that one spouse 
can't supervise the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Married people in general have their heads screwed on  
better,'' said the news director, a wedding band on his finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Nerissa and Drew Sugars met in a radio class at San Francisco  
State. They co-anchored for four years at WSEE-TV in Erie, Pa., 
before being offered tandem positions at KGET, replacing a 
departing husband-and-wife anchor team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never thought we'd be working together at one station, let  
alone two,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley Scott, 8, and brother Jack, 2, are unimpressed that their  
parents are on Channel 17 every night. Ms. Mangarin said the 
younger boy is just now recognizing them on TV, and the older one 
``is bored with it. He'd rather watch Barney.''

<HEADLINE> Censure Loses Steam After Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The uphill drive to censure President Clinton  
stalled Friday amid bipartisan sentiment to let the long-running 
controversy end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't happen,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. ``It  
shouldn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had painstakingly gathered 38  
signatures -- including that of nine Republicans -- on a resolution 
stating that Clinton had ``deliberately misled and deceived the 
American people'' and took actions ``impeding'' the judicial 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution stated that the Senate would ``condemn his  
wrongful conduct in the strongest terms'' and urged future members 
of Congress to leave it intact. A 19th century censure of President 
Andrew Jackson was expunged when Jackson's party took over the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after the Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and  
obstruction of justice, Feinstein attempted to bring the resolution 
up for debate. But in a scripted move worked out by both sides, 
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, blocked her effort by forcing a vote on a 
procedural motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Feinstein could technically bring the resolution up in  
the weeks ahead, Democrats and Republicans both doubted the Senate 
had the stomach to reconsider the issue even though polls show most 
Americans favor censure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I  
think, the Senate is tired,'' said Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss. ``We've done what we were required to do under the 
Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle declined to say censure was  
dead, saying he'd like to ``pursue it later on this month.'' But he 
acknowledged that ``a lot of people want it to end. You're going to 
see less and less interest for pursuing it for any length of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that since the censure vote  
didn't happen Friday, ``now is the time to stop. Let the 
recriminations stop. It's going to take a while to put some of 
these pieces back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Feinstein told reporters she may still attempt to  
bring up the resolution later, noting that her side got 56 votes on 
Gramm's blocking motion -- which required 67 votes to overcome -- and 
had the 38 co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That stands as a testament that over one-third of the United  
States Senate was supporting the language,'' Feinstein said. ``I 
feel it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein added that most opposition came from the GOP's  
conservative wing, which wanted a clean political issue if Clinton 
was acquitted, and from the Democrats' left, which didn't want to 
further tar the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure resolution was entered into the Congressional Record  
along with statements in support from some of its sponsors. That 
may be as far as it ever gets. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure effort was always a long shot. Many lawmakers  
believe the Constitution only allows Congress to impeach a 
president and then either convict or acquit, with no other options. 
</P>
<P>
	Censuring Clinton, the opponents said, would set an unwise  
precedent in which a Congress could hound a president with repeated 
condemnations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad idea. The president has been found not guilty,''  
said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. ``Let's move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators attempted to make the case that the number of  
censure sponsors combined with the votes to convict and remove 
Clinton signaled that more than two-thirds of the Senate had 
condemned the president's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a pretty good indication about who feels strongly  
about this president,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Bennett, the main GOP sponsor of the censure  
resolution, agreed that its time had probably passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is there to fight for? This is over,'' Bennett said.

<HEADLINE>  Howell Leads in Dubai Golf Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- David Howell of England took  
a step toward his first European tour victory Friday with a 4-under 
68 that gave him a one-stroke lead halfway through the Dubai Desert 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Faldo, meanwhile, took a messy double bogey at his 16th  
hole to miss the cut, jeopardizing his chances of making the field 
for the $5 million Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell had six birdies over the Dubai Creek Golf and Yacht Club  
to reach 7-under 137. Paul McGinley, Wayne Riley of Australia and 
Scotland's Peter Downie, the club pro at Dubai, were at 138. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara had an eagle and  
three birdies on his final five holes for a 67 that left him in a 
group at 139. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last week to qualify for the Match Play Championship  
at La Costa Resort in California, the first of the World Golf 
Championship events that pay $1 million to the winner and will 
provide valuable Ryder Cup points to European players. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, ranked No. 65, had said he would need a good week in  
Dubai but instead followed an opening 74 with a 75 for 149. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now for Plan B -- see you in Qatar,'' Faldo said after missing  
the cut. He had planned to skip next week's Qatar Masters if he 
didn't make the Match Play field. 
</P>
<P>
	But all is not lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Karlsson (66) also missed the cut in Dubai, and there's  
still a good chance Faldo can retain his position and face Tiger 
Woods in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely candidate to surpass him is Greg Turner of New  
Zealand, who would have to finish in the top three in the 
Australian Masters. Turner is tied for third through two rounds. 
The others are in the Buick Invitational in San Diego and would 
need at least a top 10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65th spot would qualify for the Match Play Championship  
because No. 14 Jumbo Ozaki is not planning to play. Woods will stay 
No. 1 no matter how he fares in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell's first pro victory came in November in the Australian  
PGA Championship. But he injured an ankle playing tennis during his 
trip home and returned to action only last week in the Malaysian 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea if my win in Australia has sparked this form,''  
Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, No. 1 on Europe's money list the past six  
years, did not carry a driver because of the severe rough and shot 
his second 70 for 140. Amateur Sergio Garcia had a 73 and was at 
141, while defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal was among those 
at 142. 
</P>
<P>
	Others missing the cut were Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros and  
Justin Rose, who turned pro after finishing fourth in the British 
Open last year but has not made a cut in 13 events.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank cut the country's already  
record-low interest rates even further in an effort to end a 
stubborn recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board voted today to lower the target  
for overnight call money -- the rate banks charge each other for 
overnight loans without collateral -- to 0.15 percent from 0.25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By cutting the target, which is a benchmark for rates of  
interest on other types of loans, the central bank hopes to lower 
borrowing costs not only for banks but for companies and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference after the move was announced, Bank  
of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said the cut will ``without a doubt'' 
give a boost to corporate borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rate, announced after the close of markets in Tokyo, is  
the lowest ever in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	By making it cheaper to borrow, the central bank said it was  
hoping to spur business activity as the economy continues to show 
few signs of recovering on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	A rebound in spending could also drive up prices -- something the  
bank seeks as it tries to pull the economy back from the brink of a 
destructive deflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is also aimed at combating a recent rise in long-term  
interest rates, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond have  
surged to more than 2 percent from lows of near 0.7 percent late 
last year, driven by concerns about Tokyo's ballooning budget 
deficits. Today, the yield on the No. 210 government bond closed at 
2.080 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increases have sent stock prices tumbling in recent sessions  
as investors fretted the higher cost of borrowing could mortally 
wound an economy already battling its worst recession since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that even if it is indirect (the latest steps) will  
have the effect of pulling down long-term interest rates,'' Hayami 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the cut, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told  
reporters he wants the central bank to consider additional steps to 
cap long-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cut -- the second since September -- also highlighted how  
few options the Japanese government has left for reviving the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Key short-term interest rates now stand at close to zero  
percent, leaving little room for further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, successive stimulus spending packages have driven  
Japan's cumulative national debt to close to 110 percent of the 
gross domestic product -- the highest ratio in the industrial world. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, a few Japanese economists and officials have begun  
calling on the Bank of Japan to take the highly unorthodox step of 
intentionally sparking inflation by freely printing new money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayami has so far brushed aside such suggestions.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday's decision does not affect the discount rate, which is at  
a record low of 0.5 percent. The discount rate is the central 
bank's charge on loans to banks.

<HEADLINE>  Howell Leads in Dubai Golf Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- David Howell of England took  
a step toward his first European tour victory Friday with a 4-under 
68 that gave him a one-stroke lead halfway through the Dubai Desert 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Faldo, meanwhile, took a messy double bogey at his 16th  
hole to miss the cut, jeopardizing his chances of making the field 
for the $5 million Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell had six birdies over the Dubai Creek Golf and Yacht Club  
to reach 7-under 137. Paul McGinley, Wayne Riley of Australia and 
Scotland's Peter Downie, the club pro at Dubai, were at 138. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara had an eagle and  
three birdies on his final five holes for a 67 that left him in a 
group at 139. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last week to qualify for the Match Play Championship  
at La Costa Resort in California, the first of the World Golf 
Championship events that pay $1 million to the winner and will 
provide valuable Ryder Cup points to European players. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, ranked No. 65, had said he would need a good week in  
Dubai but instead followed an opening 74 with a 75 for 149. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now for Plan B -- see you in Qatar,'' Faldo said after missing  
the cut. He had planned to skip next week's Qatar Masters if he 
didn't make the Match Play field. 
</P>
<P>
	But all is not lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Karlsson (66) also missed the cut in Dubai, and there's  
still a good chance Faldo can retain his position and face Tiger 
Woods in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely candidate to surpass him is Greg Turner of New  
Zealand, who would have to finish in the top three in the 
Australian Masters. Turner is tied for third through two rounds. 
The others are in the Buick Invitational in San Diego and would 
need at least a top 10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65th spot would qualify for the Match Play Championship  
because No. 14 Jumbo Ozaki is not planning to play. Woods will stay 
No. 1 no matter how he fares in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell's first pro victory came in November in the Australian  
PGA Championship. But he injured an ankle playing tennis during his 
trip home and returned to action only last week in the Malaysian 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea if my win in Australia has sparked this form,''  
Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, No. 1 on Europe's money list the past six  
years, did not carry a driver because of the severe rough and shot 
his second 70 for 140. Amateur Sergio Garcia had a 73 and was at 
141, while defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal was among those 
at 142. 
</P>
<P>
	Others missing the cut were Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros and  
Justin Rose, who turned pro after finishing fourth in the British 
Open last year but has not made a cut in 13 events.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Upgrade Condition of Boxer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The condition of boxer Fernando Ibarra, who  
suffered a brain injury when he was knocked out in a fight two 
weeks ago, has improved but his chance for a complete recovery 
remains uncertain, doctors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra, of Laredo, Texas, had been hospitalized in critical  
condition since the Jan. 29 fight against Ratanachai Vorapin, the 
IBF's No. 1 junior flyweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra was upgraded Friday to fair condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ibarra is now breathing on his own, and we believe he is  
no longer at risk for more neurological damage,'' Dr. Joseph 
Sherrill said. ``His vital signs are stable, and he is beginning to 
follow simple commands in Spanish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra, 23, suffered a blood clot on his brain when he was  
knocked out in the sixth round of the scheduled eight-rounder at a 
St. Louis hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	He was conscious after the fight and walked to the dressing  
room, but he later lost consciousness. He was revived by a doctor 
at the scene and was taken to Saint Louis University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons at the hospital have since performed two procedures to  
relieve pressure in his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra can now raise his fingers, blink his eyes and squeeze  
someone's hand, doctors said. He also makes a kissing motion when 
his mother, Julietta Maldonado, holds up a picture of his 
3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has improved significantly, Ibarra cannot walk, talk  
or sit up on his own, doctors said. He also has weakness on his 
left side. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very difficult time for our family,''  
Maldonado said though a hospital spokesperson. ``We are focusing 
all our energy, thoughts and prayers on my son's recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra will require extensive medical care with an uncertain  
recovery, Sherrill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult at this time to say exactly how much brain  
damage Mr. Ibarra sustained from such a serious injury,'' Sherrill 
said. ``The next step in his treatment will be rehabilitation, 
which will help determine the level at which he will function for 
the rest of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra, who was listed in the fight's program as the Spanish  
champion, is 14-6. Vorapin, from Thailand, is 30-3.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's ``profoundly  
sorry'' for what he said and did that brought the impeachment 
burden onto the Congress and the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a brief statement outside the White House, said it  
``can be and must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Rose Garden of the White House he will hold for two more  
years, the president again apologized for the Monica Lewinsky 
affair and his deceptions about it. He said he is humbled and 
grateful for the support he has received from millions of Americans 
over the past year, since the scandal began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans here in  
Washington and throughout our land will rededicate ourselves to the 
work of serving our nation and building our future,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Plane Bombs Iraq Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force F-15E bombed an Iraqi  
anti-aircraft artillery site today after being fired upon, a U.S. 
military official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident in the northern ``no-fly'' zone occurred about 1:30  
p.m. Iraqi time (5:30 a.m. EST) north of the city of Mosul, which 
is 250 miles north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet dropped one GBU-12 precision-guided bomb on the site in  
response to the hostile act, said Air Force Capt. Mike Blass, 
spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, 
which oversees the northern zone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no damage to coalition aircraft; damage to the  
Iraqi site was being assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said one plane ``fired a missile  
at random on a civilian installation ... which led to the martyrdom 
of one person and the wounding of another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allied warplanes have prohibited Iraqi military flights in  
northern and southern no-fly zones since shortly after the 1991 
Gulf War to protect Kurdish rebel and Shiite Muslim groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has challenged the no-fly zones  
almost daily since U.S. and British launched airstrikes in 
mid-December to punish him for not cooperating with U.N. weapons 
inspectors.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted on Both Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson  
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month 
drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only 
the second presidential impeachment trial in history. The vote 
allows the 42nd president to finish his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William  
Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the charges in 
the said articles,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing Clinton  
of obstruction of justice in concealing his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, far short of the two-thirds required for conviction. 
Earlier, senators rejected the charge of perjury by a 55-45 vote, 
as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the votes, Rehnquist banged his gavel to end the  
five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators then rejected an effort by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., to force a vote today on her recommendation to censure 
the president for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. 
The symbolic effort, which several Democrats said would not be 
revived later on, was a reminder that, acquittal aside, Clinton 
remains forever tarnished as only the second president in history 
to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote but did  
not watch it on television. He prepared a statement he planned to 
deliver from the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes were broadcast by the networks to a nation long since  
weary of the proceedings. Ms. Lewinsky, who testified earlier this 
month by videotape, watched on television, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Clinton's acquittal  
should not be seen as vindication for his behavior. ``This was a 
rebuke. There is no question,'' Daschle said of the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeat, the lead House prosecutor said his team had nothing  
to be ashamed of, rejecting any idea that the GOP House's effort -- 
which proceeded despite public opposition -- tarnished its 
credibility. ``All Americans can take great comfort,'' Rep Henry 
Hyde, R-Ill., said. ``Congress has strengthened, not weakened the 
ties that bind our nation together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, the second and third floors of the Senate side  
of the Capitol were evacuated by police checking a bomb threat, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators ended two final hours of closed door debate on  
Clinton's transgressions this morning shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton  
guilty or not guilty?'' Rehnquist asked a hushed chamber, beginning 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared  
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of  
Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted 
Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators opposing the obstruction article were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Snowe and Specter.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were  
read for a final time. Lott declared it was time for senators to 
fulfill their ``obligation under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on both sides relished the opportunity to end the  
unpopular trial and get back to legislative business after a 
mid-February break. ``I really think the Senate will be able to 
work better because of this,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's legal team was also relieved. They left the  
White House shortly after the verdict to have dinner together at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key Democrats said they do not want the Senate to  
discuss censuring Clinton after the return from the break. ``I 
don't want to go back into it. It's over. Let's move on,'' Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., said. Added Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.: ``I 
don't think censure will come back. It's time to stop ... the 
censuring, stop the debating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans were just as relieved that the impeachment crisis  
with its tawdry tale of sex and lies was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hallelujah. We have to get on with our lives,'' Margit Noro of  
Harrisburg, Pa., declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a decent presidency ... but this is going to  
overshadow everything he's done that's good,'' said A.J. Cardounel, 
of Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The final outcome of the votes was known for days as five  
moderate Republicans announced in advance that they planned to vote 
against both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators thanked the chief justice for presiding over the trial  
and presented him with a gavel on a plaque. He said he was leaving 
the Senate chamber a ``wiser but not a sadder man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers exited the chamber, shaking hands with senators  
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the inevitable acquittal, senators wanted the public  
to know they abhorred the president's conduct in concealing his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,  
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt 
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life,'' said Sen. 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes complete a drama that has riveted official  
Washington, roiled a midterm congressional election and worn out 
the patience of the American public. ``The Senate will resume final 
deliberations now in the closed session, thank goodness,'' Lott 
said at the start of today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton is not free from troubles: He could face indictment,  
while in office or after his term, by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, and must finish his remaining months in office facing a 
GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him evicted from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured for the first time videotaped testimony on  
the Senate floor and provided the world its first good look at Ms. 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A national TV audience was 
able to watch as 13 House impeachment managers, all Republicans, 
argued that Clinton deserved to be thrown out of office, while 
White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Restricts bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia  
said today it has placed new restrictions on Osama bin Laden, the 
Saudi millionaire the United States accuses of plotting bomb 
attacks on two American embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said bin Laden's  
satellite telephone has been shut off and he has been barred from 
talking to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have cut off his telephone. ... This is a new restriction,  
and he is not allowed to make any public statements,'' Muttawakil 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Muttawakil said the Taliban will not hand bin Laden  
over to a third country, despite a request from the United States, 
which suspects him of masterminding the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department dismissed the restrictions as ``woefully  
short of that which is required,'' and demanded the Taliban hand 
over bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have repeatedly made clear to the Taliban our view that  
Osama bin Laden should be expelled from Afghanistan immediately to 
a place where he can be brought to justice for his crimes,'' said 
State Department spokesman James Foley on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire, has been in hiding in  
Afghanistan since August, when his bases near the town Khost, 100 
miles south of the capital Kabul, were hit by U.S. cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	After that attack, the Taliban told bin Laden not to make any  
public statements. That restriction was lifted after the Taliban's 
Supreme Court cleared him of terrorist charges last November. 
</P>
<P>
	In late December, bin Laden issued orders to his followers to  
attack U.S. and British interests worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed restrictions are believed to be linked to recent  
meetings between the Taliban and U.S. and British officials. 
Taliban officials met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South 
Asian Affairs Rick Inderfurth last week in the Pakistani capital of 
Islamabad and later met with British officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban's Ambassador in Islamabad, Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani, said  
he had delivered a letter outlining the restrictions to the U.S. 
Embassy in the Pakistani capital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have imposed restrictions on bin Laden and made it clear to  
him that any communication with any other person outside 
Afghanistan will be a violation of the rules, regulations and laws 
of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,'' Haqqani said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't say what the punishment would be if bin Laden violated  
the rules.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Ted Stevens wasn't going to let Jay Leno  
get the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alaska Republican struck back Friday at ``The Tonight Show''  
host, who had been showing clips of him picking his nose during the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	As he entered the Senate chamber, the lawmaker proudly displayed  
his new battery-powered ``Turbo Groomer,'' a device shaped like a 
tube of toothpaste that does the job finger-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, one of the 10 Republicans who voted to acquit President  
Clinton of perjury, explained that a bone missing from the end of 
his nose apparently causes a problem that requires him to extract 
hairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the Senate doors closed for the final hours of  
deliberations, a smiling Stevens could be seen holding the groomer 
and reading the directions. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment trial, a gaggle of reporters  
frequently gathered in the Capitol basement -- where trams link the 
Capitol and the three Senate office buildings -- for a chance to 
interview senators on their way to and from the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	But when a bomb scare closed the chamber and surrounding area  
for more than an hour, a large traffic jam ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters couldn't get back to the Senate Press Gallery, nor  
could senators get into the building from the subway. It led to a 
lot more subway interviews than either lawmakers or reporters had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	After a bomb threat, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy made his way outside  
and found himself speaking to reporters an impromptu news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a hard time being heard, however. A female protester  
planted herself a few feet away and began screaming, drowning out 
Kennedy's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Democrat quickly broke off the interview and  
was escorted away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you, senator,'' reacted another woman.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton asked for forgiveness Friday following his  
acquittal in the impeachment trial but the Senate chaplain had 
already suggested lawmakers give it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate prepared to deliberate for the last time in the  
trial, the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie thanked God for what he called ``an 
open, honest debate of alternative solutions'' and asked for 
healing for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entrust to your care the president and his family. Use  
whatever is decided today to enable a deeper experience of your 
grace in his life and healing in his family,'' Ogilvie added.

	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Dr. Neil Compton, who led the effort to  
secure federal protection for the United States' first national 
river, died Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1962, Compton and others formed the Ozark Society after  
the Army Corps of Engineers began efforts to build two dams on the 
Buffalo River in northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo became the United States' first national river in  
1972. Several state and national dignitaries paid tribute to him in 
a June 1997 ceremony celebrating the 25th anniversary of President

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Herbert Kline, a documentary filmmaker who  
sneaked into Eastern Europe to film the Nazi conquest and later 
told the story of the Holocaust, died Feb. 5. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Kline wandered as a youth and wound up in Europe during the  
turbulent 1930s. During the Spanish Civil War, he teamed up with 
Hungarian photographer Geza Karpathi to make the 1936 film ``Heart 
of Spain,'' about a Madrid mother who meets the young soldier she 
saved with a blood donation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938 he made ``Crisis,'' about the German conquest of  
Czechoslovakia. It recently was re-released in Europe.

	To film ``Crisis,'' Kline, who was Jewish, bluffed his way into  
Czechoslovakia by pretending to be pro-Nazi. He filmed rallies and 
parades. Nazi storm troopers carried his equipment and follow his 
directions before the camera.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby OKs Future Wagering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Racing fans across the country will get  
the opportunity Thursday to take part in the first-ever parimutuel 
future wagering on the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bets will be accepted at the Downs' Sports Spectrum and all  
other Kentucky tracks and off-track wagering outlets until 4:30 
p.m. EST on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary field announced for the first pool includes six  
horses trained by two-time Kentucky Derby winner Bob Baffert. But 
none of his runners, including unbeaten Exploit, is favored in the 
morning line odds for the new system. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary field consists of 23 horses and a 24th betting  
interest made up of all 3-year-olds other than those in the field. 
Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia has installed that 
interest as the 6-1 morning line favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	He listed Exploit as second choice at 8-1 and the filly  
Silverbulletday, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, next 
at 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no standout in this year's group of Derby contenders,  
and it looks like it could be the most wide-open Derby we've seen 
in years,'' Battaglia said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said fans will be betting on proven horses like Exploit and  
Silverbulletday in the May 1 Derby, ``but I think many will be 
willing to take a chance that the Derby winner has yet to emerge 
and may not be among the 23 horses in this first field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent Derby Future Wager pools will be offered March 11-14  
and April 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a minimum $2 bet. No refunds will be issued in any  
of the three wagering pools and all wagers are final once the 
patron has left the mutuel window. 
</P>
<P>
	Three time Derby-winning trainer D. Wayne Lucas has a pair of  
thoroughbreds in the preliminary field for Pool One in Cape 
Canaveral (15-1) and Cat Thief (20-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time winning trainer Nick Zito is represented by The Groom  
Is Red (12-1), Doneraile Court (20-1), and alternate Wondertross. 
</P>
<P>
	If any of the 23 are sidelined by injury or illness, they will  
be replaced from a pool of alternates.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted on Both Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson  
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month 
drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only 
the second presidential impeachment trial in history. The vote 
allows the 42nd president to finish his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William  
Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the charges in 
the said articles,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing Clinton  
of obstruction of justice in concealing his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, far short of the two-thirds required for conviction. 
Earlier, senators rejected the charge of perjury by a 55-45 vote, 
as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the votes, Rehnquist banged his gavel to end the  
five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators then rejected an effort by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., to force a vote today on her recommendation to censure 
the president for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. 
The symbolic effort, which several Democrats said would not be 
revived later on, was a reminder that, acquittal aside, Clinton 
remains forever tarnished as only the second president in history 
to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote but did  
not watch it on television. He prepared a statement he planned to 
deliver from the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes were broadcast by the networks to a nation long since  
weary of the proceedings. Ms. Lewinsky, who testified earlier this 
month by videotape, watched on television, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Clinton's acquittal  
should not be seen as vindication for his behavior. ``This was a 
rebuke. There is no question,'' Daschle said of the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeat, the lead House prosecutor said his team had nothing  
to be ashamed of, rejecting any idea that the GOP House's effort -- 
which proceeded despite public opposition -- tarnished its 
credibility. ``All Americans can take great comfort,'' Rep Henry 
Hyde, R-Ill., said. ``Congress has strengthened, not weakened the 
ties that bind our nation together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, the second and third floors of the Senate side  
of the Capitol were evacuated by police checking a bomb threat, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators ended two final hours of closed door debate on  
Clinton's transgressions this morning shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton  
guilty or not guilty?'' Rehnquist asked a hushed chamber, beginning 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared  
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of  
Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted 
Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators opposing the obstruction article were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Snowe and Specter.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were  
read for a final time. Lott declared it was time for senators to 
fulfill their ``obligation under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on both sides relished the opportunity to end the  
unpopular trial and get back to legislative business after a 
mid-February break. ``I really think the Senate will be able to 
work better because of this,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's legal team was also relieved. They left the  
White House shortly after the verdict to have dinner together at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key Democrats said they do not want the Senate to  
discuss censuring Clinton after the return from the break. ``I 
don't want to go back into it. It's over. Let's move on,'' Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., said. Added Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.: ``I 
don't think censure will come back. It's time to stop ... the 
censuring, stop the debating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans were just as relieved that the impeachment crisis  
with its tawdry tale of sex and lies was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hallelujah. We have to get on with our lives,'' Margit Noro of  
Harrisburg, Pa., declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a decent presidency ... but this is going to  
overshadow everything he's done that's good,'' said A.J. Cardounel, 
of Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The final outcome of the votes was known for days as five  
moderate Republicans announced in advance that they planned to vote 
against both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators thanked the chief justice for presiding over the trial  
and presented him with a gavel on a plaque. He said he was leaving 
the Senate chamber a ``wiser but not a sadder man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers exited the chamber, shaking hands with senators  
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the inevitable acquittal, senators wanted the public  
to know they abhorred the president's conduct in concealing his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,  
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt 
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life,'' said Sen. 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes complete a drama that has riveted official  
Washington, roiled a midterm congressional election and worn out 
the patience of the American public. ``The Senate will resume final 
deliberations now in the closed session, thank goodness,'' Lott 
said at the start of today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton is not free from troubles: He could face indictment,  
while in office or after his term, by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, and must finish his remaining months in office facing a 
GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him evicted from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured for the first time videotaped testimony on  
the Senate floor and provided the world its first good look at Ms. 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A national TV audience was 
able to watch as 13 House impeachment managers, all Republicans, 
argued that Clinton deserved to be thrown out of office, while 
White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on American Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge promised a ruling Saturday on  
whether American Airlines' pilots be held in contempt for ignoring 
a back-to-work order as the nation's second-largest airline 
canceled hundreds of flights for all of the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Stranded passengers fumed at airports across the country Friday  
as U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall heard arguments in his Dallas 
courtroom as to whether the Allied Pilots Association should be 
punished for disregarding an order he issued Wednesday. An 
estimated one out of every four American pilots called in sick 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As he adjourned the hearing late Friday afternoon, Kendall  
suggested union officials spend ``a productive evening'' on the 
telephone telling pilots to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to do anything right now. I'm going to recess so  
as not to shoot from the hip,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	American asked for ``a coercive fine'' against the union until  
the pilots return. During the hearing, Kendall asked union leaders 
about the organization's net worth as well as how much they earned 
as pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to resolve the weeklong job action was galling to  
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wasting my vacation standing in line,'' Edwin Amaya, said  
as he waited at Boston's Logan International Airport after learning 
his flight to Miami had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``A federal judge ordered them back to work,'' said Amaya, who  
was trying to get to Panama, via Miami, to enjoy pre-Lenten 
Carnival celebrations and spend a week with his family. ``Why 
aren't they here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	American canceled 1,102 flights Friday, nearly half of its 2,250  
daily flights and slightly below Thursday's grounding of 1,181. It 
already has decided to cancel 536 flights for Saturday and 209 for 
Sunday, said spokesman Chris Chiames. 
</P>
<P>
	American estimated Friday that 450,000 passengers have been  
affected since the job action began Feb. 5. The sick calls 
mushroomed after talks with the airline stalled on issues such as 
differing pay scales for pilots at American and its recently 
acquired Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiames said 2,443 of the airline's 9,400 pilots were on the  
sick list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the pilots' union both said American could  
return to normal operations in three days if the massive sick calls 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can feel the tension in the air,'' Tim Daniel said as he  
waited at Los Angeles International Airport for a flight home to 
Tulsa, Okla., after a holiday in French Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset passengers revolted in Miami on Thursday, company lawyer  
Dee Kelly told the Judge Kendall at the Dallas hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a near-riot in Miami and they had to close a ticket  
counter in New York,'' Kelly said. Miami airport police did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union leaders have thumbed their noses at management and  
the public,'' Kelly told the judge. ``The airline has suffered 
enough and it is time that the pilots suffer along with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Kendall rhetorically asked Rich LaVoy, the union  
president: ``Do you all realize you may be killing the goose that 
lays the golden egg?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall also questioned LaVoy on how strongly pilots were urged  
to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our honest intent was to immediately get a message out,''  
LaVoy told the judge. ``Our pilots are intelligent people; I think 
they understand that a judge is a powerful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy also said he would do more to get members back on the job,  
even ``if I have to drive around with a loudspeaker on top of my 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't rocket science,'' the judge told the pilots at one  
point. ``Go back to work ...''

<HEADLINE> Moon Released by Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Warren Moon's last conversation with Mike  
Holmgren was brief and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that we'd made the decision to release him,'' the  
Seattle Seahawks coach-general manager said Thursday. ``He asked me 
if there was any chance I'd change my mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him no and I'd given it a lot of thought.''  
</P>
<P>
	So Moon, 42, won't be part of Holmgren's Seahawks next fall.  
</P>
<P>
	If he's going to continue his 15-year NFL career, it will have  
to be in a different city. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's decision left Jon Kitna as the only quarterback on  
the Seahawks' roster. John Friesz, who finished as the third-string 
Seattle quarterback last season, was released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna took over as the Seahawks' starting quarterback at the end  
of last season. It was an important factor in Holmgren's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to insult (Moon) in any way,'' he said. ``He  
doesn't deserve that. He's been a starter his whole career. Would 
he be real comfortable being a second-team player? It's something I 
had to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, a nine-time Pro Bowler who will turn 43 next season, said  
he only wanted to return if he could compete for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren decided to go with Kitna, who started the final five  
games of last season, and didn't want to pay $5 million to a backup 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to create a situation, particularly when  
I'm just starting out new here, that would be the least bit awkward 
or not real positive,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that that would happen necessarily. This way I think it's  
the cleanest way to go where everyone has a chance to try to do 
their thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon's release, along with those earlier in the week of Friesz,  
DT Dan Saleaumua and RB Steve Broussard, put the Seahawks $350,000 
under the NFL's salary cap before today's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon signed a two-year contract last August after the first  
holdout of his 15-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoyed my two years with the Seahawks and I want to  
thank (owner Paul Allen) for a wonderful opportunity,'' Moon said. 
``I remain optimistic that something can be worked out at a later 
date, but for now I'm going to consider my options, as are the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will, regardless of what happens in the future, maintain a  
strong presence in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon starred at the University of Washington in the 1970s before  
going to the CFL, where he played for six years in Edmonton. He 
moved to the NFL in 1984 when he signed with the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon is third in NFL history with 49,097 career passing yards,  
3,972 completions and 6,786 pass attempts. His 290 touchdown passes 
are tied for fourth-best with Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
	His seven games passing for 400 or more yards is tied for second  
in NFL history with Joe Montana and his 49 games with 300 or more 
passing yards is third best. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Moon's first season with the Seahawks, he set franchise  
records for completions (313) and yards (3,678) and was voted a 
first alternate to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg said the San Diego Chargers called  
Thursday to ask about both Moon and Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to aggressively pursue both options,'' Steinberg  
said. ``I think it will be a rapid process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Moon has options ranging from starting, starting  
for a team where there's a young quarterback to bring along, or 
being a backup. The middle option would apply with the Chargers, 
who need a veteran to help bring along Ryan Leaf, who was a rookie 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said he hasn't discussed specific roles with the  
Chargers, who were rebuffed by Moon two years ago.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators have ended their deliberations and  
are about to vote on the two impeachment counts against President 
Clinton. Senators spent the last few hours in private debate before 
a historic vote expected to acquit Bill Clinton and end the second 
presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott offered Democrats a long-shot opportunity to 
force a discussion of censure. There were signs that neither 
article of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury and 
obstruction of justice, would gain a majority of the 100 senators' 
votes.

<HEADLINE> Track Star Gets Life in Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Former Ohio State track star Chris Nelloms  
was sentenced Friday to life in prison for raping a young girl and 
will not be eligible for parole for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bitter pill to swallow when one of the chosen such as  
you falls so low,'' Judge John Kessler of Montgomery County Common 
Pleas Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler sentenced Nelloms to life on each of seven counts of  
rape of a child younger than 13 and one count of felonious sexual 
penetration of a child less than 13. The judge ordered that four of 
the sentences be served consecutively, making Nelloms ineligible 
for parole for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler also designated Nelloms a sexual predator, meaning  
Nelloms will be required upon release from prison to tell 
authorities where he will live. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms was convicted Jan. 8 of sexually assaulting the girl,  
now 12, in homes in Dayton and Lexington, Ky., from 1995 to 1997. 
Nelloms denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 12-year-old daughter was raped, and nobody knows what I'm  
going through,'' the girl's mother said before sentencing, turning 
her gaze to Nelloms. ``Maybe one day I can forgive him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, Nelloms sobbed as he addressed the judge.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms said he hopes someone ``will have mercy on me and  
forgive me and that my family will understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After sentencing, James Smith, Nelloms' father, said his son had  
told him he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son says he didn't do it. I do believe him,'' Smith said.  
``I'm waiting for something to break, something to give, so we can 
know what the truth is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Montgomery County prosecutor Angela Frydman called it  
a ``case of the most serious magnitude and consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A small child was raped, and a man manipulated her, frightened  
her and scared her into keeping that secret for quite some time,'' 
Frydman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 27, of Trotwood, set several school sprint records at  
Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Appeal State Farm Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A lawyer for six people in a  
class-action lawsuit accusing State Farm Insurance Co. of 
fraudulent sales practices said Friday he will appeal a $238 
million settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, State Farm would make varying payments --  
averaging about $1,300 -- to every one of the 3 million customers 
represented by the class action. However, those entitled to a 
larger award must undergo what lawyer Kenneth Nelson described as a 
confusing claim process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that will have the effect of discriminating against  
policy holders who are poor, disabled, elderly, unsophisticated -- 
in other words, the easiest targets for fraud,'' said Nelson, of 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Any appeal would only serve to stall State Farm's payments, said  
Tom Schneider, a State Farm lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean County Judge Ronald Dozier approved the settlement on  
Thursday. The lawsuit contended that State Farm cheated people 
while selling them whole life and universal life insurance policies 
from January 1982 to December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, State Farm agreed to settle the lawsuit in order to  
avoid a protracted trial. In Thursday's agreement, the company does 
not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Each member of the class will get the initial payment. Others  
who allege they are entitled to more must apply to an independent 
company. That neutral firm will determine the size of the 
additional award using an intricate scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, State Farm expects as few as 5 percent of those  
eligible for a larger award will apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, of the 3 million, only a handful  
are going to actually follow the claim relief procedure,'' said 
Robert Cummins, a Chicago lawyer who also objects to the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's only if the folks step through the hoops correctly.  
But my goodness, the folks in the complaints are elderly, 
unsophisticated people,'' Cummins said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is common for complicated, legalistic notices to deter  
members of a class-action from filing for a claim, said Robert 
Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a big, 65-page document, or 50 pages or something, and  
it's just incredibly intimidating,'' Hunter said. ``First of all, 
are you going to read it? And if you are, can you understand it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused State Farm of duping policy holders to  
switch policies and lose value; promising unrealistic returns on 
cash value policies; inflating dividend projections; and soliciting 
sales by referring to life insurance policies as ``investments'' 
and ``retirement plans.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Free Agent Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the first day of the 1999 free-agent period, another star  
decided to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Thomas, Miami's All-Pro middle linebacker, agreed to a  
$22.5 million, 5-year deal with the Dolphins on Friday, taking 
another attractive free agent off what is probably the thinnest 
market since the system started in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who has played three years, was only a restricted free  
agent, meaning Miami would have had the right to match any offer he 
got and get compensation in return. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dolphins were taking no chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about giving big bonuses and a big  
contract to a player,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``But with Zach, 
you're never going to be concerned about that because you know that 
every day, he's going to give 100 percent. He'll always make you 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins did get one player on Friday, obtaining running  
back Tyrone Wheatley from the New York Giants for a seventh-round 
draft choice. Wheatley, the Giants' first-round pick in 1995, was 
in trouble from the start with the two coaches for whom he played -- 
first Dan Reeves and then Jim Fassel -- and was active for only five 
games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the action was slow on the first day teams could make  
offers to free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason is that some had to make plans because the top  
players available were taken off the board by their own teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota re-signed safety Robert Griffith, who could have  
become a free agent and Green Bay did the same with defensive 
tackle Santana Dotson and linebacker George Koonce. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers Antonio Freeman of Green Bay and Rob Moore of  
Arizona were given franchise player tags, meaning their teams can 
match the offers or let them go for two first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	So was another receiver, Terrell Owens of San Francisco, a  
restricted free agent. The 49ers did that because they are too 
close to the salary cap to be able to match a huge offer from a 
team like expansion Cleveland. And Tampa Bay, seeking to keep a top 
pass rusher, put the franchise tag on defensive end Chidi Ahanotu. 
</P>
<P>
	The most desirable players left unrestricted include defensive  
backs Carnell Lake of Pittsburgh and Dale Carter of Kansas City; 
wide receiver J.J. Stokes of San Francisco; defensive end Chad 
Bratzke of the Giants; linebackers Jamir Miller of Arizona and Ed 
McDaniel of Minnesota; and offensive linemen Orlando Brown and 
Wally Williams of Baltimore and Dave Wohlabaugh of New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' designation of Moore left Miller on the market.  
But his agent, Steve Baker, suggested he would return to the desert 
if the price is anywhere closet to competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinals have a very good thing going,'' Baker said.  
``You're talking about a team that has more young defensive talent 
than any team in the league. You're talking a grass field. It's a 
very exciting situation. If Jamir wasn't a Cardinal, it would be a 
team he'd seriously look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One team, Washington, got some help from commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue, who ordered the trustees running the team to allow 
general manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner to make 
deals even though the league has yet to determine who will own the 
team. That allowed them to cut quarterback Gus Frerotte and begin 
work to re-sign quarterback Trent Green, whose decent play in his 
first season as a regular has led several other teams to consider 
signing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the busiest teams are the 49ers and Browns, who are  
somewhat intertwined because Cleveland is being run by Carmen 
Policy and Dwight Clark, who were with San Francisco as recently as 
a last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	They made one deal.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, continuing to cut salaries, sent defensive end Roy  
Barker and tight end Irv Smith to Cleveland for past 
considerations. But a deal to send backup quarterback Ty Detmer to 
the Browns was apparently put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams, meanwhile, continued to watch expansion  
Cleveland, which has $40 million in cap room left after its 
expansion draft -- far more than any other team. That allows them to 
outbid anyone for players, even if they have to overpay them, the 
main reason the 49ers protected Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what they are going to do,'' says Green Bay general  
manager Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't want to get hit with it.''

<HEADLINE> Warren Moon Looks for New Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Warren Moon, recently released by the Seattle  
Seahawks, has started working on a new game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon said Friday he has been contacted by seven NFL teams and  
there's a 60-70 per cent chance he'll play next season. If not, 
he'd like to join Houston businessman Bob McNair in his attempts to 
bring an NFL team to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal right now is to look at the teams that are interested  
in me and see if any of those situations really appeal to me,'' 
Moon told Houston TV station KRIV. ``I'm also hoping the Seattle 
situation will somehow resurface again because I really would like 
to finish my career there if possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, 42, was released Thursday by coach Mike Holmgren, who  
decided to go with Jon Kitna, who started the final five games of 
last season. Holmgren also didn't want to pay Moon $5 million in 
salary to be a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to remember that I went to Seattle the first time as a  
backup with the understanding I didn't even have a chance to 
compete for the starting job,'' Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
	If his playing career is over, Moon would like to help bring  
another NFL team to Houston where he played 10 seasons for the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a lot of different relationships within the  
league office at the top levels that could be beneficial,'' he 
said. ``I think I know a lot about the game that could be 
beneficial.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Awaits Gov't. Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry awaited a ruling today  
on whether the Commerce Department found evidence that Japan, 
Brazil and Russia illegally dumped steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary finding that producers from those countries sold  
steel in U.S. markets at prices dramatically below production costs 
or home-market prices is a key step that could lead to tariffs on 
the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports surged to record highs last year as the Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand abroad and forced foreign producers 
to seek U.S. outlets, often by selling goods at prices below the 
prevailing U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases before the Commerce Department specifically deal with  
hot-rolled carbon steel, a common product that can be used as is or 
turned into more specialized products such as auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 12-month period before the cases were filed in September,  
imports from Japan, Brazil and Russia accounted for 57 percent of 
all imports of hot-rolled carbon steel. 
</P>
<P>
	While the domestic producers accuse them of dumping, the foreign  
producers blame normal market factors, including devalued 
currencies abroad and a General Motors strike that temporarily 
lowered demand in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has pinned at least 10,000 layoffs and three  
company bankruptcies on the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	As Commerce continues its investigation, the department and its  
Russian counterpart have been holding talks aimed at settling the 
case with Russia without imposing tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement, which the U.S. industry opposes because it would  
lock in a certain amount of imports, could come within weeks and 
would not require industry's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil are not parties to such talks because of  
restrictions under international trade agreements. Russia, as a 
non-market economy, does not belong to the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Before any tariffs are imposed, Commerce would have to make a  
final dumping determination by late April and the U.S. 
International Trade Commission would have to find, by mid-June, 
that the imports injure or threaten to hurt the domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has urged President Clinton to go beyond the  
dumping cases, which target one country and one product at a time, 
and consider broader reviews that could lead to quotas or 
across-the-board steel tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, however, has been reluctant to take steps  
that could start a trade war and cut off foreign markets to U.S. 
exports of other goods. Any additional relief to prop up steel 
prices also could hurt heavy steel buyers in manufacturing and 
construction. The administration has generally favored letting the 
dumping cases run their course instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and steelworkers also have pressed their case  
before Congress, but legislation they seek have a tough time in a 
Republican Congress that favors free-trade policies.

<HEADLINE> WBC Champ Woodhall Is Set For Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWCASTLE, England (AP) -- WBC super-middleweight champion Richie  
Woodhall is far more confident of beating Vincenzo Nardiello 
Saturday than he was in winning his previous fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nardiello, the former champion, withdrew from their original  
match with a calf muscle injury a week before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the show alive, promoters put in Glenn Catley, who  
usually fights as a middleweight. Woodhall gave one of his worst 
performances, hanging onto the title on points and saying later he 
thought he'd lost the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall's explanation was that he'd been training all along to  
face a left-hander, Nardiello, and Catley, a crouching 
right-hander, made him pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Italian, who is the WBC's No. 1 contender, faces  
Woodhall on a card that has two other world title fights. WBO 
super-middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe of Britain defends against 
compatriot Robin Reid, and Mexico's Ruben Sanchez Leon risks the 
WBO featherweight title against Britain's Jason Booth. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall, whose only loss in 25 fights was a challenge to world  
champion Keith Holmes, knows he must put up a good show against 
Nardiello. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the title from South Africa's Sugar Boy Malinga with an  
impressive performance, then produced the poor effort against 
Catley in his first defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd boxed terribly and Glenn had sneaked it,''  
Woodhall said of his victory over Catley in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's time to get my career back on track. Nardiello's a  
Jekyll and Hyde ... On his day he'll give anyone a fight, but put 
him under pressure, and he folds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title has changed repeatedly in the past three years and  
Nardiello held it by outpointing Malinga in 1996. He then lost it 
to Reid, who was outpointed by Malinga who then lost to Woodhall. 
</P>
<P>
	If he beats Nardiello, who is ranked No. 1 by the WBC even  
though he hasn't fought in 16 months, Woodhall will be looking for 
a lucrative unification fight against either Calzaghe or Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Calzaghe is unbeaten in 25 matches, winning 23 by knockouts.  
Reid's loss to Malinga is his only defeat in 28 bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Calzaghe's third defense of the title he won by beating  
Chris Eubank in October 1997 and he is a strong favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all say it's going to be an easy fight,'' Reid said.  
``But it's not going to be easy at all. It's the biggest mistake 
you can make if you start thinking about the next fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leon-Booth fight was added when two more world title  
matches, Herbie Hide against Orlin Norris for the WBO heavyweight 
championship and Harry Simon against Kevin Lueshing for the WBO 
light-middleweight title were called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon is making the second defense of the title he won from  
Carlos Salazar of Argentina in August.

	Clinton Aquitted on Both Charges  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was acquitted on both  
articles of impeachment Friday by the Senate. Clinton ``hereby is 
acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to vote the 
two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Senators also put the 
idea of censure aside, probably for good. The first vote, on 
perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10 Republicans joining all 45 
Democrats voting not guilty. The second vote, on obstruction of 
justice, was 50-50, with five Republicans breaking ranks to join 
the Democrats. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Seeks Reconciliation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked forgiveness Friday as  
he declared his impeachment acquittal the start of ``reconciliation 
and renewal for America.'' Clinton said he is humbled and grateful 
for the support he has received from millions of Americans. ``I 
want to say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am 
for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the great 
burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American people,'' 
Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	US Said To Commit Troops to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce in his  
Saturday radio address that the United States is prepared to 
contribute ground troops to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians agree to a political settlement, a 
senior administration official said Friday night. Any decision to 
send U.S. troops would depend upon Serbs and ethnic Albanians 
reaching an agreement to end their fighting, U.S. officials said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 

</P>
<P>
	Judge To Rule Saturday on American  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge said he would rule Saturday on  
whether American Airlines' pilots be held in contempt for ignoring 
a back-to-work order as the nation's second-largest airline 
canceled hundreds of flights for all of the long holiday weekend. 
Stranded passengers fumed at airports across the country Friday as 
U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall heard arguments in his Dallas 
courtroom as to whether the Allied Pilots Association should be 
punished for disregarding an order he issued Wednesday. An 
estimated one out of every four American pilots called in sick 
Friday. 

</P>

	Snow Isolates Villages in Europe  
</P>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hundreds of villages were isolated  
Friday by massive snowfalls in central and eastern Europe. In 
Hungary, more than 200 communities were cut off, and the army was 
called in to ferry basic food supplies to the areas affected by the 
winter weather. More snow was expected, and winds gusted up to 60 
miles an hour, causing snowdrifts that halted several trains. In 
Bulgaria, 166 villages were without electricity after blizzards cut 
power lines, the news agency BTA reported. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Tourists Robbed in S. Africa  
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A 10-man gang armed with  
knives attacked a group of 19 American tourists who were visiting a 
preschool in a black township on Friday. The robbers interrupted a 
play being presented at the school, forcing Americans who sat in 
the audience with local children to empty their pockets and hand 
over passports, jewelry and cameras, said Inspector Gideon 
Thessner, the police spokesman. There were no injuries. 

</P>
<P>
	Six Bodies Found in Okla. Apartment  
</P>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A man shot his estranged girlfriend, their  
three young children and his mother before turning the gun on 
himself, police said Friday. Police found all six bodies in the 
living room of a small apartment. There were no signs of a struggle 
or that anyone had tried to flee the room. Authorities feel certain 
it was a murder-suicide because the gun was located near the body 
of the children's father, 23-year-old Edwin Bell. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Fall; Dow Loses 88.57  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Friday, led by a decline in  
technology shares. The Dow dropped 88.57 to close at 9,274.89. On 
the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,235-824. Broader stock indicators 
also fell, including the technology-laden Nasdaq, which was down 
83.61 at 2,321.94.

	Spurs Beat 76ers 98-94  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's highest-scoring game since  
his rookie year wasn't enough to keep the Philadelphia 76ers 
undefeated. Iverson scored 46 points, tying Grant Hill for the most 
in an NBA game this season, but it was Spurs reserve Malik Rose who 
set a career scoring high as San Antonio snapped a three-game 
losing streak by beating the 76ers 98-94 Friday night. Rose scored 
22 points, shooting 10-for-12 from the field before a sizable 
contingent of family and friends, to help the Spurs overcome a 
horrendous foul shooting performance and a below-average night from 
David Robinson and Tim Duncan.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds HIV Exclusion Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A karate school owner did not violate the  
rights of an HIV-infected boy by refusing to admit him to a 
rough-and-tumble class in which blood is routinely shed, a federal 
appeals court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
unanimously ruled that the U.S.A. Bushidokan karate school was not 
obligated to admit Michael Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's lawyer, Terry Raney, had argued that the boy's  
exclusion violated his rights under the Americans With Disabilities 
Act. School owner James P. Radcliffe II said the boy's 
participation in the class would endanger instructors and other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The school had offered the boy private karate lessons, but his  
parents refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Raney did not return a phone call.

<HEADLINE> Swedes Cut Key Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM (AP) -- The Swedish central bank cut three key lending  
rates on Friday, citing lower inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riksbank said its latest inflation outlook for Sweden  
suggests price pressure has cooled since December. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it said ``international economic activity and  
inflationary pressure have also been dampened, which probably means 
that in the coming two years economic activity and inflation in 
Sweden will be somewhat weaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Riksbank said its repurchase rate will be lowered to 3.15  
percent from 3.40 percent, the deposit rate be reduced to 2.75 
percent from 3.255 percent and its lending rate will lowered to 
4.25 percent from 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be effective Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gone were his defiant glare, wagging finger  
and angry tone. President Clinton asked forgiveness in plain, sober 
words as he declared his impeachment acquittal Friday the start of 
``reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the Senate cleared him of charges in the  
13-month-long Monica Lewinsky investigation, Clinton stepped from 
an Oval Office now secure as his for the next two years to deliver 
his response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spring-like breeze lifted the gray hair at his temple. A trio  
of remote-controlled news cameras hidden low in the planters behind 
him captured the picture of Clinton, as a towering survivor, facing 
reporters in the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The conquering image did not fit the words.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is humbled and grateful for the support he has  
received from millions of Americans consumed by scandal and 
investigation and legal argument and, ultimately, his impeachment -- 
``the process,'' as he called it -- by the House for perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the five-week trial as the Senate's  
``constitutional responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope ALL Americans -- here in  
Washington and throughout our land -- will rededicate ourselves to 
the work of serving our nation and building our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finished, he turned and had one foot on the bottom stone step as  
ABC's Sam Donaldson boomed, ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive 
and forget? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused and nodded before pivoting back to the  
microphone. ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to 
be prepared to give it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Save the placement of his presidential lectern near the saucer  
magnolia that shades the Oval Office, Clinton's appearance Friday 
bore no resemblance to the defiant show of force that he, Vice 
President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly 100 
House Democrats staged after the Dec. 19 impeachment vote by the 
Republican majority that controls the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Clinton faced cameras with a set jaw and denounced the  
``poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity 
and uncontrolled anger.'' Republicans and some Democrats bristled 
at what they saw as a victory rally in the face of disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Clinton exhorted, ``This can be and this must be a time of  
reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to his staff, Clinton apologized for how his  
scandal made their work harder. ``The best way I can repay you is 
to redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we share,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady kept to the White House residence with her  
mother, some friends and informal business meetings. ``Like the 
rest of us, she's relieved,'' her spokeswoman said. Gore, who hopes 
to take over in two years, was making campaign-style stops in 
Albany, N.Y. He called the Senate votes ``a reaffirmation of the 
wisdom of our founders and their design of our Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton penned the 82-second statement himself, starting it  
Thursday night and polishing it the next morning after his daily 
workout, even as the ``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' roll was called 
on Capitol Hill. He ran his draft by a handful of top advisers, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not watch on television, but got the final tallies,  
including a list of ``who had voted which way,'' in two short 
telephone calls from chief of staff John Podesta, said press 
secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has insisted Clinton will not seek political  
revenge on those who condemned him. Lockhart stammered, then, when 
pressed Friday to say why Clinton got a senator-by-senator 
accounting of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be a relevant piece of information at the time  
and John chose to pass it on,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading up to the trial's predictable finale, senators warned  
the White House against any semblance of gloating. The White House 
complied and only described Clinton as relieved and back to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent the hour after his statement attending briefing on  
his trip to Mexico this weekend. Then he quietly telephoned his 
thanks to key Senate supporters.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Mark Price Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Price could have played another season, but  
he was frustrated by the injuries, weary of all the moving around 
and anxious to get on with the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	So, one of the greatest shooters in NBA history announced his  
retirement Friday, ending a 12-year career that included four 
All-Star games, a spot on Dream Team II and some memorable battles 
with Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time,'' Price said during a news conference at Alexander  
Memorial Coliseum, where he starred for Georgia Tech in the 1980s. 
``My wife and I are expecting our fourth child in two weeks, there 
has been a lot of wear and tear and we have made four moves in the 
last four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who will turn 35 on Monday, had offers from several teams  
to return for another season. But he was leaning toward retirement 
after being waived in June by the Orlando Magic, and the lockout 
clinched his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to know when to say when, and now is the perfect  
time,'' Price said. ``It makes me feel good to step down when it's 
my choice and not because nobody wants me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6-foot and 180 pounds, Price was hardly an imposing  
presence on the court. But his uncanny shooting touch earned him a 
spot in the NBA, and he became a star by honing his passing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history  
(.904) and shot better than 40 percent from 3-point range. He 
finished with career averages of 15.2 points and 6.7 assists per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Price spent his first nine seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers,  
making the All-Star game in 1989 and 1992-94. He was a member of 
Dream Team II, which won the world championship in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the greatest shooter in NBA history,'' said Brad  
Daugherty, a teammate of Price's for eight seasons in Cleveland. 
``If I needed someone to take a shot at the end of the game, it 
would be Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Cavaliers hit their prime about the same time  
as Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Five times, Cleveland lost to the Bulls in the playoffs,  
including a memorable first-round series in 1989 when Jordan hit 
the winning shot at the buzzer in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some great teams in Cleveland,'' said Price, whose  
Cavalier teammates also included Ron Harper and Larry Nance. ``But 
we happened to come along when one of the best players in the game 
was at his peak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Price made a name for himself by helping transform  
woebegone teams into winners. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Enid, Okla., he signed with Georgia Tech in 1982  
when the school was at the bottom of the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
Three years later, they won the league championship and reached the 
regional finals of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Price is the third-leading scorer in school history (2,193  
points) and the career leader in steals (240). 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark came here at a time when we were real, real low,''  
Georgia Tech coach Bobby Cremins said. ``We needed somebody really 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price was picked by Dallas in the second round of the 1986  
draft, then dealt immediately to Cleveland. He was starting over 
again, going to a team known derisively as the ``Cadavers'' after 
eight straight losing seasons, including a 29-53 mark the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1989, the Cavaliers had the second-best record in the NBA  
(57-25) and seemed ready to challenge for the title. But they 
couldn't get by the Bulls in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Michael doesn't hit that shot in Game 5, I think we have a  
legitimate chance to win the NBA championship,'' Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers reached the 1992 Eastern Conference finals after  
eliminating Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics. Once again, though, 
Jordan and the Bulls were standing in the way, beating Cleveland in 
six games and going on to win the second of their six championships 
in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jordan, injuries plagued Price throughout his  
career. He played only 16 games in 1990-91 after tearing up his 
knee and a broken wrist limited him to 48 games during his final 
season in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was traded to Washington in 1995 but played in just seven  
games because of a foot injury. The following season, after signing 
with Golden State, he broke a bone in his wrist. Traded to the 
Magic in 1997, he was hampered by a thumb injury but still averaged 
9.5 points and 4.7 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark should be very proud of what he accomplished,'' said  
Lenny Wilkens, who coached Price for seven seasons in Cleveland. 
``I just wish he could have played a little longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who lives in suburban Atlanta, hasn't decided what he  
wants to do with the rest of his life, but it will probably involve 
basketball in some form. He also looks forward to spending more 
time with his wife, Laura, and their growing family. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his playing career, Price said he hopes to be remembered  
simply as someone who ``gave it everything I had when I stepped on 
the court. I would not have made it otherwise.''

<HEADLINE> Votes Are Followed by Giddiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Senators, how say you?'' asked Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist, reading from a script rarely used in American 
history, used only once before to decide the fate of an impeached 
president. ``Is the respondent, William Jefferson Clinton guilty or 
not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Abraham!'' called out the clerk.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., rose, straightened his jacket,  
looked toward Rehnquist. ``Guilty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One at a time, in alphabetical order, glum senators stood to  
declare themselves -- the most difficult votes, a number have said, 
of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after 40 minutes, the atmosphere turned upside down.  
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, senators were almost giddy. Shaking hands. Slapping  
backs. Congratulating each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Laughing at the chief justice over a line that probably only a  
senator could find funny: ``The chair wishes to make a brief 
statement -- without objection, I trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No objection, none at all from these 100.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a stranger to the great majority of you,'' Rehnquist  
began, describing his ``culture shock'' in moving from the 
structured Supreme Court to the more freeform environment of the 
Senate. ``I leave you now a wiser, but not a sadder, man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from senatorial faces, it wasn't a pleasant experience  
for any of them. It had been a 21-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the two votes -- the first on the article charging  
Clinton with perjury, the second on the article charging him with 
obstructing justice -- Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sat beside 
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in a whispered huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd reached for his eyeglasses, then into his left breast  
pocket and fished out a passport-sized copy of the Constitution. 
The two men, practically sitting cheek-to-cheek, hovered over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators stared ahead, slumped in their seats. Some read  
papers or scribbled in notepads as the roll was called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Boxer!''  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a Clinton in-law by way of her  
daughter's marriage to the first lady's brother, rose and said, 
``Not guilty.'' She sat back down, folded her hands on top of her 
mahogany desk and twiddled her thumbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Collins!''  
</P>
<P>
	``Not guilty,'' said a nervous-sounding Sen. Susan Collins,  
R-Maine, breaking party ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Others tracked the vote on long, narrow, lined tally sheets with  
columns to record each senator's ``yea'' or ``nay.'' Names of the 
Democratic senators are printed in bold type; Republican names are 
in light print. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time it was Sen. Arlen Specter's turn, the Pennsylvania  
Republican stood and said, ``Not proven, therefore not guilty.'' 
The response brought a bit of laughter. Specter had previous said 
he was tempted to vote that way. He was recorded as voting not 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	At a table in the well of the Senate were the House managers,  
the 13 Judiciary Committee Republicans who had prosecuted the case. 
Apparently resigned to defeat, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., read from a 
stack of papers in front of him; others tallied the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	A short distance away, White House defense lawyers did the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen House members lined the rear walls, joining Rep.  
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a daily visitor during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., last in the alphabet, closed  
both roll calls, voting ``not guilty'' on each article. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William  
Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the charges in 
the said articles,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist got a standing ovation. Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., then presented the chief justice with a golden gavel 
-- a traditional token given for presiding over the Senate for 100 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said ``I'm not sure it quite reached a hundred hours, but  
it's close enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like it,'' replied Rehnquist.  
</P>
<P>
	The senators laughed. The president's trial and their ordeal was  
over.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquitted on Both Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson  
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month 
drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only 
the second presidential impeachment trial in history. The vote 
allows the 42nd president to finish his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that William Jefferson  
Clinton be and hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said 
articles,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing Clinton  
of obstruction of justice, far short of the two-thirds required for 
conviction. Earlier, senators rejected the charge of perjury by a 
55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a  
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the votes, Rehnquist banged his gavel to end the  
five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote. Aides  
said he did not watch it on television. The final votes were 
broadcast by the networks to a nation long since weary of the 
proceedings 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton  
guilty or not guilty?'' Rehnquist said to a hushed chamber, 
beginning the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared  
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of  
Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted 
Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators opposing the obstruction article were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Snowe and Specter.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott offered Democrats a long-shot  
opportunity to force a discussion of censure immediately after the 
trial ended -- a reminder that even in acquittal Clinton would be 
forever tarnished as the second president in history to be 
impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,  
were opened for a final vote shortly after noon EST. Before the 
votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were read for a final 
time. Lott declared it was time for senators to fulfill their 
``obligation under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final outcome of the votes was known for days as five  
moderate Republicans announced in advance that they planned to vote 
against both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators thanked the chief justice for presiding over the trial  
and presented him with a gavel on a plaque. He said he was leaving 
the Senate chamber a ``wiser but not a sadder man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers exited the chamber, shaking hands with senators  
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the inevitable acquittal, senators wanted the public  
to know they abhorred the president's conduct in concealing his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,  
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt 
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life,'' said Sen. 
Collins, who today became the fifth Republican to announce an 
intention to vote for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also had sharp words for the president. ``The  
president's self-indulgent actions were immoral, disgraceful, 
reprehensible. History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that 
William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office 
in our American democracy,'' said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes complete a drama that has riveted official  
Washington, roiled a midterm congressional election and worn out 
the patience of the American public. ``The Senate will resume final 
deliberations now in the closed session, thank goodness,'' Lott 
said at the start of today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	After the votes on the articles, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., was allowed to introduce a motion to censure the 
president and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the most vocal opponent of 
the rebuke, offered a rival motion to kill the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein's proposal called Clinton's conduct ``shameful,  
reckless and indefensible'' and accused him of giving false or 
misleading testimony and ``impeding discovery of evidence in 
judicial proceedings.'' The California senator said, however, she 
did not have enough support to bring the matter to a vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	After acquittal, Clinton will not remain without troubles: He  
could face indictment, while in office or after his term, by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and must finish his remaining 
months in office facing a GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him 
evicted from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured for the first time videotaped testimony on  
the Senate floor and provided the world its first good look at Ms. 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A national TV audience was 
able to watch as 13 House impeachment managers, all Republicans, 
argued that Clinton deserved to be thrown out of office, while 
White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings;  
furtive sex acts between the president and Ms. Lewinsky near the 
Oval Office; late night phone calls between the president and the 
intern and, most damning for Clinton, a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Starr's findings, the House approved one article of  
impeachment accusing the president of lying to a federal grand jury 
on Aug. 17, 1998, about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The second charge said Clinton obstructed justice by trying to  
have Ms. Lewinsky sign a false affidavit in the Jones case; by a 
job search conducted by presidential friend Vernon Jordan; by the 
retrieval of presidential gifts by Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie and the alleged ``coaching'' of Mrs. Currie by the president 
for her grand jury appearance.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gone were his defiant glare, wagging finger  
and angry tone. President Clinton asked forgiveness in plain, sober 
words as he declared his impeachment acquittal Friday the start of 
``reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the Senate cleared him of charges in the  
13-month-long Monica Lewinsky investigation, Clinton stepped from 
an Oval Office now secure as his for the next two years to deliver 
his response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spring-like breeze lifted the gray hair at his temple. A trio  
of remote-controlled news cameras hidden low in the planters behind 
him captured the picture of Clinton, as a towering survivor, facing 
reporters in the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The conquering image did not fit the words.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is humbled and grateful for the support he has  
received from millions of Americans consumed by scandal and 
investigation and legal argument and, ultimately, his impeachment -- 
``the process,'' as he called it -- by the House for perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the five-week trial as the Senate's  
``constitutional responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope ALL Americans -- here in  
Washington and throughout our land -- will rededicate ourselves to 
the work of serving our nation and building our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finished, he turned and had one foot on the bottom stone step as  
ABC's Sam Donaldson boomed, ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive 
and forget? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused and nodded before pivoting back to the  
microphone. ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to 
be prepared to give it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Save the placement of his presidential lectern near the saucer  
magnolia that shades the Oval Office, Clinton's appearance Friday 
bore no resemblance to the defiant show of force that he, Vice 
President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly 100 
House Democrats staged after the Dec. 19 impeachment vote by the 
Republican majority that controls the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Clinton faced cameras with a set jaw and denounced the  
``poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity 
and uncontrolled anger.'' Republicans and some Democrats bristled 
at what they saw as a victory rally in the face of disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Clinton exhorted, ``This can be and this must be a time of  
reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to his staff, Clinton apologized for how his  
scandal made their work harder. ``The best way I can repay you is 
to redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we share,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady kept to the White House residence with her  
mother, some friends and informal business meetings. ``Like the 
rest of us, she's relieved,'' her spokeswoman said. Gore, who hopes 
to take over in two years, was making campaign-style stops in 
Albany, N.Y. He called the Senate votes ``a reaffirmation of the 
wisdom of our founders and their design of our Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton penned the 82-second statement himself, starting it  
Thursday night and polishing it the next morning after his daily 
workout, even as the ``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' roll was called 
on Capitol Hill. He ran his draft by a handful of top advisers, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not watch on television, but got the final tallies,  
including a list of ``who had voted which way,'' in two short 
telephone calls from chief of staff John Podesta, said press 
secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has insisted Clinton will not seek political  
revenge on those who condemned him. Lockhart stammered, then, when 
pressed Friday to say why Clinton got a senator-by-senator 
accounting of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be a relevant piece of information at the time  
and John chose to pass it on,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading up to the trial's predictable finale, senators warned  
the White House against any semblance of gloating. The White House 
complied and only described Clinton as relieved and back to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent the hour after his statement attending briefing on  
his trip to Mexico this weekend. Then he quietly telephoned his 
thanks to key Senate supporters.

<HEADLINE> Tripp: Lewinsky Still Protects Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp's lawyer pulled back Friday from a  
statement she made in a television interview that raised questions 
about the accuracy of testimony prosecutor Kenneth Starr gave 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said on NBC's ``Today'' show that she may have told  
Starr's FBI agents on a crucial day in the investigation of 
President Clinton that she was preparing to talk to lawyers for 
Paula Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, later said she never  
specified to the FBI that it was anyone from the Jones camp she 
would be meeting with. Starr testified to Congress that his office 
was unaware of the contact with the Jones lawyers. And Mrs. Tripp 
also has testified she didn't inform Starr's office of her 
impending meeting with the Jones lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton supporters have suggested that Starr's prosecutors knew  
their key witness was funneling information to Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
about Clinton and Monica Lewinsky the night before the president's 
Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that the prosecutors knew'' about her Jones  
lawyer contacts, Mrs. Tripp told NBC. ``I may have mentioned to one 
or two of the agents ... that I needed to get home because I had an 
interview with the Paula Jones attorneys.'' But Starr's office 
didn't know in a ``formal way'' that she was in meeting with the 
Jones lawyers, Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the heat of a live interview, it's possible that Linda was  
less than perfectly clear,'' lawyer Zaccagnini said subsequently. 
``Linda maintains that she never advised'' Starr's office ``of the 
fact that she was meeting with the Jones attorneys. She believes 
that she mentioned to the agent transporting her that day that she 
was in a hurry because she had to attend an interview. She never 
told that agent it was an interview with the Jones attorneys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Mrs. Tripp, Starr testified last Nov. 19 to the House  
Judiciary Committee that ``to the best of my knowledge, we did not 
have any information that she was, in fact, communicating with the 
Jones attorneys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about her contacts with Mrs. Jones' lawyers, Mrs. Tripp  
said ``they approached me,'' but she did not deny that she brought 
up Ms. Lewinsky's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you asking me did I want this behavior exposed?  
Absolutely,'' said Mrs. Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, she told The New York Times that a Jones lawyer  
contacted her after getting her unlisted number from New York book 
agent Lucianne Goldberg, who came up with the idea for Mrs. Tripp 
to tape her phone calls with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also said she believes that Ms. Lewinsky is  
concealing information that would hurt Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is that Monica continues to protect the president  
.. on the perjury and on the obstruction'' articles of impeachment 
on which Clinton was acquitted Friday, Mrs. Tripp told NBC. ``Who 
is going to contradict her? The president? I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith said the former White House  
intern will respond to Mrs. Tripp's comments at an appropriate 
time. Ms. Lewinsky currently is forbidden by Starr's office from 
talking to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Times, Mrs. Tripp said she does not  
believe Ms. Lewinsky's story that she alone created a document of 
``talking points'' that spelled out how Mrs. Tripp could give 
testimony that would be helpful to Clinton in the Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, whose tape recordings triggered the Lewinsky  
scandal, told the Times she believes the document was ``dictated by 
a senior White House official'' whom Mrs. Tripp refused to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that Monica wrote those on her own is about as  
likely as her co-authoring the Gettysburg Address with Lincoln,'' 
Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also said she does not believe Ms. Lewinsky's story  
that the president first brought up the subject of filing an 
affidavit in the Jones case in a 2 a.m. phone call Dec. 17, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality was, there had been talk about how to take care of  
that affidavit prior to that,'' Mrs. Tripp told NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denied a sexual relationship with the  
president.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Confirms Elizabethtown Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETHTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- The NCAA on Friday agreed that  
Elizabethtown became the first women's college basketball team to 
win 800 games after a discrepancy with record books. 
</P>
<P>
	Division III Elizabethtown reached the milestone Thursday after  
defeating Western Maryland 68-49, NCAA statistician Jenifer 
Scheibler said. NCAA records had showed that the Blue Jays only had 
796 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	But after recounting the wins in the program's 71-year history,  
Elizabethtown (19-2) found that their 19th win this season would be 
their 800th, a claim the NCAA accepts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask schools for corrections on the record books all the  
time,'' said Sheibler, who added that the number would not be 
corrected in the official record book until the next volume is 
published later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which is Division I, is next on the win list with  
779. No other NCAA women's program has 700 wins.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Auction Draws Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Potential bidders expressed qualms  
about buying O.J. Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the 
collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the whole thing a little bit sad, to take away the  
Heisman Trophy,'' said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles, who came to 
view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on 
Friday. ``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college  
football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned. The catalog 
noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as 
``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the  
Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said  
Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the 
Butterfield and Butterfield auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home  
at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. They 
won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the 
murders in criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred  
Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he 
would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to  
help satisfy the $33.5 million civil court judgment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown  
pockets,'' Beardsley said. ``I believe he's not responsible for 
this crime, and I think there are a lot of people who believe 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery  
were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson 
during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No. 
32 football jerseys; oriental carpets; paintings and Tiffany-style 
lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned  
by Simpson's first wife, Marguerite.

<HEADLINE> US Rules Brazil, Japan Dump Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs of up to  
71 percent following a Clinton administration ruling Friday that 
they may have illegally dumped steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary finding that producers from those countries sold  
steel in U.S. markets at prices dramatically below production costs 
or home-market prices triggers a full investigation that could lead 
to tariffs by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the U.S. Customs Service will collect cash  
deposits or bonds from imports to cover any duties later applied 
retroactively. Commerce Secretary William Daley said the steel 
industry would get immediate relief as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports surged to record highs last year. The Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand abroad and forced foreign producers 
to seek U.S. outlets, often by selling goods at prices below the 
prevailing U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration still faces difficult choices about  
how exactly to respond to complaints from U.S. steel companies and 
workers' unions. The industry is seeking stronger trade sanctions 
from the administration and in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of further aggravating a troubled Russian economy, the  
Commerce Department held off announcing findings in a similar 
complaint against that country, saying the United States could 
reach a settlement agreement by next week to avert tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal complaints made to the Commerce Department by the  
American steel industry specifically deal with hot-rolled carbon 
steel, a common product that can be used as is or turned into more 
specialized products such as auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints against a less common but important product,  
cut-to-length plate, are expected as early as Tuesday. Several 
cases also have been filed covering stainless steel, with duties 
already imposed in some of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Brazil and Russia  
jumped more than 60 percent during the first six months of 1998, 
compared to the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. producers blame at least 10,000 layoffs and three  
company bankruptcies on the import surge. But, while U.S. steel 
producers accuse the foreign producers of dumping, the exporters 
blame normal market factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujio Ono, chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center,  
called the dumping charges ``unjustified, ill-considered and 
counterproductive'' and said those same market forces ``are working 
to lower imports without government intervention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are already signs that imports dropped in December because  
of fears of retroactive tariffs from Japan and Russia, and Friday's 
ruling could begin to lower imports from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department found that goods from Japan may have  
been sold at up to 68 percent below the fair value and from Brazil 
at up to 71 percent. The government also found that Brazil may have 
illegally subsidized its producers, driving down the price of steel 
by up to 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has urged President Clinton to go beyond the  
dumping cases, which target one country and one product at a time, 
and consider broader reviews that could lead to quotas or 
across-the-board steel tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry and their supporters in Congress found hope in the  
preliminary dumping determinations but opposed the Russian talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really saying in order to further our initiative in  
foreign policy in Russia, we're willing to sacrifice American 
steelworkers jobs,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of 
the House steel caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the ruling ``represents only  
a small step toward stopping the flood of cheap imports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although labor unions are traditional allies of Democrats,  
Clinton has also been a strong supporter of free trade, pushing 
other countries to open up their markets to U.S. exports.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Jeered at Funeral Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mourners booed and jeered Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
outside a mosque where services were held Friday for a West African 
immigrant whose killing by police has heightened tensions between 
the black community and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A grim-faced Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
arrived at the Islamic Center of New York just as the funeral 
service for Amadou Diallo was ending. The mayor and Safir were told 
to come at 1:45 p.m., but the memorial began at 1:30 p.m., said 
Giuliani spokeswoman Cristyne Lategano. 
</P>
<P>
	Straining against police barricades, hundreds of overflow  
mourners taunted Giuliani and Safir as they entered the mosque 
through a side door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do you treat a black man like a dog?'' one man shouted at  
the mayor. Dozens more chanted, ``We want justice!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, a black 22-year-old street merchant, was killed Feb. 4  
when four white officers from an elite street-crime unit fired 41 
bullets at him inside the vestibule of his South Bronx apartment 
building, hitting him 19 times. Diallo was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The still-unexplained killing, which has sparked heated protests  
calling for the officers' arrest, is being investigated by a Bronx 
grand jury. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White disclosed Friday that the 
FBI and federal criminal and civil rights prosecutors have been 
investigating since the day after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the mayor and police commissioner arrived,  
Diallo's coffin was carried out of the mosque, and most of the 
crowd left. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim leader Khalid Abdul Muhammed, whose group clashed with  
police during last summer's Million Youth March in Harlem, led a 
small rally outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time to speak the language of those whose language  
is killing,'' said Muhammed, a former aide to Nation of Islam 
leader Louis Farrakhan. ``This is the time for an eye for an eye, a 
tooth for a tooth, a limb for a limb, a life for a life. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will be having funeral processions in the white community.  
... They shoot one of ours 41 times, we'll shoot 41 of theirs, one 
time,'' he said, surrounded by a half dozen followers wearing black 
ski masks. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered and raised their fists, yelling, ``Black  
Power!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the simple wooden coffin bearing Diallo's body was borne  
from the mosque, the crowd surged forward. ``Allah Akbar'' -- ``God 
is great,'' they cried, standing on tiptoes to touch the coffin, 
which teetered on the pallbearers' upreached hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo will be buried in his native country, Guinea.  
</P>
<P>
	The slain man's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, dressed in white  
mourning garb, remained dry-eyed throughout the two-hour service. 
``There will be no more tears,'' mosque security guard Saana 
Malik-Newton quoted her as saying. ``I did all my crying on the way 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with Muslim tradition, Mrs. Diallo was sequestered in  
an upstairs section reserved for several hundred women. Thousands 
more knelt and chanted Muslim prayers for 90 minutes before the 
memorial service began. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't measure the good of a life by how long you live but  
how you live, and his life he lived well,'' David Dinkins, New York 
City's first black mayor, told mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo was described by those who knew him as a shy and  
religious man who eked out a living selling videotapes on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	What prompted the officers to open fire has not been disclosed.  
No one but the officers saw the shooting, and they have not yet 
been interviewed. An attorney for the officers said they believed 
Diallo had a gun. Police found only a beeper and Diallo's wallet at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``May Allah have mercy on their souls,'' sad the slain man's  
father, Saikou Diallo, referring to the four officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Majid, 47, who knew Diallo from the neighborhood where  
they both lived, came to the service with his 2-year-old son Hasan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in a civilized society. When we can treat a human  
being like this it's a sad thing,'' he said, holding his son in his 
arms. ``What will we teach our children?''

<HEADLINE> Airline Dispute Frustrates Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With cruise ships returning to port, a big boat  
show in town, and thousands of American Airlines passengers 
stranded, Miami hotel rooms are scarce and frustration is mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Fran Turowetz of Hyannisport, Mass., was supposed to begin a  
$6,000 vacation in Barbados with her husband and three small 
children on Wednesday. She got only as far as Miami by Thursday and 
was spending Friday on line at Miami International Airport, 
wondering about the roughly $3,000 she put down for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know who to blame,'' Mrs. Turowetz said as her  
children sought coloring books for entertainment, instead of a 
tropical beach. ``People wait a year for a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was one of 450,000 passengers that the nation's  
second-largest airline said were stranded or delayed as pilots 
continued to call in sick in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline claimed upset passengers revolted in Miami on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a near-riot in Miami and they had to close a ticket  
counter in New York,'' American's lawyer, Dee Kelly, told a federal 
judge at a Dallas hearing Friday on whether the pilots should be 
held in contempt for ignoring a back-to-work order. Miami airport 
police did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall promised a ruling Saturday and  
suggested union officials spend ``a productive evening'' on the 
telephone telling pilots to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers stranded in Miami found hotels were fully booked.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only American. We also have the boat show going on in  
town,'' said Ronald Fabany, front office manager at the Best 
Western Miami International Airport Inn. ``It's made it kind of 
difficult to accommodate the people from American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for every person who canceled a room reservation because  
they couldn't get a flight to Miami, rooms were quickly filled by 
people who couldn't fly out, said Luis Clavero, a supervisor at the 
Courtyard by Marriott South. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken and Susan Higbee sat at the airport after returning from a  
Carnival cruise to Mexico, hoping their flight home to Michigan 
would not be canceled. So far, Higbee's frustration is mild, about 
the same intensity as the pale pink sunburn on his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I'm still here tomorrow, I'll change my story  
completely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple survived last year's Northwest Airlines strike by  
canceling a flight and driving 10 hours from Michigan to North 
Carolina to make sure they made a friend's 40th birthday party. And 
they say this year, American, which gave them a bottle of water and 
a boarding pass after a 1 1/2-hour wait in line, has been more 
responsive to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it's better this time,'' Higbee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnival's passengers aren't the only ones being affected.  
</P>
<P>
	Royal Caribbean expects 15,200 passengers to arrive for cruises  
leaving from South Florida and Puerto Rico this weekend -- and at 
least 1,740 of them are booked on American. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't make their ships, ``They direct their anger  
perhaps at us. At least we share their anger,'' said Royal 
Caribbean spokesman Rich Steck. ``It's a goodwill issue more than a 
financial issue for the cruise lines, though undoubtedly it's going 
to cost us a considerable amount of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise line is being reimbursed by American for the cost of  
chartering six planes Friday at a cost of ``several hundred 
thousand dollars,'' Steck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also has reimbursed individual passengers for their  
hotel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McLaughlin, a Royal Caribbean passenger, is back in the  
United States from a five-day cruise to the Bahamas and hopes to 
make it home to Dubuque, Iowa, in time for work at 7 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hearing a lot of different stories,'' he said.  
``Right now they say the flight is on, but it could be canceled 
anytime. We're getting mixed messages. You don't know what to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin is frustrated with the wait, and the only thing that  
will relieve the tension is traveling those 1,525 miles from Miami 
to Dubuque, no matter how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just so we get out of here, everything will be fine,''  
McLaughlin said. ``I'd drive from here if they'd let me have the 
car.''

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son To Be Tried for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer legend Pele  
is to be tried for murder, his lawyer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele's son, Edilson Cholbi do Nascimento, 27, and Marcilio Jose  
Marinho de Melo, 24, are accused of killing a motorcyclist by 
smashing into him when racing their cars, said Vicente Cascione. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Simoes Neto, a 50-year-old retiree, was thrown from his  
motorcycle and killed in Oct. 1992 in Santos, a port town 48 miles 
southeast of Sao Paulo, said Cascione. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will prove that Pele's son had nothing to do with this car  
race,'' Cascione said. ``He passed by after the crash had happened 
and actually stopped his car and tried to help the victim. I think 
witnesses got the wrong impression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cascione alleged that Melo had run into the motorcyclist but  
``was not to blame'' for his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an accident caused by the imprudence of the  
motorcyclist,'' alleged Cascione. ``He went over a crossroads 
without stopping when Melo's car was crossing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Melo will be tried by a jury at a court in Santos  
probably in May, said Cascione, who will only represent Nascimento. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the time this kind of accident would be seen as  
involuntary manslaughter,'' said Cascione. ``But it's a trend in 
Brazil that death by imprudent driving is considered as murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five judges at the Justice Tribunal of Sao Paulo on Friday ruled  
Nascimento and Melo should be charged with murder, said the 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Nascimento and Melo) will respond to a charge of  
murder,'' prosecutor Octavio Borba de Vasconcelos Filho said. 
``They assumed the risk of driving in the way they did, knowing 
they could have knocked someone down and killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento is a reserve team goalie for Santos, the Brazilian  
first division side his father used to play for. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele's given name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento.

<HEADLINE> Study Confirms Agent Orange Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of what has been done to determine  
how Agent Orange and other herbicides affected Vietnam veterans 
confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but 
leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended 
24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's independent report by the Institute of Medicine  
appears to offer no new evidence that would affect benefits for 
Vietnam War veterans or their offspring, although the Department of 
Veterans Affairs said the study will be valuable for further 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite continuing investigation into possible links to birth  
defects, diabetes and a list of other illnesses, no scientific 
studies over the last two years has provided enough information to 
draw significant new conclusions about whether herbicides are 
linked to any condition, study director Dr. David Tollerud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Affairs, which issued a statement praising the  
``thorough and impartial work of the committee,'' offers special 
compensation for 10 diseases listed as linked or possibly linked to 
herbicide used in Vietnam whether veterans can prove exposure or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Children of veterans also may receive benefits for the birth  
defect spina bifida, whose link is listed as ``limited or 
suggestive,'' but diabetes is not included. Evidence of a diabetes 
link to herbicides or dioxin is listed as still ``inadequate or 
insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more research is being done, which we are very  
optimistic will continue to provide useful information to answer 
the questions that remain,'' said Tollerud, director of the Center 
for Environmental and Occupation Health at Philadelphia's Hahnemann 
University School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The review keeps four diseases on the list of those for which  
evidence establishes links with exposure to herbicides widely used 
as defoliants in Vietnam: soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and cholaracne. The first three are 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,  
six other diseases were listed with ``limited or suggestive 
evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the 
contaminant dioxin. Added to the list then was spina bifida, the 
spinal birth defect found in the children of some Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the recent literature, there are no additional  
diseases that satisfy this category's criteria,'' the new report 
said. Nor did it find enough evidence to move diseases to a 
category of higher or lower certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Tollerud said new research was conducted on  
diabetes and on spina bifida as well as other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the most serious medical questions still being studied  
from the war involve the relationship between herbicides and cases 
of diabetes and birth defects among veterans and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's review is the third in a series of reports. A law  
passed in 1991 calls for the National Academy of Sciences to review 
new Agent Orange and herbicide studies every two years to determine 
if the fresh research finds an added connection between the 
chemicals and disease. The Institute of Medicine is an affiliate of 
the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	About 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other chemicals  
were used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam, beginning 
in 1962. Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies 
first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Veterans Affairs has received more than 92,000  
claims and treated more than 50,000 cases of service-related 
conditions, spokesman Ken McKinnon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed to  
Agent Orange, and veterans with any of the 10 diseases is presumed 
to have contracted it from the exposure, without individual proof.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president ordered soldiers  
to a remote village Friday to repair highways and provide medical 
care, the first step in a plan to increase the military's role in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried to  
overthrow the government in a bloody coup attempt seven years ago, 
announced he will use the army to help build public works -- a first 
for the Venezuelan military, which until now has been devoted 
exclusively to security. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger role for Venezuela's army is raising concern among  
Chavez's detractors who believe it may portend a return to 
authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez said Friday the military must be used to help satisfy  
``the great needs that have accumulated because of corruption and 
abandonment by governments of past years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first group of soldiers and officers will travel to the  
frontier town of Guasdualito, some 340 miles southwest of Caracas.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Argentine Foreign Ministry  
denied Friday that the government will hold talks on the Falkland 
Islands with Britain's Prince Charles during his upcoming visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between both countries regarding the South Atlantic  
islands, known here as the Malvinas, are ``not a matter that 
(Argentina) takes up with the British royal house or any of its 
members,'' the Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Charles' expected visit March 8 is considered a new step  
in the reconciliation of both countries, which fought a 74-day war 
over the islands in 1982. Nearly 1,000 servicemen on both sides 
died as a British force defeated an Argentine invasion of the 
islands.

	A withdrawal was not a precondition for making peace, President  
Andres Pastrana told reporters in the northern port of Cartagena. 
But he said that he would guarantee the security of guerrilla 
leaders of the National Liberation Army, or ELN. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bold effort to end 34 years of conflict with the larger  
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Pastrana withdrew 
all troops from a Switzerland-sized southern region on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller ELN, about one-third the size of the FARC with some  
5,000 fighters, had not previously demanded a demilitarized zone as 
a condition for talks.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Workers at Grupo Mexico's Cananea copper mine  
have agreed to end a three-month-old strike after reaching an 
accord with the company, the Sonora state government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a press release, the state government said Grupo Mexico  
agreed to maintain the collective labor contract at its Mexicana de 
Cananea subsidiary, while both sides agreed to stick to a 
productivity bonus plan established in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers of the National Mining and Metallurgy Union also agreed  
to voluntary layoffs in some areas of operations, including 
smelting and warehousing. 
</P>
<P>
	Work will resume Monday, the state government said.  
</P>
<P>
	Disagreement over bonus pay was among the issues that led to the  
strike by 1,300 Cananea workers Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Cananea is one of Grupo Mexico's principal copper mines,  
although company officials say it is among the least efficient.

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Fourteen rookies and 13 drivers had  
never raced at Daytona's fast oval before the NASCAR Goody's Dash 
Series race. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian Elder avoided a pair of multiple-car crashes to win  
the Discount Auto Parts 200 on Friday. The race included three red 
flags, seven caution periods, 57 minutes in delays and one 
spectacular wreck that flipped a car eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder, a part-time driver on the series from Minneapolis, beat  
Robert Huffman for a 3.254-second victory after a restart with 
three laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder earned $11,550 for taking the checkered flag, although all  
21 drivers who finished with their cars running must have felt like 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a pretty good number of rookies in the field and a  
pretty good number of rookie crew chiefs,'' Elder said. ``When you 
combine those two, you're asking for trouble and we had trouble 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three drivers were hospitalized, two with broken legs and the  
other with a minor neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, normally completed in about 90 minutes, took almost  
three hours. Just 22 laps into the 80-lap race, accidents had 
knocked out 20 of the 42 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I watched some tapes and thought I realized what it  
took to survive this race,'' said Derrick Kelley, who was involved 
in one of the big wrecks. ``I think some of those guys need to

<HEADLINE> Serbs Accused of Delaying Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- A deadline for Kosovo peace talks  
will likely be extended because of difficulties in negotiations 
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, Britain's foreign secretary has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Cook accused the Serbs of stalling the talks by demanding  
that ethnic Albanians sign a basic set of principles, and told 
ethnic Albanians they should cooperate if they want NATO troops to 
protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the Kosovo Albanians are engaged in trying to find a  
political settlement and I have asked them to continue to make 
progress,'' Cook said after six hours of meetings at a 14th century 
chateau here. 
</P>
<P>
	The principles guarantee that Yugoslavia's borders stay intact  
and that Kosovo never gain independence. Kosovo is a province of 
Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The international mediators at the conference, led by American  
Christopher Hill, have repeatedly said the principles were agreed 
to by both sides by the mere fact that they turned up for the 
talks, which opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said a one-week deadline for the talks will likely be  
extended by the six-nation Contact Group made up of the United 
States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be an interim assessment carried out this weekend  
and it is likely that this will result in an agreement that the 
talks would continue until the weekend after that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of  
thousands have been driven from their homes in clashes between 
ethnic Albanian separatists and Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanians are unlikely to agree to abandon the idea of  
independence, their ultimate goal after a proposed interim period 
of three years. Albanian negotiators are calling for a referendum 
on independence, an immediate cease-fire and NATO guarantees for 
the eventual interim settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This long and serious process will eventually lead to an  
independent and free Kosovo,'' Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for 
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, said from Kosovo's 
provincial capital Pristina. Rugova is participating in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has been making plans to send up to 30,000 peacekeeping  
troops into Kosovo to police an eventual peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton says he is considering sending up to 4,000  
American soldiers to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides came to the talks under NATO's threat to bomb the  
Serbs and take tough measures to cut off arms and financing for the 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb sources close to the talks, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the Serb side had unilaterally signed the document 
preserving Yugoslav borders Thursday, but the ethnic Albanians had 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, who came to the conference  
Thursday, defended the Serbian delegation's stance, telling 
Belgrade's pro-government daily Politika that it was designed to 
``ensure a meaningful dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks have been hard ... because the questions are so  
important,'' Milutinovic was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, co-hosts of the  
peace conference, returned here for the third time in six days 
Thursday in an effort to coax the stalled talks along. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the European Union's 15 foreign ministers will meet  
in Paris on Sunday to assess progress in the talks, said Foreign 
Minister Jacques Poos of Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Poos said the EU foreign ministers would meet  
before a meeting, also in Paris on Sunday, of the Contact Group 
foreign ministers.

<HEADLINE> Rules May Change for TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Singer Stevie Wonder, who owns an FM radio  
station, urged federal regulators Friday not to ease restrictions 
on media ownership, saying it would hurt minority-owned radio and 
TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority station owners are ``an endangered species pursued by  
large corporate predators who consume the single and small owner,'' 
Wonder told a Federal Communications Commission hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public interest demands and public interest requires the  
protection of stations who stand alone like the dots in a Pac Man 
game destined to be gobbled up by'' media conglomerates, said 
Wonder, who owns Los Angeles area FM station KJLH. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is considering easing existing rules that limit the  
number of local TV and radio stations that a single company can 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder and others fear that doing so will bring about more  
consolidation, making it harder for minority-owned stations and 
stations not part of a chain to compete against media 
conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard called Wonder's testimony ``very, very  
compelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Marcus, president of Chancellor Media Corp., meanwhile,  
called the FCC's ownership restrictions ``glacial remnants of a 
regulatory Ice Age'' that make it difficult for broadcasters to 
compete against cable TV and other media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the FCC to let broadcasters own more radio and TV  
stations in the same markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law eased some restrictions but  
required the commission to consider changing, or even eliminating, 
other limits in light of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hearing focused on just three of those rules and  
possible changes to them. Those rules: 
</P>
<P>
	--Forbid a single company to own more than one local TV station  
in a given market. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit a company from owning a TV station and a radio station  
in the same market unless the FCC grants a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	--Permit local marketing agreements, or LMAs, which allow one TV  
station to operate another TV station in the same market, but not 
actually own it. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is considering giving stations a little leeway to own a  
second TV station in a given market. It also is considering letting 
a company own both a TV station and up to four radio stations in a 
market. But companies with existing waivers to the TV-radio 
restriction could be forced to sell some properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is considering tightening the LMA rules and  
counting these stations toward federal ownership limits, a move 
that could force some broadcasters to abandon their agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus and other broadcasters believe the FCC's proposals don't  
give them enough regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Key lawmakers who deal with telecommunications agree. Among them  
are Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., House 
Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and the panel's 
top Democrat John Dingell of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation opponents think the FCC's proposals give  
broadcasters too much freedom. Allowing companies to own more local 
stations threatens editorial diversity, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It most certainly does not replenish the creative gene pool to  
ensure that broadcasting can stay in touch with ethnic and social 
diversification of American society,'' said Andy Schwartzman, 
president of the Media Access Project, a public interest law firm.

<HEADLINE> Recordings Uncover Mystery of Seals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists long have wondered how 1,000-pound  
seals could chase down their dinner under the thick Antarctic ice 
sheet without popping up for a breath of air for an astounding 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now marine biologist Randall Davis is solving the mystery, with  
a ``seal-cam'' that virtually lets him go along for the dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny video camera and data recorder are providing 3-D  
pictures of the seal's mystery world -- and they reveal that the 
animals have great eyes for peering under the dim ice and somehow 
never lose their way back to a small air hole in the ice even if 
they roam a mile away or 1,000 feet under water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrestrial biologists have the advantage of being able to go  
out and observe their animals fairly easily. But ... we know 
basically nothing about underwater behavior,'' said Davis, who 
reports the first data from his three-dimensional tapes in the 
journal Science today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology allows us to travel vicariously with these  
animals to great depths and for the first time look at their 
behavior, ... foraging tactics, how do they stalk their prey,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a marine biologist at Texas A&AMP;M University, strapped the  
data packs to the heads of Weddell seals, huge but fairly friendly 
mammals that hunt under the ice shelves of Antarctica. The packs 
combine a video recorder and equipment to gather information on 
sound, depth, direction, water speed, even flipper strokes -- 
basically everything the seal did and experienced once it dived 
under the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The first surprise from the nearly 100 hours of tape: Seals may  
squawk a lot while lounging around on rocks, but they are stealth 
hunters, coming within inches of large fish without the prey 
noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, they do not appear to use sound -- sonar or echolocation --  
to hunt, relying instead on eyes highly developed for peering 
through the murk below the 6-foot-deep ice. Davis' tapes show a 
seal gliding under a 100-pound Antarctic cod and tracking its 
silhouette in the dim light before moving in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another discovery was a novel hunting technique: The seal wanted  
some smaller fish that tried to hide inside crevices under the ice, 
so it blew a blast of air from its nostrils into the crevice. Out 
fled the fish, ripe for capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really advancing our understanding of underwater  
foraging behavior,'' said Polly Penhale of the National Science 
Foundation, which paid for the research. ``You're getting a totally 
unique, three-dimensional picture of what the animal is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weddell seals in particular fascinated researchers because of  
how long they dive without breathing. Twenty minutes is typical, 
but Davis recorded a 65-minute dive. The longest dive ever recorded 
is an astounding 82 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The seals spend most of their waking hours beneath the ice  
shelves, but they congregate around 4-feet-wide holes through which 
they emerge to gulp air. Davis' recordings show they can dive 1,000 
feet deep and swim almost 2 miles away from those holes yet 
unerringly find their way back before running out of air. 
</P>
<P>
	``These seals not only have to locate and capture prey, but they  
do it while holding their breath, and in such a way that they can 
find their way back to a fairly isolated breathing hole or they'll 
drown,'' Davis explained. ``That's a small point to locate in a 
fairly broad sheath of ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How do they do it? When Davis returns in October to Sound,  
Antarctica, he will continue researching how the seals navigate 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
	But as for holding their breath, it seems they have incredibly  
complex biology. Their blood and muscles have three to five times 
more oxygen-carrying capacity than humans', enough to survive those 
typical 20-minute dives. 
</P>
<P>
	For longer dives, their bodies actually alter blood circulation  
to sequester oxygen in the brain and heart; the rest of the body 
simply goes without, Davis said. That is very stressful and 
painful, and requires hours to recuperate, so really long dives are 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' work has implications beyond seals: If scientists  
miniaturize the data pack a little more, they also could see into 
the alien world of other undersea creatures, even large diving 
birds, said Penhale of the NSF. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's advances like these that pique the interest of scientists  
to push the technology to the limits,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Indian Baskets Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Three hand-woven Indian baskets stolen in  
broad daylight from the Nevada Historical Society more than 20 
years ago and valued at nearly $1 million have been officially 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The event on Thursday ends a tale of thievery, dealing and  
negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who stole them and we really don't know where  
they've been,'' said Peter Bandurraga, Nevada Historical Society 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The baskets were made by Washoe Tribe member Dat So La Lee, who  
is believed to have lived from about 1850 to 1925. She made the 
baskets for Carson City businessman Abe Cohen, who sold them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dat So La Lee made about 120 baskets in her lifetime, and her  
work became renowned for its intricate style and distinctive weave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Legislature purchased 20 remaining baskets from  
Cohen's widow in 1945 for $1,500. Their value has soared, with some 
estimated at $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, four were stolen from the Nevada Historical Society on  
the University of Nevada, Reno campus. One was recovered two years 
later -- and the rest vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point, we suspected they'd never be seen again,'' said  
J.R. Hill, agent in charge of the FBI office in Reno.

	Then, in 1997, the three missing baskets were purchased by Paul  
Shepard, a Tucson, Ariz., art dealer. Shepard brought them to the 
attention of the FBI after an expert on Washoe tribal art 
identified them as stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The art dealer said he purchased the baskets from another  
collector, Hill said. Nevada eventually paid the man $55,000 to get 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical Society officials were worried about how the rare and  
delicate baskets made of tule and fern were being stored by the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The baskets were secretly returned and stored in a  
climate-controlled room at the society's headquarters here. Last 
month, authorities decided there was insufficient evidence for any 
prosecutions in the case and authorized the FBI to release the 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	The homecoming was completed on Thursday. Bandurraga said the  
baskets will go on permanent exhibit this summer.

<HEADLINE> Oil Burns on Grounded Oregon Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- With the bulk of its fuel burned in a  
boldly conceived fire, the grounded tanker New Carissa lies broken 
in half and smoking in the surf as cleanup crews labor to shovel up 
what oil washed onto the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Friday, only three patches of beach within a three-mile  
stretch were reported heavily oiled, and the sandy strand closest 
to the ship had only light streaks of black left behind by the 
receding tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did the right thing,'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer  
Gene Maestas. ``By burning the oil we prevented it from spilling 
into the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall added, ``Every gallon that is burned  
means one less gallon in the environment and the coastal habitat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot ship, a Japanese-owned freighter, ran aground in  
the surf Feb. 4 a mile north of the entrance to Coos Bay with 
nearly 400,000 gallons of diesel and tarlike bunker oil on board. 
It began leaking Monday as the pounding waves widened cracks in its 
hull, sending streaks of goo over six miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts made the daring decision to burn the fuel before the  
ship broke up and fouled Oregon's scenic coastline. A Navy 
demolition team used 400 pounds of explosives to crack open the 
fuel tanks and set the heavy bunker fuel ablaze within the hull of 
the crippled ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the fuel erupted in a tremendous fireball, the ship  
broke into two huge pieces, which experts said was completely 
expected and no reason for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on infrared images of the burning wreckage Friday morning,  
experts estimated that about two-thirds of the fuel had burned 
away, and that no more than 10 percent of the load had spilled onto 
the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	With winds blowing the smoke up the coastline and away from  
town, Oregon environmental officials said that even the air 
pollution from the burning wreckage was minimal. Mike Szerlog of 
the Department of Environmental Quality said the pollution levels 
in Coos Bay were ``less than a good day in L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities estimated that by Friday night, nearly 90 percent of  
the fuel would have burned and much of the rest would have been 
reduced to a waxy residue. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, the rest of the oil will be removed, and the  
wreckage cut up and hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
	Burning of a ship's oil to save beaches had never before been  
tried in the Lower 48 states, and officials said that the success 
of the New Carissa could make it a more common option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like it is something that will be scrutinized and  
accepted throughout the world,'' said Jerry Craft of Williams Fire 
and Hazard Control, a Baton Rouge, La., company that puts out oil 
platform fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said he plans to file a bill to make  
some foreign-flagged ships wait at international borders 12 miles 
out to sea until they receive a U.S. pilot or are found competent 
to enter U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would prevent these disasters from happening in the  
future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Faces Abuse Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A Canadian hockey player accused of  
throwing his stick into the crowd and injuring two girls must stand 
trial on child-abuse charges, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Barry McKinlay, playing for the Thunder Bay Thunder  
Cats of the United Hockey League, pleaded innocent to two counts of 
recklessly causing harm to a child. He faces a maximum penalty of 
four years in prison and a $20,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinlay, angered by taunts from spectators during a November  
game against the Madison Monsters, threw his hockey stick into the 
crowd, striking an 8-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl, the 
criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were not seriously hurt, but both were bruised and  
upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Dane County Circuit Judge Maryann Sumi ordered McKinlay to stand  
trial. No date was immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinlay's preliminary hearing was held Friday because he was in  
Madison for two weekend games between the Thunder Cats and the 
Monsters. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinlay, free on a $2,000 signature bond, was suspended for 25  
games after the incident. He returned to the ice in mid-January.

<HEADLINE> LA Indoor Track Meet Has Top Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Speed, in the form of sprinter Maurice  
Greene, and stamina, personified by decathlete Dan O'Brien, 
headline a strong field for the Los Angeles Invitational Indoor 
Track Meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked sprinter, will compete in the 50  
meters, and record-setting decathlon champion O'Brien will run the 
50-meter hurdles and compete in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, a winner at the 1997 World Championships, has a  
100-meter best of 9.86 seconds. He also set the world indoor mark 
for 60 meters of 6.39 last year in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene intends to retain his No. 1 ranking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard to get it and I will work harder to keep it  
through the Olympics in Sydney,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is coming off a strong weekend; he ran the fastest 60  
meters ever in the United States with a 6.45 clocking in Boston 
Sunday, two days after winning at 6.51 in the Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will face a field that includes Olympian Jon Drummond and Tim  
Harden, the 1998 national champion, in Saturday night's meet at the 
Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, the 1996 Olympic champion and world record-holder with  
8,891 points, will meet a group of hurdlers that includes Olympic 
silver medalist Mark Crear, who was ranked No. 1 in the world last 
year, and Reggie Torian, the 1998 national champion and winner at 
the Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Top women's events are expected to include the 50-meter dash,  
with Inger Miller, ranked third in the world last year, meeting 
Chryste Gaines, No. 4. Both won Olympic gold medals as members of 
the U.S. 400-meter relay team in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisha Waller, who cleared 6 feet, 7 inches last year and was  
ranked the world's No. 2 high jumper, also is competing, along with 
hurdlers Melissa Morrison, Angie Vaughn and Cheryl Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet is the second of the four-meet indoor Golden Spike  
Tour, which began with the Millrose Games and includes a meet at 
Fairfax, Va., and the USA Championships at Atlanta, both this 
month.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Lenard Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Heat guard Voshon Lenard,  
diagnosed in training camp with a stress fracture in his left leg, 
underwent surgery Friday to repair the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors inserted a metal rod into his left tibia. He is expected  
to be out at least eight weeks and, with the NBA's abbreviated 
schedule, could miss the entire regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was discovered during a physical exam Jan. 21 when  
training camps finally opened after the NBA lockout. Lenard weighed 
his options for three weeks before finally agreeing to the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody's going to drill a hole in my leg and put a rod in  
my tibia, I would think about it for a while,'' sympathized Heat 
coach Pat Riley, who placed Lenard on the disabled list Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard, 25, said he thinks the injury took place a year ago,  
when he was kicked during a game last February. He said that's when 
a bump appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the fourth-year player had been a regular at the Heat's  
informal workouts while waiting for the collective bargaining 
agreement to be signed.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Wins IROC Opening Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt can still teach his  
son a thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the opening round of the 1999 International Race of  
Champions series on Friday, using plenty of patience and an 
aggressive last-lap move. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Earnhardt rode around the 2 1/2-mile Daytona  
International Speedway trailing three-time defending IROC champion 
Mark Martin and just ahead of Bobby Labonte from lap 17 until the 
final turn of the 40th and last lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to make a move off turn two, but Mark was too smart  
for that,'' Earnhardt said. ``Off (turn) four, I tried to get under 
him and he pinched me down. I bumped him a little, got a little 
room, scooted under him and Bobby pushed us by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt finished 0.107-seconds -- about 1 1/2 car-lengths -- ahead  
of Labonte, who nipped Martin for second place by less than 6 
inches. The winner's cream-colored car was one of 12 identically 
prepared IROC racers in the 100-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	The event began with the crowd of about 40,000 hoping for a  
head-to-head battle between the Earnhardts, whose only previous 
race together was an exhibition last November in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But 24-year-old Dale Earnhardt Jr., the defending champion in  
the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series, wasn't around for long. 
</P>
<P>
	After some exciting racing in the early going, Earnhardt Jr.  
moved into the lead on lap seven. Two laps later, he trailed Rusty 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leaders approached the first turn, the youngster's car  
slid sideways, slammed into Wallace's car and the two collected 
Indianapolis 500 champion Eddie Cheever, who was also making his 
first IROC start. 
</P>
<P>
	With white smoke billowing over the track and obscuring  
everybody's sight, Jeff Burton also got caught in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	As his father, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, strode toward  
victory lane, Earnhardt Jr. walked up in street clothes to 
congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got wrecked, Daddy. Those guys were wrecking all over the  
place out there,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Earnhardt said, ``What were you doing?''  
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get to the front,'' his son said, grinning.  
</P>
<P>
	His father put an arm around the precocious kid's shoulders and  
said, ``It don't pay to get to the front on that lap. You have to 
wait for the last one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caution laps don't count in IROC and when the race resumed at  
the start of lap nine, Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston 
Cup champion, was out front, with CART driver Adrian Fernandez and 
Martin right behind. Earnhardt was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	On lap 17, Martin forged into the lead and fellow NASCAR drivers  
Earnhardt and Labonte moved into position right behind one lap 
later. That's the way it stayed until the last turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hoping they'd be patient behind me and they were,''  
Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The runner-up was disappointed he wasn't able to take a shot at  
the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't quite get up to Dale to do what I wanted to and  
then help myself,'' Labonte said. ``I ended up with all my tires on 
the apron, just hanging on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin wasn't upset by Earnhardt's little love tap at the end.  
</P>
<P>
	``We just kind of got moved out of the way,'' he said. ``I did  
everything I could do. I tried to stay on the bottom, but once he 
got up against me, the rear end started slipping and I had to 
follow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was added to the all-star field this week when CART's Al  
Unser Jr. withdrew after his 12-year-old daughter became ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt averaged 181.178 mph in the race, which was his eighth  
IROC victory -- five of them coming at Daytona where he now has a 
record 33 wins. The two-time IROC champion is tied with Martin for 
victories in the series, trailing only Unser Jr., who has 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Brack, the defending Indy Racing League champion, finished  
fourth in his first IROC start, followed by CART's Greg Moore, 
Gordon, Fernandez, NASCAR's Dale Jarrett, Wallace, Earnhardt Jr., 
Cheever and Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	The next event in the four-race series is April 24 at Talladega  
Superspeedway, with the drivers starting in reverse order of their 
Daytona finish.

<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp Says She'd Do It Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings triggered  
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, says she considered it her ``patriotic 
duty'' to expose a relationship in which President Clinton 
``abused, used, discarded'' the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	People think the relationship was ``consensual and that I  
inserted myself somehow'' but ``it was not,'' Mrs. Tripp said in an 
interview aired today on NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has no clue ... absolutely no idea what Monica  
endured ... the histrionics, the hysteria, the throwing of lamps, 
the damage to herself'' and Clinton ``emotionally abused Monica,'' 
Mrs. Tripp asserted. ``She threatened suicide on more than one 
occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said she felt Ms. Lewinsky was passing along  
``threats'' from President Clinton that Mrs. Tripp should lie in 
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were threats,'' said Mrs. Tripp. ``Did I take them  
seriously? Absolutely. Threats to my life. Threats to the lives of 
my children. Monica made those threats and passed them along to me, 
I believed from the president. I believed I was in jeopardy. Be a 
team player, or else.'' She said the message she got was that if 
she didn't protect the president by lying, ``You will lose your job 
and worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding alleged threats, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy  
said ``any such bizarre suggestion is ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp denied the role Clinton supporters have attributed to  
her as a provocateur who actively tried to foment the scandal. She 
said she didn't start taking steps to expose the relationship 
``until I was asked to commit a crime'' by lying in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about her contacts with Mrs. Jones' lawyers, Mrs. Tripp  
said ``they approached me'' but she did not deny that she brought 
up Ms. Lewinsky's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you asking me did I want this behavior exposed?  
Absolutely,'' said Mrs. Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	She said lying in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in order to protect the  
president was ``not an option for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth it to me to do what I considered to be my  
patriotic duty'' and ``yes, I would do it all again,'' Mrs. Tripp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp has emerged as one of the most unpopular figures in  
the presidential scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	She turned over the tapes to prosecutor Kenneth Starr but  
refuses to say in public whether she made them. She remains under 
investigation by Maryland authorities who want to know whether she 
violated the state's wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
	Save for her grand jury appearances and the release of her  
tape-recorded phone calls, Mrs. Tripp has seldom been heard from 
over the past year. During a statement on the courthouse steps, she 
told Americans she had been misunderstood and mischaracterized. 
``I'm you,'' she declared then. 
</P>
<P>
	A former White House worker employed by the Pentagon but who has  
worked from home since the scandal erupted, Mrs. Tripp insisted 
that she would want someone to expose an improper relationship if 
it involved her daughter, just as she did for Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would thank them,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``If my daughter found  
herself in a situation such as this where she was being abused, 
used, discarded, I would hope someone would come in and help her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take exception to the fact that I brought this all about,''  
Mrs. Tripp declared, placing the blame squarely on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were choices made by the president of the United  
States,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Kwan, Weiss Win Short Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The standings look exactly the way  
everyone expected. The way Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss got to 
the top in their short programs wasn't quite so expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both blew away weakened fields Thursday at the U.S.  
Figure Skating Championships, neither was spectacular. Sure, Kwan 
got a 6.0 and eight 5.9s for presentation in her ``The Fate of 
Carmen'' routine. But even she and coach Frank Carroll found fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine, consistent, but don't think it was the  
greatest short program she has ever done,'' Carroll said. ``But I 
certainly will take it. I thought she did her job and thought it 
was a very good performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was like the greatest it has ever been. But  
what you want to do in the short program is nail everything, and 
she did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Weiss, albeit with some bobbles in his footwork. He, too,  
swept the judges in the short program, worth one-third of the total 
score. And, like Kwan -- who is seeking her third American crown; 
Weiss is after his first -- the two-time U.S. runner-up should have 
no trouble clinching the title on Saturday in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit different going in as the favorite, I'm used  
to going in as the underdog,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously it's a good 
position to be in, though. I went out and skated the way I wanted 
to and I'm sitting where I want to be right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each get a day of rest while the free dance and pairs free skate  
are held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion and the sport's biggest star,  
was ``honored'' about the 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really strong and confident,'' said Kwan, a two-time  
world champion closing in on her third American crown. ``My lutz 
was a little shaky, higher than usual. But I guess I have to be 
prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except losing, it would seem. Against a group of young,  
generally unproven skaters -- at least at this level -- Kwan appears 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Hughes, the rising 13-year-old who was runner-up in the  
recent World Junior Championships, was second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really like to think about placements,'' she said. ``I  
just wanted to be happy with my performances, and I am happy with 
my short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, the American junior winner a year ago, edged 20-year-old  
Amber Corwin, who wound up third in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are people out there working as hard and maybe  
harder than you,'' Kwan said after hitting a triple lutz-double toe 
loop combination, a double axel and a triple toe loop, along with 
some sensational spirals. ``I have to work to stay at the top of my 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss had to work quite hard to get to the top of American  
skating. He was a close loser to five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge 
the last two years. With Eldredge not defending his title, despite 
still being eligible, Weiss is an odds-on choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He handled that situation well enough Thursday, hitting all of  
his jumps and spins. But his footwork was sloppy and he lacked 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The short program is just getting through it and having fun,  
and I think I did that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel, fresh out of juniors and the only U.S. skater to  
land a quadruple jump in competition, was second. Goebel performed 
solidly, but lacks the flair that usually marks Weiss' routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic was third. Both he and Goebel, like Hughes and  
Corwin, are light years from the level of the skaters they trail. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't breed overconfidence in the leaders, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put them down,'' Kwan said. ``There are some great  
skaters here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are, but not below first place.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks To Try Out With Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Garth Brooks may be in the same league with  
Elvis and the Beatles when it comes to album sales, but can he hit 
for average or turn the double play? 
</P>
<P>
	He'll find out as soon as he trades in his cowboy hat for a San  
Diego Padres cap. The team and Brooks scheduled a conference call 
today to announce the country music superstar will go to spring 
training with the Padres, team sources told The Associated Press on 
condition of anonymity late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres owner John Moores said it was no secret that Brooks  
longed to play professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had indicated through channels that he was interested in  
going to spring training,'' Moores said. ``I know there have been 
some discussions underway. If he shows up, that would be dynamite. 
I think that would add a dimension to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the spring training invitation leads is anyone's guess. If  
Brooks is a bust, he certainly won't have to go hunting for another 
job. He's sold almost as many albums as Elvis and the Beatles, and 
makes millions selling out concert dates across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has taken the year off from touring. If he shows he can  
play, he likely would be sent to a minor-league club to live out 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent developments pointed to Brooks' involvement in  
baseball. He and several baseball stars, including some Padres 
players, recently announced formation of a foundation tied to 
baseball that would benefit children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk that Brooks would make a cameo appearance with  
the Padres at spring training like he did last year, and one of the 
Padres' vice presidents is now head of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the controversial trade of slugger Greg Vaughn still fresh  
in the minds of fans, the Padres likely will make it clear Brooks 
isn't going to be paid. In lieu of salary, the Padres are expected 
to make a donation to his foundation, with assurances that some 
will be spent in San Diego. A fling in camp might allow Brooks the 
chance to develop relationships with ballplayers so his foundation 
will flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever heard was that he wanted to play baseball,'' Moores  
said. ``I understand he routinely takes batting practice at home. 
He's got an athletic build and a big pair of wheels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he can make it work -- he obviously knows the Michael  
Jordan story. Obviously, it would be very hard. If Garth makes it, 
I'll try to do it myself,'' Moores joked. ``I'm sure he knows this 
is a tough row to hoe. Everybody's got to follow their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan tried baseball after his first retirement from the  
Chicago Bulls, but struggled as a member of the Birmingham Barons 
and went back to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks spent two days working out with the Padres last spring,  
and even got into a game as a pinch runner. Brooks, who sings of 
Friends in Low Places, was almost picked off twice, diving back 
into the bag once. He hugged the umpire after he was called safe on 
what appeared to be a generous call. Finally, he was forced out in 
a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nicely received by the ballclub,'' Moores said. ``The  
players liked the hell out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he's with the big-league club, he'll merely be the  
third musician in camp, albeit the most-recognized. Third base 
coach Tim Flannery recently released his third CD, and pitcher Mark 
Langston, who's friends with Bruce Hornsby, plays guitar in his own 
band.

<HEADLINE>  Kwan, Weiss Win Short Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The standings look exactly the way  
everyone expected. The way Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss got to 
the top in their short programs wasn't quite so expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both blew away weakened fields Thursday at the U.S.  
Figure Skating Championships, neither was spectacular. Sure, Kwan 
got a 6.0 and eight 5.9s for presentation in her ``The Fate of 
Carmen'' routine. But even she and coach Frank Carroll found fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine, consistent, but don't think it was the  
greatest short program she has ever done,'' Carroll said. ``But I 
certainly will take it. I thought she did her job and thought it 
was a very good performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was like the greatest it has ever been. But  
what you want to do in the short program is nail everything, and 
she did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Weiss, albeit with some bobbles in his footwork. He, too,  
swept the judges in the short program, worth one-third of the total 
score. And, like Kwan -- who is seeking her third American crown; 
Weiss is after his first -- the two-time U.S. runner-up should have 
no trouble clinching the title on Saturday in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit different going in as the favorite, I'm used  
to going in as the underdog,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously it's a good 
position to be in, though. I went out and skated the way I wanted 
to and I'm sitting where I want to be right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each get a day of rest while the free dance and pairs free skate  
are held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion and the sport's biggest star,  
was ``honored'' about the 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really strong and confident,'' said Kwan, a two-time  
world champion closing in on her third American crown. ``My lutz 
was a little shaky, higher than usual. But I guess I have to be 
prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except losing, it would seem. Against a group of young,  
generally unproven skaters -- at least at this level -- Kwan appears 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Hughes, the rising 13-year-old who was runner-up in the  
recent World Junior Championships, was second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really like to think about placements,'' she said. ``I  
just wanted to be happy with my performances, and I am happy with 
my short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, the American junior winner a year ago, edged 20-year-old  
Amber Corwin, who wound up third in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are people out there working as hard and maybe  
harder than you,'' Kwan said after hitting a triple lutz-double toe 
loop combination, a double axel and a triple toe loop, along with 
some sensational spirals. ``I have to work to stay at the top of my 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss had to work quite hard to get to the top of American  
skating. He was a close loser to five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge 
the last two years. With Eldredge not defending his title, despite 
still being eligible, Weiss is an odds-on choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He handled that situation well enough Thursday, hitting all of  
his jumps and spins. But his footwork was sloppy and he lacked 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The short program is just getting through it and having fun,  
and I think I did that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel, fresh out of juniors and the only U.S. skater to  
land a quadruple jump in competition, was second. Goebel performed 
solidly, but lacks the flair that usually marks Weiss' routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic was third. Both he and Goebel, like Hughes and  
Corwin, are light years from the level of the skaters they trail. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't breed overconfidence in the leaders, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put them down,'' Kwan said. ``There are some great  
skaters here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are, but not below first place.

<HEADLINE> Richmond High Coach Benches Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The Richmond High boy's basketball team  
has been benched again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, one day before the team's biggest game of the  
season, coach Kenny Carter canceled practice and shipped his team 
to mandatory study hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter made headlines last month when, dismayed by a lack of  
academic focus, he banned the Oilers from all basketball-related 
activities, including practices and rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	The team missed a non-league game and an alumni game; when they  
returned to the court after a week, Gov. Gray Davis was in the 
crowd to show support for the coach's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a hero,'' Davis said of Carter. ``Obviously, not  
every kid is going to the NBA. How they do in school will determine 
how they do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Richmond players weren't in any danger of failing; they all  
had the 2.0 grade point average the district requires before a 
student can play. But the team signed contracts with the coach back 
in September to maintain a 2.3 GPA, and they were falling short. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said he took the latest action because team members were  
not taking part in daily tutoring sessions that went into effect 
after the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, our young men are starting to slip away,''  
Carter said Thursday in announcing the study hall move. ``It's not 
the overall academics but our study habits and attitudes that 
concern me. If we can spend the added time studying, our overall 
grades will have no choice but to go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond is 18-4 overall and 5-4 in the Alameda Contra Costa  
Athletic League. It was scheduled to play El Cerrito (19-3, 8-0), 
in a crucial ACCAL Super Power division game Friday night, then end 
the regular season Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That game was not canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter met with school officials Thursday before making the  
decision. He said he's not worried about the impact the decision 
will have on his team's performance on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the lockout, we've played basketball pretty much as  
usual,'' Carter said. ``And I don't think this will have any 
effect, either. I expect us to go out and compete just like any 
other game. We've been playing and practicing for three months now. 
I don't think one day will make that much of a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond lost its last game, on Tuesday, but the coach isn't  
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're happy with the way we're playing  
basketball,'' he said. ``I thing we're a more mature team right 
now. I can actually see it in their eyes. Sometimes, you have to 
make decisions and not everyone is going to be happy with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were winning, I don't think any of this would have ever  
become an issue,'' said senior forward Courtney Anderson said. ``I 
don't know what's going on with coach. He's an enigma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think not practicing at all will definitely hurt us,'' said  
senior forward Wayne Oliver. ``We need to keep practicing and 
playing. I don't know what coach is thinking.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks To Try Out With Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Let's see, the San Diego Padres lose a bunch of  
free agents, trade away their best slugger and then bring in a 
singing cowboy? 
</P>
<P>
	In a move sure to raise eyebrows -- if not chuckles -- from fans  
and no doubt some NL West rivals, the Padres announced Friday that 
country music superstar Garth Brooks has been invited to spring 
training on a non-roster basis. 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding -- a singing cowboy whose athletic credentials are  
playing on his high school baseball team and throwing the javelin 
at Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited, I'm nervous, I'm scared, and it's going to be  
neat,'' the 37-year-old rookie said in a conference call from Los 
Angeles. ``Make no mistake about it, I'm out there to play 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in the bigs. At least, not right away.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no chance of him being on the major league club, but  
we're excited to have him because I think he's going to bring a lot 
of enthusiasm and hard work into camp, because that's how he goes 
about his business,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, a switch-hitter, worked out with the Padres for two days  
at last year's spring training. The extent of his game action was a 
pinch-running appearance, when he was nearly picked off twice. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years on the road playing sold out concerts, Brooks  
took a year off, giving him a chance to live out his fantasy of 
playing professional baseball. If he's any good, he could be back 
on a bus, riding the backroads of America, playing minor league 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who sings about Friends in Low Places could end up in  
the low minors: maybe at Idaho Falls, Idaho; Rancho Cucamonga, 
Calif.; or Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's serious enough about the game that he'll skip the Feb.  
24 Grammy Awards ceremonies in Los Angeles, even though he's 
nominated for three awards, to go to spring training in Peoria, 
Ariz., a few days before the Feb. 23 reporting day. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks and the Padres denied the move was a publicity stunt to  
promote the image of the team, but it is being used to help 
jump-start Brooks' new baseball-related Touch 'Em All Foundation, 
which will benefit children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead paying Brooks a salary, the Padres will donate  
approximately $200,000 -- the equivalent of the major league minimum 
salary -- to his foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres have been suffering fan criticism for failing to  
retain the core of the National League championship team after 
convincing voters to approve public funding for a new downtown 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this as damage control, grasping for straws in an  
attempt to manipulate the fans to get what they want, which is a 
new stadium at the taxpayers' expense,'' said Diane Dixon, one of 
the leaders of an anti-stadium campaign. ``I don't think (Brooks) 
is going to mend the hearts of the Padres' fans -- unless he can 
really play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he's been hitting off tees and in batting cages ever  
since playing for the Padres last March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just know this -- the first goal of all of this is not to  
embarrass major league baseball,'' said Brooks, who was wearing a 
Padres cap and a navy blue jersey in a video feed of the conference 
call. ``They had their best year, in my lifetime, and possibly 
history, last year, so they need a great year this year to come 
back with it ... Anything to hurt that reputation, I don't want to 
be involved with. We're going to take it extremely serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks had hoped to spend time picking slugger Greg Vaughn's  
mind on playing left field, and just hanging out with Ken Caminiti 
``because he's so damn intense.'' But they're gone, as are Kevin 
Brown, Steve Finley and Joey Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, `I can't believe you lost these people and now  
you're giving us this guy at camp,''' said Brooks, who views 
himself as a utility player -- all the outfield positions, as well 
as first and third. 
</P>
<P>
	He is well aware of Michael Jordan's failed attempt to play  
baseball, but applauded Jordan because he ``walked away from 
something that was safe to go to something that wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, like Jordan, Brooks is prepared to be the underdog.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that people are going to go out there and just kind  
of laugh and chuckle, `Oh, Garth, is that chubby cowboy going to 
try to play baseball? This ought to be fun.' I want people to walk 
up there and not expect to get what they're about ready to get from 
me in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Sterling Hitchcock said Brooks can do whatever he  
wants as long as it's not on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he's not trying out to pitch, I don't care,''  
Hitchcock said.

<HEADLINE> TV Networks Mark End of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One more time, perhaps with nostalgia, NBC ran  
the famous videotape of a gladhanding President Clinton stopping to 
hug Monica Lewinsky as the network ended Friday's coverage of the 
Senate impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps now we can file it away and not use it for a long,  
long time,'' anchorman Tom Brokaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Television networks marked the end of the impeachment saga  
somberly, with an eye toward history. The Senate vote provided 
little suspense and was packaged neatly for the networks: ABC, CBS 
and NBC began special reports at noon and ended them an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over,'' CBS's Dan Rather noted flatly shortly after the  
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather said that the upcoming weekend, with President's Day and  
Valentine's Day, provides Americans with the time to reflect on the 
nation's ideals and the notion of forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokaw said the day reminded him of August 1974, when President  
Nixon resigned because of Watergate and President Gerald Ford told 
the nation that its long national nightmare is over. He reminded 
viewers that the effects of Watergate lingered, as the Clinton saga 
undoubtedly would. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the Senate vote, ABC's Peter Jennings read an  
eyewitness report on the Senate's cliffhanger 1868 vote at the end 
of President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial. A ``hungry'' crowd 
then was voracious for news of the verdict; Johnson survived by one 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``My, how things have changed,'' Jennings said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was clear long before Clinton's trial began that the Senate  
would not be able to muster the 67 votes required to remove him 
from office, and the only real drama Friday was whether either 
impeachment article would be supported by a majority of senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to reach 51 ``guilty'' votes on either article was  
``a real slap at the House prosecutors,'' CBS's Bob Schieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a television event, the votes were diminished by the  
inability of the cameras to record each senator rising to intone 
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' Instead, the networks had to flash 
still pictures of each senator, and only the loudest among them 
could be heard in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Robert Bennett  
of Utah won the awards for speediest senators to the TV cameras by 
racing to ABC interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, back-to-back interviews with two of  
Clinton's best-known detractors and supporters enlivened NBC's 
``Today'' show. Linda Tripp, in her first TV interview, said in a 
taped interview that she considered it her ``patriotic duty'' to 
expose Clinton's behavior with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, political attack dog James Carville said he wanted to bury  
the hatchet -- figuratively speaking -- in independent prosecutor 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wish him personal ill,'' Carville said. ``But I wish  
him all the professional ill imaginable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Sportsco International Corp.'s purchase of the  
insolvent SkyDome was approved Friday by an Ontario court. stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, owned by a group of Canadian and U.S. businessmen  
that includes former Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick, bid 
about $74 million for the ballpark, operating under court 
protection from creditors.

Blue Jays and Labatt is in the best interests of both businesses 
and a priority for us'' said Sportsco's Harvey Walken, a Chicago 
investor and former co-owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gillick and Walken, the Sportsco syndicate  
includes New York businessman Alan Cohen, Canadian businessmen 
Lawrence Dale and Howard Sokolowski, former Ontario cabinet

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Movc Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell sharply a second day Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid concern that U.S. exporters 
continue to lose out to cheaper-priced foreign wheat. Corn and 
soybeans also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures have been under heavy selling pressure this year  
as some of the top buyers of the grain, including Egypt and 
Pakistan, continually turn to Australia or European wheat exporters 
for their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	With American inventories remaining near their highest in eight  
years, market participants say prices must go lower to be able to 
compete effectively for business that has been affected by a global 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also were pressured by beneficial moisture in  
winter wheat growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn retreated on the weakness in the wheat market and amid the  
start of harvesting in Argentina, which was expected to bring ample 
supplies of competing product to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans continued their retreat in a market that has had few  
good things to consider. American farmers this spring are expected 
to plant near-record acreage to soybeans, while Brazil is close to 
harvesting a near-record crop that will compete for some of the 
weakest export business in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.57$ 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn fell 1 cent to $2.15 a bushel; March oats fell 1 1/4 cents 
to $1.03 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 cents to $4.92 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .45 cent to 67.57 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .43 cent to 74.60 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .50 cent to 46.77 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .05 
cent to 56.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft VP Queried on Downloading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government attorney clashed with a senior  
Microsoft Corp. executive over the often long and awkward 
downloading of Web browsers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase said Thursday it was a  
simple process. But under cross-examination by Justice Department 
attorney David Boies, Chase acknowledged it also can take some time 
for personal computer owners with low-speed phone connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is significant because of Microsoft's claim that  
people who receive its browser as part of the Windows operating 
system simply can switch to another, such as Navigator, the browser 
made by Microsoft rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies sought to show how downloading browser software over the  
Web is much more difficult for consumers than getting it with their 
new computers or through Internet service providers like America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department contends in its antitrust lawsuit that  
Microsoft used its monopoly power and illegal tactics to crush and 
discourage competition, including Netscape and its rival browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies presented Chase with a March 1997 e-mail, sent to him by a  
Microsoft employee, on how to get more people to use the company's 
browser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 60 percent of all surfers have never downloaded any  
software from the Web. My sense is that these people are not very 
likely to download anything, let alone a browser that takes two 
hours to download,'' wrote that employee, Kumar Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo goes on to report that ``80 percent of those who do not  
use IE say they have no plans to switch to it, which means that if 
we take away IE from the o/s (operating system), most nav (Netscape 
Navigator) users will never switch to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase said he had no problem with the report but disputed its  
interpretation. He said Mehta was being ``dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also went over the deposition taken from another Microsoft  
employee, Joe Belfiore, a computer programmer who last March cited 
``tons of feedback that suggest that downloading IE (Internet 
Explorer) takes too long, is too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find that the number of hours that it takes to download  
these components over a phone line is incredibly discouraging to 
people, often fails, and the result is that people don't get an 
improved user experience at all,'' Belfiore said in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase acknowledged that at the time, he oversaw efforts to make  
Microsoft's browser smaller to help make it more appealing to 
consumers. But he disagreed with Belfiore's suggestion that 
downloading is difficult. He suggested that Belfiore perhaps was 
engaging in self-critique popular in the ``Microsoft culture.''

<HEADLINE> Market Glut Hits Treasury Bonds / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled in light trading Friday  
after a $35 billion government auction overwhelmed customer demand 
for the new securities, sending investors to the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 2 1-16  
points, or $20.63 for each $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, 
which moves in the opposite direction from price, shot up to 5.42 
percent from 5.30 percent at Thursday's quarterly auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading Friday ended at 2 p.m. in observance of the three-day  
President's Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $35 billion in five-year, 10-year  
and 30-year securities between Tuesday and Thursday. But investor 
demand has been tepid, leading to a supply bottleneck by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the selloff was an overnight decline in Japanese  
government bond prices that carried over into morning trading of 
fixed-rate securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices apparently had no reaction to the Senate's historic  
vote Friday to acquit President Clinton, ending only the second 
presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. A sharp drop in 
stock markets also had little impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 3/16 point and 7/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down between 9-16 point and 1 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 6.39 
points to 1,297.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.52 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.42 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.57 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 percentage 
point to 4.42 percent. One-year yields were 4.71 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.05 percentage point to 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 27/32 from 125 11/32 late 
Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.15 percent, up from 
5.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> USDA OKs Irradiation of Red Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Irradiated red meat moved closer to the  
nation's supermarkets Friday when the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture approved the controversial process for zapping 
potentially deadly bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do all we can to give consumers confidence we have  
the safest food supply in the world, which it is,'' Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said at a meeting in Charlotte of the 
National Cattlemen's Beef Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed USDA rule would permit -- but not require --  
irradiation for refrigerated or frozen uncooked meat, and some meat 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry welcomed the announcement, saying it will make meat  
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-nuclear groups oppose the procedure and some health  
advocates fear it might lead to a relaxation of other safety 
practices such as plant sanitation. Irradiation also remains a hot 
issue in America's kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let someone else try it first before I buy it,'' said  
Annie Miller as she loaded groceries into her car outside a 
supermarket in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	During irradiation, low-level doses of gamma rays or electron  
beam irradiation are administered to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Irradiation is the only known method to eliminate a potentially  
deadly strain of E. coli in raw meat. The technology can also 
significantly reduce levels of listeria, salmonella and 
campylobacter bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, contamination at a meat processing plant in Michigan  
was linked to 11 deaths, and listeria was the suspected culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA rule on irradiation will be published in the Federal  
Register within 10 days, with a 60-day period after that for public 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles P. Schroeder, head of the Cattlemen's Beef Association,  
said: ``It is not often that industry eagerly awaits new government 
regulations and guidelines, but the use of this technology in the 
beef industry will benefit both beef producers and consumers'' by 
producing safer beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of  
America, added: ``In the simplest of terms, food irradiation will 
save lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether meatpackers will make widespread  
use of the technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see irradiation as another potential tool for enhancing  
food safety. Ultimately, it will be up to the consumer to determine 
whether it's an acceptable practice,'' said Gary Mickelson, 
spokesman for meatpacking giant IBP Inc. of Dakota, Neb. ``First we 
need to see what the rules are. After that, we may test-market some 
ground beef.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration ruled in 1997 that irradiation  
is safe for raw meat, and also has approved irradiation for years 
in poultry, pork, spices and some raw produce. 
</P>
<P>
	But USDA regulates the processing and labeling of red meat, so  
it had to write regulations to guide how meat processors 
incorporated the new technology into the plants, how they used 
different dosages and how they labeled the resulting products. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the major food companies has stepped forward to market  
irradiated products. Only a few small retailers offer irradiated 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like pasteurization of milk,'' said rancher Wallace  
Schulthes, who raises cattle in Utah. ``At one time, people were 
concerned it would be bad for them. Look at the benefits of that.''

<HEADLINE> Web Site Reveals Intimate Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The lovers, flirts and playboys sending  
e-mail Valentines and other notes on Hallmark Cards' online site no 
doubt intended their musings to be perused only by that special 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwittingly, they had a potential audience of millions.  
</P>
<P>
	A programming error at hallmark.com allowed anyone with a  
computer and some curiosity to search the Web site for private love 
notes -- and, in many cases, the senders' name, home and e-mail 
addresses and place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	The security breach surprised customers and executives at the  
Kansas City-based company, which this week scrambled to modify the 
computer program after The Kansas City Star reported the problem. 
Technicians have since deleted all of the old messages. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hallmark official said the problem involved only greetings  
sent a year or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a programming error,'' company spokeswoman Julie O'Dell  
said. ``We certainly are committed to providing privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recipient of a cyber Hallmark greeting card first gets an  
e-mail from the company, including a password. Then he or she 
clicks on a Web address to view the card. 
</P>
<P>
	But until this week, all those messages were available to anyone  
who used the site's search engine, the newspaper reported. That 
means if the word ``bear'' was typed, for example, Hallmark's 
computer would have given you a list of Web pages including that 
word -- including one page featuring a sweet message from ``Teddy 
Bear'' to his ``Honey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea,'' said Gary Harders of Chicago, who sent one of  
the cards to his wife. ``I assumed it was private. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defeats the whole purpose of sending somebody a personal  
card if everybody and his brother is going to get ahold of it. It 
could be embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Dell said she had no idea how many people might have  
clicked through the greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new system has, built in, a new standard to ensure this  
kind of thing doesn't happen again,'' she said. ``We don't want a 
lot of people worried. None of the recent electronic greetings were 
in that file.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Star, some of the messages were obviously not  
meant for mass consumption. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Gary &AMP; I have been having secret cyber sex via computer.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I've seen you swing a sledge hammer and the way your muscles  
ripple ... is amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``You deserve an extra foot massage tonight!''  
</P>
<P>
	Another writer e-mailed an intimate message and a photo of a  
flower to a woman friend, trying to entice her into a romantic 
rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will have the greatest time you've had in 15 years,'' he  
assured his friend -- unless the other man in her life persuaded her 
to stay home with him and their children instead.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign Lake, Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars wasted no  
time trying to shore up their defense Friday, getting safety 
Carnell Lake and defensive tackle Gary Walker on the first day of 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars, who won their first AFC Central title but again  
came up short in the playoffs with a suspect defense, agreed to a 
contract with Lake about the time Walker arrived to meet with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our style has always been to be well-organized and to strike  
fast,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``No doubt we're a better 
defensive team with these two players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contracts were not immediately available. The  
Florida Times-Union reported on its web site that Walker, an 
unrestricted free agent from Tennessee, signed for $3.6 million 
over five years, including a $4 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of Lake ends a 10-year career with the Pittsburgh  
Steelers in which he was a three-time All-Pro selection at safety 
and haunted the Jaguars the minute they arrived in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin couldn't help but mention a 28-3 loss at Three Rivers  
Stadium in 1996. Trailing 14-3 at halftime, the Jaguars drove the 
length of the field to start the third quarter when Lake came on a 
blitz, jarred the ball loose from Mark Brunell and returned it 90 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has always found a way to get in position,'' Coughlin said.  
``It seems like he always makes ... some kind of momentum-changing 
play on defense, and that always helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 31, Lake doesn't exactly fit into the Jaguars' mold of going  
after young players, but Coughlin was enthused about the experience 
and leadership he could bring. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 25, has started every game he has played the past three  
years for the then-Oilers. He had seven sacks two years ago, tied 
for the best on the team, but had just one sack last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things I didn't do well last year,''  
Walker said. ``I never got it under control and I started putting 
too much pressure on myself. But I think I can get that turned 
around pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars' defense is going through somewhat of an overhaul,  
which some may regard as good news. The Jaguars were 25th in total 
defense and got only 30 sacks -- 6 1/2 from last year's premier free 
agent, Bryce Paup, who wasn't used as a pass-rush specialist the 
way he thought he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 11 players who started in a 34-24 playoff loss to  
the New York Jets are unrestricted free agents. Safety Chris Hudson 
recently turned down a five-year deal worth $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dom Capers, who led the Blitzburg defense before his  
four-year tenure as coach of Carolina Panthers, has been hired as 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers will get another chance to work with Lake, who has 16  
interceptions, 16 forced fumbles and 16 fumble recoveries during a 
10-year career in which he has gone to the Pro Bowl four times. 
</P>
<P>
	He has split time between safety and cornerback the past couple  
of years as the Steelers have dealt with free agency losses and 
injuries, but Coughlin said he would return to safety in 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at his age, he's extremely fast,'' Coughlin said. ``No  
matter what tape you study, you see him in coverage situations and 
there isn't any doubt in my mind he return full-time to safety will 
allow him to be productive and to be counted on to help direct 
traffic.''

<HEADLINE> Evening Papers Get Clinton Scoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``CLINTON ACQUITTED.'' ``IT'S OVER.''   	
</P>
<P>
	With headlines like these, some nearly 4 inches high, the  
nation's evening newspapers brought the outcome of the century's 
only presidential impeachment trial to their readers on the day it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rare we get to say, `Halleluah! We're a PMs paper,' but  
today was good,'' said Susan Ihne, executive editor of the St. 
Cloud (Minn.) Times, which printed a story by The Associated Press 
on the end of the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to acquit President Clinton of perjury and obstruction  
of justice came at about 12:30 p.m. EST Friday, a time many editors 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew from the beginning of the day that it was going to be  
a noon vote, so we knew it would be something ... that we could be 
comfortable with,'' said Robert Kraft, managing editor of the 
Cincinnati Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post's final edition, with its Page 1 headline, ``CLINTON  
ACQUITTED,'' and also using the AP story, was published 30 minutes 
later than usual. The newspaper also added about 700 papers to its 
usual final-edition press run of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For some newspapers, including the Aiken Standard in South  
Carolina, it was the first time editors had held the presses for a 
late-breaking national story since the October 1995 acquittal of 
O.J. Simpson on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was a historic thing,'' explained Jeff Wallace,  
managing editor in Aiken, where 80 percent of the press run was 
delayed for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors at many afternoon dailies watched in frustration as the  
clock ticked past their earlier deadlines and the Senate continued 
to debate behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We held and we held and we held, and they talked and talked  
and talked,'' said Mike Lloyd, editor of The Grand Rapids Press in 
Michigan. ``We waited 45 minutes, and we finally had to let the 
paper go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said the newspaper did get the story into about two-thirds  
of the 95,000 copies of the late edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon papers ``rarely get the newsbreak,'' said Sue Jones,  
graphics editor at the Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail. This time was 
different; ``IT'S OVER'' announced the paper's 1 1/2-inch high 
headline. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Examiner ran the news even bigger -- 270-point  
print, or nearly 4 inches tall, a headline that said simply, 
``ACQUITTED.'' The Examiner bumped up circulation by 20,000 papers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the St. Albans (Vt.) Messenger, deadlines were pushed back  
two hours until the vote was finished. The headline for its 5,200 
readers was about double its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a keepsake,'' explained Emerson Lynn, editor and  
publisher. ``You can't hold a radio broadcast or a television 
newscast, but you can hold our front page in your hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, where word of the scandal surfaced 13 months  
ago, early indications were that the Senate vote lacked the appeal 
of the Clinton grand jury testimony video in August to millions 
over four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	ABCnews.com reported 60,000 people watched the Senate's vote  
live on the Web -- a fraction of the estimated 500,000 to 700,000 
visitors to the site over the course of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was the anticlimax to something that has been writing  
itself on the walls for several days now,'' said Laura Durkin, news 
director for the Fox News site. ``Perhaps there's less a sense of 
breathlessness to the whole thing that TV usually provides.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Impeachment Provides Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton can take solace from  
history. Andrew Johnson, the only other U.S. president impeached 
and acquitted, rebuilt his political life. 
</P>
<P>
	After he left the White House, Johnson went home to Tennessee  
and was elected to the Senate, serving with 13 senators who had 
voted to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came back and he made one last speech,'' says Donald  
Ritchie, associate Senate historian. ``It was like he was saying, 
`I was not defeated by you people. I'm still here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It took Johnson seven years to make his comeback after the House  
impeached him in 1868 on a series of charges stemming from his 
dispute with Congress over Reconstruction. When the Senate fell one 
vote short of convicting him, Johnson served the remaining 10 
months of his presidency and returned to his native Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	After unsuccessful bids for House and Senate seats in 1869 and  
1872, Johnson was elected to the Senate, becoming the only former 
president to ever serve in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	He took his oath on a snowy day in March 1875.  
</P>
<P>
	His entrance into the chamber caused a stir. A senator from  
Vermont, who had voted to convict Johnson, stopped speaking and sat 
down, upsetting some books in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several other senators who had also voted to convict looked  
the other way, or pretended to be busy with papers at their 
desks,'' Paul Boller Jr. wrote in ``Congressional Anecdotes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, his colleagues applauded him. ```I miss my old  
friends,' Johnson said, tears in his eyes,'' Boller writes. 
</P>
<P>
	His stint in the Senate, however, was short-lived. On July 31,  
1875, just a few months after taking his oath, Johnson suffered a 
stroke and died. His body was wrapped in a flag and he was buried 
in Greenville, Tenn., with a well-worn copy of the Constitution 
placed under his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, says Johnson's  
place in history never really has been settled. He has gone up and 
down in the estimation of historians. Sometimes he even is judged 
as a ``great defender of the Constitution,'' Foner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Johnson's name is rarely mentioned in history books  
without the word ``impeached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Blessing of Alvernia College in Pennsylvania, who surveys  
other historians to rank presidents, says it was acute partisanship 
-- ``worse than what we're seeing now'' -- that prompted Johnson's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the fact that it was very clearly a very partisan  
activity, that impeachment has driven him into the basement of 
presidents,'' Blessing said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Jeter Focuses on Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Derek Jeter is concentrating on making  
contact, not contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees shortstop has spent the past two weeks  
taking batting practice and fielding grounders in preparation for 
the start of spring training next week. His agent, Casey Close, has 
been the one preparing for a salary arbitration hearing scheduled 
for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is worrying about it going to do?'' Jeter said Friday  
following a workout at the Yankees' spring training complex. ``I 
can't control it. There's no reason to sit around and worry about 
something that you have no control over. It's out of my hands ... 
All you can do is play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year, is in arbitration for the  
first time and has asked for a raise from $750,000 to $5 million. 
The Yankees countered at $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter said he doesn't know what to expect at the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can answer the question afterwards,'' he said. ``Everything  
is new to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Jeter heads to New York for ESPN's Espy  
Awards, where the Yankees will be honored for their World Series 
championship. On Tuesday, its back to Florida. That's the likely 
day for a ruling on his case. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted but Tarnished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
Clinton declared he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said and 
did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to 
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five  
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort  
led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Several 
Democrats said they did not expect the issue to resurface when 
lawmakers return to the Capitol after a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said one Republican,  
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who twice voted to convict the 
president and strip him of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for  
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, asked Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to autograph a blank Senate roll call form, 
then used it to record the results. Hyde the leader of the 
prosecution effort, sat silently as the verdict was sealed. So, 
too, the legal team that had defended the president. 
</P>
<P>
	For each article of impeachment, a clerk read the charges aloud,  
then Rehnquist said, ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, 
William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the lawmakers rose at their seats to respond. Sen.  
Spencer Abraham of Michigan was first, Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon 
was last. Between the votes, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West 
Virginia sat at his seat, perusing his breastpocket copy of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes, the trial -- the first since Andrew Johnson  
sat in the White House in 1868 -- was over. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was exercising  
in the White House when he received word of the first vote in a 
phone call from his chief of staff, John Podesta. The president had 
returned to work in time to learn he was finally free of the threat 
of removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said later in the Rose Garden that he was ``humbled and very  
grateful for the support and the prayers I have received from 
millions of Americans over this past year. Now I ask all Americans, 
and I hope all Americans here in Washington and throughout our land 
will rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and 
building our future together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' the president said. Similarly, staff members were sent an 
e-mail message from Clinton apologizing that ``my actions and the 
events they triggered have made your work even harder.'' He 
promised to ``redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we 
share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate votes, coming several months after the dismissal of  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, marked the second 
consecutive major legal and political victory for Clinton. He still 
faces the threat of an indictment from Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, either before or after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, the 74-year-old, white-haired chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee, said he hopes that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, he told reporters that despite the verdict  
``I have no regrets. We fulfilled our oath of office to discharge 
our duty according to the Constitution. And when people do that, 
when elected representatives do that, democracy works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had not been any doubt for weeks about the outcome, the  
only suspense coming over whether either article of impeachment 
would gain a majority. In the end, neither did. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia Snowe and  
Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter 
of Pennsylvania, voted to acquit the president on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	On perjury, there were five other Republicans voting to acquit:  
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard 
Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was harsh, bipartisan condemnation of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In comments late Thursday night, as senators were emerging from  
a third long day of closed-door deliberations on Clinton's fate, 
Utah Sen. Robert Bennett said that ``over and over again from both 
sides of the aisle,'' senators had denounced the president as a 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who alone among Democrats had  
voted earlier against dismissal of the charges, said ``President 
Clinton has disgraced himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts were broadcast nationally to a public that had long  
since said it wanted the trial over -- but seemingly never tired of 
watching, reading and joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the politicians said it was time to move on, other key  
players in the sex and cover-up drama were only just starting to 
speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is expected to write a book and make several media  
appearances in the coming months. Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded 
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky helped propel Starr's 
investigation, is also embarking on a series of media appearances 
to refurbish her image. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation began in January 1998, when the nation awoke  
to the shocking allegations that the president had had a sexual 
relationship with a young woman in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	His denials were famously forthright -- ``I did not have sexual  
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' he said a few days 
later. But that depended, it later developed, on the definition of 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a string of embarrassing disclosures, and at one point  
it turned out that Ms. Lewinsky had evidence of a sexual encounter, 
a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress what he said was evidence of impeachable  
offenses in September, 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of pages of salacious material was released to the  
public at cyber-speed. Republicans and Democrats went to war almost 
immediately in the House, and by year's end, the GOP muscled 
through a formal impeachment inquiry unlimited in time or scope. 
</P>
<P>
	Their drive was stalled at the elections, though, when the GOP  
lost seats in a campaign that was widely viewed as a referendum of 
sorts on the president's fate. Republicans returned to a lame duck 
session determined to wrap up the case speedily, and narrowly won 
approval of two of four articles of impeachment that had been 
approved by the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened in the Senate on Jan. 7, with the unforgettable  
sight of Rehnquist mounting the dais, senators vowing to do 
impartial justice and walking to the front of the chamber to sign 
an impeachment book. 
</P>
<P>
	The two legal teams clashed for days on end, but the real  
struggle played out in closed-door party caucuses. There, 
Democratic support for Clinton hardened. Republicans, sensing 
political damage, fractured.

<HEADLINE> Kent Cooke Given Redskin Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins appeared on the  
verge of losing all their free agents and getting none to take 
their place. Then Paul Tagliabue stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the Thursday midnight deadline for the start of the  
free-agent signing period, the NFL commissioner intervened in a 
power struggle between the team's management and its interim owners 
and declared president John Kent Cooke in charge -- at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commissioner Tagliabue today confirmed that current Redskin  
management retains full authority to direct the operation of the 
team, including player and coach employment until the sale of the 
Redskins is approved by NFL clubs,'' a statement from the league 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner acted after learning that the special  
committee of the trustees for Jack Kent Cooke's estate recently 
denied management the authority to re-sign certain players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's move was a relief to general manager Charley  
Casserly, whose hands had been tied at the bargaining table by the 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately got on the phone and reopened negotiations with  
quarterback Trent Green and cut disenchanted quarterback Gus 
Frerotte, saving the team a $1.25 million roster bonus that would 
have been due at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we have the go-ahead to operate,'' Casserly said.  
``We've done that. We've talked to Trent Green's agent. We'll be on 
the phone ... talking to other free agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly's future -- as well as that of everyone who works for  
the Redskins -- remains in limbo, however, as NFL owners consider 
whether to approve the sale of the team to a group headed by 
brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Synder for a 
league-record $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees of the late Cooke's estate agreed to sell the team  
to the Milstein-Snyder group on Jan. 10. Three-fourths of the NFL 
team owners must give their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers, trustees and many within the Redskins organization  
were hoping that approval would come at an owners' meeting next 
week in Atlanta, but that meeting was canceled Thursday. The next 
scheduled meeting of the full ownership is March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners have said they would have preferred that John Kent  
Cooke, Jack Kent Cooke's only surviving son, purchase the team. But 
the younger Cooke, who has represented the Redskins at league 
meetings for nearly 20 years, was not able to outbid Milstein and 
Snyder in a months-long action conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of a tussle between the trustees and the Redskins  
management have been evident for days as the team made no progress 
in re-signing priority free agents Green, linebacker Marvcus 
Patton, receiver Leslie Shepherd and center Cory Raymer. The annual 
eve-of-free agency press conference with Casserly and coach Norv 
Turner was canceled Thursday with just two hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under normal conditions, we could have reached a deal by  
midnight,'' said Glenn Schwartzmann, Shepherd's agent. ``They would 
have loved to be able to do that, but obviously the circumstances 
have been a little bit complicated.''

<P>
	The articles of impeachment against President Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	Resolution impeaching William Jefferson Clinton, president of  
the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolved, that William Jefferson Clinton, president of the  
United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and 
that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the 
United States Senate: 
</P>
<P>
	Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of  
Representatives of the United States of America in the name of 
itself and of the people of the United States of America, against 
William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States of 
America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him 
for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE I   	
</P>
<P>
	In his conduct while president of the United States, William  
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath 
faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States 
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial 
process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration, 
impeding the administration of justice, in that: 
</P>
<P>
	On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the  
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before a federal 
grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William 
Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of 
the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with 
a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he 
allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil 
rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the 
testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in 
that civil rights action. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	ARTICLE III   	
</P>
<P>
	In his conduct while president of the United States, William  
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath 
faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States 
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration 
of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through his 
subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed 
to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence 
and testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought 
against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme  
included one or more of the following acts: 
</P>
<P>
	(1) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding 
that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	(2) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him to give perjurious, false and misleading 
testimony if and when called to testify personally in that 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	(3) On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal 
evidence that had been subpoenaed in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
	(4) Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing  
through and including January 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton 
intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to 
a witness in a federal civil rights action brought against him in 
order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness 
in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that 
witness would have been harmful to him. 
</P>
<P>
	(5) On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a federal civil  
rights action brought against him, William Jefferson Clinton 
corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and misleading 
statements to a federal judge characterizing an affidavit, in order 
to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge. Such false and 
misleading statements were subsequently acknowledged by his 
attorney in a communication to that judge. 
</P>
<P>
	(6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William  
Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of events 
relevant to a federal civil rights action brought against him to a 
potential witness in that proceeding, in order to corruptly 
influence the testimony of that witness. 
</P>
<P>
	(7) On or about January 21, 23 and 26, 1998, William Jefferson  
Clinton made false and misleading statements to potential witnesses 
in a federal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence 
the testimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading 
statements made by William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the 
witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive 
false and misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> American Back in Court Over Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled nearly half of its  
flights today as the nation's second-largest airline asked a 
federal judge to hold the pilots union in contempt for ignoring his 
back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee Kelly, a lawyer for the airline, told U.S. District Judge  
Joe Kendall that passengers upset by the cancellations caused a 
``near riot'' in Miami after the airline shut down a ticket window. 
He said 450,000 passengers have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a near riot in Miami and they had to close a ticket  
counter in New York,'' Kelly said at a hearing on the airline's 
request for a contempt finding. He didn't specify when the two 
incidents happened. Miami airport police did not immediately return 
a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the eve of the busy Presidents Day weekend travel period,  
the company said it was canceling 1,046 flights, nearly half its 
normal 2,250 daily flights. It was a similar situation Thursday, 
even though Kendall had issued a back to work order on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union leaders have thumbed their noses at management and  
the public,'' Kelly said today. ``The airline has suffered enough 
and it is time that the pilots suffer along with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall asked union President Rich LaVoy how strongly the union  
had urged pilots to resume flying. American has suggested the union 
has been lukewarm in its efforts to get workers to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our honest intent was to immediately get a message out,''  
LaVoy told the judge. ``Our pilots are intelligent people; I think 
they understand that a judge is a powerful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy also said he would do more to get members back on the job,  
even ``if I have to drive around with a loudspeaker on top of my 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In answer to another question from the judge, LaVoy stated that  
the pilots union has a net worth of about $36 million to $38 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also made clear his views on the pilots' action,  
asking the union chief: ``When you call in sick and get paid for it 
and you're really not, is that not stealing?'' LaVoy responded that 
his members weren't stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing broke for lunch at midday with no ruling from the  
judge. Even if pilots did go back to work immediately, travel was 
expected to be disrupted for days as planes and crews are moved 
into the proper positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of flights have been canceled since Saturday. Analysts  
have predicted the airline will lose millions of dollars. American 
estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots -- one in every four -- 
called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy urged pilots to return to work. But during a previous  
pilot sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return 
despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are disgruntled over pay disparities that have resulted  
from American's slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air. 
Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an 
experienced American pilot is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said the pilot union's demands to add Reno pilots to the  
higher pay scale quickly would cost as much as $50 million this 
year, and no progress has been reported in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton today urged the two sides to settle their  
differences, citing ``the potential for enormous disruption over 
the upcoming Presidents Day holiday weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the  
issue, but federal regulations require pilots to call in sick if 
they think they are undue emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jim Philpot, a union spokesman, said: ``We are meeting or  
exceeding the judge's requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, passengers were still trying to reschedule or get  
refunds, swamping American's reservation desk with calls and 
finding themselves disconnected or waiting on hold.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Says Teamsters Witness Lied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors contend a key witness in the  
federal investigation into the Teamsters lied to them after he made 
a deal to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to defense attorneys for former union officials and  
to court-appointed officers monitoring the union, the prosecutors 
said the witness, Jere Nash, had ``falsely denied any role'' in a 
scheme to defraud the union through improper billings. 
</P>
<P>
	The billings scheme apparently was only tangential to the  
election scandal that led to the ouster of union president Ron 
Carey and the federal indictment of the union's former political 
director, William Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash was Carey's campaign manager and a key witness against him  
before the court-appointed board that removed him from office. The 
government's case against Hamilton also rests in large part on 
conversations he allegedly had with Nash about political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nash acknowledged that, when previously questioned by the  
government regarding these expenses, he intentionally withheld 
information about the scheme, and falsely denied any role in the 
billing of expenses,'' according to the Feb. 5 letter from U.S. 
Attorney Mary Jo White. The letter was obtained Thursday by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey's 1996 re-election over James P. Hoffa was overturned  
after investigators found that his campaign had improperly 
benefited from donations the union made to third-party political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, political consultant Martin Davis and telemarketer Michael  
Ansara all pled guilty to the scheme in 1997. Nash implicated Carey 
before the court-appointed review board, and both he and Davis 
alleged that Hamilton participated. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is fighting the charges, and Carey has an appeal  
pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The new allegations involve more than $21,000 in campaign  
expenses that Nash and Davis improperly billed to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash apparently admitted his role in the scheme earlier this  
month, after denying it for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am bringing this to your attention in connection with your  
pending appeals of Mr. Carey's and Mr. Hamilton's discipline by the 
Independent Review Board,'' White wrote.

<HEADLINE> Japan Market's Main Index Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index edged higher  
today for the second consecutive day as the market waited for the 
outcome of a policy-setting meeting of Japan's central bank. The 
dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.32 yen in late afternoon, down 0.98 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 114.61 yen overnight. It ranged during the day from 114.08 yen 
to 114.78 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 128.54 yen, down from 130.22 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Thursday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 21.29  
points, or 0.15 percent, closing the week at 13,973.69 points. On 
Wednesday, the index rose 49.74 points, or 0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were moderately higher for much of the day amid hopes  
that the Bank of Japan may decide to take action to curb a recent 
surge in long-term interest rates. The results of the Bank of 
Japan's meeting were not announced by late afternoon after trading 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to touch the market right now, ahead of the  
outcome of the BOJ's meeting,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant general 
manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International Trust 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Political pressure has been building for the Bank of Japan to  
buy government bonds to help lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank has refused, saying such a measure would set  
off inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 452  
million shares, up from Wednesday's turnover of 423 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 583 to 534, with 165 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 6.44 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,089.53. The 
TOPIX shed 0.56 points, or 0.05 percent, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, some U.S. hedge funds sold the American  
currency on speculation that the Bank of Japan will leave interest 
rates alone for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.080 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.995 percent, driving its price down to 97.81 yen from 98.46 yen.

<HEADLINE> Pilot: Cables a Chronic Hazard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Cables supporting a gondola system at  
a ski resort in the Italian Alps weren't marked as a hazard and 
were a chronic ``danger point'' for airplanes, an Italian 
helicopter pilot testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno Avi testified for the defense in the court-martial of  
Capt. Richard Ashby, a Marine pilot whose jet sliced a gondola 
cable last year, killing 20 people. Avi was permitted to testify 
during the prosecution's case so he could return home this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable system was ``almost impossible to see'' from the air,  
Avi said. ``The cables have always been a danger point for 
whoever's flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said Ashby's EA-6B Prowler jet was flying 621  
mph when it cut the cable, violating altitude restrictions and the 
mission's speed limit by more than 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
could face more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend Ashby was issued a map that didn't  
show the gondola and that his plane's radar altimeter was faulty.

<HEADLINE> Niners Make Owens Franchise Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Terrell Owens' free agency comes with  
strings attached. The San Francisco 49ers made sure of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of losing the star receiver, the 49ers on Thursday made him  
their franchise player, driving up the price for any other team 
that wants to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the franchise tag, San Francisco offered Owens a  
one-year contract worth $3.5 million, the average salary last 
season for the five highest-paid receivers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who supplanted Jerry Rice as the 49ers' go-to receiver  
last year, could have become a restricted free agent today, when 
the league's trading and free agency period begins. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still negotiate with other teams, and the 49ers retain  
the right of first refusal. The franchise designation means any 
other team signing him would have to pay San Francisco two 
first-round picks, the first in 1999 and the second in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	John McVay, director of football operations, said the move  
reflects the organization's esteem for Owens, who made one of the 
biggest catches in franchise history when he snagged a last-second 
touchdown pass to beat Green Bay in a January playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	McVay added that the 49ers hope other teams interested in  
signing Owens are scared off by the steep price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't guarantee it because somebody could still come in  
with an offer with enough poison pills that you couldn't match, but 
if it did happen, at least you have the consolation of getting two 
first-round picks,'' McVay said. 
</P>
<P>
	McVay said the 49ers still hope to sign Owens to a long-term  
deal, and they also plan to try to retain fellow wideout J.J. 
Stokes, who became eligible for unrestricted free agency today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McVay would neither confirm nor deny reports that  
quarterback Ty Detmer and possibly defensive end Roy Barker and 
tight end Irv Smith would be traded to Cleveland in exchange for 
draft picks. A club source said there have been trade talks between 
the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of people on the roster. We just have to see  
how things unfold,'' McVay said. ``Things can change from day to 
day. We'll just have to see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVay added the 49ers have completed restructuring the contracts  
of a dozen players, gaining approximately $17 million in salary cap 
relief. Provided the redone contracts are approved by the league, 
McVay said the team will be about $2 million under the $57.5 
million cap, which becomes effective today. 
</P>
<P>
	Players whose contracts were restructured were Steve Young,  
Jerry Rice, Ray Brown, Ken Norton Jr., Chris Doleman, Bryant Young, 
Tim McDonald, Winfred Tubbs, Gabe Wilkins, Lee Woodall, Harris 
Barton and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers began the offseason about $28 million over the cap.  
They realized an additional $13 million in cap relief through the 
retirement of Kirk Scrafford, the expiration of Marquez Pope's and 
Terry Kirby's contracts and the loss of cornerback Antonio Langham, 
linebacker James Williams and center Steve Gordon to Cleveland in 
the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh speculated that the team's bloated  
player payroll might require the release of such players as safety 
Merton Hanks and guard Kevin Gogan, but they both survived the 
initial cost-cutting moves. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their future with the team remains in question. The  
49ers could gain some financial advantages by waiting until after 
June 1 to release Gogan or Hanks. That would cushion the impact on 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said he wants to keep the team together as  
much as possible, but also conceded economics might not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, their future lies with the 49ers. Can that change?  
Yes,'' Mariucci said. ``We certainly have to make more cap room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also worked out quarterback Jeff Garcia on  
Thursday. Garcia, a former San Jose State star, has played five 
years in the Canadian Football League, where he was player of the 
year last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the 49ers have an interest in signing Garcia and  
plan to talk to him again next week.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Looked for Other Solutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Henry Hyde, lead prosecutor in the case  
against President Clinton, says he was tempted to find a way out of 
the impeachment drama in the House, but decided ``it just became 
too difficult to fashion a resolution that would be satisfactory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I became convinced that we didn't have the votes to remove the  
president and therefore, we were going to go through a very 
arduous, strenuous, gut-wrenching process without an appropriate 
end,'' Hyde told reporters in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the difficulty was in convincing his own rank and  
file, many of them strongly pro-impeachment, he replied, ``That was 
too difficult. I never discussed this with very many people. I was 
interested and became convinced it wasn't practical.'' He declined 
to provide any other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted acquittal on Friday on both articles of  
impeachment, one alleging perjury, the other obstruction of 
justice. Both charges arose from Clinton's efforts to conceal his 
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde also said he hopes and believes that Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr will not indict the president at the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I predict he (Starr) won't indict. ``I predict that when he  
(Clinton) leaves office, he won't be bothered on this,'' the 
74-year-old Illinois lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his own views, he said, ``I think for the good of the  
country probably forget it. It was like Nixon, should Nixon go to 
jail? I think that would not have been good for the country, to 
have a president locked up in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said House prosecutors ``never had high expectations of  
winning'' their case for Clinton's removal in the trial. ``But 
there was never a choice. We had to proceed,'' he said, adding that 
he believes both charges were amply documented. 
</P>
<P>
	In an hourlong interview this week inside the House Judiciary  
Committee suite of offices, Hyde said that partisanship by 
Democrats had complicated impeachment proceedings in the House, but 
a desire for bipartianship by Senate Republicans hampered efforts 
to prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, he said, he kept hoping some Democrats would  
``rise above party politics. ... It was naive thinking this could 
be bipartisan,'' he said. ``This was as hardball as you can get. 
This is deposing a president in his sixth year and the Democrats 
are tenacious in refusing to let that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was different in the Senate, where a two-thirds  
vote was needed to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have to criticize the senators, or at least the  
Republican senators who voted to do that (sharply restrict the 
number of witnesses), they do make bipartisanship the ultimate 
ethic over there. And that oftentimes in practical terms means 
yielding to the minority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, House prosecutors were told they needed to trim their list  
of suggested witnesses to three if they were to win any, Hyde said.

wired city in America for the second year in a row, according to a 
recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, Texas, and Seattle netted the No. 2 and 3 spots,  
respectively, indicating Silicon Valley may be starting to lose its 
dominance as newly wired cities start to flex their technological

	``People assume the Internet is where people are putting  
together computers,'' said Ben Greenman, executive editor of Yahoo!

<HEADLINE> Rubin Recognizes Bank Change Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, citing the  
recent wave of big corporate mergers, acknowledged today there are 
``legitimate concerns'' that overhauling the financial services 
laws could concentrate economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Clinton administration's top economic policymaker, Rubin  
supports the goal of legally removing barriers separating banks, 
brokerage firms and insurance companies. But he told the House 
Banking Committee there are valid concerns over the impact of such 
legislation regarding economic concentration and risk to the 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the developments around the world over the  
last couple of years, and when you look at the size of mergers here 
in the United States over the same period, there are legitimate 
concerns about financial modernization,'' Rubin said in testimony 
prepared for a Banking Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has given a ringing  
endorsement to financial overhaul legislation, but Ralph Nader and 
other critics are worried about the money ``supermarkets'' such a 
measure would create. 
</P>
<P>
	As Greenspan waded into this year's debate on Thursday, he  
brushed aside concerns that such legislation would bring about a 
dangerous concentration of economic power. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Fed chairman extended his public  
disagreement with Rubin and the administration over the best 
approach to take to revamping the financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, Nader and others spoke at a Banking Committee hearing  
Thursday as Congress began the latest round of debate on financial 
overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank chief endorsed a bill proposed by committee  
Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, that would lift the barriers between 
financial services industries and give the independent Fed more 
power over new financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, on the other hand, today reaffirmed the administration's  
opposition to Leach's bill, saying President Clinton would have 
vetoed the legislation had it passed Congress last year in its 
current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation to let banks, brokerages and insurers merge  
and move more deeply into each other's businesses died in Congress 
last year after coming closer to passage than it had in many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say such an overhaul is needed to keep the U.S.  
industry competitive in a fast-changing world. They say it would 
save consumers money by encouraging the creation of one-stop 
financial ``supermarkets'' offering checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents, including Nader and several consumer groups,  
contend it could bring more megamergers and concentrate economic 
power in a few hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach's bill ``is not a bill for consumers,'' Nader testified  
Thursday. ``It is a bill designed to create new profit centers for 
a relative handful of banking and financial services 
corporations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, said the banking industry should 
not ``leave average, working-class Americans behind'' by 
discriminating against customers with smaller accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in response to questions from Rep. Bernard Sanders of  
Vermont, Congress' lone independent, Greenspan said he did not 
share concerns about financial concentration because technology has 
brought ``a major increase in competitive pressures throughout this 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging there are some ``extraordinarily wealthy  
billionaires'' in this country, Greenspan said that is the result 
of soaring stock prices, not corporate mergers. Many mergers 
actually have not worked very well, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the legislation worry that mergers creating financial  
conglomerates -- such as the recent marriage of banking giant 
Citicorp and the Travelers Group insurance-brokerage company -- will 
encourage a ``too big to be allowed to fail'' doctrine leading to 
government bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan did express concern over rising bank fees to  
consumers, which critics believe have been pushed higher by bank 
mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ongoing process (for regulators) ... to make sure that  
banks maintain appropriate services to their customers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Quotes About Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some quotes in reaction to President Clinton's acquittal on the  
articles of impeachment: 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional  
responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to 
say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what 
I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they 
have imposed on the Congress and the American people.'' -- President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a constitutional duty to carry out. We did that. I  
think we did it in a fair way. We've done what we were required to 
do under the constitution. ... Censure is an extra-constitutional,

	``All Americans can take great comfort in knowing that by  
remaining faithful to this constitutional process, the Congress has 
strengthened, not weakened, the ties that bind our nation 
together.'' -- Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is an overwhelming feeling in that chamber that  
the independent counsel statute either should be fixed or killed.

<HEADLINE> NFL Free Agent Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the first day of the 1999 free-agent period, another star  
decided to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Thomas, Miami's All-Pro middle linebacker, agreed to a  
$22.5 million, 5-year deal with the Dolphins on Friday, taking 
another attractive free agent off what is probably the thinnest 
market since the system started in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who has played three years, was only a restricted free  
agent, meaning Miami would have had the right to match any offer he 
got and get compensation in return. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dolphins were taking no chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about giving big bonuses and a big  
contract to a player,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``But with Zach, 
you're never going to be concerned about that because you know that 
every day, he's going to give 100 percent. He'll always make you 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins also added one player on Friday, obtaining running  
back Tyrone Wheatley from the New York Giants for a seventh-round 
draft choice. Wheatley, the Giants' first-round pick in 1995, was 
in trouble from the start with the two coaches for whom he played -- 
first Dan Reeves and then Jim Fassel -- and was active for only five 
games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The first big name to switch teams was safety Carnell Lake, who  
left Pittsburgh for division rival Jacksonville. The Jaguars also 
signed defensive tackle Gary Walker, who played three years with 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of Lake ends a 10-year career with the Steelers in  
which he was a three-time All-Pro selection. Lake will be reunited 
with Dom Capers, his former defensive coordinator in Pittsburgh who 
was hired to revamp a Jaguars' defense, which ranked 25th on the 
league last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our style has always been to be well-organized and to strike  
fast,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``No doubt we're a better 
defensive team with these two players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets and punter Tom Tupa agreed to a contract. Tupa  
spent the last three years with New England, where he played under 
Jets coach Bill Parcells in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little other action on the first day teams could make  
offers to free agents. One reason is that some had to make plans 
because the top players available were taken off the board by their 
own teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota re-signed safety Robert Griffith, who could have  
become a free agent and Green Bay did the same with defensive 
tackle Santana Dotson and linebacker George Koonce. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers Antonio Freeman of Green Bay, Arizona's Rob Moore  
and San Francisco's Terrell Owens were designated franchise 
players, meaning their teams can match the offers or let them go 
for two first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The most desirable players left unrestricted include cornerback  
Dale Carter of Kansas City; wide receiver J.J. Stokes of San 
Francisco; defensive end Chad Bratzke of the Giants; linebackers 
Jamir Miller of Arizona and Ed McDaniel of Minnesota; and offensive 
linemen Orlando Brown and Wally Williams of Baltimore and Dave 
Wohlabaugh of New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' designation of Moore left Miller on the market.  
But his agent, Steve Baker, suggested he would return to the desert 
if the price is anywhere closet to competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinals have a very good thing going,'' Baker said.  
``You're talking about a team that has more young defensive talent 
than any team in the league. You're talking a grass field. It's a 
very exciting situation. If Jamir wasn't a Cardinal, it would be a 
team he'd seriously look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the busiest teams are the 49ers and Browns, who are  
somewhat intertwined because Cleveland is being run by Carmen 
Policy and Dwight Clark, who were with San Francisco as recently as 
a last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	They made one deal.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, continuing to cut salaries, sent defensive end Roy  
Barker and tight end Irv Smith to Cleveland for past 
considerations. But a deal to send backup quarterback Ty Detmer to 
the Browns was apparently put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also brought former All-Pro linebacker Chris  
Spielman, who hasn't played a down in the NFL since 1997, in for a 
workout and a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were granted permission by the Bills to bring in  
Spielman, 33, who sat out the 1998 season while his wife, Stefanie, 
was treated for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams, meanwhile, continued to watch expansion  
Cleveland, which has $40 million in cap room left after its 
expansion draft -- far more than any other team. That allows them to 
outbid anyone for players, even if they have to overpay them, the 
main reason the 49ers protected Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what they are going to do,'' says Green Bay general  
manager Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't want to get hit with it.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Increase in China Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China has improved the capabilities of  
missiles aimed at Taiwan but has not increased their numbers for 
five or six years despite fears on the island of a buildup, U.S. 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. tracking of Chinese missiles near the Taiwan Strait has  
discovered no fresh deployments, Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday, a 
Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He discounted published reports that China recently has aimed  
more missiles at Taiwan and suggested that two coming Pentagon 
reports to Congress would find no increase in missiles menacing the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acknowledge that China has been modernizing its armed  
forces and has been increasing its capabilities on a variety of 
fronts,'' Doubleday said. ``But I think it is incorrect to think 
that the missile threat ... is something that developed in the last 
several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Chinese missile buildup near Taiwan happened five  
or six years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's Defense Ministry reports 100 ballistic missiles,  
capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads, aimed at the 
island, which China considers a renegade province. Taiwan's 
military intelligence officials worry the number could hit 600 
within a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remains uneasy about missile deployment and  
Taiwan's defense, however, and the subject is expected to come up 
when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright travels to China and 
meets with Premier Zhu Rongji in early March, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	China frightened Taiwan residents by test-firing missiles near  
the coast in 1995 and 1996. The tests were part of an intimidation 
campaign against independence supporters in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, President Clinton ordered two Navy aircraft carrier  
battle groups to the region in a show of support for Taiwan, which 
the United States has pledged to defend against Chinese attacks 
although it has official government ties only with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has bought Patriot missiles from the United States for  
protection and is studying development of a short-range missile 
defense system because of the Chinese threat. Taiwan also would 
like to be included in any regional defensive umbrella the U.S. 
military deploys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has several research projects to develop  
short-range missile defense systems but has been unable to overcome 
technical challenges to shooting a fast-moving missile out of the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department is scheduled to submit a study to  
Congress within a week on the possible inclusion of Taiwan and 
other Asian nations in a U.S. missile defense system. A second 
Pentagon report will assess the security situation across the 
125-mile-wide Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue, speaking at a  
briefing Thursday, said including Taiwan in such a system would 
violate the agreements that are the foundation of China-U.S. 
relations and would be ``counterproductive to peace and stability 
in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific Region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has been modernizing its armed forces and weapons for  
several years, including making its missiles more powerful and 
accurate, CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers this month. He 
said it remains unclear whether China will become a military 
aggressor.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher,  
with the key index in Bangkok surging more than 10 percent after 
Thailand's Senate passed a bill to set up a bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 10.5 percent to  
347.43 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the market had reacted positively to the Senate's  
passing with its own amendments late Friday of a 
government-sponsored bill to set up a bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the bill still needs to go back to the government and  
the lower house, the dealer said the market was convinced the 
establishment of a bankruptcy court bill was now a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking sector index rose 19.7 percent, while financial  
stocks gained 15.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong share prices surged on the back of overnight gains on  
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips rose 278.62 points, or 3 percent, closing at 9,425.42. 
On Thursday, the index had gained 70.47 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors drove the market higher in reaction to  
overnight sharp gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average gained 2 percent to close at 9363.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Seoul also closed sharply higher, with the main  
index rising 5.3 percent on expectations that reforms in the 
semiconductor industry may soon be completed, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such expectations were prompted by an agreement Thursday between  
Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. and LG Semicon Co. to determine 
the sale price of the latter company by Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 27.78 points to  
551.77. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
21.29 points, or 0.15 percent, closing the week at 13,973.69 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were moderately higher for much of the day amid hopes  
that the Bank of Japan may decide to take action to curb a recent 
surge in long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the Bank of Japan's meeting were not announced by  
late afternoon after trading ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to touch the market right now, ahead of the  
outcome of the BOJ's meeting,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant general 
manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International Trust 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.32 yen in late  
afternoon, down 0.98 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also 
below its late New York level of 114.61 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Taiwan for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 31.46 points, or 1.5 percent, 
to 2,169.00. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine share prices closed higher, buoyed by  
bargain-hunting after six straight days of losses. The Philippine 
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 25.19 points, or 
1.3 percent, to 1,919.78. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, boosted by  
Thursday's gains on Wall Street and strong buying in the banking 
sector. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,889.5, up 22.5 points 
or 0.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed higher on bargain-hunting. The  
Composite Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, rose 7.84 points, or 
1.4 percent, to 570.79. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times  
Index fell 2.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,354.85. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed the week sharply lower  
on continued profit-taking. The Composite Index fell 2.096 points, 
or 0.5 percent, to 400.552.

<HEADLINE> Slew of Crashes Alters Busch Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Busch Series champion Dale Earnhardt  
Jr. crashed twice within two hours Friday, and the second one 
created a five-car wreck that could drastically alter the 
season-opening race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt was one of seven Busch drivers whose cars were damaged  
enough in practice to force them into backups. Under NASCAR rules, 
they must drop to the rear of the field at the start of the NAPA 
Auto Parts 300 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old driver took the blame for the wreck that also  
involved Ted Musgrave, Dick Trickle, Jeff Burton and Chuck Bown. He 
tried to put his car between a slowly moving Michael Waltrip and 
Musgrave, who was up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably shouldn't have stuck my nose in there,'' said  
Earnhardt, who also wrecked in the IROC race before practice. ``I 
should have backed off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrave's car was badly damaged, and he was forced to borrow  
one of Jeff Purvis' backups. Musgrave said more caution is needed 
during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to slow down and pick your way through rather than  
trying to barrel through there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Busch champion Randy LaJoie agreed, saying Earnhardt  
still has much to learn about racing on a fast track such as the 
2 1/2-mile Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is practice,'' LaJoie said. ``They don't pay to win  
practice. I hope people realize that. We've got a garage full of 
torn race cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaJoie said Earnhardt hurt his own chance of winning by wrecking  
his primary car. He doesn't think Earnhardt can be as effective in 
a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure his backup car is going to be good, too,'' LaJoie  
said. ``But without no practice on the stuff, he's going to have a 
tough day tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt also was one of four drivers who crashed out of the  
season-opening IROC event won by his father. Also taken out in that 
crash were Burton, Rusty Wallace and Eddie Cheever. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries in the Busch or IROC wrecks, but four  
drivers were sent to the hospital with injuries from crashes in the 
Discount Auto Parts 200, a NASCAR subcompact race earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of them were treated and released. Two others underwent  
surgery for broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Busch driver Todd Bodine blamed the track for his crash that  
also took out Glenn Allen. Both also must use backups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track's filthy from the Dash race and IROC,'' Bodine said.  
``I ran over something ... hit the wall and then Glenn Allen ran 
into the side of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Fedewa and Matt Kenseth also were involved in accidents, but  
they will start Saturday in their primary cars.

<HEADLINE> Ole Miss Coach Is Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi football coach David Cutcliffe  
was hospitalized Friday for treatment of an inflammation of the 
pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Webb, the coach's physician, said Cutcliffe entered  
Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi earlier in the week 
after an evaluation procedure apparently showed further 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe, 44, who took over the Ole Miss football program at  
the end of last season, was hospitalized in Knoxville, Tenn., with 
pancreatitis prior to the Independence Bowl game. He rejoined the 
team in time to coach Ole Miss to a 35-18 bowl victory over Texas 
Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said the evaluation that apparently caused the latest  
inflammation had revealed ``a normal healthy pancreas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hospitalized after developing inflammation of the  
pancreas as a result of the study which was done,'' Webb said. 
``This complication occurs in five percent of those who undergo 
this procedure. His condition has improved each day and discharge 
from the hospital is expected soon with a complete recovery.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senate OKs Bankruptcy Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's Senate approved an amended  
bill establishing a bankruptcy court today. It was part of key 
legislation the International Monetary Fund and government see as 
essential to reviving the battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was the first of four vital bankruptcy and  
foreclosure-related bills to clear the Senate, which had threatened 
to derail such legislation when some senators accuse Prime Minister 
Chuan Leekpai's government of opening Thailand up for sale to 
foreign interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisit Wisitsora-at, executive director of the ministry's  
Business Reorganization Office, said that the Senate sided with the 
government to reject a proposed two-year delay in establishing the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, investors and the International Monetary Fund, which  
is administering a $17.2 billion rescue program for the Thai 
economy, view bankruptcy and foreclosure reforms as a prerequisite 
to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The other bills deal with the right by debtors to indefinitely  
extend proceedings simply by not showing up in court, tightening 
rules that allow indefinite appeals and amending the current 
bankruptcy act. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a visiting IMF team conducting a regular quarterly  
review of Thailand's performance under a rescue program left Friday 
after reaching an agreement on goals for the next quarter. Neither 
side released details of the deal.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on American Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge promised a ruling Saturday on  
whether American Airlines' pilots be held in contempt for ignoring 
a back-to-work order as the nation's second-largest airline 
canceled hundreds of flights for all of the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Stranded passengers fumed at airports across the country Friday  
as U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall heard arguments in his Dallas 
courtroom as to whether the Allied Pilots Union should be punished 
for disregarding an order he issued Wednesday. An estimated one out 
of every four American pilots called in sick Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As he adjourned the hearing late Friday afternoon, Kendall  
suggested union officials spend ``a productive evening'' on the 
telephone telling pilots to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to do anything right now. I'm going to recess so  
as not to shoot from the hip,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	American asked for ``a coercive fine'' against the union until  
the pilots return. During the hearing, Kendall asked union leaders 
about the organization's net worth as well as how much they earned 
as pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to resolve the weeklong job action was galling to  
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wasting my vacation standing in line,'' Edwin Amaya, said  
as he waited at Boston's Logan International Airport after learning 
his flight to Miami had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``A federal judge ordered them back to work,'' said Amaya, who  
was trying to get to Panama, via Miami, to enjoy pre-Lenten 
Carnival celebrations and spend a week with his family. ``Why 
aren't they here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	American canceled 1,102 flights Friday, nearly half of its 2,250  
daily flights and slightly below Thursday's grounding of 1,181. It 
already has decided to cancel 536 flights for Saturday and 209 for 
Sunday, said spokesman Chris Chiames. 
</P>
<P>
	American estimated Friday that 450,000 passengers have been  
affected since the job action began Feb. 5. The sick calls 
mushroomed after talks with the airline stalled on issues such as 
differing pay scales for pilots at American and its recently 
acquired Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiames said 2,443 of the airline's 9,400 pilots were on the  
sick list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the pilots' union both said American could  
return to normal operations in three days if the massive sick calls 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can feel the tension in the air,'' Tim Daniel said as he  
waited at Los Angeles International Airport for a flight home to 
Tulsa, Okla., after a holiday in French Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset passengers revolted in Miami on Thursday, company lawyer  
Dee Kelly told the Judge Kendall at the Dallas hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a near-riot in Miami and they had to close a ticket  
counter in New York,'' Kelly said. Miami airport police did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union leaders have thumbed their noses at management and  
the public,'' Kelly told the judge. ``The airline has suffered 
enough and it is time that the pilots suffer along with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Kendall rhetorically asked Rich LaVoy, the union  
president: ``Do you all realize you may be killing the goose that 
lays the golden egg?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall also questioned LaVoy on how strongly pilots were urged  
to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our honest intent was to immediately get a message out,''  
LaVoy told the judge. ``Our pilots are intelligent people; I think 
they understand that a judge is a powerful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy also said he would do more to get members back on the job,  
even ``if I have to drive around with a loudspeaker on top of my 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't rocket science,'' the judge told the pilots at one  
point. ``Go back to work ...''

<HEADLINE> Senators Denounce Clinton Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators announced, one by one, how they  
would vote in the impeachment trial, some of them used harsh words 
to describe the conduct that led to the case against President 
Clinton. A sampling: immoral, deplorable, disgraceful, 
indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said he was arrogant.  
</P>
<P>
	And those were the president's Democratic supporters talking.  
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct at the heart of the charges is deplorable,'' said  
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``The president acted immorally, he 
acted recklessly, he acted disgracefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harshness aside, Feinstein said she was not convinced beyond a  
reasonable doubt that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of 
justice, as alleged by House prosecutors. She said she would vote 
to acquit him when the Senate met today to decide the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators have tongue-lashed Clinton during closed-door  
deliberations on his fate and then described their feelings outside 
the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism was to be expected, from both parties, but it  
seemed to resonate loudest when it came from the president's 
Democratic friends. They had little choice but to talk tough, lest 
they be accused of condoning his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's actions were wrong and arrogant,'' said Sen.  
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announcing that he, too, would vote to 
acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also were scathing in their assessment of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most accomplished, polished liar that we have ever had  
serving in the White House,'' Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah said in 
announcing he would vote to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, one of a handful of moderate  
Republicans who intend to vote for acquittal, said she ``struggled 
throughout ... to reconcile the president's lowly conduct with the 
Constitution's high standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the president's behavior deplorable and indefensible,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said Clinton ``debased'' his office  
and ``violated the soul of justice -- truth. He has thereby debased 
and violated the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer, the former House member who voted against the articles  
of impeachment in December on the House floor and in the Judiciary 
Committee, said the charges failed to meet the standard outlined in 
the Constitution of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., concurred, saying the evidence ``does  
not prove high crimes, but it does prove low character in our 
highest office.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Influential in Surprising Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The television screen crackles with energy each  
weeknight on the ``Adrenaline Rush Hour.'' The earth crumbles, 
flood waters sweep buildings away, planes crash and bloody patients 
are wheeled into emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	It looks like the latest from Fox, the master of heart-stopping,  
sometimes stomach-churning ``reality TV.'' But it's not. 
</P>
<P>
	It's The Learning Channel.  
</P>
<P>
	And TLC isn't alone. Next week on PBS, of all places, the  
award-winning ``NOVA'' documentary presents a four-part miniseries 
on safety with a title that also sounds suspiciously Fox-like: 
``Escape! Because Accidents Happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what exactly is being learned here at these supposedly  
highbrow outposts? 
</P>
<P>
	``How to get ratings,'' Mike Darnell, the Fox executive behind  
his network's rollicking reality shows, said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell is used to people who turn up their noses at Fox and  
consider nonfiction programs like ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and 
``World's Most Shocking Moments'' exploitative or worse. So it's a 
little amusing to see their influence in some of the strangest 
places, where executives would be loath to admit to even watching 
Fox, much less taking cues from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a form of cultured reality.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think of these shows as being like the Fox shows at  
all,'' said John Ford, chief executive at TLC and architect of the 
``Adrenaline Rush Hour.'' ``It had nothing to do with their 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series dates back to April, well after Fox began making its  
mark with similar fare. TLC was looking for a way to tie together 
some disparate programming, like the Emmy-winning medical show 
``Trauma: Life in the ER,'' the disaster series ``Without Warning'' 
and the weather-run-amok collection ``Savage Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford considers the shows perfectly consistent with TLC's  
mission: People who watch them will learn something. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do that's different is tell a story and give the  
information about what's going on, as opposed to saying, `look at 
that guy jumping off a cliff. Isn't that cool?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Adrenaline Rush Hour'' label is part of an effort to  
convince viewers that TLC fare isn't just professors standing in 
front of blackboards. That's also why The Learning Network is 
usually advertised simply as TLC. 
</P>
<P>
	And, yes, the ratings are shooting up. TLC had its best  
quarterly ratings in prime time during the last three months of 
1998 and is on track to better that this year. The two medical 
hours on ``Adrenaline Rush Hour'' are the cable network's 
highest-rated shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at Fox, Darnell doesn't begrudge TLC its success but gets a  
kick out of its executives trying to distance themselves from what 
Fox does. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, they're the same exact shows,'' he said. ``Do you see a  
difference? ... They try to interject a little more information 
into these things. There may be more use of technical terms and 
they may try to explain more why these things happen, but it's real 
slight. They do a police chase show that is exactly what we would 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NOVA'' miniseries is certainly more sedate than  
``Adrenaline Rush Hour,'' talking about safety advances in 
automobiles, airplanes, firefighting and cruise ships. The ``Car 
Crash'' episode features its share of slow-motion video of 
crunching metal, but is largely technical and informative, 
befitting a series that last month won the Alfred I. 
duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton award, one of the highest 
honors in broadcast journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making films about hurricanes and tornadoes for  
years and years,'' said Paula Apsell, ``NOVA'' executive producer. 
``I don't think we should put them off-limits just because other 
people are doing them and doing them badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A title for the series like ``Advances in Safety Engineering''  
would be more accurate and, certainly, more like PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Apsell figures no one would tune in. She decided to go for a  
little flash and dash with the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to make our shows exciting,'' she said. ``I want people  
to watch them. But I also try to have solid content. I don't think 
there's anything wrong with merging information and entertainment, 
as long as there's the balance that we have always had on this 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere in California, in an office where no shelf space is  
cleared for a Gold Baton award, Darnell is smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it ironic, more than anything else,'' he said. ``TLC,  
A&AMP;E, PBS, these are all companies that would have spit on this 
material, truthfully, three years ago. Now they are finding they 
can use it to their advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	7th HEAVEN: Seventh heaven, cloud nine, whatever you want to  
call it, they're definitely floating this week at the WB network. 
Monday night's broadcast of ``7th Heaven,'' featuring the birth of 
the Camden twins, was the highest-rated show in the young network's 
history. In perhaps a more significant milestone, it was the first 
time a show on the WB drew more viewers than competitors on any 
other network, including the more established ABC, CBS and NBC. 
``7th Heaven'' doesn't get the publicity of other WB fare like 
``Dawson's Creek'' or ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' but has 
quietly become the network's biggest success.

<HEADLINE> Pageant Seeks Younger Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- In another bid to boost its sagging  
TV ratings, especially among little girls, the Miss America Pageant 
will hit the air an hour earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 18 telecast will be from 8 to 11 p.m. EST instead 9  
p.m. to midnight, pageant chief Robert L. Beck said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The audience we appeal to is a family audience,'' he said.  
``By finishing up the show at midnight, we lose a large percentage 
of those people.'' He said earlier hours will be particularly 
helpful to attract girls age 7 to 11 who might become lifelong 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the pageant, a TV fixture since 1954, peaked in 1961  
and have been in a free fall for years, setting new lows in each of 
the past three years. NBC-TV, which broadcast the pageant for 30 
years, dropped it two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant officials have tried plenty of gimmicks to reverse the  
trend, including a call-in poll allowing viewers to vote for their 
favorite contestant and the introduction of two-piece swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78th annual pageant last September drew a 10.2 rating,  
meaning about 10.1 million households tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC-TV, which now televises the pageant, has agreed to the time  
change, Beck said. ABC officials did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said in future years he hopes to persuade ABC officials to  
move the telecast to Sunday night instead of Saturday night, but so 
far ``the folks at the network don't share that opinion.''

<HEADLINE> States Back Regional Primary Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A regional presidential primary system that  
would spread out the process for picking nominees -- and give 
different parts of the country a chance to lead off the process -- 
was approved Friday by state election officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's secretaries of state would like to have their plan  
in place by 2004, but they face a formidable task in getting 
approval of 48 states and both major political parties. Many states 
have pushed their primaries earlier for 2000 so they will have a 
bigger say in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Iowa and New Hampshire would retain their  
leading positions in the presidential selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the country would be divided into four regions:  
East, South, Midwest and West. Many of the states in the regional 
groupings have already started to hold primaries on the same dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Primaries in each state of a given region would be held on or  
soon after the first Tuesday of March, April, May and June of 
presidential election years. Not all states would necessarily hold 
their contest on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	After the voting, the region that goes first would go last the  
next election cycle, and the second region would move up. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the current system has become almost unworkable  
and has jammed too many primaries into the opening few weeks in 
late February and early March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we sit here today, the presidential primary selection  
process will probably be all but completed about 13 months from 
now,'' said William F. Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth of 
Massachusetts. ``This will come at a time when most people in this 
country have not thought about the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin said the quick primary schedule hurts lesser-known  
candidates, forces candidates to declare their intentions too early 
and hurts voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was adopted by the National Association of Secretaries  
of State with a handful of dissenting votes.

<HEADLINE> Senators' Quotes on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the statements of senators who have publicly  
declared their positions on the impeachment charges against 
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: ``I will cast my vote not for the  
current president but for the presidency. I believe that in order 
to convict, we must conclude from the evidence presented to us with 
no room for doubt that out Constitution will be injured and our 
democracy suffer should the president remain in office one moment 
more. In this instance the claims against the president fail to 
reach this very high standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.: ``I will vote to acquit President  
Clinton on both articles of impeachment. In my view the House 
managers failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
president committed either perjury or obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George V. Voinovich, R-Ohio: ``I have reached the  
conclusion that beyond a reasonable doubt, the president committed 
both perjury and obstruction of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.: ``This case is a constitutional  
travesty. We deplore the conduct of President Clinton that led to 
this yearlong distraction for the nation. But we should deplore 
even more the partisan attempt to abuse the Constitution by 
misusing the impeachment power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine: ``From the day I swore my oath to  
do impartial justice in this trial, I determined that the only way 
I could approach this case was to ask myself, `If I were the 
deciding vote, could I remove this president under these 
circumstances?' The answer, I have concluded, is `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.: ``After weeks of listening, reading,  
reviewing, reflection, analysis and contemplation I have come to 
the conclusion that I will vote to convict the president on both 
articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.: ``The House alleges that specific  
crimes have been committed, to wit, perjury and obstruction of 
justice as defined in law. ... But is it impeachable conduct? Does 
it rise to the constitutional standard of bribery, treason or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo.: ``I have sadly come to the  
conclusion that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.: ``I will vote against  
conviction and removal of President William Jefferson Clinton on 
both articles of impeachment. I do not believe the House managers 
established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.: ``The Constitution and the evidence  
compels me to vote to acquit the president on both articles of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.: ``Today I will cast two votes as your  
senator to convict and remove the president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.: ``The president's personal conduct  
was clearly wrong. He has endured embarrassment and will spend the 
rest of his natural life and forever in the annals of history 
branded by this experience. ... What has occurred here is a 
personal and family tragedy -- it is not a national tragedy which 
should result in the removal of this president from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.: ``I will be voting to acquit the  
president on both counts. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I concluded the president lied in the civil deposition. ...  
The obstruction case was weak -- stitched together by circumstantial 
evidence and not-provable assumptions about what was in the 
president's mind, and it was not supportable by the facts. ... I 
further concluded the president's actions were wrong and arrogant, 
but they did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors 
as written in the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.: ``If the evidence required to convict a  
president in an impeachment trial is allowed to be less than that 
required in a shoplifting trial, the constitutional foundation for 
the presidency will disintegrate before our very eyes. That's 
something a few future presidents in this body would do well to 
consider. Today I will vote to acquit on both counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.: ``I will vote to acquit the  
president, and it is not because his poll numbers are high or 
because the economy is good. And it is not because Bill Clinton is 
a Democrat. ... And it is because of my deep reverence for the 
Constitution that I believe we must reject the articles of 
impeachment before us today. Why? Because the high crimes and 
misdemeanors constitutional requirement for removal has not been 
met -- not even close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.: Lieberman said he ``came closer to  
voting to convict the president than I thought I would. But after 
much reflection and a review of the extensive evidence before us 
... I have concluded that the facts do not meet the high standard 
the founders established for conviction and removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.: ``My conclusion is that we must not  
avenge the faults of William Jefferson Clinton upon our nation, our 
children and our Constitution. Extreme partisanship and 
prosecutorial zealotry have stained this process in its critical 
early junctures. Partisan impeachments are lacking in 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.: ``I cannot conclude beyond all  
reasonable doubt that this president is guilty of the criminal 
charges enumerated in either article of impeachment. Thus, not only 
do I `shrink from this most drastic of measures,' I positively 
affirm we must not remove this president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah: ``I will vote guilty on both articles,  
with a clear conscience that I have done my duty. And I would vote 
the same if the president's name were Ronald Wilson Reagan.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Deputies Charged in Inmate Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Two former sheriff's deputies were  
indicted on civil rights violations in the case of an inmate who 
died of a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sawdon and Erich Dieter were charged in the 1997 death  
of Christopher Moreland, 30, at the St. Joseph County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that he had become combative while being booked on  
drunken driving charges and that they used pepper spray and put him 
in a restraining chair. He was found dead in a cell about eight 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner ruled he died of a blow to the head.  
</P>
<P>
	Moreland suffered ``excessive use of force that amounted to  
punishment,'' according to a federal indictment announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawdon and Dieter could get life in prison and fines of up to  
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieter was fired a year ago. Sawdon resigned Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Dieter did not immediately return a call. A woman answering the  
phone at a listing for a Sawdon in South Bend said he had no 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Lines Watch Airline Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cruise lines are watching the American Airlines pilots' labor  
dispute with some trepidation as thousands of people prepare to fly 
into Miami this weekend to begin cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hell of a big weekend for flying somewhere because of  
President's Day and Valentine's Day,'' said Rich Steck, a spokesman 
for Royal Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival, Norwegian, Premier and Royal Caribbean cruise lines  
said the job action by American pilots hadn't caused major 
problems, but the companies were monitoring negotiations between 
the pilots union and airline in case they need to make alternative 
plans for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of American Airlines' flights were grounded  
Thursday even though a judge ordered the pilots back to work the 
day before. The airline is the largest carrier at Miami 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cruise lines avoided serious problems because their  
ships set sail last weekend and weren't scheduled to return until 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Caribbean's Vision of the Seas, however, left its San Juan  
port 1 1/2 hours late Wednesday night because 100 passengers and crew 
members had to be flown in on a charter plane after American 
flights from Miami were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The big worry was for the upcoming weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	A quarter of the 22,000 cruise passengers expected to sail on  
Royal Caribbean ships from Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Miami and 
San Juan were scheduled to fly with American Airlines, Steck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with American Airlines on alternative measures  
but it's hard to plan anything when nothing has happened,'' Steck 
said. ``We believe the airlines will be flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian, anticipating a busy holiday weekend, had already  
booked charter flights to bring its passengers from the Northeast 
to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival was expecting four of it ships to return to Miami this  
weekend and leave the same day with a new batch of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still keeping a close eye on the situation,'' said  
spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz. ``This situation is continuing to 
unfold.''

<HEADLINE> Censure Loses Steam After Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite polls showing Americans liked the  
idea, the effort to censure President Clinton appeared dead after 
the Senate's impeachment acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I  
think, the Senate is tired,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
said Friday. ``We've done what we were required to do under the 
Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., painstakingly had gathered 38  
signatures -- including that of nine Republicans -- on a resolution 
stating that Clinton had ``deliberately misled and deceived the 
American people'' and took actions ``impeding'' the judicial 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution stated that the Senate would ``condemn his  
wrongful conduct in the strongest terms'' and urged future members 
of Congress to leave it intact. A 19th century censure of President 
Andrew Jackson was expunged when Jackson's party took over the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after the Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and  
obstruction of justice, Feinstein attempted to bring the resolution 
up for debate. But in a scripted move worked out by both sides, 
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, blocked her effort by forcing a vote on a 
procedural motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Feinstein technically could bring the resolution up in  
the weeks ahead, Democrats and Republicans both doubted the Senate 
would reconsider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle declined to declare censure  
dead, saying he would like to ``pursue it later on this month.'' 
But he acknowledged that ``a lot of people want it to end. You're 
going to see less and less interest for pursuing it for any length 
of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't happen,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that because the censure vote  
did not happen Friday, ``now is the time to stop. Let the 
recriminations stop. It's going to take a while to put some of 
these pieces back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Feinstein told reporters she still may try to  
raise the resolution later, noting that her side got 56 votes on 
Gramm's blocking motion -- which required 67 votes to overcome -- and 
had the 38 co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That stands as a testament that over one-third of the United  
States Senate was supporting the language,'' Feinstein said. ``I 
feel it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein added that most opposition came from the GOP's  
conservative wing, which wanted a clean political issue if Clinton 
was acquitted, and from the Democrats' left, which did not want 
further to tar the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure resolution was entered into the Congressional Record  
along with statements in support from some of its sponsors. That 
may be as far as it ever gets. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure effort always was a long shot. Many lawmakers  
believe the Constitution only allows Congress to impeach a 
president and then either convict or acquit, with no other options. 
</P>
<P>
	Censuring Clinton, the opponents said, would set an unwise  
precedent in which a Congress could hound a president with repeated 
condemnations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad idea. The president has been found not guilty,''  
said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. ``Let's move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators attempted to make the case that the number of  
censure sponsors combined with the votes to convict and remove 
Clinton signaled that more than two-thirds of the Senate had 
condemned the president's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a pretty good indication about who feels strongly  
about this president,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Bennett, the main GOP sponsor of the censure  
resolution, agreed that its time had probably passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is there to fight for? This is over,'' Bennett said.

	American Back in Court Over Pilots  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled nearly half of its  
flights today as the nation's second-largest airline asked a 
federal judge to hold the pilots union in contempt for ignoring his 
back-to-work order. Dee Kelly, a lawyer for the airline, told U.S. 
District Judge Joe Kendall that passengers upset by the 
cancellations caused a ``near riot'' in Miami after the airline 
shut down a ticket window. He said 450,000 passengers have been 
affected by the pilots dispute. On the eve of the busy Presidents 
Day weekend travel period, the company said it was canceling 1,046 
flights, nearly half its normal 2,250 daily flights.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 88.57  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, led by a decline in  
technology stocks after analysts warned that Dell Computer's sales 
growth may be slowing. At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 88.57 at 9,274.89. The blue-chip index 
gained as much as 26 points in early trading before heading lower. 
Broader stock indicators also fell today, including the Nasdaq 
Composite Index, which was down 83.61 to 2,321.94. It was another 
volatile session for technology shares, which have made some wide 
swings this week. On Tuesday, there were huge losses, then they 
were mostly unchanged Wednesday and soared yesterday.

	Markets Will Be Closed Monday  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. financial markets, government offices and  
banks will be closed Monday, Feb. 15, to mark Presidents Day. 
International markets will be open. In addition, the bond market 
closed at 2 p.m. EST today. Some commodities markets also scheduled 
early closings. 

</P>
<P>
	Inventories Unchanged in December  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A jump in sales helped hold inventories at  
American businesses at modest levels in December. Lean backlogs of 
unsold goods heading into 1999 could be a good portent, analysts 
say. Inventories that are too big can cause production cutbacks as 
businesses try to sell excess goods. ``It suggests that 1999 will 
... likely be very strong,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist with 
First Union Corp. in Charlotte, S.C. ``We know that sales also held 
up in January, and with inventories lean we're also probably going 
to see some gains in production as well.''

	US Finds Brazil, Japan Dump Steel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department announced today it has  
found evidence that Brazil and Japan have illegally dumped steel in 
the United States at up to 70 percent below normal prices. In a 
step that could lead to tariffs on imported steel, the government 
made a preliminary finding that producers from those countries sold 
steel in U.S. markets at prices dramatically below production costs 
or home-market prices. A ruling in an investigation into possible 
steel dumping by Russia was delayed however, as negotiations 
seeking settlement of trade issues with that country go on. 

</P>
<P>
	Brazil Inflation Up; Output Down  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Inflation is rising while  
industrial output is down, the government said in another spate of 
gloomy news about the country's battered economy. Meanwhile, a team 
from the International Monetary Fund left after two weeks of talks. 
An agreement on economic targets is a condition for Brazil to 
receive the second installment of a $41.5 billion international aid 
package. The fund said ``considerable progress'' had been made, but 
that it expects ``closure'' on pending issues when talks resume 
Monday in Washington.

	Ecuador Lets Currency Float  
</P>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The central bank let Ecuador's currency  
float freely, eliminating the band within which the sucre could be 
traded in order to protect its foreign reserves. News of the move 
caused the value of the sucre to tumble 9 percent from 7,300 to the 
dollar at yesterday's closing to 8,000 in early trading today. But 
the sucre rallied and by late day was trading in the range of 7,350 
to the dollar.

<P>
	Gore Announces Plan for Disabled  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced a plan  
today to let disabled people earn more money before the government 
cuts off their cash and medical benefits. Fewer than 1 percent of 
Americans who begin receiving disability benefits ever return to 
jobs, in part because of strict rules that cut benefits for those 
who earn $500 or more a month. Under the proposal Gore announced, 
the monthly limit would be raised to $700. The administration does 
not need congressional approval for the plan. After hearing public 
comment, the Social Security Administration can change the rules on 
its own. The new regulations are expected to take effect June 1.

	San Francisco Top Cyberspace City  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco -- surprise! -- ranked as the most  
wired city in America for the second year in a row, according to a 
survey. Austin, Texas, and Seattle netted the No. 2 and 3 spots, 
respectively, indicating Silicon Valley may be starting to lose its 
dominance as newly wired cities start to flex their technological 
muscles. Austin, for instance, has more people logging onto the 
Internet from home than any other city. And San Jose, Calif., is 
No. 1 for people logging on from work. Yahoo! Internet Life 
conducted the survey.

<P>
	Japan Gov't. To Give Banks $66B  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The government will pump $66 billion in public  
funds into 15 major banks in coming weeks to repair the country's 
hobbled financial system under a plan approved today. The total is 
in line with previous projections. The final amount could vary 
depending on how satisfied the government is with the banks' 
restructuring plans, the Financial Revitalization Committee member 
said. The government told banks that they can go ahead and hold 
shareholders' meetings to obtain approval for issues of preferred 
shares. The preferred shares will be sold to the government in 
exchange for the public funds.

<HEADLINE> Skaters Lang-Tchernyshev Wow Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- America's new wave of ice dancers includes  
three men not born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The best of them, Russian Peter Tchernyshev, partnered with  
Naomi Lang to win the U.S. Figure Skating Championships title 
Friday. Performing a playful tango, they swept the judging panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Second place went to Eva Chalom and Mathew Gates, and  
Englishman. Another Russian, Oleg Fediukov, teamed with Debbie 
Koegel for third. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really wanted to find is a partner we can skate  
with,'' said Chalom, whose partner skated Friday despite a bout 
with pneumonia. ``I don't think any one of us had it mind to find 
someone from overseas ... that's just the way it ended up.''

<P>
	The top two couples qualified for the world championships at  
Helsinki next month, but they are longshots for a high finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The best American ice dancers of the 1990s, Elizabeth Punsalan  
and Jerod Swallow, turned pro last year. They won five U.S. crowns, 
but never managed to climb higher than sixth at worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the years come, the American teams will develop,'' Lang  
said. ``We just have to give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lang and Tchernyshev were training partners with Punsalan and  
Swallow at the Detroit Skating Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners first teamed in late 1996 after he hand-wrote a  
letter to her asking if she was interested in a partnership. Both 
had recently split with their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	They were fifth in the 1997 nationals and moved up to third last  
year. In ice dancing, where upsets almost never happen, they were 
next in line for the title when Punsalan-Swallow moved on and 
Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler -- the other U.S. duo at the 
Nagano Olympics -- split. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday night was the pairs free skate, in which siblings  
Danielle and Steve Hartsell hoped to hold off the new team of Kyoko 
Ina (a two-time national champion with Jason Dungjen) and John 
Zimmerman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquittal Tops Global News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- World leaders were largely silent but TV stations  
in Europe led news broadcasts Friday with the Senate's acquittal of 
President Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many losers in this case and very few  
winners,'' France's TF1 TV correspondent Ulysse Gosset said from 
Washington. ``Bill Clinton is definitely among the losers, even if 
he has risen from the ashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, the British Broadcasting Corp. and rival ITN carried  
the story as their lead item. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the Senate's proceedings as a ``historic moment,''  
SKY, a satellite TV service that broadcasts from London and covers 
Britain and parts of Europe, carried live coverage of the Senate 
vote to acquit Clinton on articles of impeachment for perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, many officials in Europe refused to comment on Clinton's  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said all along, this has been a matter for the  
American Senate,'' said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor Party,  
sent congratulations to Clinton. In a letter, Barak said he was 
satisfied with the decision because it would let Clinton get back 
to aiding Middle East peace, Israel radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that history will judge you on your many  
achievements and your extraordinary successes and not on other 
subjects that are irrelevant,'' said Barak, considered to be one of 
the strongest challengers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 
May 17 national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, where Clinton is scheduled to meet President Ernesto  
Zedillo on Sunday and Monday, political analyst Sergio Sarmiento 
said Mexicans generally saw the whole process as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incomprehensible for the majority of Mexicans,'' he said,  
``that an intimate relationship ... would be converted into a 
political persecution.''

<HEADLINE> San Diego State Coach Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego State basketball coach Fred Trenkle,  
whose team is 2-20, will resign at the end of the season, athletic 
director Rick Bay said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenkle told Bay of his decision Thursday night via phone from  
Salt Lake City after the Aztecs absorbed their worst loss ever, 
86-38 to No. 14 Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a replacement centered on Utah's Rick Majerus and  
Rhode Island's Jim Harrick. When Bay was athletic director at Ohio 
State, he once interviewed Harrick, then at Pepperdine, for the 
Buckeyes' head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This development was not totally unexpected,'' Bay said. He  
said he and Trenkle had a ``pretty emotional meeting'' Tuesday 
morning, the day after an 85-60 loss to No. 25 New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began the conversation by saying I thought it was time that  
I consider the possibility of reassigning him,'' Bay said. ``He 
interrupted me by saying he didn't want to go into it. He said he 
felt very much that this was the time for him to step down and 
relinquish his head coaching responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said San Diego State will attempt to settle the year  
remaining on Trenkle's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenkle didn't immediately return a phone call to his Salt Lake  
hotel room. He has scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released through the school, he said: ``I had not  
intended for this to be the timing on this announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it was obvious from the way the team reacted in our  
recent practices that the uncertainty regarding my job situation 
has been a major distraction. We had no focus. Hopefully, this will 
clear things up with the kids and we can direct our attention to 
the remaining games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trenkle is 53-81 in his five years at San Diego State. The team  
is 0-10 in the WAC. Trenkle had just one winning season, when the 
Aztecs went 15-14 in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aztecs have four games remaining.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to being hired at San Diego State, Trenkle was 329-34 in  
10 seasons at College of Southern Idaho, where he won the national 
junior college title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Majerus, Bay said, ``I don't know to what degree he might  
be interested in this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't asked for permission yet to talk with him, which I  
must do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he would, Bay said: ``I may very well, yes.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Inflation Up; Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Inflation is rising while  
industrial output is down, the government said Friday in another 
spate of gloomy news about the country's battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a team from the International Monetary Fund left  
after two weeks of talks. An agreement on economic targets is a 
condition for Brazil to receive the second installment of a $41.5 
billion international aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund said ``considerable progress'' had been made, but that  
it expects ``closure'' on pending issues when talks resume Monday 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in an advanced stage but haven't absolutely defined the  
details,'' said Amaury Bier, a top finance ministry official who 
will head the Brazilian delegation to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real, last  
month changed all the numbers of its targets. The government 
promised more spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit and 
control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures showed Brazil has plenty of work ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices in 11 major cities jumped 0.65 percent in  
January, up from 0.42 percent in December, the government's 
Geography and Statistics Institute said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pledges that it won't allow the return of high  
inflation, which plunged from 2,700 percent in 1993 to about 2 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the remedy is high interest rates, which breed economic  
stagnation. Last year, Brazil's industrial output fell 2.3 percent, 
the first annual decline since 1993, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the presidents of Brazil and Argentina decided on  
Friday to do ``whatever is necessary'' to strengthen the Mercosur 
trade bloc in the wake of Brazil's economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of a two hour summit meeting in Sao Jose dos Campos,  
Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Carlos Menem of 
Argentina said they reached an agreement whereby Brazil will 
eliminate its subsidies on consumer good exports to Mercosur 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed to set up a committee to monitor the trade flow  
among Mercosur members, which also include Paraguay and Uruguay. 
Chile and Bolivia are associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to eliminate subsidies was the first aimed at  
protecting Mercosur from the financial storm unleashed by the real 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough to protect the progress we have so far  
achieved. We want more,'' Cardoso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is the backbone of Mercosur, widely considered Latin  
America's most successful attempt at economic integration. In the 
four years since it began, trade among its four members grew from 
$4 billion to more than $18 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil accounts for the bulk of this trade and its partners felt  
that their own economic stability was threatened by the devaluation 
of the real, which has lost nearly 40 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's devaluation spread alarm among Argentine exporters,  
especially in the agriculture and oil sectors, who feared their 
sales to Brazil would drop as their products become more expensive 
in this country. Brazil accounts for 30 percent of Argentine 
exports.

<HEADLINE> Airline Dispute Frustrates Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With cruise ships returning to port, a big boat  
show in town, and thousands of American Airlines passengers 
stranded, crowds are growing and frustration is mounting at the 
Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Fran Turowetz of Hyannisport, Mass., was supposed to begin a  
$6,000 vacation in Barbados with her husband and three small 
children on Wednesday. She got only as far as Miami by Thursday and 
was spending Friday on line at the airport, wondering about the 
roughly $3,000 she put down for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know who to blame,'' Mrs. Turowetz said as her  
children sought coloring books for entertainment, instead of a 
tropical beach. ``People wait a year for a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was one of 450,000 passengers that the nation's  
second-largest airline said were stranded or delayed as pilots 
continued to call in sick in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline claimed upset passengers revolted in Miami on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a near-riot in Miami and they had to close a ticket  
counter in New York,'' American's lawyer, Dee Kelly, told a federal 
judge at a Dallas hearing Friday on whether the pilots should be 
held in contempt for ignoring a back-to-work order. Miami airport 
police did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken and Susan Higbee sat at the airport after returning from a  
Carnival cruise to Mexico, hoping their flight home to Michigan 
would not be canceled. So far, Higbee's frustration is mild, about 
the same intensity as the pale pink sunburn on his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I'm still here tomorrow, I'll change my story  
completely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple survived last year's Northwest Airlines strike by  
canceling a flight and driving 10 hours from Michigan to North 
Carolina to make sure they made a friend's 40th birthday party. And 
they say this year, American, which gave them a bottle of water and 
a boarding pass after a 1 1/2-hour wait in line, has been more 
responsive to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it's better this time,'' Higbee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnival's passengers aren't the only ones being affected.  
</P>
<P>
	Royal Caribbean expects 15,200 passengers to arrive for cruises  
leaving from South Florida and Puerto Rico this weekend -- and at 
least 1,740 of them are booked on American. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't make their ships, ``They direct their anger  
perhaps at us. At least we share their anger,'' said Royal 
Caribbean spokesman Rich Steck. ``It's a goodwill issue more than a 
financial issue for the cruise lines, though undoubtedly it's going 
to cost us a considerable amount of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise line is being reimbursed by American for the cost of  
chartering six planes Friday at a cost of ``several hundred 
thousand dollars,'' Steck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline also has reimbursed individual passengers for their  
hotel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McLaughlin, a Royal Caribbean passenger, is back in the  
United States from a five-day cruise to the Bahamas and hopes to 
make it home to Dubuque, Iowa, in time for work at 7 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hearing a lot of different stories,'' he said.  
``Right now they say the flight is on, but it could be canceled 
anytime. We're getting mixed messages. You don't know what to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin is frustrated with the wait, and the only thing that  
will relieve the tension is traveling those 1,525 miles from Miami 
to Dubuque, no matter how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just so we get out of here, everything will be fine,''  
McLaughlin said. ``I'd drive from here if they'd let me have the 
car.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Show Unrelated to Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- A Jerry Springer segment on incest did  
not inspire two teen-agers to repeatedly rape their younger 
half-sister, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 15 and 13, allegedly raped the 8-year-old girl  
over the course of at least a year and were arrested in December. 
They face sexual battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The case put an ugly spotlight on Springer's already  
controversial talk show when Detective Curt Navarro told reporters 
the older boy got the idea for molesting his sister because he 
``saw it on `The Jerry Springer Show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But a portion of the boy's statement -- the only part that  
mentions Springer -- indicates that although he learned the meaning 
of the word incest from a Springer episode, he and his brother had 
already been molesting their sister. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the statement, Navarro asked the 15-year-old to  
define the word incest. The boy did so correctly and Navarro asked 
where he learned the term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Springer,'' the boy replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``And when he talked about incest, was that before you started  
having sex with your sister or after?'' Navarro asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``After,'' said the boy.  
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesmen did not return a call late Friday seeking  
clarification of why the boy's full statement was not released when 
the case was made public.

<HEADLINE> Moon Released by Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Warren Moon's last conversation with Mike  
Holmgren was brief and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that we'd made the decision to release him,'' the  
Seattle Seahawks coach-general manager said Thursday. ``He asked me 
if there was any chance I'd change my mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him no and I'd given it a lot of thought.''  
</P>
<P>
	So Moon, 42, won't be part of Holmgren's Seahawks next fall.  
</P>
<P>
	If he's going to continue his 15-year NFL career, it will have  
to be in a different city. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's decision left Jon Kitna as the only quarterback on  
the Seahawks' roster. John Friesz, who finished as the third-string 
Seattle quarterback last season, was released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna took over as the Seahawks' starting quarterback at the end  
of last season. It was an important factor in Holmgren's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to insult (Moon) in any way,'' he said. ``He  
doesn't deserve that. He's been a starter his whole career. Would 
he be real comfortable being a second-team player? It's something I 
had to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, a nine-time Pro Bowler who will turn 43 next season, said  
he only wanted to return if he could compete for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren decided to go with Kitna, who started the final five  
games of last season, and didn't want to pay $5 million to a backup 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to create a situation, particularly when  
I'm just starting out new here, that would be the least bit awkward 
or not real positive,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that that would happen necessarily. This way I think it's  
the cleanest way to go where everyone has a chance to try to do 
their thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon's release, along with those earlier in the week of Friesz,  
DT Dan Saleaumua and RB Steve Broussard, put the Seahawks $350,000 
under the NFL's salary cap before today's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon signed a two-year contract last August after the first  
holdout of his 15-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoyed my two years with the Seahawks and I want to  
thank (owner Paul Allen) for a wonderful opportunity,'' Moon said. 
``I remain optimistic that something can be worked out at a later 
date, but for now I'm going to consider my options, as are the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will, regardless of what happens in the future, maintain a  
strong presence in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon starred at the University of Washington in the 1970s before  
going to the CFL, where he played for six years in Edmonton. He 
moved to the NFL in 1984 when he signed with the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon is third in NFL history with 49,097 career passing yards,  
3,972 completions and 6,786 pass attempts. His 290 touchdown passes 
are tied for fourth-best with Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
	His seven games passing for 400 or more yards is tied for second  
in NFL history with Joe Montana and his 49 games with 300 or more 
passing yards is third best. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Moon's first season with the Seahawks, he set franchise  
records for completions (313) and yards (3,678) and was voted a 
first alternate to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg said the San Diego Chargers called  
Thursday to ask about both Moon and Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to aggressively pursue both options,'' Steinberg  
said. ``I think it will be a rapid process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Moon has options ranging from starting, starting  
for a team where there's a young quarterback to bring along, or 
being a backup. The middle option would apply with the Chargers, 
who need a veteran to help bring along Ryan Leaf, who was a rookie 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said he hasn't discussed specific roles with the  
Chargers, who were rebuffed by Moon two years ago.

<HEADLINE> How Will History Judge Lewinsky? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whither Monica?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, she will soon be an author; her book, ``Monica's Story,''  
is due soon. Yes, she will be interviewed, eventually, by Barbara 
Walters. No, we will not soon forget her beret, her thong, her 
helmet of black hair. 
</P>
<P>
	But what is the long view? When the history books are written,  
what will be Monica Lewinsky's place? 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only be flip,'' said Edmund Morris, author of ``The Rise  
of Theodore Roosevelt'' and an upcoming major biography of Ronald 
Reagan. ``I expect that Monica's major place will be in the oral 
history collection of the Clinton presidential library.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, even historians can't resist the opportunity to joke  
about the world's most famous intern. But beyond the jokes, there 
is a consensus that in history's annals, Ms. Lewinsky will be a 
footnote, at best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, she's a rather uninteresting person,'' said Robert  
J. Maddox, professor emeritus of American history at Penn State 
University. ``All she has done is have oral sex with the president. 
Nobody has said that she was even a good worker, as far as I 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``She'll be more than a Nan Britton'' -- the  
woman who claimed that she had an affair with Warren G. Harding 
that began when she was 20, and continued while he was in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book, ``The President's Daughter,'' Miss Britton told of  
trysts with the president in a 5-foot-square closet off the Oval 
Office. The result, she said, was their love child, Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's paternity was never proven; by the time Miss Britton  
wrote her book, he was dead. In fact, most presidents have died 
before their flings became common knowledge. Franklin Roosevelt had 
Lucy Mercer, John F. Kennedy had Judith Campbell Exner, et al., but 
few knew. 
</P>
<P>
	Other politicians have had the misfortune to be alive when their  
sex lives became front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
	Grover Cleveland was elected despite allegations that he had a  
child out of wedlock with a 33-year-old widow, Maria C. Halpin. 
(``Ma, ma, where's my pa?'' taunted his opponents. ``Gone to the 
White House, ha ha ha,'' rejoined his supporters.) 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hart's presidential campaign imploded when his relationship  
with Donna Rice came to light. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the 1970s, two powerful congressmen -- Wilbur Mills and  
Wayne Hayes -- were brought down by sex scandals. Hayes employed 
Elizabeth Ray for typing, though he had less stenographic 
activities in mind; Mills' liaison with Annabell Battistella (also 
known as Fanne Foxe, the Argentine firecracker) was exposed when 
police pulled over their speeding car, and Miss Battistella dove 
into the Tidal Basin. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these women have lapsed into obscurity, relegated to  
``where are they now'' features and occasional appearances at 
dinner theaters. And historically, they have faced a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph J. Ellis, author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of  
Thomas Jefferson'' and ``Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy 
of John Adams,'' can think of one exception: Sally Hemings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1802, when Thomas Jefferson was in his first term as  
president, it was reported that he had had a child with Miss 
Hemings, one of his slaves. The allegation dogged him through his 
re-election and into history; last year, DNA tests indicated that 
the story was true. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Miss Hemings has inspired novels and films. But  
Ellis said this is an unlikely outcome for Ms. Lewinsky, because 
her relationship with Clinton did not carry the racial baggage of a 
Jefferson-Hemings affair, because Monica is no Sally and because 
Clinton is no Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
	She is ``a tin can that's tied to Clinton's tail, that will  
rattle through the ages and through the pages of the history 
books,'' Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the result will be that Clinton's presidency -- already  
considered less than sparkling -- will be devalued. He simply will 
not be written about as much as the first rank of American 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that Monica will become even a minor figure in  
history,'' Ellis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	With Dan Dierdorf's departure from ``Monday Night Football,''  
one of the most prominent broadcasting jobs is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be filled.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC may return to a two-man booth on ``MNF'' for the first time  
in 13 years, back when Al Michaels teamed with Frank Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most booths in the NFL are two-man,'' said Jim Nantz, the  
``NFL Today'' host. ``It's not that unusual. We've come to be 
accustomed to the three-man booth in prime time, but it's the 
exception and not the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels and Gifford each were established veterans when they  
were paired. Boomer Esiason just completed his rookie stint after 
replacing Gifford, to mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe ABC came to the conclusion that this three-man booth  
wasn't working and another one would be a risk, and Al Michaels and 
Boomer Esiason would be a better two-man,'' said Neal Pilson, the 
former president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Boomer is coachable and can improve, but they need to  
work with him,'' Pilson added. ``He needs to be more insightful. 
There wasn't much humor or entertainment this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Esiason doesn't show progress, his faults would be magnified  
with Michaels as his only partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Fried, Esiason's agent, said the ex-quarterback has fielded  
inquiries from several teams about returning to the field. But 
Esiason wants to stay upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	If ABC does go with a third man in the booth, it will likely  
cost the network about $1 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading candidates:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Paul Maguire is the ideal -- and safe -- choice. He has been an  
analyst for two Super Bowls with NBC, he adds humor and is 
insightful. Maguire Currently works Sunday night games and has 
already had success bringing along one blond former QB, Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sterling Sharpe has been grabbing most of the headlines, but  
he has been a studio analyst for three years and pairing him with 
Esiason would put far too much inexperience in the booth. It would 
be a major risk for NFL's biggest showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Joe Theismann is knowledgeable, but he and Esiason would  
battle for airtime -- much as Boomer and Dierdorf did. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Jackson is more of a football guy and is the favorite to  
replace Gifford as the co-host of the pregame show. He offers a 
blend of humor and football savvy. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CONTRACT DISPUTE: Jerry Glanville jumped from his job as an NFL  
analyst at Fox to a spot with the revamped CBS pregame show on 
Wednesday. That was a complete shock to Fox, which believes it has 
an agreement for a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville said neither he nor Fox signed the deal, which he  
called a ``suicide contract.'' According to the outspoken former 
NFL coach, the deal had an option after each season. 
</P>
<P>
	``After this season, they had until June 1 to decide whether  
they wanted to bring me back. Next year it was July 31 and the 
final year it was in August. That's not a contract -- it's suicide. 
By June 1, there are no jobs out there if they decide to let me 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville's former agent, Ed Hookstratten, negotiated the deal  
with Fox and has said that he has a written agreement between the 
two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one of us signed it,'' Glanville said. ``If he's got a  
document with my signature, I promise you the FBI will be called in 
-- because it's a forgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville will team with Nantz, Craig James and Randy Cross --  
once CBS finds a replacement for Cross as its No. 2 analyst.

<HEADLINE> US Rules Brazil, Japan Dumped Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is considering a  
deal to avert possible tariffs on Russian steel, risking the wrath 
of a domestic steel industry that sought the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, in announcing evidence of  
illegal dumping by Japan and Brazil, said Friday he was hopeful for 
a settlement agreement with Russia by next week. An announcement on 
dumping findings for Russia was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon our discussions with the negotiators who have been  
leading there for the Russians and for our people, and my 
discussions with one of the ministers, I'm optimistic,'' Daley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The development is yet another sign of the difficult choices  
facing the administration about how exactly to respond to 
complaints from American steel companies and workers' unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is seeking stronger trade sanctions, but the  
administration does not want to risk further aggravating troubled 
economies abroad or closing foreign markets off from U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really saying in order to further our initiative in  
foreign policy in Russia, we're willing to sacrifice American 
steelworkers' jobs,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of 
the House steel caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the U.S. industry opposes a deal because it would lock  
in certain import or price levels for Russia, Daley said any 
agreement would come ``because we believe it's good for American 
workers and is good for our overall economic relationship with 
Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports surged to record highs last year. The Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand abroad and forced foreign producers 
to seek American outlets, often by selling goods at prices below 
the prevailing U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department issued a preliminary finding Friday that  
producers from Japan and Brazil have sold steel in U.S. markets at 
up to 71 percent below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also found that Brazil illegally may have  
subsidized its producers, driving down the price of steel by up to 
9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Those determinations trigger a full investigation that could  
lead to tariffs by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the U.S. Customs Service will collect cash  
deposits or bonds from imports to cover any duties later applied 
retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the steel industry would get immediate relief as a  
result. Industry officials said the ruling lends credence to their 
dumping complaints, but they considered the move only a small step 
toward stopping cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting those countries to cut back on one product line after  
they've robbed us blind for 15 months doesn't mean the crisis is 
over,'' said George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal complaints made to the Commerce Department by the  
American steel industry specifically deal with hot-rolled carbon 
steel, a common product that can be used as is or turned into more 
specialized products such as auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints against a less common but important product,  
cut-to-length plate, are expected as early as Tuesday. Several 
cases also have been filed covering stainless steel, with duties 
already imposed in some of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Brazil and Russia  
jumped more than 60 percent during the first six months of 1998 
from the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. producers blame at least 10,000 layoffs and three  
company bankruptcies on the import surge. But, while U.S. steel 
producers accuse the foreign producers of dumping, the exporters 
blame normal market factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Although labor unions are traditional allies of Democrats,  
President Clinton has been a strong supporter of free trade, 
pushing other countries to open up their markets to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our policy of this administration remains strong believers in  
an open trading system, again because our economy proves that we 
are the beneficiaries of it,'' Daley said. ``American consumers, 
the overall American economy has benefited from it tremendously.''

<HEADLINE> Bumpers Praises Senate's Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, who returned  
to the Senate to implore his former colleagues not to remove Bill 
Clinton from office, praised them Friday for heeding his words. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rose to the occasion and defended and preserved the  
Constitution,'' the Arkansas Democrat said after the Senate 
acquitted Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those senators did exactly what they held up their hands and  
said they would do, judge that case fairly and impartially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``They left a historic legacy that probably will save  
this country from episodes like this in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, 73, summed up the opening of Clinton's defense at the  
impeachment trial last month.

<HEADLINE> Arlen Specter Votes 'Not Proved' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Arlen Specter had his own unique way of  
voting to acquit President Clinton on articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not proved, therefore not guilty,'' the Pennsylvania  
Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, there was a pause among Senate clerks who seemed  
unsure how to record such a vote. The impeachment rules say a 
senator can vote only guilty or not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Chief Justice William Rehnquist announced the vote,  
Specter was counted in the not guilty column. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, a former Philadelphia prosecutor, had announced earlier  
this week he planned to vote using these words based on Scottish 
court practice that allowed the nuance of ``not proved'' as an 
alternative verdict. Specter said he did not necessarily believe 
Clinton was innocent but that the House had not had a fair chance 
to prove their case.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Hires Romney As Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mitt Romney, self-described as having ``an  
overactive service gland'' and hailed by one of the two men who 
picked him as ``the white knight,'' accepted the task of scouring 
the blemishes from Salt Lake City's Olympics organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, whose Boston firm turns around troubled companies, was  
hired to do the same for the 2002 Winter Games, which have been 
tarnished by misconduct that has scared sponsors and shaken the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games and the preparations leading up to the games will  
comply with the highest level of ethical conduct,'' Romney vowed. 
``There is absolutely no excuse for the compromise of principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will preside over a revamped Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
which has been expanded, its role reduced and three of its members 
forced out -- two of them with a shove from Gov. Mike Leavitt, who 
said conflicts of interest no longer will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the changes are hard, Leavitt said, but the Olympic  
Games gain their power through trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to raise our standard to the highest possible  
standard,'' said Leavitt, who gave any board member with a 
perceived conflict of interest 60 days to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's selection as president of SLOC will help move the  
Olympics' focus from ``money and materialism back to its roots of 
athletes and altruism,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, whose ancestors were Mormon pioneers, was chosen by  
Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff. Their choice was endorsed 
this week by a hastily formed search committee amid some complaints 
about a short-circuited search. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my job to hire a leader now, not three or five months  
from now,'' said Garff, who alternately referred to Romney as ``the 
white knight'' and ``the cream of the crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been in a crisis and needed leadership now,'' Garff  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganizing of the board and the hiring of Romney on  
Thursday came two days after SLOC's ethics panel issued a report 
blaming executives of Salt Lake City's bid committee for giving 
more than $1 million in cash payments, bogus scholarships, shopping 
sprees, vacations and free medical care to 24 International Olympic 
Committee members in exchange for getting the games. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, four IOC members have resigned and another five have  
been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he doesn't believe the Olympic movement will be  
permanently stained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have messed up big time. The athletes haven't,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney pledged to spend no more money than the games take in, to  
spare taxpayers, to protect the environment and to take no salary 
until the Olympics are over and in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	When he is paid, it will be $285,000 per year -- the same rate as  
his predecessor, Frank Joklik, who resigned Jan. 8. Joklik claimed 
to know nothing about the excesses of bid executives while he 
served as chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The roles of Joklik, First Security Corp. Chairman Spence Eccles  
and PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham all came under question 
because of their importance on both the bid committee and SLOC, but 
the ethics panel found no particular fault with them beyond its 
general criticism of a lack of oversight of the bid managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik will remain on SLOC's board of trustees, which was  
expanded from 33 to 50 at Leavitt's and Garff's suggestion. So will 
Eccles, and he also was elected by fellow trustees to one of six 
at-large spots on the new management board that is to oversee Salt 
Lake's Olympics effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Topham, by his own choice, resigned from the board. ``In careful  
consideration of my own personal interests, and probably in the 
interests of going forward, I submit my resignation ... and allow 
someone else to carry the torch forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the board in compliance with the new no-conflict policy  
were Alan Layton and Earl Holding. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC has a $13.8 million contract with Holding to hold downhill  
ski races at his Snowbasin Ski Area, and to use his downtown Salt 
Lake City properties around Little America Hotel. Layton's 
construction company has a contract to build a $29 million 
enclosure of the speedskating oval in Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton, who earlier this week told The Salt Lake Tribune that he  
did not intend to resign, capitulated Thursday, saying he would 
step down ``in the interest of Salt Lake City and the Olympic 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holding's resignation letter said he was asked by Leavitt to  
serve on the board and to upgrade Snowbasin, and that he did both 
diligently while always disclosing his conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I remain firmly committed to my SLOC responsibilities,  
we should respect differences of opinion. ... I believe it would be 
helpful if I am not part of the realignment,'' he said. ``What we 
now need is not more division or distrust, but greater 
understanding and reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said he wanted one more resignation, but would not  
identify whose. The Tribune said it was believed to be Nicholas 
Badami because he has ties to Park City Mountain Resort, a venue 
for skiing and snowboarding events. He was not at Thursday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty trustees will be on the new management committee.  
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Marty Stephens, appointed to the board of trustees  
Thursday, said, ``The board's been purged. The message needs to go 
out today that this is a new era. The Mitt Romney Era has begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selling the 2002 Winter Games to corporate sponsors will be a  
big part of Romney's focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he has little doubt corporations will jump at the  
chance to sponsor the first U.S. Winter Games in nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you see John Hancock and others like them standing in  
line to support the Salt Lake Olympics,'' Romney said, referring to 
comments Tuesday by the president of the insurance company. David 
D'Alessandro said he was protesting the IOC's failure to deal with 
the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, said after a meeting with 11 key sponsors in 
New York on Thursday that there was no indication corporations were 
considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said. ``There 
is nobody that has withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between Olympic officials and sponsors lasted about  
three hours. Mike Sherman, a spokesman for Visa International, 
said, ``We voiced our concerns and encouraged reforms and they 
listened,'' but declined to offer further details. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' Pound said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Easton, a member of both SLOC and the IOC, said he may  
resign from the IOC if it does not expel those members who accepted 
improper favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton did not consider his own behavior as unethical. His  
company, Easton Sports, at the request of the Salt Lake bid 
committee, hired the son of IOC member David Sibandze of Swaziland, 
who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing a favor for the bid committee. In hindsight I  
wouldn't do it,'' Easton said. ``At the time it seemed perfectly 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easton said he did not consider it unethical because Sibo  
Sibandze actually worked and Easton Aluminum paid his $9 per hour 
wages for errands, research and office help in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Police To Patrol Disneyland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- In response to a ship accident that  
killed a tourist, a uniformed police officer is now patrolling 
Disneyland during park hours at the company's expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, Anaheim officers were deployed at the park only  
during peak tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Disney has agreed to report all serious injuries to  
the police department, and the theme park will no longer clean up 
sites where serious injuries occur until detectives consent. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, a tourist from Washington state was killed when a  
metal cleat ripped loose from a ship as it was docking and struck 
him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland, concerned that the mess was visible to other  
visitors, cleaned it up within half an hour, well before Anaheim 
police reached the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all candor, as a result of the accident, we are just  
deploying as much resources as we can'' to ensure safety, Walt 
Disney Attractions President Paul Pressler said Thursday. ``It's 
not that we believe things are wrong, but you can never be too safe 
in this business.''

<HEADLINE>  Zach Thomas Stays With Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Zach Thomas, who shared an apartment with a  
teammate during his first three NFL seasons, is eager to move out. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not leaving town, though. Rather than test the market as an  
unrestricted free agent, Thomas signed a five-year, $22.5 million 
contract to remain with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get me a house and a big backyard with some dogs,''  
the All-Pro middle linebacker said Friday. ``I want a Great Dane 
and maybe a Rottweiler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after buying big dogs and a big house, Thomas will likely  
have money left over thanks to a $4.5 million signing bonus. His 
base salaries will be $2 million this year, $3 million in 2000, 
$3.75 million in 2001, $4.25 million in 2002 and $5 million in 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are staggering sums for the high-intensity, low-ego  
throwback from small-town Texas who wears T-shirts and blue jeans 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about giving big bonuses and a big  
contract to a player,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``But with Zach, 
you're never going to be concerned about that because you know that 
every day, he's going to give 100 percent. He'll always make you 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 25, said the new contract will allow him to hire a  
personal trainer to improve his flexibility. He also wants to a buy 
a projector to watch game film at home. 
</P>
<P>
	His average salary of $4.5 million per year falls shy of  
Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis' $6.5 million. But it's a big 
raise over the $238,000 Thomas made in 1998, and close to the $5 
million per year sought by his agent, Drew Rosenhaus. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' roommate of the past three years, linebacker Larry Izzo,  
will soon be on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the only guy not happy about this,'' Rosenhaus joked.  
``He's got to find a new roommate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-11 and 235 pounds, Thomas has long battled the  
perception that he's too small to play middle linebacker. He was a 
fifth-round draft choice out of Texas Tech but quickly won a 
starting job with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many things that made me want to stay,'' Thomas  
said. ``I love our defensive scheme, and we're an up-and-coming 
team. We're only going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank coach Johnson for taking another chance on me. He took  
one on me when I was a rookie, and I made him happy. I'm hoping to 
make him happy now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has been the Dolphins' leading tackler in each of his  
three NFL seasons. He became All-Pro last year, anchoring a defense 
that allowed the fewest points in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	And now he's a millionaire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take the check to the bank,'' he said, ``and come  
back and work out.''

	Those are staggering sums for the high-intensity, low-ego  
throwback from small-town Texas who wears T-shirts and blue jeans 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about giving big bonuses and a big  
contract to a player,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``But with Zach, 
you're never going to be concerned about that because you know that 
every day, he's going to give 100 percent. He'll always make you 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 25, said the new contract will allow him to hire a  
personal trainer to improve his flexibility. He also wants to a buy 
a projector to watch game film at home. 
</P>
<P>
	His average salary of $4.5 million per year falls shy of  
Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis' $6.5 million. But it's a big 
raise over the $238,000 Thomas made in 1998, and close to the $5 
million per year sought by his agent, Drew Rosenhaus. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' roommate of the past three years, linebacker Larry Izzo,  
will soon be on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the only guy not happy about this,'' Rosenhaus joked.  
``He's got to find a new roommate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-11 and 235 pounds, Thomas has long battled the  
perception that he's too small to play middle linebacker. He was a 
fifth-round draft choice out of Texas Tech but quickly won a 
starting job with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many things that made me want to stay,'' Thomas  
said. ``I love our defensive scheme, and we're an up-and-coming 
team. We're only going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank coach Johnson for taking another chance on me. He took  
one on me when I was a rookie, and I made him happy. I'm hoping to 
make him happy now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has been the Dolphins' leading tackler in each of his  
three NFL seasons. He became All-Pro last year, anchoring a defense 
that allowed the fewest points in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	And now he's a millionaire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take the check to the bank,'' he said, ``and come  
back and work out.''

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Cop Arrested in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A white police officer suspected of authoring  
a Web page with racist overtones was arrested in the shooting death 
of a black motorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Cooperstein turned himself in Thursday to face possible  
murder and manslaughter charges in the Dec. 21 death of Deron 
Grimmitt during a police chase. Cooperstein claims he shot Grimmitt 
in self-defense because he feared the motorist would run him over. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had sought to question Grimmitt, 32, as to why he slowed  
down while he passed officers making a drug arrest. One officer 
testified that police were on edge after a drive-by shooting the 
previous night and feared Grimmitt was planning to shoot them. 
</P>
<P>
	But testimony in a coroner's inquest established that Grimmitt  
was shot through the side window in the side of the head, not 
head-on -- as might be expected if he were driving toward 
Cooperstein. Cooperstein was standing behind his car when he shot 
Grimmitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities looking for a motive for murder are investigating  
whether Cooperstein is the so-called Blue Knight, an anonymous 
police officer behind the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's issues touching on racial animus, talking about  
finding the right victim,'' said Allegheny County District Attorney 
Stephen Zappala Jr. ``You need malice if you're going to get a 
charge on murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web page blasts the Pittsburgh police department and defends  
five white suburban officers who suffocated black motorist Jonny 
Gammage after a traffic stop on Oct. 12, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get out of your car and fight with me on a traffic  
stop, for whatever dysfunctional cause you have, I will feel 
remorse when you die for that cause, but I will go home to see my 
child in the morning,'' the Blue Knight writes. ``Don't talk to me 
about rules, and don't talk to me about race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview with the Tribune-Review of Pittsburgh,  
Cooperstein, 43, said he ``can neither confirm nor deny'' he is the 
Blue Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperstein has an unlisted number and could not be reached for  
comment Friday. His attorney, David Trautman, did not immediately 
return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperstein was released on $100,000 bail Thursday, a day after  
he was suspended from the force without pay for allegedly violating 
department rules and regulations. A judge will determine the 
severity of the criminal charges against Cooperstein. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the shooting, Cooperstein was taking prescription  
medications for depression and anxiety. He has said the medications 
ease symptoms of multiple sclerosis but didn't affect his ability 
to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperstein has sued the city, claiming he did not receive  
proper accommodation for his disease, was denied promotions and 
labeled a sick-time abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Knight Web page includes lengthy criticisms of the  
sick-time policy for Pittsburgh police.

<HEADLINE> Some Republicans Vote To Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five Republican senators broke ranks Friday  
and voted to acquit President Clinton on both articles of 
impeachment, preventing a majority vote for removing the president 
on either count. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other Republicans voted ``guilty'' on obstruction of  
justice, but ``not guilty'' on the perjury article. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democrats voted to acquit Clinton on both counts, leaving  
the Senate well short of the two-thirds majority that would have 
been required on either count to force Clinton from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers prosecuting the case had said they were hoping  
for a majority vote on at least one article to demonstrate that 
most senators found the case against him compelling. But after the 
votes went 55-45 against the perjury article and 50-50 on the 
obstruction count, Democrats said the roll calls showed the 
weakness of the case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that neither count got a majority of votes showed it  
never should have come to the Senate in the first place,'' said 
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``We shouldn't have spent our first 
six weeks on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All five who voted to acquit Clinton on both counts are  
moderates and had announced their intentions in advance. They were 
Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania, John Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel in the end they met the burden of proof,''  
Chafee said after the vote. ``If I was in the House, I would have 
voted to impeach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, Snowe and Jeffords all face re-election next year and  
come from states that Clinton carried in the 1996 elections, which 
could have made votes for conviction politically risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the GOP  
defections showed that Republicans had worked hard to be fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to note that every Democrat -- every Democrat --  
voted against either article,'' Lott said. ``Republicans voted for 
one, against the other. Some of them, of course, voted for both. 
But if it were a bipartisan vote, it was because we did have 
Republicans that voted the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time that the moderate senators had parted  
company from their more conservative colleagues. In the past, they 
have opposed them on issues such as tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Republicans who voted not guilty on perjury but guilty  
on obstruction of justice were Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of 
Tennessee and John Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Of this group, only Gorton faces re-election next year. Clinton  
carried Washington state in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he believed the perjury accusation was ``probably  
not the kind of thing the Founding Fathers had in mind'' when they 
wrote a constitutional provision allowing for a president's removal 
for ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the case was ``overwhelming'' on obstruction of  
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of thing, I think, the Founding Fathers would  
have approved of,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the perjury count was not proved beyond a reasonable  
doubt because of conflicting testimony from Clinton and Monica 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom he had a sexual 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said he received thousands of letters and calls during  
the five-week trial but found no prevailing view he felt obligated 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no difficulty following my conscience,'' Warner said.  
``Politics be damned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter actually voted ``not proved'' on both counts, but they  
were counted as not guilty votes.

<HEADLINE> Waltrip Knows Value of Daytona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- An image of Darrell Waltrip will  
someday hang in an auto racing hall of fame bearing this 
inscription: 
</P>
<P>
	``Three-time Winston Cup champion, 1989 Daytona 500 champion.''  
</P>
<P>
	The latter nearly escaped him, and he says his career would not  
have been complete without it. So, he can imagine how Dale 
Earnhardt felt until last February, and how Terry Labonte, Rusty 
Wallace and Mark Martin might feel now. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the pinnacle of our sport,'' Waltrip said. ``If you're  
a driver that has accomplished very much at all, then this is 
something you'd like to have on your resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some guys that will never win this race and nobody  
will care, quite honestly. But there are some people in this sport 
that if you don't win it they give you a bad time about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, in the autumn of a magnificent career that includes 84  
Winston Cup victories, knew the sting of criticism more than most. 
He failed to win The Great American Race in his first 16 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally won in 1989 by skipping a fuel stop at the end of the  
race, while the other contenders took gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win the big one, he stole it. But considering all the  
bad luck he had in years when he was expected to win, Waltrip makes 
no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all based on time, not the fastest car,'' he said. ``It's  
who gets there first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finally lived up to his billing, as Earnhardt did on his 20th  
try last year. On Sunday, the seven-time series champion defends 
that title against polesitter Jeff Gordon and a field filled with 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, whose career includes more victories than all but two  
NASCAR drivers, knows the disappointment a top driver feels by not 
winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expect Dale Earnhardt to have won the Daytona 500, you  
expect Darrell Waltrip to have won it,'' he said. ``There are 
drivers who had no expectations that won this race. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are those that need to win the race to fulfill  
everything they dreamed about accomplishing in this sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt was happy to win for more than the obvious reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now, when Darrell and me are sitting in a rocking chair on the  
front porch when we're both about 70, he can't say, 'I won it and 
you didn't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, a two-time series champion, would also be happy to win  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you filled out your resume, after Winston Cup champion when  
you listed the races you won, this would be the first one,'' said 
Labonte, three times a second-place finisher in 20 attempts in what 
he calls the ``Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says coming so close is disappointing but also encouraging.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, it frustrates you,'' Labonte admitted. ``But it shows  
you that you've got an opportunity to win a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, the 1989 series champion, also has the race at the top  
of his wish list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean everything in the world to me because I think  
any good racer that hasn't won the Daytona 500 would feel like 
there's a void in his career,'' said Wallace, who makes his 17th 
start Sunday. ``I've won a lot of races, but this one has eluded me 
for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 0-for-72 at Daytona before winning last Sunday in the  
non-points Bud Shutout, finally feels in position to win in his 
15th start. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said when asked if he would feel empty if he retires  
without winning the race. ``I've had a better career than any other 
kid from Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just won't lose any sleep if it doesn't happen, because  
nobody ever told me I was going to win one race, much less have the 
kind of success I've had.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Win Short Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The standings look exactly the way  
everyone expected. The way Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss got to 
the top in their short programs wasn't quite so expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both blew away weakened fields Thursday at the U.S.  
Figure Skating Championships, neither was spectacular. Sure, Kwan 
got a 6.0 and eight 5.9s for presentation in her ``The Fate of 
Carmen'' routine. But even she and coach Frank Carroll found fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine, consistent, but don't think it was the  
greatest short program she has ever done,'' Carroll said. ``But I 
certainly will take it. I thought she did her job and thought it 
was a very good performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was like the greatest it has ever been. But  
what you want to do in the short program is nail everything, and 
she did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Weiss, albeit with some bobbles in his footwork. He, too,  
swept the judges in the short program, worth one-third of the total 
score. And, like Kwan -- who is seeking her third American crown; 
Weiss is after his first -- the two-time U.S. runner-up should have 
no trouble clinching the title on Saturday in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit different going in as the favorite, I'm used  
to going in as the underdog,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously it's a good 
position to be in, though. I went out and skated the way I wanted 
to and I'm sitting where I want to be right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each get a day of rest while the free dance and pairs free skate  
are held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion and the sport's biggest star,  
was ``honored'' about the 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really strong and confident,'' said Kwan, a two-time  
world champion closing in on her third American crown. ``My lutz 
was a little shaky, higher than usual. But I guess I have to be 
prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except losing, it would seem. Against a group of young,  
generally unproven skaters -- at least at this level -- Kwan appears 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Hughes, the rising 13-year-old who was runner-up in the  
recent World Junior Championships, was second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really like to think about placements,'' she said. ``I  
just wanted to be happy with my performances, and I am happy with 
my short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, the American junior winner a year ago, edged 20-year-old  
Amber Corwin, who wound up third in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are people out there working as hard and maybe  
harder than you,'' Kwan said after hitting a triple lutz-double toe 
loop combination, a double axel and a triple toe loop, along with 
some sensational spirals. ``I have to work to stay at the top of my 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss had to work quite hard to get to the top of American  
skating. He was a close loser to five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge 
the last two years. With Eldredge not defending his title, despite 
still being eligible, Weiss is an odds-on choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He handled that situation well enough Thursday, hitting all of  
his jumps and spins. But his footwork was sloppy and he lacked 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The short program is just getting through it and having fun,  
and I think I did that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel, fresh out of juniors and the only U.S. skater to  
land a quadruple jump in competition, was second. Goebel performed 
solidly, but lacks the flair that usually marks Weiss' routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic was third. Both he and Goebel, like Hughes and  
Corwin, are light years from the level of the skaters they trail. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Jury Finds Gun Makers Liable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a landmark ruling, gun makers have been found  
liable for shootings in a case closely followed by cities across 
the nation anxious to make the firearms industry pay for 
gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury on Thursday returned a $4 million verdict based  
upon a new strategy by plaintiffs -- that the industry's negligence 
in marketing and distribution allows weapons to flow illegally to 
states with strict anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``This huge pool (of handguns) is like toxic waste,'' lawyer  
Elisa Barnes told the jury. ``It's been sent down the river by 
different companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is considered a breakthrough for gun opponents because  
the firearms industry has defeated past claims that they make 
defective weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	It may also become a watershed for cities suing the  
manufacturers. Like the massive tobacco litigation, which pressured 
cigarette companies to pay for treating sick smokers, the cities 
want to force gun makers pay the costs of treating shooting 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami-Dade County  
are suing the industry. Pro-gun groups have responded by lobbying 
state legislatures to pass laws prohibiting such suits; Georgia 
this week approved such a law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was filed in 1995 by Steven Fox, 19, and the relatives  
of six homicide victims. Fox was accidentally shot by a friend, who 
had bought a gun on the street. The bullet remains lodged in his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought unspecified damages from a group of 25 gun  
makers that included leaders of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	During the month-long trial, plaintiffs argued that the  
companies flooded gun-friendly markets, mainly in the South, 
knowing that excess guns would flow into criminal hands via illegal 
markets in New York and other states with stricter anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused the defendants of making no effort to identify and  
discipline dishonest distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition read to the jury, Robert Morris, head of Taurus  
International Manufacturing Inc., conceded the company had ``never 
cut off anybody, cut them off for sloppy distribution practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gun companies argued their responsibility ends once they  
sell to licensed distributors. They said the job of policing gun 
runners should be left to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, which has never required manufacturers to track their 
products to the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is simply wrong,'' industry attorney James Dorr told  
the jury, adding it was unfair to ``hold the manufactures of a 
lawful, legitimately sold product responsible for acts of outlaws 
who are totally outside their control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury concluded that 15 of the 25 companies distributed their  
guns negligently, and that the negligence of nine of the 15 was a 
``proximate cause'' of one or more of three shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the jury completely exonerated 10 companies but  
found various gun makers responsible for three of the seven 
shootings involved in the lawsuit. Two of the three shootings were 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors decided that Fox was the only victim entitled to damages.  
Although they concluded he and his family suffered $4 million in 
harm, they reduced the amount to about $500,000, based on the 
market share of the three companies linked to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three companies are American Arms Inc., the Beretta USA  
Corp. and Taurus International. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides claimed victory after the complex verdict was  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God, we absolutely won,'' said plaintiff Freddie  
Hamilton, a Brooklyn woman whose son, Njuzi, was slain in 1993. She 
predicted the verdict would bring a ``whole new phase'' of 
litigation against the firearms industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dorr called the result ``a defense verdict in all  
respects,'' while John Renzulli, whose clients include Glock Inc., 
said ``it completely makes no sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense made a motion to throw out the verdict, and U.S.  
District Court Judge Jack Weinstein said he would rule after the 
parties submit written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came despite apparent disagreement in the jury room.  
In recent days, the jurors had sent Weinstein several notes saying 
they were deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the deliberations, one juror, who refused to  
give his name, said, ``Some (jurors) didn't like guns and some did. 
That's why it took so long.''

<HEADLINE> Niners Make Owens Franchise Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Terrell Owens' free agency comes with  
strings attached. The San Francisco 49ers made sure of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of losing the star receiver, the 49ers on Thursday made him  
their franchise player, driving up the price for any other team 
that wants to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the franchise tag, San Francisco offered Owens a  
one-year contract worth $3.5 million, the average salary last 
season for the five highest-paid receivers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who supplanted Jerry Rice as the 49ers' go-to receiver  
last year, could have become a restricted free agent today, when 
the league's trading and free agency period begins. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still negotiate with other teams, and the 49ers retain  
the right of first refusal. The franchise designation means any 
other team signing him would have to pay San Francisco two 
first-round picks, the first in 1999 and the second in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	John McVay, director of football operations, said the move  
reflects the organization's esteem for Owens, who made one of the 
biggest catches in franchise history when he snagged a last-second 
touchdown pass to beat Green Bay in a January playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	McVay added that the 49ers hope other teams interested in  
signing Owens are scared off by the steep price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't guarantee it because somebody could still come in  
with an offer with enough poison pills that you couldn't match, but 
if it did happen, at least you have the consolation of getting two 
first-round picks,'' McVay said. 
</P>
<P>
	McVay said the 49ers still hope to sign Owens to a long-term  
deal, and they also plan to try to retain fellow wideout J.J. 
Stokes, who became eligible for unrestricted free agency today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McVay would neither confirm nor deny reports that  
quarterback Ty Detmer and possibly defensive end Roy Barker and 
tight end Irv Smith would be traded to Cleveland in exchange for 
draft picks. A club source said there have been trade talks between 
the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of people on the roster. We just have to see  
how things unfold,'' McVay said. ``Things can change from day to 
day. We'll just have to see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVay added the 49ers have completed restructuring the contracts  
of a dozen players, gaining approximately $17 million in salary cap 
relief. Provided the redone contracts are approved by the league, 
McVay said the team will be about $2 million under the $57.5 
million cap, which becomes effective today. 
</P>
<P>
	Players whose contracts were restructured were Steve Young,  
Jerry Rice, Ray Brown, Ken Norton Jr., Chris Doleman, Bryant Young, 
Tim McDonald, Winfred Tubbs, Gabe Wilkins, Lee Woodall, Harris 
Barton and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers began the offseason about $28 million over the cap.  
They realized an additional $13 million in cap relief through the 
retirement of Kirk Scrafford, the expiration of Marquez Pope's and 
Terry Kirby's contracts and the loss of cornerback Antonio Langham, 
linebacker James Williams and center Steve Gordon to Cleveland in 
the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh speculated that the team's bloated  
player payroll might require the release of such players as safety 
Merton Hanks and guard Kevin Gogan, but they both survived the 
initial cost-cutting moves. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their future with the team remains in question. The  
49ers could gain some financial advantages by waiting until after 
June 1 to release Gogan or Hanks. That would cushion the impact on 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said he wants to keep the team together as  
much as possible, but also conceded economics might not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, their future lies with the 49ers. Can that change?  
Yes,'' Mariucci said. ``We certainly have to make more cap room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also worked out quarterback Jeff Garcia on  
Thursday. Garcia, a former San Jose State star, has played five 
years in the Canadian Football League, where he was player of the 
year last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the 49ers have an interest in signing Garcia and  
plan to talk to him again next week.

<HEADLINE> Possible Cancer Protector Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be a powerful tool for women: a gel  
or cream they could apply just before sex to protect against AIDS 
or other sexual infections, without having to get the man to agree 
to a condom. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have spent years hunting such a ``topical  
microbicide'' with little luck so far, although they have some 
early candidates that might fight the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	But Penn State University researchers announced a surprise: an  
experimental microbicide that promises to protect against both HIV 
and a sexually transmitted virus that causes deadly cervical 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a common ingredient in shampoos and toothpastes, so  
researchers already know it is safe; it also is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Many chemicals are being tested for anti-HIV action. After all,  
the AIDS virus is spreading most rapidly in heterosexual women. 
</P>
<P>
	But Penn State microbiologist Mary Howett's discovery of the  
first chemical that also destroyed human papilloma virus, or HPV, 
has researchers intrigued. The National Institutes of Health 
cautiously hopes that first-stage testing of sodium dodecyl sulfate 
could begin in a small number of women later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about the broad-spectrum nature,'' said Dr.  
Penny Hitchcock, NIH's microbicide chief. The HPV protection is 
particularly intriguing because ``it's been a lot harder for us to 
find anything that works with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're cautious,'' she stressed, because researchers have  
lots of work -- including turning the ingredient into a usable 
vaginal gel -- before initial testing could begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Human papillomavirus is a common sexually transmitted infection.  
About one in four women is estimated to have a strain of HPV. 
</P>
<P>
	Most HPV is symptomless, but some strains go on to cause  
cervical cancer that kills 5,000 American women and 250,000 women 
worldwide every year. (The global toll is so high because 
developing countries cannot afford Pap smears, tests that let most 
American women discover cervical abnormalities before they grow 
into actual cancer.) 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could eliminate (HPV), you could potentially prevent  
all those cancers,'' Howett explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Microbicides are gels or films that women would insert into the  
vagina before sex to protect against various sexually transmitted 
diseases. So far, none has panned out. A study just found that the 
popular spermicide nonoxynol-9, long thought the best hope for an 
anti-HIV gel, does not protect after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists now are studying whether other spermicides or  
chemicals could work instead, and the NIH is spending millions to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	One approach in early testing is an acid-buffer gel. Semen is  
very alkaline, raising the pH level of a woman's vagina enough to 
help acid-averse HIV infect more easily. The gel would maintain a 
vagina's natural acidity in hopes of killing HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	But until now, no experimental microbicides have blocked the  
tougher cervical cancer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the February journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,  
Howett reported that in test-tube studies, the ingredient SDS 
inactivated the AID and herpes viruses. Like other experimental 
microbicides, SDS is a detergent that dissolves the fatty coating 
that holds those viruses together. 
</P>
<P>
	The cervical cancer virus is coated with tightly packed proteins  
that mere detergents cannot dissolve. But SDS also is a 
``denaturing'' agent -- and it picked those proteins apart. 
</P>
<P>
	After it worked in test tubes, Howett injected human cells with  
the cancer virus or with SDS-treated virus and then implanted those 
cells inside mice. The treated human cells grew normally with no 
evidence of HPV infection. The untreated cells grew into genital 
warts. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take years to prove whether SDS will work in the bedroom  
as well as the lab. Still, Howett calls SDS ``a major step toward 
... producing a practical, nontoxic, inexpensive, discreet 
product'' to protect women's sexual health.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Released From Miss. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURVIS, Miss. (AP) -- A 12-hour standoff ended when federal  
agents created a diversion, rushed the room where a lone gunman was 
holding his last hostage and wrestled the man to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell Martin, 44, held a total of four women hostage Thursday  
at the Jefferson Todd Educational Center, a school for troubled 
students, and demanded that more black teachers be hired, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents and state Attorney General Mike Moore said they  
negotiated for hours until concocting a plan to free the last 
hostage, Elaine Hartfield. The other three were released earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her she needed to get down because something was going  
to happen,'' Moore said he told Hartfield by phone. ``She got down 
and Martin was apprehended and brought to the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has been in and out of hospitals and is on medication for  
mental problems, according to relatives. They said he is a friendly 
man who never exhibited violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hostage released, 51-year-old Angela French, said the  
incident began when Martin came into a school office, paced around, 
and then threw a telephone against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had us calling a lot of different people,'' said French, a  
district test administrator. ``He definitely had a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annie Hamler, who said she was Martin's best friend, said Martin  
wanted to see more black people in better jobs with the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	Purvis is about 92 miles southeast of Jackson.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Leonard Arrington, one of the foremost  
historians of Mormonism and the mentor of a generation of Mormon 
scholars, died Thursday at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, for a decade historian for The Church of Jesus Christ  
of Latter-day Saints, wrote 21 books including ``Great Basin 
Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints'' and 
``Brigham Young: American Moses.'' He also was co-author of ``The 
Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named church historian in 1972 by President Joseph Fielding  
Smith, Arrington was the first professional historian to hold the 
post. He oversaw a period of several years in the 1970s when the 
church's voluminous archives were opened to many historians, both 
Mormon and non-Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
	That access was slowly closed off by church leaders beginning in  
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, released as church historian in 1982, wrote some 200  
articles on historical topics. He was a professor of economics at 
Utah State University from 1946 to 1972.

<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Whitney Tower, who wrote about  
great race horses from Citation to Secretariat and backed a museum 
dedicated to racing, died Friday from complications from a stroke 
suffered last year. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower is remembered as the driving force behind the National  
Racing Museum and Racing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower, a longtime racing writer for the Cincinnati Enquirer,  
Sports Illustrated and other publications, became a major figure at 
race tracks throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He chronicled and contributed to the sport's golden era,  
reporting on the triumphs of champions including Citation, Kelso, 
Dr. Fager and Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
	His honors include the Thoroughbred Racing Association award for  
magazine writing in 1967 and the Eclipse Award for magazine writing 
in 1976 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower served in the Army Air Forces during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1948 after earning his degree, Tower was hired as a sports  
reporter on The Cincinnati Enquirer. Six years later he became turf 
editor of the new Sports Illustrated magazine, covering racing 
events around the world for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent another five years as turf editor of Classic magazine,  
and wrote ``The Art of Race Riding'' with Eddie Arcaro and 
``Saratoga, The Place and the People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He directed the racing museum for eight years and was its  
chairman for another 10 years, supervising a major expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower was the son of Roderick and Flora Payne Whitney Tower. He  
was the grandson of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the 
Whitney Museum, and Charlemagne Tower, railroad president and 
ambassador to Germany, Austria and Russia. His 
great-great-grandfather was the railroad tycoon Cornelius 
Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower is survived by his wife, Lucy Niblack Lyle Tower, and six  
children: daughters Aurora, Alexandra Thorne and Frances Thacher, 
and sons Alfred, Whitney Jr. and Harry Payne.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Benjamin Volcani, a microbiologist who found  
life forms in the Dead Sea and helped uncover the secrets of 
silicon in aquatic plants, died Saturday from complications of 
kidney failure. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1936, Volcani found microorganisms in the Dead Sea, which was  
once believed to be too salty to sustain life. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the  
University of California San Diego in 1959, serving as professor of 
microbiology. He retired in 1985 and became a professor emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scripps in 1969, he became the first scientist to show that  
silicon is essential for DNA synthesis in diatoms, which are 
single-celled aquatic plants that make up the base of the marine 
food chain.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rodman To Sign With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, the NBA's seven-time  
rebounding champ and one of the league's most flamboyant players, 
has decided to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles 
Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, known for his dyed hair and cross-dressing as well as  
his ferocious defense and rebounds, has agreed to play for the 
veterans' minimum of $1 million -- pro-rated to $600,000 for this 
lockout shortened season, sources told the Times in a story 
published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will also earn $3 million from an endorsement contract with  
Converse, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman of International Creative  
Management, has been negotiating with the team for the past two 
weeks. Talks became sidetracked for a week while they discussed a 
possible movie deal with Fox, which holds an option to buy into the 
Lakers as a 10 percent partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward, the NBA's top rebounder in each of the  
last seven seasons, has been laying low at his Newport Beach home 
before finally agreeing to meet with Lakers officials on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls left for Lakers spokesman John Black and Rodman's  
representatives at ICM were not returned late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement and the team's subsequent  
break-up, however, he was cut loose by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had expressed interest in playing for Orlando and Miami  
as well as Los Angeles, but he was irked at Heat coach Pat Riley's 
public insistence that he follow team rules. Magic coach Chuck 
Daly, Rodman's first pro coach at Detroit, tried to cut a deal but 
was overruled by owner Rich DeVos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers soon became his only option.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's signing would be a boost for the Lakers, which failed  
to sign a marquee power forward to help O'Neal shoulder the 
rebounding burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team can use his physical ability,'' first-year Lakers  
guard Derek Harper said before the season began. ``The problem with 
Dennis is how he's going to conduct himself off the basketball 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three seasons ago he was suspended by the NBA for head-butting  
referee Ted Bernhardt. A season later he was suspended by the 
Chicago Bulls for swearing on a live postgame show and by the 
league for kicking a photographer in the crotch during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He is regularly late for everything, from team photo sessions to  
practices. During last year's Bulls-Jazz finals series, he skipped 
practice to wrestle with Hollywood Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's arrival would cap a bizarre past two months in which  
Rodman announced he was retiring, then changed his mind and said he 
wanted to return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recently married longtime girlfriend Carmen Electra,  
although days later there were reports of an annulment filing. But 
in another wacky twist, the ``Hyperion Bay'' actress later denied 
the marriage was off. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the great rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player ever won seven straight rebounding titles.

<HEADLINE> 'Monica Lisa' Stirs Tempest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The assignment was elegantly simple:  
Students were told to merge Monica Lewinsky and the Mona Lisa into 
a single image. 
</P>
<P>
	The brouhaha it touched off is anything but simple, with  
20-year-old Penn State sophomore Alysia DeAntonio and her professor 
claiming The New Yorker appears to have ripped off her concept. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the ``Monica Lisa'' on cover of The New Yorker  
that came out last week was produced by someone else. And that's 
what has professor Richard Alden fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel like somebody mugged me,'' Alden said this week.  
``I can't prove it, but I believe the concept behind the merging of 
the two is what was stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeAntonio's painting for his architecture class so impressed  
him that he copyrighted the image, slapped the portrait onto 
T-shirts and boxer shorts and started selling the merchandise 
online and at a gallery. About 200 shirts have sold at $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
	He even shopped the image around to national weeklies: Time,  
Newsweek, The New Yorker, The Nation. Alden got no takers in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has hired a lawyer to investigate whether he and Ms.  
DeAntonio have grounds for a copyright infringement lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Yorker and Dean Rohrer, the Marlton, N.J., free-lance  
artist who produced ``Woman of the Year'' for the magazine's Feb. 8 
cover, insist whole thing is a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover features a doctored photo of Ms. Lewinsky superimposed  
on an image of the famed painting and wearing a mysterious Mona 
Lisa smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting a person in the news on a body of art is not a unique  
idea,'' said New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrer said he got the idea a few months ago after he kept  
seeing a newspaper photo of Ms. Lewinsky ``that was reminding me of 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting there one day and I said, `It's the Mona Lisa.'  
Just the little curve of the mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks later, Rohrer pitched it to The New Yorker.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people had the idea. It's  
not that brilliant,'' said Rohrer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. DeAntonio is disappointed, saying it ruined her  
chances to get it published or to have it featured on a cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would look like a takeoff on The New Yorker,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> New LPGA Commissioner Starts Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) -- New LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw wasted  
little time at his new job, announcing a plan to beef up the tour's 
TV coverage and to tap into a global market. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently 33 of the 43 tournaments are televised, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus will be on getting more of our tournaments on  
television, increasing the size of purses and expanding 
internationally, with more lucrative television packages from 
foreign nations such as Korea, Australia, and Sweden,'' Votaw said 
Thursday after taking the reins from Jim Ritts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Presently, there are only five or six domestic tournaments  
that are not on television, and we're trying to get all of those on 
some sort of TV, be it national network or cable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw's goal of more international exposure should be helped by  
the multinational makeup of the women's tour, which includes such 
stars as Se Ri Pak of Korea, Karrie Webb of Australia and Annika 
Sorenstam of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also striving to keep all the tournament fields strong  
and increase prize money,'' Votaw said. ``We now have 11 events 
with at least $1 million in purses in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw brings a wealth of experience in his new role, having  
worked for the LPGA since 1991. He was responsible for handling 
business transactions, including tournament sponsorships and 
television rights negotiations as vice president of business 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Becoming commissioner is a great honor,'' he said during an  
informal news conference at Oakmont Country Club, site of this 
weekend's Valley of the Stars Championship. ``I have a great 
passion for the LPGA and the confidence the LPGA board of governors 
has demonstrated in selecting me is very gratifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts, who has accepted the position of chief operating officer  
with Digital Entertainment Network, will remain with the LPGA for 
40 days to ensure a smooth transition to the new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The LPGA has experienced great growth during my eight years  
with this organization and we can do even better in the future'', 
said Votaw, who celebrated his 37th birthday Thursday during the 
pro-am at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little overwhelming for me and my family, but I have  
received a great reception from the players and sponsors. We all 
thought Jim would stay on as commissioner for several more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw noted that the LPGA's 50th anniversary is coming up in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to pay homage to the women's golfers from the  
trailblazing era who have helped the LPGA become the world's most 
successful women's sports organization,'' he said. ``The reality is 
that 25 years before Bobby Riggs played Margaret Court (in tennis' 
first ``Battle of the Sexes''), we had Babe Didrikson and Louise 
Suggs creating our organization.''

<HEADLINE> Rubin Recognizes Bank Change Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin acknowledged  
Friday the worries felt by consumer activists who are concerned 
that overhauling the nation's financial services laws could 
concentrate economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A top banking regulator, meanwhile, said overhaul legislation  
endorsed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would hurt the 
safety of the national banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Clinton administration's top economic policymaker, Rubin  
supports the goal of legally removing the Depression-era barriers 
separating banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. But he 
told the House Banking Committee there are valid concerns about how 
such legislation might concentrate economic power and risk to the 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the developments around the world over the  
last couple of years, and when you look at the size of mergers here 
in the United States over the same period, there are legitimate 
concerns about financial modernization with respect to economic 
concentration and systemic risk,'' Rubin testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin reacted sympathetically to views expressed by Rep. Barbara  
Lee, D-Calif., who told him, ``I think consumers have some really 
serious concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has given a ringing endorsement to overhaul  
legislation, but Ralph Nader and other critics are worried about 
the financial ``supermarkets'' such a measure would create -- 
offering consumers checking accounts, mutual funds, insurance 
policies and much more. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Fed chief waded into this year's debate Thursday, he  
brushed aside concerns that financial overhaul legislation would 
bring about a dangerous concentration of economic power. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees  
nationally chartered banks, criticized Greenspan for supporting a 
bill proposed by House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, 
R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	That measure would lift the barriers between financial services  
industries and give the Fed more power over new financial 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach taken by Leach's bill ``undermines, rather than  
enhances, safety and soundness'' of the banking system, said Hawke, 
who testified after Rubin. ``It will inevitably force resources out 
of banks and diminish the protections for the federal deposit 
insurance fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke's trenchant remarks widened the gulf on the issue between  
the administration and Greenspan, head of the independent central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Rubin himself reaffirmed the administration's  
opposition to Leach's bill, saying President Clinton would have 
vetoed the legislation had it passed Congress last year in its 
current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the administration supports a competing measure  
proposed by Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's 
senior Democrat. It would lift the barriers between banks, 
brokerages and insurers but preserve the split regulatory authority 
between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation died in Congress last year after coming  
closer to passage than it had in many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say such an overhaul is needed to keep the U.S.  
industry competitive in a fast-changing world and to save consumers 
money by offering one-stop financial shopping.

<HEADLINE> Quotes on Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional  
responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to 
say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what 
I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they 
have imposed on the Congress and the American people.'' -- President 
Clinton 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair directs judgment to be entered in accordance with  
the judgment of the Senate as follows: 
</P>
<P>
	``'The Senate, having tried William Jefferson Clinton, president  
of the United States, upon two articles of impeachment exhibited 
against him by the House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the 
senators present not having found him guilty of the charges 
contained therein, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the 
said William Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the 
charges in the said articles.''' -- Chief Justice of the United 
States William Rehnquist 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I leave you now a wiser, but not a sadder, man. I've been  
impressed by the manner in which the majority leader and minority 
leader have agreed on procedural rules, in spite of the differences 
that separate their two parties on matters of substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been impressed by the quality of the debate in closed  
session on the entire question of impeachment, as provided for in 
the Constitution. Agreed-upon procedures for airing substantive 
divisions must be the hallmark of any great deliberative body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work as a court of impeachment is now done. I leave you  
with the hope that our several paths may cross again, under happier 
circumstances.'' -- Rehnquist 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it helps when (Clinton) starts talking about  
revenge. And it was interesting to me that the Democrats started 
running $5 million worth of negative ads yesterday -- yesterday, 
right in the middle of the vote on the articles of impeachment. 
That's not positive.'' -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a constitutional duty to carry out. We did that. I  
think we did it in a fair way. We've done what we were required to 
do under the Constitution. ... Censure is an extra-constitutional, 
it's outside the constitution. We were out of time.'' -- Lott 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was naive thinking this could be bipartisan. This was as  
hardball as you can get. This is deposing a president in his sixth 
year and the Democrats are tenacious in refusing to let that 
happen.'' -- Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All Americans can take great comfort in knowing that by  
remaining faithful to this constitutional process, the Congress has 
strengthened, not weakened, the ties that bind our nation 
together.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate did its best to accommodate us within the  
parameters of their way of doing things. We knew that everybody in 
the country wanted us to go away, I guess almost everybody, and we 
couldn't blame the senators for not inviting us there to spend a 
couple of months. We could have had a better trial, we should have 
had a better trial.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has voted; I agree with the result. But whatever  
our individual opinions of the outcome, let us all understand that 
today's vote -- rather than being a victory for any person or party 
-- is instead a reaffirmation of the wisdom of our founders and 
their design of our Constitution. Now we must dedicate ourselves to 
the higher purposes to which we have an opportunity to turn.'' -- 
Vice President Al Gore 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this vote not so much as a vindication for the president  
but as a severe indictment for the blatant partisanship of the 
House of Representatives in sending it here in the first place.'' -- 
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's self-indulgent actions were immoral,  
disgraceful, reprehensible. History should -- and, I suspect, will -- 
judge that William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the 
highest office in our American democracy.'' -- Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen, we're going to work with whoever is president. The  
institution of the presidency is more important than any single 
person. And members of Congress need to work with whoever is 
president. When he's right, I'm going to support him; when he's 
wrong, I'm going to oppose him as I always have.'' -- Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was that a while ago, a group of people who very  
much disliked Bill Clinton decided that they would expose his 
private life, put him through a legal process and try to remove 
him. And what's frightening to me is how close they came. What it 
says is that the mighty oak that we regard as the American 
government is a little more shakable, maybe a little less strong, 
than we had thought.'' -- Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	'' I think instantly this nation, at this very moment, must do  
everything it can to heal the problems that were caused by this 
president. He is a weakened president. ... Censure will drag this 
issue on. We've got to end the pain, heal the nation and get back 
to our work.'' -- Sen. John Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the culmination of a long and arduous road, but the  
Constitution endures. It's stronger than political faction, it's 
stronger than frailties of any individual, it's as strong as this 
American people.'' -- Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the end of a long, sad year, and I think people in the  
country and all of us are ready to get back to work.'' -- Sen. Paul

<HEADLINE> Judge: SC Must Sell Drivers' Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A judge Friday said South Carolina  
officials must go ahead with the sale of driver's license photos to 
a company that wants them for an anti-fraud system used by 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge James Williams said the right of privacy doesn't  
extend to the photos, as State Attorney General Charlie Condon had 
argued. Condon sought a temporary injunction while the state 
proceeds with a lawsuit to cancel its contract with Image Data LLC 
of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida judge blocked a similar Image Data deal there and  
Colorado's governor wants to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your photograph can be bought and sold like a used car,  
what other personal information goes on the auction block next?'' 
Condon said. ``What other portion of our life will be deeded away 
by the government in the future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Safety Department sold 3.5 million driver's  
license photos to Image Data for $5,000, but Condon asked Gov. Jim 
Hodges last week to help stop future sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data is testing the anti-fraud system in South Carolina,  
installing it in about 10 businesses for use in confirming a 
customer's identity when a credit card or personal check is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Houvener, president of Image Data, said the system enhances  
privacy because store customers don't have to show addresses, 
driver's license numbers and other personal information when making 
purchases.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Must Release Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Northeastern University has been ordered to turn  
over a drug-use report sought by a doctor sued for malpractice by 
the widow of the late Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued by a special Northeastern commission that  
investigated drug use by university athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to include results of drug tests given to Lewis  
in 1987 when he played for the Northeastern basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	In Suffolk Superior Court on Thursday, Judge Thayer  
Fremont-Smith ordered the university to give the report to lawyers 
for Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers hope to use the report in defending Mudge in the  
suit brought by Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said that 16 days before Lewis collapsed at a  
practice, he acknowledged using cocaine in the past, but said he 
had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was 27 when he died at that practice session July 27,  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He had collapsed during a game earlier, and one team of doctors  
who examined him said he had a life-threatening heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge led a second team of doctors to treat Lewis, and diagnosed  
a less-harmful condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintains he could not have made a proper diagnosis  
because he didn't know Lewis allegedly used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has denied her late husband used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	In ordering Northeastern to turn over the report, Fremont-Smith  
said any information in it on possible drug use by other players 
will be impounded and not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeastern had argued against turning over the report, saying  
it would hinder future investigations because the university could 
not guarantee confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeastern spokeswoman Janet Hookailo said the university's  
lawyers were reviewing Fremont-Smith's order, and considering 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that Northeastern's general counsel Vincent  
Lembo can be deposed by lawyers for Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in trial of the suit was scheduled for April 26.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Fla. FB Player Denies Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A former Florida football player  
investigated for receiving illegal payments from a Louisiana sports 
agent denied receiving any money. 
</P>
<P>
	Dock Pollard said that he never took money from Michael  
McDonald, whom police say was the middle man for the agent and 
distributed the money to Pollard and Tim Beauchamp. Both no longer 
play for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take anything,'' Pollard told the Gainesville Sun in  
today's editions. ``I haven't done anything at Florida to warrant 
anyone giving me money. Why would an agent come to me? I had maybe 
22 tackles my whole career and hadn't played much at all until last 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University police filed a sworn complaint Wednesday with the  
State Attorney's Office against McDonald, 23, a former roommate of 
Beauchamp and Pollard, charging him with illegally funneling cash 
from the agent to the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent is the subject of an investigation, and police would  
not identify him. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald, of Gainesville, faces one felony count of unlicensed  
athletic agent activity. If convicted, he faces up to five years in 
prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still anticipating more charges ...'' police  
spokeswoman Stacy Badics said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Times-Union quoted unnamed sources Thursday as  
saying the players received money during the season from New 
Orleans-based agent Sean Alfortish. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfortish, who is licensed by the NFL Players Association to  
operate as an agent, has referred callers to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Rick Stanley, said he had no information about the  
investigation and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they received information in December from a  
confidential source that Pollard and Beauchamp were receiving money 
from a Louisiana sports agent. The agent sent money to McDonald, 
who then gave it to the two players, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials said they learned about the investigation in  
late November, after the regular season ended. The school suspended 
Beauchamp and Pollard on Dec. 28 for the Orange Bowl for a 
violation of university rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been a scapegoat in all this,'' Pollard said.  
``I feel they're trying to use me to get information about what 
other players were doing. I don't know of any other players taking 
money from anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Local Police To Work at Disneyland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- People headed for Disneyland over the  
holiday weekend probably won't see the park's newest addition -- 
unless there's trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to an accident that killed a tourist in December and  
raised questions about why police weren't immediately called, 
Disneyland this week begun paying for an off-duty city policeman to 
staff the park. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer will stay in ``backstage'' areas and monitor park  
security frequencies by radio. A similar arrangement exists at 
Universal Studios in Los Angeles and several other California theme 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety is the hallmark of what we do at the Disney parks,''  
said Paul Pressler, president of Walt Disney Co.'s theme park 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland has its own security force and until Thursday,  
Anaheim police were deployed only during peak tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, however, the park drew criticism for cleaning up  
the scene of a fatal accident before police arrived. A tourist from 
Washington state was killed when a metal cleat ripped loose from a 
ship as it was docking and struck him in the head.

<HEADLINE> Pub Boots Pacer Fan; Boss Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The manager of a downtown pub arrested for  
battery on a patron said Friday he's a victim of Larry Bird's high 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Etchison of the Legal Beagle pub said he was only trying  
to protect the privacy of the Indiana Pacers coach when he evicted 
a female patron whom he believed was bothering Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Etchison was arrested by police Thursday and charged with one  
misdemeanor count of battery. He was released from jail after 
posting $5,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is he doesn't like to be bothered a lot,''  
Etchison said of Bird. ``I don't know what the big deal is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for a ``high-profile person like Larry Bird, they  
wouldn't even file charges against me,'' Etchison said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Etchison faces a maximum sentence of a year in  
jail and a fine of $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, whom prosecutors list as a witness in the case, was having  
a beer with an unidentified assistant coach in the pub near Market 
Square Arena when he was approached by Kay Williams on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird gave the woman an autograph, and when she approached him  
later at the bar, he politely talked with her, police said. Pacers 
president Donnie Walsh had given Williams and her chronically ill 
daughter two tickets to the NBA All-Star game last year in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said that while she talked with Bird, Etchison  
approached her and asked her to leave Bird alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Bird told Etchison she was not bothering him, but  
the pub manager grabbed her wrist and her arms and pushed her 
toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bird tried to get Etchison to stop by ``yelling at  
Gordon, saying, `Gordon, it's OK.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams received hospital treatment for soreness, bruises and  
other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, contacted about the problem Thursday night before the  
Pacers' game at Vancouver, said he had been having a conversation 
with Williams, ``and the next thing I know, somebody asked her to 
leave, and he grabbed her arm or something.''

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureate Defends Her Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Nobel laureate has conceded that she used the  
testimony of other victims to construct her own story of 
Guatemala's civil war, but defended the book as a testimonial that 
accurately depicts the suffering of her people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a survivor, alone in the world, who had to convince the  
world to look at the atrocities committed in my homeland,'' 
Rigoberta Menchu said at a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked her New York audience to instead focus attention on  
the need to investigate and prosecute the massacres, kidnappings 
and widespread torture during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu became a powerful human rights advocate after the 1983  
publication of ``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' a wrenching story of an 
Indian child whose family was caught in the war that killed an 
estimated 100,000 people and left another 40,000 missing and 
presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, which was hailed as  
recognition of the struggle for indigenous rights 500 years after 
the Spanish conquest of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The book that is being questioned is a testimonial that mixes  
my personal testimony and the testimony of what happened in 
Guatemala,'' she said. ``The book that is being questioned is not 
my biography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu disputed the research of U.S. anthropologist David Stoll,  
who challenged claims that she had no formal education, that she 
watched a brother being burned to death by Guatemalan soldiers, and 
that a brother, Nicolas, had died of malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu said she worked as a maid at a Roman Catholic boarding  
school but was not a regular student. She said she omitted 
mentioning the nuns who gave her literacy classes to avoid making 
them targets of retribution during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The indigenous activist said an investigation being done by her  
aides has located the death certificate of the brother, whom she 
originally said was burned to death. Survivors have told her he was 
shot to death by Guatemalan army troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu also said her parents had two boys named Nicolas -- a  
common practice among Guatemala's Maya majority -- and that one of 
them had died. She referred requests for more information to her 
Guatemala City-based foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Council of Churches sponsored Menchu's visit  
to New York to give her the chance to answer criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Rigoberta is a symbol for a lot of excluded  
people in Latin America and around the world,'' said Rev. Oscar 
Bolioli, director of the group's Latin America office. ``We feel 
that this campaign to destroy her name is unjust.''

<HEADLINE> Chi Chi Returns After Heart Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In a hospital room after suffering a heart attack, Chi Chi  
Rodriguez wanted only the chance to be able to walk the fairways 
with his friends, whether that was on the Senior Tour or at the 
golf course near his home on the Gulf Coast of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez returns to the Senior Tour today for the American  
Express Invitational in Sarasota, Fla., with a different game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I'm feeling better, I want to compete again,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the biggest scare of his happy-go-lucky life hasn't  
instilled a sense of change. 
</P>
<P>
	He already has given up cigarettes, the last puff coming on Nov.  
5, 1997. Since his heart attack in October, he has all but given up 
red meat, limiting himself to 3 ounces a week, if any at all. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he still has the charm and gregariousness that made  
him one of the most popular figures in golf, he also carries a very 
serious message for anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be stubborn,'' Rodriguez said. ``Whenever you have pain  
or dizzy spells, get a stress test. Go see a doctor. Because the 
heart attack that I had could have been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is back on the tour for for the first time since his  
Oct. 13 heart attack, which he says probably would have killed him 
if not for his brother insisting he go to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was working out before a practice round for the  
Raley's Gold Rush Classic. He routinely went 30 minutes at 12 mph 
on the stationary bicycle, and he was playing well. A month 
earlier, his tie for fifth in the Comfort Classic was his best 
tournament of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got on the bike, he noticed something wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had to stop because my stomach was killing me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He took some antacid, got back on the bike and had to stop again  
after five minutes when he found it even more difficult to breathe 
and swallow. After a big breakfast -- Rodriguez loves food about as 
much as golf -- he finally agreed to see a doctor and couldn't 
believe what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Rodriguez, you're having a heart attack right now,'' the  
doctor told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me for the first time,'' Rodriguez said. ``Jim  
Anderson (his pilot) drove me to the hospital and a team of doctors 
were waiting to operate. If I had waited another 10 minutes, the 
doctor said I would have needed a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They call it the widow-maker,'' he said. ``About 50 percent of  
the people who get this kind of heart attack die. So I beat the 
odds pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has been doing that all his life. He learned the game  
in Puerto Rico by hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick, then 
worked as a caddie before joining the U.S. Army at 19. He joined 
the PGA Tour in 1960 and won eight times during his 21-year career, 
playing on one Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	He left his mark on golf through his Chi Chi Rodriguez  
Foundation, which has raised more than $5 million, and on the 
Senior Tour, where he has won 22 times, but not since 1993. Still, 
galleries love to watch him play, listen to him banter and perform 
his trademark sword dance whenever he makes a big putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a big void if he were gone,'' Larry Nelson said  
Thursday from the TPC at Prestancia. ``Last year, we missed him 
while he was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez plans to play in only 18 tournaments this year as he  
slowly works himself into shape. He felt strong enough to play 27 
holes two weeks ago, but doesn't want to push it. He says he will 
treat golf even less seriously now, although he is very serious 
about his eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandparents on both sides lived to be 100, and I figured I  
would live to be 100 without worrying about anything,'' Rodriguez 
said. ``But I was eating too much of the wrong stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what,'' he said. ``If you've got a good car, you  
better put good gas in it or you'll ruin it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has lost 17 pounds and feels better than he has in  
years. His doctors told him the heart attack probably had been in 
the makings for as many as four years, and Rodriguez is thankful to 
have a chance to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In bed when I was almost dead, I found out about life,'' he  
said. ``Money doesn't mean anything. Your health is everything.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks End To Africa Battles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying to halt fighting  
in the Horn of Africa between Ethiopia and Eritrea and get the two 
nations to negotiate their border dispute, the administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice told a congressional  
panel that both sides now were more focused on the battlefield, 
where there appeared to be a temporary lull in fighting, than on a 
diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we and others can direct their attention to a  
peaceful resolution we will do so and invest our heaviest efforts 
in the process,'' she said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Campbell, a member of the House International Relations  
subcommittee on Africa, asked her whether Clinton might exercise 
Middle East-style diplomacy and invite Ethiopian President Negasso 
Gidada and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to the United States 
for talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without going into private diplomatic efforts,'' Rice said,  
``please be assured that President Clinton has been personally 
engaged in this issue. Since the conflict has broken out he has 
been in touch with both leaders and stands ready to do everything 
we feel we can'' to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Clinton had also sent Anthony Lake, his former national  
security adviser, to the region four times since the border dispute 
broke out last May to try to resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ordered non-emergency staff, their families  
and Peace Corps volunteers out of Ethiopia on Thursday in response 
to the fighting with Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two days ago, we were asking all non-emergency staff and their  
families to volunteer to leave Ethiopia. Today we are telling them 
to do so,'' said the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Addis Ababa, the 
capital, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not give a number on those embassy staff who left or  
those who remain. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 57 Peace Corps volunteers from Ethiopia arrived in  
neighboring Kenya on Thursday . One volunteer, who asked not to be 
identified, said they would be offered assignments in other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy spokesman said those leaving were traveling on  
commercial aircraft, and no U.S. planes were being sent to evacuate 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	All nonessential staff and dependents at the U.S. Embassy in  
Eritrea's capital, Asmara, have already left the country. A general 
evacuation order for all U.S. citizens was expected today, said an 
official, who asked not to be further identified.

<HEADLINE> Hunters Get OK To Shoot Snow Geese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government gave hunters new freedom Friday  
to shoot hundreds of thousands of additional snow geese as they 
migrate north -- an attempt to protect imperiled Canadian tundra 
from the birds' voracious appetites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department said it will allow 24 states to ease  
restrictions on the hunting of snow geese, hoping to double the 
number killed during their upcoming spring migration. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.2 million birds are expected to be shot,  
officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. Over the past 
three decades, the population of snow geese has exploded from 
800,000 birds to an estimated 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While endorsed by many conservation and hunting groups, the plan  
was immediately denounced by the Humane Society of the United 
States. It promised a lawsuit, saying the expanded hunt violates 
laws protecting migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
	The ecosystem problem ought to be resolved in the arctic and  
``not by the indiscriminate slaughter of birds'' as they migrate, 
said John Grandy, the group's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The easing of the rules takes effect Tuesday and is the  
beginning of a campaign to address what has emerged as a major 
environmental concern: The destruction of thousands of acres of 
tundra and salt marshes in Canada's Hudson Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is the summer breeding ground for snow geese, which are  
white with black wing tips and considerably smaller than 
better-known Canada geese. During the warm months, the birds grub 
into the tundra, destroying plant roots and the area's thin layer 
of topsoil. That disturbs the feeding grounds for other migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not take action, we risk not only the health of the  
arctic breeding grounds, but also the future of many of America's 
migratory bird populations,'' said Fish and Wildlife Director Jamie 
Rappaport Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules allow states to extend the goose hunting season  
and let hunters use now-banned electronic goose calls. It also will 
free hunters to carry more shells in their shotguns, increasing 
their firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring migration of millions of snow geese is just  
beginning. They have spent their winter in the Gulf Coast and 
Southwest. Their northward path takes them up the Mississippi 
Valley and along flyways that stretch into the upper plains states 
and the western Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say their goal is to cut the number of  
breeding snow geese by 50 percent, a task expected to take five to 
seven years even under the aggressive campaign of expanded hunting 
and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunting restrictions will not, alone, reduce the population  
enough to save the arctic tundra, said Dan Ash, assistant director 
for refuge and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the beginning to address this ecological  
crisis,'' said Ash. ``It's a first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency plans a broader environmental assessment next year to  
determine what future steps to take to reduce the bird population, 
including possibly killing young birds in their Canadian breeding 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists say the problem is really of society's making.  
Each winter the geese gorge themselves on the abundant grains and 
friendly environs of America's agricultural heartland, growing so 
hardy they are now able to withstand the harsh arctic climate. The 
average age of a snow bird is eight years, biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been ``a growing environmental problem'' that  
threatens an array of wildlife including many waterfowl from the 
sandpiper to Canada geese that share the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
	Actions to reduce snow geese numbers -- including less  
restrictive hunting -- have been endorsed by conservation groups 
such as the Audubon Society as well as Ducks Unlimited, whose 
members include many hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply letting nature take its course is no longer valid,''  
said Frank Gill, senior vice president of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The states covered by the new hunting rules are: Alabama,  
Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, 
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Direct Makes Flowery Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Marc Ostrofsky is off the hook for life when it  
comes to Valentine's Day gifts for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston entrepreneur agreed to sell the domain name  
``eflowers.com'' to Flowers Direct with one special condition: A 
bouquet of flowers to be delivered to his wife, every month, for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's 36, so we figure 50 to 60 years of flowers,'' Ostrofsky  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ostrofsky bought the ``eflowers.com'' name for $70 two years  
ago. Over since, he says he'd been hounded by florists wanting to 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of the calls, Ostrofsky agreed Thursday to sell the name  
for-- $25,000, a 50-cent commission from each order placed through 
eflowers.com and the flowers for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers Direct, based in Tampa, Fla., jumped at the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty excited about it,'' said Patti Grenhart, the  
company's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Ostrofsky received her first delivery Thursday -- a batch of  
long-stemmed red roses. But she may not be the only lucky lady for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Flowers Direct began offering to deliver flowers to

<HEADLINE> Aide: Hillary Will Consider Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Now that her husband's impeachment trial is  
over, Hillary Rodham Clinton will consider running for the Senate 
seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an aide 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the backdrop we've been in for the past few weeks, she  
wasn't in a position to do that,'' Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for 
the first lady, said. ``Clearly, there's a change in that 
situation, and at some point in the future I'm sure she will be 
giving thought to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Daily News, quoting unidentified sources, said Mrs.  
Clinton would make her decision as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Berry said: ``I don't know that she's put a deadline on  
herself at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, New York Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said the  
odds are 50-50 that Mrs. Clinton would seek the Senate seat next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to return to New York City in early  
March for a women's leadership forum and some Democrats think she 
might use that setting to give some indication of what she intends 
to do.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gov't. To Give Banks $66B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The government will pump $66 billion in public  
funds into 15 major banks in coming weeks to repair the country's 
hobbled financial system under a plan approved today. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is in line with previous projections. The final amount  
could vary depending on how satisfied the government is with the 
banks' restructuring plans, the Financial Revitalization Committee 
member said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government told banks that they can go ahead and hold  
shareholders' meetings to obtain approval for issues of preferred 
shares. The preferred shares will be sold to the government in 
exchange for the public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen major banks are to receive funds before the end of the  
fiscal year on March 31. Banks are likely to apply formally for the 
funds in early March, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are heading in the right direction, but it is just one  
step,'' said Setsuko Akiba, analyst at Deutche Morgan Grenfell. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said questions linger on whether banks will be  
successful in improving their profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	The government passed legislation last October allowing the use  
of taxpayer money to bail out weak Japanese banks or help replenish 
capital reserves at healthier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is mired in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden banks scale back on lending, starving companies of 
cash. Many finance institutions are now struggling to write off 
massive bad loans left over from the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has asked the banks to carry out drastic  
restructuring, and some banks have reportedly been urged to 
restrict their activities to the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 15 banks, Fuji Bank will get the largest amount of  
$8.85 billion, followed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank at $7.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Yokohama, Japan's largest regional bank, will  
receive $1.77 billion. The bank has reportedly decided to withdraw 
from overseas banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major banks that will receive public funds include: Sakura  
Bank, Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and Sumitomo 
Bank.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Four-time U.S. pairs champions Kitty and  
Peter Carruthers were inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of 
Fame on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother-sister team was honored at the U.S. Figure Skating  
Championships with fellow inductee John Misha Petkevich, a two-time 
Olympian. Tom Collins, owner and producer of the ``Champions on 
Ice'' tour, also was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carruthers were the dominant U.S. pairs team in the 1980s.  
They won four titles from 1981-84, and captured the silver medal at 
the Sarajevo Olympics in 1984. They also won a bronze medal at the 
1982 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Petkevich, the U.S. 1971 men's champion, finished fifth at the  
1972 Sapporo Olympics and sixth at the Grenoble Games in 1968. He 
was fourth at the world championships in 1972. Petkevich, who also 
won three silvers and one bronze at the senior nationals, was the 
1966 junior champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who was inducted into the U.S. hall in 1996, was  
elected to the world hall in May. To honor his many 
accomplishments, both on and off the ice, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association is renaming its headquarters in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., the ``Tom Collins Building.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *WHEAT A WINNER IN JUNIOR WOMEN:* Sara Wheat landed four triple  
jumps, two in combination, and skated the most well-rounded program 
Friday to win the junior women's title at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, 14, of Swedesboro, N.J., has been working on the overall  
quality of her programs this year, specifically her edge quality 
and style, said her coach, Jeff DiGregorio. That showed in the 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though she wasn't the best jumper today, her second mark  
reflected all the hard work that she's put in this year,'' 
DiGregorio said. ``And we'll continue in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sasha Cohen, who had the most versatile program, but was hurt by  
mistakes on three jumps, finished second. Jennifer Kirk of Newton, 
Mass., was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, 14, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., really let her personality  
shine through, playing to the crowd and making sure her skating fit 
the music. She had nice spins, but lacked the technical elements to 
hold onto her first-place finish in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Cohen's five triple jumps, she double-footed the flip and  
salchow, and fell on one of her toe loops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started out sort of shaky and I think I got better going  
through,'' Cohen said. ``I was nervous about the opening jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, also 14, was the best jumper, nailing seven triples, but  
her program lacked personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat plans to move up to seniors next year, and Cohen said she  
does, too. Not so fast, according to coach John Nicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say you'll consult with your coach and then you'll decide  
whether you'll move up or not,'' Nicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I moving up?'' Cohen asked. ``What do you want me to say?''  
</P>
<P>
	``'I'll consult with my coach and then decide,''' Nicks replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll consult with my coach and then decide,'' Cohen said,  
drawing laughter from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EMPTY STANDS:* If this year's U.S. Figure Skating Championships  
are a trial run for the 2002 Winter Olympics, there's a serious 
problem facing local organizers: Few fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance at the Delta Center for five sessions through  
Thursday was abysmal. The biggest turnout was for Wednesday 
evening's pairs short program, which drew only 3,964. Thursday 
night's women's short program attracted only 3,804 despite the 
presence of the sport's biggest star, Michelle Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	By far the most disappointing number was for Thursday  
afternoon's men's short program, which drew the fewest fans thus 
far, 1,776. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased, but we'd be more pleased if we were sold out,''  
said Lisa Mickelson, the executive director of the local organizing 
committee. ``A year after the Olympics, I definitely think we're 
seeing the effects of that.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Set To Vote on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirteen months after the name Monica Lewinsky  
rattled the White House, senators are primed to acquit Bill Clinton 
and end the second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. 
But senators appear far less willing to forgive Clinton for 
concealing an extramarital affair from the nation and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's historic votes on two articles of impeachment charging  
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice complete a drama 
that has riveted official Washington, roiled a midterm 
congressional election and worn out the patience of the American 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	And it has caused Clinton, and the presidency, incalculable  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's self-indulgent actions were immoral,  
disgraceful, reprehensible,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. 
``History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that William 
Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office in our 
American democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah predicted that Clinton's  
concealment of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, which grew out of the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, would forever tar him as 
``the most accomplished, polished liar we've ever had serving in 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After another morning of closed-door deliberations, senators  
were to vote in public today on the impeachment articles, possibly 
around noon. With four Republican senators saying they would vote 
to acquit, it was possible that the articles would not even attract 
a simple majority in a chamber where the GOP holds a 55-45 edge. 
Several senators predicted Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also would 
vote to acquit, although her office declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, would not remain without troubles: He could  
face indictment, while in office or after his term, by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, and must finish his remaining months in 
office facing a GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him evicted 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes cap a five-week trial that featured for the first time  
videotaped testimony on the Senate floor and provided the world its 
first good look at Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A 
national TV audience was able to watch as 13 House impeachment 
managers, all Republicans, argued that Clinton deserved to be 
thrown out of office, while White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings;  
furtive gropings and sex acts between the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky near the Oval Office; late night phone calls between the 
president and the intern; and, most damning for Clinton, a stained 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Starr's findings, the House approved one article of  
impeachment accusing the president of lying to a federal grand jury 
on Aug. 17, 1998, about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The second charge said Clinton obstructed justice by trying to  
have Ms. Lewinsky sign a false affidavit in the Jones case; by a 
job search conducted by presidential friend Vernon Jordan; by the 
retrieval of presidential gifts by Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie; and the alleged ``coaching'' of Mrs. Currie by the 
president for her grad jury appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators said it was their constitutional duty to proceed with a  
trial, even though from the beginning there were doubts that the 
two-thirds vote required to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office would materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of closed-door deliberations this week, senators  
denounced Clinton's conduct ``over and over again from both sides 
of the aisle,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and Republicans alike said the votes were not  
there for conviction. Bennett, for one, has joined a 
Democratic-sponsored initiative to have the Senate pass a strong 
resolution of censure immediately after Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist gavels the trial to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters agree the resolution is ailing because of  
stiff Republican opposition, and the pro-censure senators may have 
to settle for a statement denouncing the president's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joined three  
GOP senators who previously announced their decisions against 
removing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``After due consideration, I am persuaded that the president's  
wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by the criminal 
justice system,'' she said. ``And I am further persuaded that 
future presidents and future generations can be effectively 
deterred from such wrongdoing by this impeachment and that 
potential prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of  
Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania previously came out 
against conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began private deliberations on Tuesday, and by Thursday  
night they were holding news conferences and issuing written 
statements to announce their votes and explain their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not any senator in this chamber nor any person in this  
country, will look at this president in the same way again,'' 
Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that the president abused his sacred power by lying and  
obstructing justice,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``How can 
parents instill values and morality in their children? if Clinton 
isn't removed, he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore: ``There can be no doubt that  
President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of his 
words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to 
our culture and to our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate trial began Jan. 7. Inside the tradition-steeped  
Senate chamber, where the only other presidential impeachment trial 
was held in 1868 in the case of Andrew Johnson, senators conducted 
the case with decorum and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	Just outside the chamber, where microphones and television  
cameras were permanently stationed, partisan sparks flew as they 
had all through the House proceedings. Most Republicans scarcely 
tried to hide their eventual conclusions that Clinton should be 
removed from office. Democrats expressed outrage that concealing an 
affair warranted overturning a presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Text of Proposed Censure Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The text of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's censure resolution:  
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United  
States, engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate 
employee in the White House, which was shameful, reckless and 
indefensible; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United  
States, deliberately misled and deceived the American people, and 
people in all branches of the United States government; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United  
States, gave false or misleading testimony and his actions have had 
the effect of impeding discovery of evidence in judicial 
proceedings; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter is  
unacceptable for a president of the United States, does demean the 
office of the president as well as the president himself, and 
creates disrespect for laws of the land; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas President Clinton fully deserves censure for engaging in  
such behavior; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas future generations of Americans must know that such  
behavior is not only unacceptable but also bears grave 
consequences, including loss of integrity, trust and respect; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton remains subject to criminal  
actions in a court of law like any other citizen; 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter has  
brought shame and dishonor to himself and to the office of the 
president; and 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton through his conduct in this  
matter has violated the trust of the American people; 
</P>
<P>
	Now therefore be it resolved that:  
</P>
<P>
	The United States Senate does hereby censure William Jefferson  
Clinton, president of the United States, and does condemn his 
wrongful conduct in the strongest terms; and 
</P>
<P>
	Now be it further resolved that:  
</P>
<P>
	The United States Senate recognizes the historic gravity of this  
bipartisan resolution, and trusts and urges that future congresses 
will recognize the importance of allowing this bipartisan statement 
of censure and condemnation to remain intact for all time; and 
</P>
<P>
	Be it further resolved that:  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate now move on to other matters of significance to our  
people, to reconcile differences between and within the branches of 
government, and to work together -- across party lines -- for the 
benefit of the American people.

<HEADLINE> Alvin Young One of the Top Scorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Alvin Young remembers the slap that set  
him straight when he said he didn't have any homework. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just smacked me in front of everybody, right in the  
face,'' Young said. ``I couldn't believe she did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young did his homework, all right. He also stayed out of trouble  
and eventually started shooting baskets at the Brooklyn church 
where his mother worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Young now plays for Niagara and is one of the top scorers in  
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Edna Young, died of a heart attack last September,  
and Young is dedicating his season to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I can see her in the stands,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he came to Niagara, Young was cut from his high school  
team four times. He was snubbed by Division I programs coming out 
of junior college two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's intent on proving he belongs among the best, and  
proving so many people wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 senior guard is averaging 24.7 points a game and  
became the second-highest scorer in Division I with 44 points 
against Siena on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Niagara is bidding for its first Metro Atlantic Athletic  
Conference title and first NCAA tournament spot since Calvin Murphy 
averaged 29 points a game in 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, the school's highest scorer since Murphy, also can handle  
the ball, pass, defend and rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is by far the most complete guard in the league,'' said  
Mike MacDonald, the coach of rival Canisius. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two kinds of people,'' Niagara coach Joe Mihalich  
said. ``Those who say `I can' and those who say `I can't.' And 
they're both right. Alvin thinks he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he does. His off-balance 3-pointer beat Rider at home on  
Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a playground wizard at heart, Young loves to talk on the  
court. He serves his trash with a smile, like that night against 
Rider. Niagara point guard Jeremiah Johnson said Rider had it 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just hounding him,'' Johnson said. ``I guess he  
wanted to end it the proper way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young learned his basketball from players whose accomplishments  
never found their way into box scores. There was one street wizard 
named Biz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was great,'' Young said. ``I wanted to be like him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Young held his own on the playgrounds and in a summer  
tournament, but his goal was to play college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He discovered Mitchell College, a junior college in New London,  
Conn. Young didn't want to leave home but Edna pushed him out the 
door, saying the world was a lot bigger than Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get so many stereotypes when you're out in the streets,''  
Young said. ``You hate cops. White people are bad. It's not 
necessarily that you believe it, it's just that it's always beaten 
into your head. Mitchell was a lesson in life as well as a lesson 
in basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young taught a few lessons himself. He scored 54 points one  
night and came back with 48 the next in a tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Armstrong, then the Niagara coach, recruited Young on the  
advice of Mitchell coach Dick Conover, a former Niagara assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion he's the best player in that conference,'' said  
Armstrong, who now does radio commentary for the Toronto Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Mihalich: ``He just lights up the room.''  
</P>
<P>
	Young did just that last season at Madison Square Garden,  
scoring 26 points in an 86-63 upset of St. John's. His 44 points 
against Siena made him only the third Niagara player to score that 
many in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt his name was circled in the scouting report,  
and he still got the points,'' said Mihalich, who became coach 
after Armstrong was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The shots don't always go. After missing a 3-pointer that would  
have won the game against Canisius recently, Young went to the gym 
at Niagara and shot 3-pointer after 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe I missed that shot,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Lets Currency Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The central bank let Ecuador's currency  
float freely Friday, eliminating the set band within which the 
sucre could be traded, in order to protect its foreign reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the move caused the value of the sucre to tumble 9  
percent from 7,300 to the dollar at Thursday's closing to 8,000 in 
early trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sucre rallied, finishing the day at 7,494 to the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	Most traders had not expected such a quick recovery, and will  
likely remain very cautious about the sucre when markets open again 
Wednesday after a four-day weekend, said Carlos Andrade, a trader 
with the brokerage firm Produbanco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measure is designed to give security to the internal  
market and respond to the needs of the national economy,'' said 
Central Bank President Luis Jacome. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank had spent $60 million of its reserves this week  
defending the sucre's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank will continue to intervene in the foreign  
exchange market to protect the sucre against speculators, but ``in 
a more limited fashion'' than before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts expect the sucre's value to fall.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is not so much a flotation of the sucre, but  
a hidden devaluation which the government does not want to admit,'' 
said economist Luis Villacis. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the economic uncertainty in Ecuador, one of Latin  
America's smallest economies, was Finance Minister Fidel 
Jaramillo's resignation late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaramillo said he resigned because he opposed the government of  
President Jamil Mahuad's decision to put a 1 percent tax on bank 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador was plagued by a massive budget deficit and Latin  
America's highest inflation in 1998. It has been hurt by falling 
prices for its main export, oil, which President Jamil Mahuad said 
has helped generate Ecuador's ``worst crisis in 70 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's decision to let its currency float comes amid fears of  
financial instability in the region following Brazil's decision 
last month to let its currency, the real, float freely. The real's 
value has dropped sharply since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador had depreciated the sucre by sliding trade bands since  
1984, with the currency falling by 54 percent against the dollar 
last year. The last trade band was between 7,274 and 6,287 to the 
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquittal Tops Global News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- World leaders were largely silent but TV stations  
in Europe led news broadcasts Friday with the Senate's acquittal of 
President Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many losers in this case and very few  
winners,'' France's TF1 TV correspondent Ulysse Gosset said from 
Washington. ``Bill Clinton is definitely among the losers, even if 
he has risen from the ashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, the British Broadcasting Corp. and rival ITN carried  
the story as their lead item. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the Senate's proceedings as a ``historic moment,''  
SKY, a satellite TV service that broadcasts from London and covers 
Britain and parts of Europe, carried live coverage of the Senate 
vote to acquit Clinton on articles of impeachment for perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, many officials in Europe refused to comment on Clinton's  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said all along, this has been a matter for the  
American Senate,'' said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor Party,  
sent congratulations to Clinton. In a letter, Barak said he was 
satisfied with the decision because it would let Clinton get back 
to aiding Middle East peace, Israel radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that history will judge you on your many  
achievements and your extraordinary successes and not on other 
subjects that are irrelevant,'' said Barak, considered to be one of 
the strongest challengers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 
May 17 national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, where Clinton is scheduled to meet President Ernesto  
Zedillo on Sunday and Monday, political analyst Sergio Sarmiento 
said Mexicans generally saw the whole process as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incomprehensible for the majority of Mexicans,'' he said,  
``that an intimate relationship ... would be converted into a 
political persecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela sent congratulations  
to both the Senate and the White House, and said he hoped that the 
U.S. government could now focus on other issues.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cuts Key Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Seeking to lift its economy out of a dogged  
recession, Japan's central bank on Friday cut the country's already 
record-low interest rates once again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board voted to reduce the rate banks  
charge each other on unsecured overnight loans from 0.25 percent to 
0.15 percent -- the lowest rate ever. 
</P>
<P>
	By cutting the rate, which serves as a benchmark for interest  
rates on other types of loans, the central bank hopes to lower 
borrowing costs not only for banks but also for companies and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami told reporters the cut would  
boost corporate borrowing. He also said the central bank would step 
up its purchases of corporate securities in the money market as 
another way of making it easier for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps, aimed at giving a boost to business activity, come as  
the economy has failed to recover from the longest recession since 
the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rate, announced after the close of markets in Tokyo, is  
also aimed at combating a recent rise in long-term interest rates, 
the bank governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cut -- the second since September -- highlighted how few  
options the Japanese government has left for reviving the economy. 
Key short-term interest rates now stand at close to zero percent, 
leaving little room for further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, successive stimulus spending packages have driven  
Japan's cumulative national debt to close to 110 percent of the 
gross domestic product -- the highest ratio in the industrial world. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Japan approved a plan to pump $66 billion in public  
funds into 15 major banks in coming weeks to repair the country's 
hobbled financial system.

<HEADLINE> US Backs Killing Seals To Save Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials should be allowed as a last resort  
to kill federally protected sea lions and seals when they prey on a 
declining fish population such as salmon, says a federal report to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the National Marine Fisheries Services says that  
the rapidly growing populations of California sea lions and Pacific 
harbor seals on the West Coast are harming salmon stocks and other 
declining fish species. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to measure exactly how great an impact seals  
and sea lion predation is having on salmon,'' said William Stelle, 
the agency's Northwest region administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``We do know that sound principles of wildlife  
management tell us that we should minimize the pressure being put 
on already badly diminished runs of these fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the report recommends that the agency apply a resource  
conservation principle ``favoring the resource most in need of 
protection when information is uncertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which was made public earlier this week, also cited  
increasing incidents in which sea lions have been a threat to 
safety at docks and in marinas in California and the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific harbor seals and California sea lions, whose numbers  
have dramatically grown, are protected under the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act. The law also protects Steller sea lions and 
Hawaiian monk seals, which remain critically endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, based on a larger scientific study by the fisheries  
agency, said there are ``robust and increasing'' populations of 
California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, there were 188,000 California sea lions  
and 76,000 harbor seals off California, Oregon and Washington, with 
the populations growing at an annual rate of 5 percent to 7 
percent. Their numbers have tripled since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that Congress change the law to allow the  
closely managed killing of these sea lions or seals when they 
repeatedly come into conflict with human activity or threaten 
certain fish populations that are in severe decline. 
</P>
<P>
	These killings should be as a last resort and be ``a seldom-used  
option,'' the study said, adding there is a ``pressing need'' to 
develop other deterrents to keep the killing of these mammals to a 
minimum.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Is Also Liberated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before Hillary Rodham Clinton took off across  
the East Room in a tango with the Argentine president, a guest at 
that state dinner asked if she had her campaigning shoes ready for 
next year's Senate race in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady tossed her head back, lifted her arms and let  
them fall. ``Aaah-ah-ah-ha-uh!'' she replied, giving neither a 
quotable syllable nor a clear clue of her plans. She turned to 
greet another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clinton, who shooed away talk of future roles as long  
as she played stalwart wife through 13 months of scandal, the 
Senate votes Friday to acquit President Clinton of impeachment 
charges freed her, too, to think ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainties: Mrs. Clinton will crisscross the country  
promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare proposals. She 
will make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably with 
daughter Chelsea. She will take her ``America's treasures'' tour to 
the West to promote historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Mrs. Clinton's own post-impeachment ``comeback'' strategy  
to salvage the legacy of the administration she and her husband 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see her taking time to say, 'Gee, thank goodness  
(impeachment) is over.' I think she says, 'Gee, thank goodness 
people will start paying attention to our work on the issues,''' 
said Neel Lattimore, a former top aide to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's acquittal Friday was ``obviously a great  
passage'' for Mrs. Clinton, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. 
``But I don't think it will be considered over for her until they 
get their legacy back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who logged at least 100 appearances in the 1998  
campaign, also will ``go out enthusiastically'' this year and next 
for congressional Democrats, spokeswoman Marsha Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Frank Luntz remarked with envy that Mrs.  
Clinton is ``a home run'' for campaigning Democrats. But he warned 
it will be a tightrope walk regarding those candidates aiming to 
topple the Republican House majority that impeached Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing the public doesn't want to come from this year  
of scandal -- they don't want anyone seeking revenge,'' said Luntz. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Clinton who formulated the strategy early in the  
Monica Lewinsky scandal to attack the president's accusers as part 
of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' On last fall's campaign trail, 
she vilified Republicans as ``the other side,'' bent on ``defaming 
and tearing down'' Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady will campaign in the next round only as an  
advocate for the Democrats' agenda, Berry said. ``She takes her own 
future too seriously to do anything for revenge. That's stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about that future?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want a long vacation when this is all over,'' Mrs. Clinton  
laughed back in April 1997 when campaign-finance investigations 
were the rage. As for herself in elected office, she said then, 
``No, no, no. That's not anything I ever thought of for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smart money has been on lucrative ventures -- a lecture circuit,  
another book or two, a seat at the head of a foundation or 
corporate board -- because the Clintons owe millions of dollars to 
lawyers. Or, she might claim an ambassadorship or Cabinet post if 
Vice President Al Gore succeeds Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	But word now from friends and advisers is that Mrs. Clinton is  
``seriously considering'' pleas from prominent Democrats and New 
Yorkers who want her to seek in 2000 the Senate seat of retiring 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of deferring -- ``after the trial, after the trial,''  
Berry told reporters -- decision time is at hand. But, the 
spokeswoman said this week, ``I don't think a switch is going to be 
flipped overnight. People need to settle down and give her some 
time ... to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Mrs. Clinton best find it hard to envision her  
abandoning her role -- a vocation, really -- as first lady to satisfy 
her separate political ambitions.	   ``I would be surprised,'' said Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's 
former press secretary. ``She has managed to carve an invaluable 
national and international niche as an ambassador to the world on 
behalf of women, children and families. ... I see her continuing 
that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lattimore agreed, guessing the buzz about being a shoo-in for  
the Senate is, at best, flattering for a woman long wronged -- 
before this past year, anyway -- by public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's won hearts,'' said Lattimore. ``But she always stays  
focused on the work at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Media consultant Mandy Grunwald, yet another former aide  
contemplating Mrs. Clinton as a candidate, said: ``I can't decide 
whether to start making ads or start laughing. ... As interesting 
as the Senate can be, the stage she is used to as first lady is so 
much broader that I think the Senate would feel confining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Mrs. Clinton does, she should keep it nonpartisan, said  
GOP consultant Luntz, lest she face a credibility issue for her 
role in allowing the president's lie denying a sexual relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky to stand for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have talked to my husband about everything. I can state  
unequivocally that ... these are false allegations,'' she said at 
first. After his confession, she put out word that he'd deceived 
her, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel very sorry for her, but I would not mistake an  
expression of pity for an expression of political support,'' Luntz 
said.

<HEADLINE> Will Clinton Pick Remorse, Revenge? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remorse or revenge?  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton must strike a delicate balance after his  
impeachment trial -- trying to demonstrate contrition while waging a 
political war against the Republicans who sought to drive him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to push his own agenda through the Republican Congress  
and then help Democrats win back control of the House and Senate. 
But at the same time, he can't gloat or be smug about defeating 
Republican efforts to oust him. That would be unseemly for a man 
marked in history as only the second American president to be 
impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Clinton,'' said Brookings Institution analyst Thomas  
Mann. ``He's perfectly capable of going to work with people who 
were and are his adversaries. At the same time, he will fume 
privately and do what he can to defeat them. There's no overt 
public bitterness, there's no public `I'm going to get even.' 
There's no self pity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategist Eddie Mahe, however, believes that  
Clinton's ``natural hubris, his arrogance, will be the driving 
force in how he behaves in the coming days, weeks and months. He 
will believe and act accordingly, that whatever he presents to 
Congress he is automatically entitled to get his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahe said Republicans should go their own way, take a stand of  
``substantial disengagement from the guy'' and tell Americans what 
the GOP believes in, without drawing a contrast with Clinton. ``A 
lot of us can't even mention his name without our venom showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a swirl of talk Thursday about whether Clinton would  
seek post-impeachment revenge against Republicans, particularly the 
House managers who prosecuted the case. Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said it was ``deeply troubling that the president views 
closure of this constitutional process as an opportunity for 
revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House press secretary Joe Lockhart pointed out that  
most of the 13 House managers are in politically safe districts and 
were handily reelected in November. ``I can't think of a worse, 
more dumb strategy than going after people based on whether they 
were a House manager or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's expected impeachment acquittal, Clinton intends  
to try to clear the air with a statement urging the country to 
leave behind divisions about impeachment and move on to other 
matters. At the same time, many Democrats are hoping to use the 
impeachment battle against Republicans in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is likely to leave the impeachment theme to others as he  
tries to build a legacy on the strength of Social Security and 
education reforms. But he won't be shy about campaigning or 
building a big warchest for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, Clinton will fly to New Hampshire next Thursday,  
less than a week after the Senate's final vote, to campaign for 
Vice President Al Gore, his loyal defender. Later in the month, the 
president will stage a big fundraiser in San Francisco, the first 
of many around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	It is no secret Clinton has seethed about Ken Starr's  
investigation and believes the impeachment battle was driven by 
partisan passions. However, he was able to keep his job approval 
ratings high by reminding Americans about the booming economy and 
insisting he was doing the peoples' business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see very little change, stylistically or  
substantively,'' presidential counselor Doug Sosnik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why change a successful strategy?  
</P>
<P>
	Mann suggested that Clinton simply make a statement apologizing  
for the damage and pain he caused and ``quickly suggest everyone 
set aside the bitterness of these past months and return to the 
people's work. I'd make it a paragraph in length.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also have a political interest in moving on.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be concerned about their own preservation and  
political future,'' Mann said. ``It's time to go back to work. All 
signs are that the Republicans in Congress are ready to do just 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Cites Nine in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nine IOC members might have broken Olympic rules  
during visits to Nagano during the Japanese city's bid for the 1998 
Winter Games, Japanese sports officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up an investigation into Nagano's bid, they said a  
complete report will be sent to International Olympic Committee 
headquarters in Switzerland by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that it's up to the discretion of the IOC,'' said  
Japanese Olympic Committee secretary-general Yushiro Yagi, who led 
the investigative team. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi refused to give the names of the nine or details of their  
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	He would only say that those engaged in questionable conduct  
included one IOC member who visited Nagano several times, four who 
brought ``large numbers'' of people and four who were accompanied 
by families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials are generally allowed one trip to a bidding city  
and permitted to bring one guest at the bidders' expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi also dismissed criticism that there was a conflict of  
interest in forming the investigative team from members of the 
Japanese Olympic Committee, some of whom had also served on the 
Nagano bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied with this report,'' Yagi said.  
</P>
<P>
	A Nagano residents group called on Tokyo prosecutors Friday to  
investigate Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like an impartial investigation,'' Kaoru Iwata, who  
heads the group, wrote in a letter submitted to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Iwata's group has filed a civil lawsuit demanding the return of  
taxpayer money used in the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi said his investigative team was unable to confirm any  
expensive gifts, reimbursement of medical costs or outright 
transfers of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The team based the findings on seven days of interviews with  
former Nagano bid committee members and an examination of bid 
committee records. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi said records were incomplete because the bid committee had  
burned its accounting ledgers in 1992, which he called 
``regrettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team would continue its investigation, Yagi said, although  
he refused to say what it would look into next. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano's bid cost $18 million. In the wake of the Salt Lake City  
scandal, Nagano's bid has also come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders have said they wined and dined visiting IOC officials,  
entertaining some with geisha and taking others to the tourist spot 
of Kyoto.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down La. Sodomy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An appeals court has thrown out a  
194-year-old Louisiana law against sodomy, saying that consensual 
oral and anal sex is protected by the right to privacy in the state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court issued the 3-0 ruling Tuesday, reversing the  
1996 conviction of Mitchell E. Smith. He had been accused of raping 
a woman but found guilty under the state's ``crimes against 
nature'' statute only of having her perform oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no doubt that the right of consenting adults to  
engage in private non-commercial sexual activity, free from 
governmental interference, is protected by the privacy clause of 
the Louisiana Constitution,'' the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed Smith's conviction and his sentence of two  
years probation. Smith's lawyer didn't return a telephone call 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The law made anal and oral sex between consenting adults  
felonies punishable by up to five years in prison. It dates from 
1805, just after Louisiana was purchased by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the law applied to homosexual and heterosexuals, gay  
men and women said it was aimed at them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great legal ruling,'' said Suzanne Goldberg, a lawyer  
with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``It is 
completely consistent with rulings by other courts nationwide 
striking down these laws as outrageous invasions of privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be appealed, said prosecutor Tim McElroy.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about gay rights,'' McElroy said. ``We are doing  
this as a means of restoring to the victim what small victory she 
received in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means there are now 11 states that still ban oral  
and anal sex between consenting adults, Goldberg said.

<HEADLINE> Snakebite Orphans Keep Family Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Tenn. (AP) -- Five children who were orphaned when their  
mother and snake-handling evangelist father died of snakebites were 
put in the custody Friday of both sets of grandparents, one of whom 
is also a serpent-handling preacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile Court Judge John Bell settled a dispute over custody of  
the youngsters, ages 4 to 12, by deciding they will spend the 
school year with grandparents in Georgia and vacations with 
grandparents in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge warned the grandparents to keep the youngsters away  
from churches where serpents are handled. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's maternal grandparents had argued that the  
youngsters would be safer with them. They do not belong to a 
snake-handling church. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters' father, John Wayne ``Punkin'' Brown Jr., 34,  
belonged to a sect that believes faith protects Christians who 
handle poisonous snakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown died in October after being bitten by a rattlesnake at a  
worship service. When asked whether he wanted medical help, he 
shook his head and pointed to the sky. His wife, Melinda Brown, 28, 
died under similar circumstances in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's father is himself a snake-handling minister with his own  
church. During a custody hearing Thursday, the elder Brown said 
children are not allowed to handle serpents in his church. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would seek medical help if bitten, Brown Sr. said he  
would have to ``pray about it.'' ``But I say that if you can't get 
help through prayer, go get some help,'' he told the judge.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft VP Queried on Downloading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government attorney clashed with a senior  
Microsoft Corp. executive over the often long and awkward 
downloading of Web browsers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase said Thursday it was a  
simple process. But under cross-examination by Justice Department 
attorney David Boies, Chase acknowledged it also can take some time 
for personal computer owners with low-speed phone connections. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is significant because of Microsoft's claim that  
people who receive its browser as part of the Windows operating 
system simply can switch to another, such as Navigator, the browser 
made by Microsoft rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies sought to show how downloading browser software over the  
Web is much more difficult for consumers than getting it with their 
new computers or through Internet service providers like America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department contends in its antitrust lawsuit that  
Microsoft used its monopoly power and illegal tactics to crush and 
discourage competition, including Netscape and its rival browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies presented Chase with a March 1997 e-mail, sent to him by a  
Microsoft employee, on how to get more people to use the company's 
browser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 60 percent of all surfers have never downloaded any  
software from the Web. My sense is that these people are not very 
likely to download anything, let alone a browser that takes two 
hours to download,'' wrote that employee, Kumar Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo goes on to report that ``80 percent of those who do not  
use IE say they have no plans to switch to it, which means that if 
we take away IE from the o/s (operating system), most nav (Netscape 
Navigator) users will never switch to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase said he had no problem with the report but disputed its  
interpretation. He said Mehta was being ``dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also went over the deposition taken from another Microsoft  
employee, Joe Belfiore, a computer programmer who last March cited 
``tons of feedback that suggest that downloading IE (Internet 
Explorer) takes too long, is too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find that the number of hours that it takes to download  
these components over a phone line is incredibly discouraging to 
people, often fails, and the result is that people don't get an 
improved user experience at all,'' Belfiore said in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase acknowledged that at the time, he oversaw efforts to make  
Microsoft's browser smaller to help make it more appealing to 
consumers. But he disagreed with Belfiore's suggestion that 
downloading is difficult. He suggested that Belfiore perhaps was 
engaging in self-critique popular in the ``Microsoft culture.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Hepatitis C Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved a more accurate test  
for hepatitis C Friday, a move that could help blood banks more 
accurately track people who may have caught the dangerous liver 
virus from pre-1992 blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, thousands  
of whom caught it from transfusions before purity tests of the 
blood supply began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The hepatitis C virus sometimes destroys people's livers, yet  
many carriers don't know they have it. 
</P>
<P>
	So under new government rules, blood banks are testing leftover  
samples of pre-1992 transfusions. When a test indicates a batch of 
blood could have contained hepatitis C, hospitals will track people 
who received that blood and urge them to be checked for infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The test that blood banks have had to use until now sometimes  
classified blood samples as ``indeterminate'' -- it couldn't always 
rule out infection in samples that were fine. That meant thousands 
of people who aren't sick could be scared into getting an 
unnecessary hepatitis test. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, Chiron Corp.'s RIBA HCV 3.0, is more accurate, the  
Food and Drug Administration said Friday. In one study in which a 
competing test declared 30 percent of samples indeterminate, the 
RIBA 3.0 found only 7 percent inconclusive.

<HEADLINE> US Said To Commit Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is offering to commit  
American ground troops to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians overcome steep differences and reach a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's decision, which he was disclosing in his weekly radio  
address today, was hinted at Friday night by Sen. John Warner, 
R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and then 
confirmed by a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, was heading  
for Paris today to assess peace talks between the two warring 
sides. The parties have an informal deadline of Feb. 20 for 
reaching an accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it was not a foregone conclusion an agreement  
would be reached despite the threat of NATO military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	There are deep divisions between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians  
on almost all important issues, mediators said Friday. ``We are 
going to have to make a lot of progress in the days ahead,'' said 
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, the chief mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, appearing Friday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''  
said, ``There's going to be a significant announcement by the 
president on Kosovo ... what we're going to do.'' While giving no 
specifics, he said he had spoken Pentagon officials and Senate 
colleagues, and that the Senate would be supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Warner's comment, National Security Council  
spokesman David Leavy said Clinton, in his radio address, would 
``continue his conversation with the American people about the U.S. 
national interests and the stakes in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy refused to elaborate, but the senior administration  
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``Depending on 
the character and composition of a political settlement, the 
president is prepared to contribute U.S. ground forces to a 
potential implementation force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some reports have suggested as many as 4,000 U.S. troops.  
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said the United States would send 2,200  
Marines to Kosovo in the first stage of any peacekeeping mission if 
there's a need to move quickly and U.S. troops are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of  
thousands have been driven from their homes in clashes in Kosovo 
between ethnic Albanian separatists and Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France are serving as co-hosts for the talks in  
Rambouillet, France. Albright will meet with Hill, the U.S. 
ambassador to Macedonia, and ``make her own on-the-ground 
assessment,'' the State Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is due this weekend on whether to extend negotiations  
into a second week. That would depend on how much progress the two 
sides were making on a self-rule plan for the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States does not support independence for Kosovo, but  
is insisting any settlement provide maximum self-rule for a 
three-year trial period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines, from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at  
Camp Lejeune, N.C., are already deployed near Kosovo as part of an 
amphibious ready group in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Army soldiers and heavy equipment, which sometimes take weeks to  
deploy, would follow Marines to Kosovo as part of a long-term NATO 
peacekeeping operation, said a Pentagon official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. Army troops could come from Europe, Asia or 
U.S. bases, depending on what type of units are needed.

<HEADLINE> Hartsells Win Figure Skating Pairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When they began skating together nine  
years ago, Danielle and Steve Hartsell could only dream of growing 
up to win the U.S. Figure Skating Championships pairs title. They 
grew into champions Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings from Westland, Mich., who have been on the rise  
since finishing second in a regional intermediate competition in 
1990, easily won the senior crown with a strong display of lifts, 
jumps and throws. Danielle, 18, and Steve, 21, added the title to 
their 1997 junior world crown and 1995 gold medal in the U.S. 
juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, we matured as people, and that shows in  
our skating,'' Steve said. ``We took a performance like this and 
made it a national championship performance. It shows how we've 
matured as people and skaters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells are the youngest pairs champions since Melissa and  
Mark Militano in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few years, we watched all the champions win and the  
emotions they showed were not something you know until you 
experience it yourself,'' Danielle said. ``And it's better than I 
ever thought it would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina, who won the last two nationals with Jason Dungjen --  
he now coaches the Hartsells -- finished second with new partner 
John Zimmerman. They were sloppy, as might be expected from a duo 
that has been together for only a few months. Both went down on a 
split triple twist when Ina crashed into Zimmerman's chest and he 
tripped over her. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, we need to evaluate what went wrong,'' Ina said.  
``Is it an element in the program, the way things are set up, or 
were we nervous? 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never, ever missed the twist. We tried to pick up the  
rest of the program, but because of that we were a little bit 
late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they are headed to next month's world championships --  
Ina's fifth appearance at worlds, and Zimmerman's second -- along 
with the Hartsells and third-place finishers Laura Handy and J. 
Paul Binnebose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to represent the USA and there is nothing  
like stepping on the ice as national champions at worlds,'' Ina 
said to the Hartsells. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, America's new wave of ice dancers was  
identified, and it includes three men not born in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The best of them, Russian Peter Tchernyshev, partnered with  
Naomi Lang to win. Performing a playful tango, they swept the 
judging panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Second place went to Eva Chalom and Mathew Gates, an Englishman.  
Another Russian, Oleg Fediukov, teamed with Debbie Koegel for 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really wanted to find is a partner we can skate  
with,'' said Chalom, whose partner skated despite a bout with 
pneumonia. ``I don't think any one of us had it mind to find 
someone from overseas ... that's just the way it ended up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top two couples qualified for the world championships at  
Helsinki, but they are longshots for a high finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The best American ice dancers of the 1990s, Elizabeth Punsalan  
and Jerod Swallow, turned pro last year. They won five U.S. crowns, 
but never managed to climb higher than sixth at worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the years come, the American teams will develop,'' Lang  
said. ``We just have to give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lang and Tchernyshev were training partners with Punsalan and  
Swallow at the Detroit Skating Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners first teamed in late 1996 after he hand-wrote a  
letter to her asking if she was interested in a partnership. Both 
had recently split with their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	They were fifth in the 1997 nationals and moved up to third last  
year. In ice dancing, where upsets almost never happen, they were 
next in line for the title when Punsalan-Swallow moved on and 
Jessica Joseph and Charles Butler -- the other U.S. duo at the 
Nagano Olympics -- split.

<HEADLINE> USDA OKs Irradiation of Red Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department today approved  
irradiation of red meat as a way to curb food-borne illnesses, 
offering the industry another way to improve food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to food safety, there is no silver bullet,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in announcing the action in 
Charlotte, N.C. ``Used in conjunction with other science-based 
prevention efforts, irradiation can provide consumers with an added 
measure of protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman made the announcement while speaking before a meeting  
of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Under USDA's proposed 
rule, which will be published in the Federal Register within 10 
days, radiation would be permitted for treatment of refrigerated or 
frozen uncooked meat and some meat products. It would not, however, 
require plants to use irradiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Irradiation is currently the only known method to eliminate  
completely a potentially deadly strain of E. coli bacteria in raw 
meat. The technology can also significantly reduce levels of 
listeria, salmonella and campylobacter bacteria on raw products, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups hailed the announcement as a new frontier for  
the food safety movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've more or less hit a technological wall in terms of how  
much further we can squeeze food safety,'' said Dane Bernard, vice 
president of food safety programs for the National Food Processors 
Association. ``This will open the door to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers  
of America, ``In the simplest of terms, food irradiation will save 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the silver bullet to eradicate food-borne pathogens  
but it is a big step to enhancing the world's safest food supply,'' 
Sansoni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irradiation has been used for years on limited amounts of  
produce, spices, poultry and other foods. Last year, the Food and 
Drug Administration approved the process for red meat, sparking 
renewed debate over the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	While irradiation has been approved for years, none of the major  
food companies has stepped forward to market irradiated products. 
Only a few small retailers offer irradiated foods. 
</P>
<P>
	During irradiation, low-level doses of gamma rays or electron  
beam irradiation are administered to kill bacteria. Scientists 
agree the process is safe in food. On the recent space mission, 
John Glenn and his fellow astronauts ate irradiated food. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, anti-nuclear groups have been vocally opposed to the  
procedure and some health advocates worry that using irradiation 
might reduce other safety techniques such as proper handling and 
plant sanitation.

<HEADLINE> Delgado, Blue Jays OK $5M Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado, who had asked for the highest  
salary in arbitration this year, settled without a hearing Friday, 
agreeing to a one-year contract worth $5,025,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said it was a lot easier and it was much better to  
get a deal done instead of going to arbitration,'' Delgado from 
Puerto Rico during a telephone news conference. ``Arbitration is a 
tool that you have as a player. It's a right. But you really don't 
know what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, who made $2.4 million last year, had asked for $6.5  
million in arbitration. Toronto had offered $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It relieves some of the tension that may happen in that room  
during that hearing,'' the first baseman said of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado gets a $1.75 million signing bonus and a salary of  
$3,275,000. The deal contains award bonuses but no performance 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly pleased to have Carlos under contract and this  
situation resolved heading into spring training,'' general manager 
Gord Ash said. ``We all know the pitfalls of arbitration. While 
it's a process that's there to be utilized to settle honest 
disputes, I always think it's better to settle if you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, the team captain, set career highs last season with a  
.292 average, 38 homers, 115 RBIs, 94 runs, 43 doubles and 314 
total bases. He missed the first 20 games of the season while 
recovering from shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties would have preferred a long-term deal but couldn't  
agree on terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one-year deal sets the framework for maybe coming back  
and re-visiting where we are on a long-term deal,'' Ash said. 
``We'll maybe do that at spring training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Blue Jays released outfielder Patrick Lennon. The  
30-year-old appeared in two games with Toronto last season and had 
two doubles in three at-bats. He hit .290 in 126 games at Triple-A 
Syracuse with 25 homers and 22 doubles.

	Senate Votes To Acquit Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal today in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
He told Americans he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said and 
did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. Clinton 
``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to vote the 
two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Senators also put the 
idea of censure aside, probably for good. 

</P>
<P>
	Jones Disappointed With Verdict  
</P>
<P>
	CABOT, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones, whose sexual harassment lawsuit  
began the scandal that ended with today's impeachment vote, said 
she was disappointed the Senate did not remove President Clinton 
from office. ``I just expected it because he gets away with 
everything,'' Mrs. Jones told Fox News. She sued Clinton on May 6, 
1994, alleging he propositioned her at the Excelsior Hotel in 
Little Rock three years earlier, when she was a state worker and he 
was Arkansas' governor. The case was later thrown out, and they 
settled for $850,000. But the House impeached Clinton on charges 
that he obstructed justice and committed perjury in the lawsuit.

	Judge To Rule on American Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge promised a ruling tomorrow on  
whether American Airlines' pilots should be held in contempt for 
ignoring a back-to-work order as the nation's second-largest 
airline canceled hundreds of flights for all of the long holiday 
weekend. Stranded passengers fumed at airports across the country 
today as U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall heard arguments in his 
Dallas courtroom as to whether the Allied Pilots Association should 
be punished for disregarding an order he issued Wednesday. An 
estimated one out of every four American pilots called in sick 
today.

	3rd Person Dies From Ford Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A third worker died today from injuries in an  
explosion at a Ford Motor Co. plant. Warren Blow, 51, had been in 
critical condition since the Feb. 1 accident at the company's Rouge 
complex. Ten other workers remained hospitalized. A state inspector 
said the explosion was caused by a natural gas buildup inside a 
coal-fired boiler at the power station. A final determination of 
the cause is expected this month.

	Sierra Leone Peacekeepers Accused  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The West African peacekeeping force in  
Sierra Leone summarily executed detainees suspected of 
collaborating with rebels, according to a U.N. human rights report 
obtained today. While human rights violations by the Nigerian-led 
force and Sierra Leone's Civil Defense Forces were not on the scale 
of the rebel campaign of terror, they were nonetheless totally 
unacceptable, the report said. Rebel killings and maimings have 
been widely documented. The report cited eyewitness accounts of 
peacekeeping troops executing dozens of civilians and Civil Defense 
Forces killing others who were allegedly either rebels or rebel 
sympathizers.

	Little Progress at Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Foreign mediators accused Serbs today  
of preventing progress at the Kosovo peace talks. They denied the 
Serb accusations of blocking direct meetings between the two sides. 
The chief mediator, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, described the six 
days of negotiations so far between Serbs and ethnic Albanians as 
``a very difficult process.'' But he predicted progress in the days 
ahead.

<P>
	Japan Cuts Key Lending Rate  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Seeking to lift its economy out of a dogged  
recession, Japan's central bank today cut the country's already 
record-low interest rates once again. The Bank of Japan's policy 
board voted to reduce the rate banks charge each other on unsecured 
overnight loans from 0.25 percent to 0.15 percent -- the lowest rate 
ever. By cutting the rate, which serves as a benchmark for interest 
rates on other types of loans, the central bank hopes to lower 
borrowing costs not only for banks but also for companies and 
individuals.

	Dow Ends 88.57 Lower  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, led by a decline in  
technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 88.57 
to close at 9,274.89. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,235-824. 
Broader stock indicators also fell, including the technology-laden 
Nasdaq, which was down 83.61 at 2,321.94.

	49ers Trade Barker, Smith to Browns  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Defensive end Roy Barker and tight  
end Irv Smith, both key players for the San Francisco 49ers, were 
traded today to the Cleveland Browns for unspecified past 
considerations. A source close to the 49ers said the deal was 
linked to the Browns' selection of cornerback Antonio Langham in 
Tuesday's expansion draft, relieving San Francisco of a free-agent 
bust and a $3 million salary.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presidency Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last dog is still alive.  
</P>
<P>
	In the bleakest days of his 1992 campaign, with his political  
career threatened by scandal, Bill Clinton vowed to fight ``'til 
the last dog dies.'' He survived New Hampshire, dubbed himself the 
``Comeback Kid,'' and continued down a career-long path of ruin and 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater. Gennifer Flowers. The draft. ``I didn't inhale.''  
Gays in the military. The ``Gates'' -- Nanny-, File-, and Travel-. 
</P>
<P>
	And Monica Lewinsky.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine lives? ``Bill Clinton has 13,000 lives,'' said consultant  
Dick Morris, who has worked for Clinton, on and off, since 1977. 
``And so far he's had 12,999 deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate's vote Friday to acquit him on impeachment  
charges, he lives again. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times has been written off? Twice? A dozen times?  
Dozens of times, maybe? No matter how often the skeptics count him 
out, he's always beat the odds,'' said Skip Rutherford, of Little 
Rock, Ark., a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern dates to his early days in politics, when the voters  
threw him out of the Arkansas governor's office in 1980. For each 
crisis, Clinton had only himself to blame -- though he often blamed 
others. And into each crisis, he relied on the same survival 
skills: moxie, arrogance, luck and a stubborn resolve inherited 
from his mother, a woman who didn't know how to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a lot of ups and downs as a kid and the pattern  
continues,'' said Arkansas political consultant Bill Paschall, 
another old friend. ``It's nothing for him to get up and have to 
face a rough day. It goes back to his childhood'' when he had an 
abusive stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, the late Virginia Kelley, was pregnant with Clinton  
when his father died in an automobile accident. She left him with 
her parents and went away to college. ``A bad break, you plow 
ahead. Sound familiar?'' Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	It does. Indeed, there is a familiar ring to many of Clinton's  
comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1982 re-election campaign was built around a television ad  
that expressed regret for the mistakes of his first term. Morris 
insisted that Clinton use the word ``apology.'' Clinton refused at 
the last minute, saying he was sorry without actually using the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two decades later, Clinton found it equally difficult to  
apologize directly for lying about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. But, once again, voters got his point. 
</P>
<P>
	His first big role on the national stage, an address to the 1988  
Democratic convention, was a boring bust. Hollywood pals Harry and 
Linda Thomason pulled strings to get him on the ``Tonight Show,'' 
where he played the saxophone and poked fun at himself. The 
appearance repaired his image nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, Harry Thomason stage-managed Clinton's  
finger-waving denial of the Lewinsky affair -- as well as his 
dramatic admission hours after he testified before the Starr grand 
jury that the denial was a lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers' tabloid story of an affair with Clinton threatened his  
1992 campaign in New Hampshire until Hillary Rodham Clinton sat by 
his side for a ``60 Minutes'' appearance that turned the tide. She 
was on TV again in the first days of the Lewinsky scandal, blaming 
it on ``a vast right-wing conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton backers spread negative information about Flowers, just  
as they would about Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a familiar bit of verbal gymnastics, Clinton denied  
having a 12-year affair with Flowers. He waited years to say that 
while they didn't have a 12-year affair, they did have sex once. 
</P>
<P>
	He let the truth about his Vietnam-era draft status eke out in  
dribs and drabs, a strategy of delay repeated at the White House 
during the controversies about campaign fund-raising and his 
Whitewater holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1993 health care plan bombed and helped Republicans grab  
control of the House and Senate in 1994. His political capital 
deeply diminished, Clinton felt compelled to tell reporters that 
the presidency was still relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, banished from the Clinton orbit in the 1980s, returned  
to help fashion a strategy to seize Republican issues such as crime 
and welfare, even at the risk of alienating Democrats. He then 
produced a laundry list of bite-sized proposals that appealed to 
suburban America: School children should wear uniforms! 
Neighborhood watch programs should have cellular telephones! 
</P>
<P>
	He easily won re-election.  
</P>
<P>
	The trial is now over, but the trials of Bill Clinton may never  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he's had his last death and rebirth,'' Morris  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other people get in a quandary and move to solve it. He simply  
steps aside, lets everything take its course and outlives it,'' 
said Washington-based Democratic consultant Ray Strother, who 
worked for Clinton in Arkansas between the Morris stints. He said 
Clinton counts on voters having short attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's lived his entire life like this,'' Strother said. ``Why  
change now? Somewhere down the line, he'll let somebody down and 
skid right through. Act like it didn't happen. And go on to 
something else.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquitted on 1st Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson  
Clinton of perjury, nearing the end of a 13-month drama that 
catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only the second 
presidential impeachment trial in history. The 42nd president was 
poised to finish his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 55-45 to reject the perjury article, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Senate Democrats in acquittal. ``Not 
guilty as charged,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller margin was expected to reject a second article of  
impeachment charging Clinton with obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a  
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton  
guilty or not guilty?'' Rehnquist said to a hushed chamber, 
beginning the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared  
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury were:  
Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of 
Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted 
Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote. Aides  
said he did not watch on television. The final votes were broadcast 
by the networks to a nation long since weary of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott offered Democrats a long-shot  
opportunity to force a discussion of censure immediately after the 
trial ended -- a reminder that even in acquittal Clinton would be 
forever tarnished as the second president in history to be 
impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,  
were opened for a final vote shortly after noon EST, ending a fifth 
week of the trial. Before the votes were taken, the articles of 
impeachment were read for a final time. Lott declared it was time 
for senators to fulfill their ``obligation under the 
Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final outcome of the votes was known for days as five  
moderate Republicans announced in advance that they planned to vote 
against both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors had hoped to attract support from most or all  
the Senate's 55 Republicans, a prospect that faded this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to get beyond an impeachment crisis that paralyzed the  
capital for a year, the president was prepared to make a statement 
about an hour after the verdict, though he wasn't saying whether it 
would be on paper or in person. Clinton leaves Sunday for a trip to 
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Payton's Disease Progressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Walter Payton's liver disease is progressing  
faster than expected, and private planes have been offered to speed 
him to the Mayo Clinic when a transplant becomes available, a 
spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disease is progressing at a faster pace than  
anticipated,'' Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Payton said. She said 
that if the urgency increases he may move up on the waiting list, 
``but he won't be moved up just because he's Walter Payton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to wait his turn just like everybody else,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several friends of the Chicago Bears great have offered their  
company planes so that he won't be bound by airline schedules and 
weather when doctors are ready to give him a new liver, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that starting in three to four weeks the Hall of Fame  
running back will begin wearing a beeper to notify him immediately 
when a donated liver is ready and he must go to the clinic for the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the process that everyone goes through, and it doesn't  
necessarily mean Walter has been put above anybody,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did say that Payton visited the clinic immediately after the  
news conference at which he announced that he is suffering from a 
rare liver disease and would need a transplant. Doctors at that 
time measured the progress of the disease as being faster than what 
they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	She said doctors were not specific about exactly how serious  
Payton's condition had become but that ``they felt it was important 
for Walter to wear the beeper as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Payton was quoted Friday in USA Today as saying  
he remains a ``lean, mean, fightin' machine'' but was having 
trouble sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said the star running back was not available for an  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not feeling well at all today; he didn't sleep last  
night,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> SKorea IOC Member Says Drop Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The highest-ranking Olympic official implicated in  
the Salt Lake City bribery case urged the IOC on Friday to dismiss 
the ``scandalous allegations'' against him and his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, the powerful South Korean executive board member,  
described the ``rumor-mongering'' as a ``personal affront'' to his 
``untarnished reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is deeply saddened by this situation and we hope it  
will be resolved swiftly,'' Kim said in a letter to IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim defended himself in a three-page letter that was also sent  
to members of the IOC panel investigating ethical misconduct during 
Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the letter, signed by Kim's New York attorney, Howard  
Graff, was also faxed to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter made clear that Kim has no intention of resigning and  
will fight his case vigorously, setting the stage for a potentially 
divisive internal battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has been considered a leading aspirant to succeed Samaranch,  
whose term expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Kim's main rivals is Dick Pound, the IOC vice president  
who is leading the internal inquiry into the Salt Lake scandal. 
Three other members of the panel are also seen as presidential 
hopefuls -- Pal Schmitt of Hungary, Thomas Bach of Germany and 
Jacques Rogge of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has claimed the allegations linking him to the biggest  
corruption scandal in Olympic history are part of a political plot 
to smear his name and undermine his presidential chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes, I will fight back,'' he said earlier this  
week. ``I have a lot of ammunition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning Kim, Rogge responded to accusations that the  
inquiry panel was not independent and had political motives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you the entire commission is acting in a very  
objective and neutral way and will only base its judgments on 
irrefutable material evidence,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was one of three members who remained under investigation by  
Pound's panel last month, when nine IOC members resigned or were 
expelled for taking cash, scholarships and excessive gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Thursday that his commission would examine new  
evidence against Kim contained in the Salt Lake City ethics panel 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's report tied Kim's son, John Kim, to a  
telecommunications job directly funded by the Salt Lake City 
Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel said bid committee records show it paid $45,000  
toward the salary of Kim's son to work at Keystone Communications, 
a satellite communications company based in Salt Lake. Keystone's 
former chief executive David Simmons said the bid committee paid 
all of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said bid committee president Tom Welch  
arranged for Kim's son to work for Keystone after Kim sought his 
help. It also said Simmons recalled discussing the deal with Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kim's letter said he and his son were unaware of any  
``secret deal'' between the bid committee and Keystone. Kim claimed 
the Salt Lake report had cleared both him and his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even without meeting with John Kim or reviewing the  
documentation, including pay stubs and canceled checks, the ethics 
commission's conclusions have fully exonerated the Kims,'' the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim called on the IOC panel to ``put an end to the repetition of  
David Simmons' baseless allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The repetition of Mr. Simmons' baseless claims does a  
disservice to the IOC, and is a personal affront to the untarnished 
reputation'' of Kim, the letter said. ``We trust the ad hoc 
commission will not fall victim to the same rumor-mongering that 
has surrounded the reporting of these events to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also said that John Kim's company, Komar  
International, hired Keystone for consulting work in a $40,000 
contract. ``The money was flowing from John Kim, not to him,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1992, Welch told Kim he had paid the first $10,000  
installment to Keystone under Komar's contract and ``John Kim, 
recognizing the impropriety of Mr. Welch having made this payment 
on Komar's behalf, immediately reimbursed Mr. Welch with a 
certified check in this amount, and still has a copy of the 
check,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine IOC members might have broken IOC rules during visits to  
Nagano during the Japanese city's bid for the 1998 Winter Games, 
Japanese Olympic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said a complete report will be sent to IOC headquarters in  
Switzerland by Monday. Names of the IOC members and details of 
their actions were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rogge, who heads the IOC's oversight panel for the 2000  
Olympics, said preparations for the games were being disturbed by 
continuing questions about whether Sydney won the bid fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is creating an uncertainty with the organizing committee  
and its staff, with the athletes, with the government, the sponsors 
and the search for volunteers,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
``It's affecting public opinion and the support of the population. 
We only have 15-16 months until the opening of the games -- that's 
(like) tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he hoped the uncertainty would be put to rest by the  
independent Australian inquiry into the Sydney bid, due to be 
completed by March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rogge said the IOC inquiry panel will consider denials of  
wrongdoing by Phil Coles, the Australian IOC member implicated in 
the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Coles and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala as  
making four visits together, with their families, to the United 
States, in one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted 
by Welch, at a cost of $19,991. Coles said he made only one visit 
to Salt Lake City during the city's candidature, as permitted under 
the IOC's guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he attended the 1995 Super Bowl as a guest of CBS  
with Rick Gentile, the network's vice-president of sports 
production. But Gentile told the Sydney Morning Herald that Coles 
was a guest of Welch and that Gentile didn't even stay for the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Moscow, the Russian Olympic Committee defended Samaranch,  
saying his contributions to the Olympic movement outweighed the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sends Video to Iowa Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican activists who want Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush to run for president don't know yet whether they'll 
have a candidate -- but they do have his video. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has sent videos detailing his accomplishments to activists,  
and when a group of state legislators visited Austin to urge him to 
run, they returned with copies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have mailed them out,'' said veteran Republican activist  
Becky Smith, granddaughter of former Republican National Committee 
head Mary Louise Smith. ``You can also call down and request one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An official close to Bush, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the videos were sent to key donors throughout the nation, 
including key presidential states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and 
California. Video packages also were sent to donors last year, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was just elected to a second term as governor and has  
conceded he is interested in seeking the Republican nomination, but 
he doesn't have plans to visit important early primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of moderate legislators went to Austin to urge Bush to  
enter the race and said they go no commitments but were greeted 
warmly. Most polls have shown Bush atop the field of potential GOP 
candidates, and his name identification is very high. 
</P>
<P>
	The videos includes scenes from Bush's election-night victory  
speech and his inaugural address, as well as interviews he has done 
on television. Seeking to portray the image of a statesman, they 
also includes shots of Bush delivering his State of the State 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is the latest sign that Bush is considering a run and  
is laying the groundwork in Iowa, where precinct caucuses next 
February will launch the nominating season.

<HEADLINE> East Timor To Mull Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian president today called  
on the people of East Timor to choose between autonomy and full 
independence before Indonesia's highest legislative body meets 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie said he hopes the East Timorese people  
will make their wishes for the future of their territory known 
before November, when the People's Consultative Assembly, or MPR, 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll leave it up to the East Timorese people to decide by  
themselves whether to accept ... autonomy or independence,'' 
Habibie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an autonomy offer proposed by Jakarta, East Timor would  
stay part of Indonesia but would enjoy wide powers of self-rule and 
its own flag. The autonomy offer is now the subject of 
U.N.-sponsored negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal, East 
Timor's former colonial ruler. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has said it would consider independence for East Timor  
if its people reject autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie again ruled out the possibility of holding a referendum  
on East Timor's future. Indonesia has consistently warned that a 
direct vote on the issue could ignite violence among rival East 
Timorese groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a vote, Indonesia has favored determining the  
public's preference for autonomy or independence by meeting with 
East Timorese leaders and parties. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Habibie indicated that he favored independence for  
East Timor and said he hoped the issue would be resolved by the 
start of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed East Timorese guerrilla leader Jose Alexandre Xanana  
Gusmao today welcomed Habibie's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is indeed fair, because the time has come for the  
settlement of the East Timor issue,'' said Gusmao. ``I want 
independence for East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting  
Indonesian forces, was transferred from a Jakarta prison to house 
arrest on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is to allow him to assume a greater role in future  
negotiations over the fate of his homeland, which has been wracked 
by guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded in 1975 and declared East Timor its 27th  
province in 1976. Until recently, Indonesia refused to consider 
granting independence to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, its policy softened after former autocratic President  
Suharto, who ordered the invasion 24 years ago, quit power last May 
after riots and protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, has dismantled many  
features of his predecessor's rigid political legacy and has 
scheduled parliamentary elections for June 7.

<HEADLINE> Inventories Unchanged in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A jump in sales helped hold inventories at  
American businesses at modest levels in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean backlogs of unsold goods heading into 1999 could be a good  
portent, analysts say. Inventories that are too big can cause 
production cutbacks as businesses try to sell excess goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests that 1999 will ... likely be very strong,'' said  
Mark Vitner, an economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte, S.C. 
``We know that sales also held up in January, and with inventories 
lean we're also probably going to see some gains in production as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories stayed unchanged, at a seasonally adjusted $1.09  
trillion in December, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was 
the first month with no increase since July, and followed a 
moderate 0.4 percent rise in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sales rose 1 percent, the biggest jump since  
September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, there were enough goods on shelves and backlots in  
December to meet demand for just 1.37 months at the current sales 
pace -- a low hit only twice before since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	At retailers, inventories rose 0.7 percent and sales rose 1  
percent, and at wholesalers, inventories rose 0.5 percent and sales 
rose 1.2 percent. Manufacturers' inventories dropped 0.9 percent, 
in line with an identical 0.9 percent rise in sales.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Wins IROC Opening Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt put his arm around his  
precocious son, doing his best to teach him a racing lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt Jr. had wrecked early in the opening round of the  
International Race of Champions, which his dad went on to win 
Friday at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``What were you doing?'' the elder Earnhardt asked in front of  
cameras as 40,000 fans watched on the track's big-screen monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get to the front,'' his 24-year-old son  
responded, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the lesson that the seven-time Winston Cup champion  
has been teaching other drivers for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It don't pay to get to the front on that lap,'' Earnhardt told  
his son as they stood on pit road. ``You have to wait for the last 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was just that kind of patience that put the elder Earnhardt  
in position to win his eighth IROC race and fifth on the 2 1/2-mile 
Daytona oval. 
</P>
<P>
	From lap 17 until the final turn of the 40th and last lap,  
Earnhardt was tucked in between three-time defending IROC champion 
Mark Martin and Bobby Labonte at the head of the lead draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to make a move off turn two, but Mark was too smart  
for that,'' Earnhardt said. ``Off (turn) four, I tried to get under 
him and he pinched me down. I bumped him a little, got a little 
room, scooted under him and Bobby pushed us by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt finished 0.107-seconds -- about 1 1/2 car-lengths -- ahead  
of Labonte, who nipped Martin for second place by less than 6 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, matching 12 racing all stars in identically prepared  
IROC cars, began with many of the spectators hoping for a 
head-to-head battle between the Earnhardts, whose only previous 
race together was an exhibition last November in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Earnhardt Jr., the defending champion in the NASCAR Busch  
Series, wasn't around for long. 
</P>
<P>
	After some exciting racing in the early going, Earnhardt Jr.  
moved into the lead on lap seven. Two laps later, he trailed Rusty 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leaders approached the first turn, the youngster's car  
slid sideways, slammed into Wallace's car and the two took out 
Indianapolis 500 champion Eddie Cheever, who was also making his 
first IROC start. With white smoke billowing over the track, 
NASCAR's Jeff Burton also got caught in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Caution laps don't count in IROC and when the race resumed at  
the start of lap nine, Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston 
Cup champion, was out front, with CART driver Adrian Fernandez and 
Martin right behind. Earnhardt was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	On lap 17, Martin moved to the front and fellow NASCAR drivers  
Earnhardt and Labonte slipped into second and third a lap later. It 
remained that way until the last turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hoping they'd be patient behind me and they were,''  
Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The runner-up was disappointed he wasn't able to take a shot at  
the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't quite get up to Dale to do what I wanted to and  
then help myself,'' Labonte said. ``I ended up with all my tires on 
the apron, just hanging on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was added to the all-star field this week when CART's Al  
Unser Jr. withdrew after his 12-year-old daughter became ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, who now has a record 33 victories at Daytona,  
averaged 181.178 mph in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Brack, the defending Indy Racing League champion, finished  
fourth in his first IROC start, followed by CART's Greg Moore, 
Gordon, Fernandez, NASCAR's Dale Jarrett, Wallace, Earnhardt Jr., 
Cheever and Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	The next event in the four-race series is April 24 at Talladega  
Superspeedway, with the drivers starting in reverse order of their 
Daytona finish.

<HEADLINE> Ski Company Creates Safety Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. (AP) -- In the past, questions about rude and  
reckless skiers have been answered with claims that skiing isn't as 
dangerous as other sports. Six recent deaths at Colorado ski 
resorts have changed things. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts officials have agreed to keep a closer eye on the  
slopes following the deaths at the four ski areas it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the deaths of two Breckenridge residents in a  
skier-snowboarder collision that hit home for Bill Jensen, chief 
executive of Breckenridge Resort. It was the second fatal collision 
in less than a week at the resort about 80 miles west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do a lot of soul-searching,'' Jensen said Thursday as Vail  
Resorts announced its new safety and courtesy patrol. ``The company 
listens. We do take customer concerns seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Watson, 73, whose leg was smashed three years ago by a  
hit-and-run skier, said the crackdown ``is incredible. I think it's 
the only way for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you pick up the paper somebody has hit a tree,  
usually because they were trying to avoid somebody,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the recent deaths resulted from skiers hitting trees.  
The others followed collisions, which national studies say normally 
account for 5 percent or less of ski and snowboard deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Those deaths, combined with a public call for safer skiing,  
drove Vail to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts President Andy Daly said Vail officials began a  
crackdown on ski safety last year on Vail Mountain, lifting a 
record number of lift tickets and season passes from skiers and 
snowboarders who ignored requests to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new patrol will be independent of the Ski Patrol,  
whose members have their hands full treating injured skiers and 
overseeing overall slope safety, from avalanche dangers to rocky 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the new patrollers ``won't be the speed police.'' If a  
run is empty and not marked for slow skiing, there will be no speed 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The patrollers will keep a record of accidents, incidents and  
confrontations with each guest, just as police do with traffic 
offenders, so they can get bad apples off the hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of Vail Resorts' mountains -- Vail, Breckenridge, Beaver  
Creek and Keystone -- will appoint a safety-courtesy supervisor. 
Five slow-skiing zones have already been set up at Breckenridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen said reckless and rude skiers and snowboarders are ``not  
just a Breckenridge problem ... We are seeing it all over the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern New England, where ski deaths are rare, four over  
three days last month raised questions about safety on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, though overall ski injuries have declined in recent  
years with the introduction of better equipment, serious injuries, 
including those resulting in paralysis and comas, were up 
substantially the last two ski seasons, the National Ski Areas 
Association said.

<HEADLINE> Jones Disappointed With Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CABOT, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones, whose sexual harassment lawsuit  
began the scandal that ended with Friday's impeachment vote, said 
she was disappointed the Senate did not remove President Clinton 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy, you know, for sure,'' Mrs. Jones told Fox News  
outside a school where she picked up her children. ``I just 
expected it because he gets away with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones sued Clinton on May 6, 1994, alleging he  
propositioned her at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock three years 
earlier, when she was a state worker and he was Arkansas' governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was later thrown out, and Mrs. Jones and Clinton  
settled for $850,000. But the House impeached Clinton on charges 
that he obstructed justice and committed perjury in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones had moved to California after leaving her job at a  
state economic office, but she is moving back to Arkansas to be 
closer to family and friends.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls on Overshpply Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures tumbled Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade,  
falling to their lowest in five months amid concern that already 
weak U.S. export prospects will dim even further as foreign 
competitors offer cheaper wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also retreated. On other markets, silver  
futures rose sharply, as did platinum and palladium. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures have been under heavy selling pressure this year  
as some of the top buyers of the grain, including Egypt and 
Pakistan, continually turn to Australia or European wheat exporters 
for their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	With American inventories remaining near their highest in eight  
years, market participants say prices must go lower to be able to 
compete effectively for business that has been affected by a global 
economic crisis. Some analysts also said wheat must go lower to 
become more attractive for domestic users as an animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also were pressured by beneficial moisture in  
winter wheat growing regions. The winter wheat crop accounts for 
nearly 75 percent of the nation's total wheat production, and 
investors are watching its growth period carefully for signs that 
the harvest will be smaller than normal. That might ease the 
pressure caused by large inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn retreated on the weakness in the wheat market and amid the  
start of harvesting in Argentina, which was expected to bring ample 
supplies of competing product to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans continued their retreat in a market that has had few  
good things to consider. American farmers this spring are expected 
to plant near-record acreage to soybeans, while Brazil is close to 
harvesting a near-record crop that will compete for some of the 
weakest export business in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.57 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1 cent to $2.15 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 cents to 
$4.92 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures jumped to their highest in nearly seven months on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange as the cost of borrowing the 
metal, called lease rates, soared to their highest in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp run-up in lease rates -- as much as 8 percent -- signals  
there is heavy demand from the jewelry and photography industries. 
It also could mark the return of investor interest in the metal, 
which has been on the decline for close to a year, after 
billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company revealed it 
had purchased 20 percent of the world's supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett at the time was betting silver prices would continue to  
rise sharply, but buying from India, the world's largest consumer, 
dried up in the face of those steep prices. 
</P>
<P>
	March silver rose 9.7 cents to $5.66 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Platinum and palladium also rose sharply on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange in the face of continued shipping delays from 
Russia, which is the world's largest producer of palladium and 
second-largest producer of platinum behind South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	April platinum rose $6 to $370.60 an ounce; March palladium rose  
$3.50 to $357.50 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Set To Become a Lobbyist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though he is leaving the House at the end of  
the month, Rep. Bob Livingston will not be gone for long: He plans 
to lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, R-La., was set to become speaker of the House  
following the departure of Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. But two days 
after he admitted to having extramarital affairs, Livingston 
announced he would quit Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving office Feb. 28, he plans to set up his own  
lobbying shop, affiliated with the firm of Jones, Walker, Waechter, 
Poitevent, Carrere &AMP; Denegre, officials close to the Louisiana 
Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm is based in New Orleans but has a Washington  
office. Its clients include the First National Bank of Commerce, 
the Port of New Orleans and Tyson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston's announcement Dec. 19 that he would resign rather  
than stand for speaker shocked his colleagues, who at the time were 
debating the articles of impeachment against President Clinton. 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., eventually was elected speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	As former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which  
writes federal spending bills, Livingston should have little 
trouble attracting blue-ribbon clients, said Charles Lewis, 
director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington watchdog 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the committee he served on, he will instantly  
command big bucks and remarkable access,'' Lewis said. ``This 
firm's going to shoot out of the box real fast. There aren't too 
many would-be speakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in office, Livingston, a defense hawk, received more  
financial support for his campaign committee and political action 
committee from defense companies than any other source, even though 
his Louisiana district has no major Pentagon installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston is the latest of a number of high-powered lawmakers  
who recently left Capitol Hill to become lobbyists. Though they 
will not be able to lobby their former colleagues for a year, they 
can offer advice and guidance to their new clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon of New  
York opened his own firm, affiliated with the lobbying shop headed 
by former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada. Another New York Republican, 
Bill Paxon, former chairman of the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, joined the powerhouse lobbying firm of 
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford, D-Ky., joined the firm  
of Dickstein Shapiro Morin &AMP; Oshinsky, home to former GOP Rep. Stan 
Parris of Virginia and former Democratic Sen. Joseph Tydings of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio of California  
is now one of two partners running the Washington office of Clark &AMP; 
Weinstock. The other is former Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who began 
the Washington operation after he retired in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Appeal State Farm Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A lawyer for six people in a  
class-action lawsuit accusing State Farm Insurance Co. of 
fraudulent sales practices said Friday he will appeal a $238 
million settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, State Farm would make varying payments --  
averaging about $1,300 -- to every one of the 3 million customers 
represented by the class action. However, those entitled to a 
larger award must undergo what lawyer Kenneth Nelson described as a 
confusing claim process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that will have the effect of discriminating against  
policy holders who are poor, disabled, elderly, unsophisticated -- 
in other words, the easiest targets for fraud,'' said Nelson, of 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Any appeal would only serve to stall State Farm's payments, said  
Tom Schneider, a State Farm lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean County Judge Ronald Dozier approved the settlement on  
Thursday. The lawsuit contended that State Farm cheated people 
while selling them whole life and universal life insurance policies 
from January 1982 to December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, State Farm agreed to settle the lawsuit in order to  
avoid a protracted trial. In Thursday's agreement, the company does 
not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Each member of the class will get the initial payment. Others  
who allege they are entitled to more must apply to an independent 
company. That neutral firm will determine the size of the 
additional award using an intricate scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, State Farm expects as few as 5 percent of those  
eligible for a larger award will apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, of the 3 million, only a handful  
are going to actually follow the claim relief procedure,'' said 
Robert Cummins, a Chicago lawyer who also objects to the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's only if the folks step through the hoops correctly.  
But my goodness, the folks in the complaints are elderly, 
unsophisticated people,'' Cummins said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is common for complicated, legalistic notices to deter  
members of a class-action from filing for a claim, said Robert 
Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a big, 65-page document, or 50 pages or something, and  
it's just incredibly intimidating,'' Hunter said. ``First of all, 
are you going to read it? And if you are, can you understand it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused State Farm of duping policy holders to  
switch policies and lose value; promising unrealistic returns on 
cash value policies; inflating dividend projections; and soliciting 
sales by referring to life insurance policies as ``investments'' 
and ``retirement plans.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Lets Currency Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The central bank let Ecuador's currency  
float freely Friday, eliminating the set band within which the 
sucre could be traded, in order to protect its foreign reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the move caused the value of the sucre to tumble 9  
percent from 7,300 to the dollar at Thursday's closing to 8,000 in 
early trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sucre rallied, finishing the day at 7,494 to the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	Most traders had not expected such a quick recovery, and will  
likely remain very cautious about the sucre when markets open again 
Wednesday after a four-day weekend, said Carlos Andrade, a trader 
with the brokerage firm Produbanco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measure is designed to give security to the internal  
market and respond to the needs of the national economy,'' said 
Central Bank President Luis Jacome. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank had spent $60 million of its reserves this week  
defending the sucre's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank will continue to intervene in the foreign  
exchange market to protect the sucre against speculators, but ``in 
a more limited fashion'' than before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts expect the sucre's value to fall.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is not so much a flotation of the sucre, but  
a hidden devaluation which the government does not want to admit,'' 
said economist Luis Villacis. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the economic uncertainty in Ecuador, one of Latin  
America's smallest economies, was Finance Minister Fidel 
Jaramillo's resignation late Thursday.

	Ecuador was plagued by a massive budget deficit and Latin

<HEADLINE> 49ers Trade Barker, Smith to Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Defensive end Roy Barker and tight  
end Irv Smith, both key players for the San Francisco 49ers last 
season, were traded Friday to the Cleveland Browns for unspecified 
past considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the team said the past considerations involved  
the Browns' selection of cornerback Antonio Langham in Tuesday's 
expansion draft, relieving the 49ers of a free-agent bust and a $3 
million salary cap liability. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that the Browns also are interested in  
trading for quarterback Ty Detmer, who spent last season backing up 
Steve Young and led the 49ers to a win over Carolina in his only 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, a seven-year pro who spent two seasons in Philadelphia  
as a starter, is coveted by Cleveland because he could help tutor 
Tim Couch if the Browns take the Kentucky star with their first 
draft pick. He also could be used as a starter until Couch was 
ready to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer has a no-trade clause in his contract with the 49ers but  
the Browns have received permission to discuss a new deal for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker and Smith provide potential building blocks on both sides  
of the ball for the Browns and their departure gives San Francisco 
additional financial maneuverability. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were in danger of being released because of San  
Francisco's cap constraints before being dealt to the Browns, who 
begin play later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker has a '99 cap figure of $2.5 million and Smith costs $1.2  
million against the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker had 12 sacks last season, his third with San Francisco  
since joining the team as a free agent after spending his first 
four years with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was signed prior to last season as a free agent. He was  
projected as a backup to Greg Clark but wound up starting eight 
games due to injuries to Clark. Smith, who played six years for New 
Orleans before joining the 49ers, had 24 catches for 259 yards and 
a career-high five touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Woes Mount for New Washington Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel, Washington's new football coach,  
finds himself with more problems -- breaking another NCAA rule by 
playing an informal basketball game with recruit Domynic Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-10 Conference will look into the new allegation against  
Neuheisel, who confirmed he played Shaw in a game of 3-point 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under NCAA rules, the ``game'' was considered a tryout.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a cornerback, was declared ineligible last week by the  
Huskies -- along with four other signees -- after they were visited 
by Washington assistants when the coaches weren't supposed to be in 
recruits' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	All five players are expected to be reinstated by the NCAA.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington president Richard McCormick was upset by Neuheisel's  
latest problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're never satisfied with having the University of Washington  
in violation of NCAA regulations,'' McCormick told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer. ``It is a matter of considerable concern. We 
take great pride in the integrity of Husky athletics. It's not a 
satisfying situation. It doesn't fundamentally diminish my 
confidence in Rick Neuheisel or (UW athletic director) Barbara 
Hedges, but I don't mind saying they (the Pac-10) and I both are 
disappointed by the current situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hedges hired Neuheisel to replace the fired Jim Lambright on  
Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick, on his own, told me about this,'' Hedges said. ``He  
wanted to make sure there aren't any issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time (Neuheisel) shot baskets with Domynic Shaw, there  
was no intent on his part to violate the tryout rule. He was not 
doing it with the purpose of evaluating Domynic's athletic 
ability.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Punter Tom Tupa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Punter Tom Tupa, an 11-year veteran in the NFL,  
agreed Friday to a contract with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also will consider using Tupa as its backup  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupa has a 45.5-yard career average with the Phoenix Cardinals,  
Indianapolis Colts, Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots. He 
averaged 44.5 yards last season for New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupa, 33, joined the Patriots in 1996, when the team was coached  
by Bill Parcells, now coach of the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It addresses what I feel was one of our primary needs,''  
Parcells said. ``He has punted at a consistent level for the last 
four years, and our coaching staff is pleased to be reunited with 
him again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets used three punters last season: John Kidd, Nick Gallery  
and Brian Hansen. Kidd did the best with a 41.6 gross average in 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupa's signing could indicate that Parcells is ready to dump  
Glenn Foley as backup quarterback. Foley was not protected in the 
expansion draft, but the Cleveland Browns did not select him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupa has completed 252 of 491 passes for 3,256 yards, with 10  
touchdowns and 24 interceptions. Parcells likes the idea of one 
player who can fill two needs.

<HEADLINE> Weary Nation Welcomes the End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Americans sounded a collective ``whew'' Friday at the end of  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, a saga that many said cost 
too much, hurt too many and trivialized the government and the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The same phrases emerged in dozens of interviews across the  
land: ``Waste of money.'' ``Disgusting.'' ``The media made too much 
of it.'' ``Ready for it to be over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In White Plains, N.Y., people were so sick of it that they  
wouldn't talk about being sick of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hallelujah. We have to get on with our lives,'' exulted Margit  
Noro of Harrisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, Clinton's acquittal on perjury and obstruction of  
justice charges was the correct and welcome outcome. Others 
lamented a nation and a process that, they said, could officially 
excuse a leader's lying and immoral conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was no moon landing or O.J. Simpson verdict. Few seemed  
glued to their televisions. In fact, few seemed to care much at 
all. They knew it was going to be over and they knew how it was 
going to turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched it faithfully at the beginning. I got tired,'' said  
Joyce Bishop, 67, of Jacksonville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our concerns can be diverted like this for a whole year,  
then you know something is not right,'' said Rose Fitzgibbon, 55, 
Portland, Ore., who was relieved at acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans said the acquittal represented business as usual  
for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's given people in government another reason they  
can go on doing basically what they're doing -- that is, lie, cheat 
and steal,'' said Ron Juhas, reading a paper during his lunch hour 
Friday in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truth is no longer a priority in this country,'' said Beth  
Nichols of Olympia, Wash., as she waited at a Southwest Airlines 
gate in the Oklahoma City airport. ``It's a sad, sad day. Our 
senators don't have the courage to uphold truth as a standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few defended Clinton or doubted he did something wrong. The  
question, they said, was whether guilt was proved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as bad as the O.J. Simpson trial,'' said Bill Ott, 56,  
of St. Louis, who works in electronics. ``We all know O.J. was 
guilty. We all know Clinton is guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other voices:  
</P>
<P>
	--On the Republicans: ``They wanted to play politics at the  
population's expense,'' said Reynold Lewis, a mechanic at Camp 
Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C., who is himself a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Kenneth Starr: ``The fact that they spent so much money to  
find out the guy had oral sex is pretty ridiculous,'' said Roark 
Birsner, 23, a student at West Virginia University. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Clinton's place in history: ``He's already marked,'' said  
Terryl Huyck, who works at a gift shop in Sioux Falls, S.D. ``It 
won't make a difference how good he was in a lot of areas. This one 
poor choice, unfortunately, will be his hallmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On what a guilty verdict would have done: ``I do not believe  
the country would have fallen apart if he would have been 
convicted,'' said Joan Buhrmann, a retired homemaker from Martell, 
Neb. ``Our nation is much bigger than one man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On the private vs. the public: ``We're all entitled to our  
privacy,'' said Bob Hyland, 53, of White Plains, an insurance 
salesman. ``But I don't think it was appropriate for him to conduct 
his personal affair where he did, in the White House, the house we 
gave him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, finally, what happens now?  
</P>
<P>
	``I know there was another impeachment 150 years ago, but I  
don't know what that was about,'' said Millard Reeves, 35, drinking 
a cup of coffee in Philadelphia. ``I think it's going to be the 
same thing with this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Moore, a 26-year-old consultant from New York City,  
said: ``I think people may say he was a good president, but they 
will always put a `but' there.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Primed To Acquit Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirteen months after the name Monica Lewinsky  
rattled the White House, senators are primed to acquit Bill Clinton 
and end the second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. 
But senators appear far less willing to forgive Clinton for 
concealing an extramarital affair from the nation and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's historic votes on two articles of impeachment charging  
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice complete a drama 
that has riveted official Washington, roiled a midterm 
congressional election and worn out the patience of the American 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	And it has caused Clinton, and the presidency, incalculable  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's self-indulgent actions were immoral,  
disgraceful, reprehensible,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. 
``History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that William 
Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office in our 
American democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah predicted that Clinton's  
concealment of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, which grew out of the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, would forever tar him as 
``the most accomplished, polished liar we've ever had serving in 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After another morning of closed-door deliberations, senators  
were to vote in public today on the impeachment articles, possibly 
around noon. With four Republican senators saying they would vote 
to acquit, it was possible that the articles would not even attract 
a simple majority in a chamber where the GOP holds a 55-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, would not remain without troubles: He could  
face indictment, while in office or after his term, by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, and must finish his remaining months in 
office facing a GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him evicted 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes cap a five-week trial that featured for the first time  
videotaped testimony on the Senate floor and provided the world its 
first good look at Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A 
national TV audience was able to watch as 13 House impeachment 
managers, all Republicans, argued that Clinton deserved to be 
thrown out of office, while White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings;  
furtive gropings and sex acts between the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky near the Oval Office; late night phone calls between the 
president and the intern; and, most damning for Clinton, a stained 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Starr's findings, the House approved one article of  
impeachment accusing the president of lying to a federal grand jury 
on Aug. 17, 1998, about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The second charge said Clinton obstructed justice by trying to  
have Ms. Lewinsky sign a false affidavit in the Jones case; by a 
job search conducted by presidential friend Vernon Jordan; by the 
retrieval of presidential gifts by Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie; and the alleged ``coaching'' of Mrs. Currie by the 
president for her grad jury appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators said it was their constitutional duty to proceed with a  
trial, even though from the beginning there were doubts that the 
two-thirds vote required to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office would materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of closed-door deliberations this week, senators  
denounced Clinton's conduct ``over and over again from both sides 
of the aisle,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and Republicans alike said the votes were not  
there for conviction. Bennett, for one, has joined a 
Democratic-sponsored initiative to have the Senate pass a strong 
resolution of censure immediately after Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist gavels the trial to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters agree the resolution is ailing because of  
stiff Republican opposition, and the pro-censure senators may have 
to settle for a statement denouncing the president's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joined three  
GOP senators who previously announced their decisions against 
removing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``After due consideration, I am persuaded that the president's  
wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by the criminal 
justice system,'' she said. ``And I am further persuaded that 
future presidents and future generations can be effectively 
deterred from such wrongdoing by this impeachment and that 
potential prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of  
Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania previously came out 
against conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began private deliberations on Tuesday, and by Thursday  
night they were holding news conferences and issuing written 
statements to announce their votes and explain their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not any senator in this chamber nor any person in this  
country, will look at this president in the same way again,'' 
Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that the president abused his sacred power by lying and  
obstructing justice,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``How can 
parents instill values and morality in their children? if Clinton 
isn't removed, he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore: ``There can be no doubt that  
President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of his 
words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to 
our culture and to our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate trial began Jan. 7. Inside the tradition-steeped  
Senate chamber, where the only other presidential impeachment trial 
was held in 1868 in the case of Andrew Johnson, senators conducted 
the case with decorum and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	Just outside the chamber, where microphones and television  
cameras were permanently stationed, partisan sparks flew as they 
had all through the House proceedings. Most Republicans scarcely 
tried to hide their eventual conclusions that Clinton should be 
removed from office. Democrats expressed outrage that concealing an 
affair warranted overturning a presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped After 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Policeman Edward Gorwell's case dragged on for  
six years after the night he fatally shot a 14-year-old boy in the 
back, allegedly in self-defense. Now, it may be over -- a new 
forensics test shows Gorwell may have been telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning turnaround, prosecutors dropped the manslaughter  
charge against Gorwell on Thursday, when jury selection in his 
trial was supposed to start, because a new gunshot residue test 
bolstered his version of the shooting of Simmont Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors left open the possibility of introducing new  
charges if the new test results are not supported in a laboratory 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had caused racial tension in Baltimore. Gorwell is  
white; Thomas was black. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first trial, which ended in a mistrial in August 1993  
when a juror was dismissed for showing up late for deliberations, 
Gorwell testified he thought he was returning fire when he shot 
Thomas. But police found no weapons in the area and a residue test 
done at the time showed Thomas did not fire at Gorwell. 
</P>
<P>
	But a firearms technician told an assistant prosecutor Thursday  
that he used a newer, more sensitive machine that found gunpowder 
particles on the swabs taken from Thomas' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the presence of gunpowder residue was found on the  
teen-ager's left hand. Thomas was left-handed, defense lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were prepared to proceed on the case this morning, and we  
were surprised a new test had been done,'' said Patricia Jessamy, 
the Baltimore state's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Technician Daniel Van Gelder had done the test on his own, she  
said. He did not return a call Thursday from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test was done with an electron microscope that the  
department installed in 1997, four years after Gorwell's first 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped the manslaughter charge after the judge  
refused to grant a postponement. They will wait for a private 
laboratory in Pennsylvania to review the gunshot residue evidence 
before deciding how to proceed, Ms. Jessamy said. That test could 
be done as soon as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorwell's lawyer, Kimberly Alley, said she was glad the case  
appeared to be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We prayed to God for it to end,'' Ms. Alley said. ``Six years  
is far, far too long for a time to sit around and wait for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' family, though, was flabbergasted the charges were  
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shocked the hell out of me,'' Thomas' mother, Myra Green,  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a gunshot and residue on my son's hand, can a  
dead man hide a gun? Can a dead man hide a gun? That's my 
question,'' said Thomas' stepfather, Dennis Green.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Unseasonably warm weather draped itself along the East Coast  
early today ahead of a powerful storm system. Rain was spreading 
toward the Gulf Coast as another round of rain and mountain snow 
aimed at the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Balmy temperatures were forecast from northern New England into  
the Carolinas, but the heat was ushering in a line of showers and 
heavy thunderstorms up and down the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsettled weather lingered from the Great Lakes into the lower  
Mississippi and Ohio valleys, with a chance of light snow forecast 
around the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was in the forecast from Tennessee into Mississippi and  
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Quiet weather conditions should prevail across much of the West,  
with partly cloudy skies forecast from the cold northern Plains 
into the Rockies, abundant sunshine in California and breezy 
conditions in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Another storm system was gearing up to lash the Pacific  
Northwest, with rain likely across Washington and Oregon. The 
heaviest rainfall was possible along the coast, and flooding could 
be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy wind-whipped snow was likely above 3,000 feet in the  
Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee recorded a high of 68 degrees Thursday, a stormy day  
but the city's warmest in February since record-keeping began in 
1871. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's hot spot Thursday in the lower 48 states was  
McAllen, Texas, with a high of 87. The coldest place was 
Yellowstone Lake, Wyo., with a low of 23 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today should range from the teens and 20s around the  
western Great Lakes into the 80s in Florida, with readings into the 
30s for the inter-Mountain region; the 40s in the Mississippi 
Valley, the Midwest and Northwest; the 50s across the southern 
Plains and Gulf Coast; 50s and 60s for the Northeast; and 70s in 
the Carolinas, Southern California and the Southwest.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Edwards To Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New England Patriots running back Robert Edwards  
will miss the 1999 season after injuring his knee during a beach 
flag football game, the team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a rookie who rushed for 1,115 yards this season,  
dislocated his left knee on Feb. 5 while playing in a Pro Bowl 
weekend event on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. He was released from a 
hospital in Hawaii on Thursday and was examined Friday by team 
doctors in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious knee injury,'' Dr. Bertram Zarins, the  
team doctor, said in a statement. ``He will definitely miss the 
1999 season. His ability to play football again will depend upon 
the recovery of the nerve function and will require extensive 
rehabilitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in Hawaii, Edwards had surgery to repair damage done to an  
artery in his left leg. On Friday, the results of an MRI -- magnetic 
resonance imagaing -- scan confirmed that the knee dislocation had 
torn three of the four major knee ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of nerve damage, Edwards is unable to move his foot,  
Zarins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards is scheduled to have surgery on Tuesday in Boston. The  
surgery is to repair damaged ligaments and assess the extent of 
nerve damage to his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a devastating blow to a young man who was just at the  
beginning of a very promising professional career,'' Patriots coach 
Pete Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a Patriots first-round draft pick, was hurt in the  
``Rookie Beach Bowl'' one of the activities leading up to Sunday's 
Pro Bowl. Edwards wasn't on the AFC team, but went to Hawaii to 
play in the beach football game and participate in other Pro Bowl 
functions.

<HEADLINE>  Elder Wins Race Full of Big Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Fourteen rookies and 13 drivers had  
never raced at Daytona's fast oval before the NASCAR Goody's Dash 
Series race. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian Elder avoided a pair of multiple-car crashes to win  
the Discount Auto Parts 200 on Friday. The race included three red 
flags, seven caution periods, 57 minutes in delays and one 
spectacular wreck that flipped a car eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder, a part-time driver on the series from Minneapolis, beat  
Robert Huffman for a 3.254-second victory after a restart with 
three laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder earned $11,550 for taking the checkered flag, although all  
21 drivers who finished with their cars running must have felt like 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a pretty good number of rookies in the field and a  
pretty good number of rookie crew chiefs,'' Elder said. ``When you 
combine those two, you're asking for trouble and we had trouble 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three drivers were hospitalized, two with broken legs and the  
other with a minor neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, normally completed in about 90 minutes, took almost  
three hours. Just 22 laps into the 80-lap race, accidents had 
knocked out 20 of the 42 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I watched some tapes and thought I realized what it  
took to survive this race,'' said Derrick Kelley, who was involved 
in one of the big wrecks. ``I think some of those guys need to 
watch some of those tapes, watch those wrecks and realize how these 
cars bump together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic accident, however, was a one-car affair.  
</P>
<P>
	Heading toward the start-finish line with just four laps left,  
Danny Bagwell lost control. His Ford barrel-rolled eight times 
before coming to a stop in the apron, with every piece of sheet 
metal sheared off the body by the time it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	He crawled out of the shell and waited for a stretcher to arrive  
as the 40,000 fans cheered. He was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, involving younger drivers in four- and six-cylinder  
subcompacts, is normally plagued by accidents, yet this one still 
stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elder didn't feel there were any fundamental problems with  
the drivers or cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``For three years here, I've seen rollover accidents; I've seen  
people try to knock down the fences,'' he said. ``But I've seen 
everyone get out and walk away. I think the cars are OK.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 88.57 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Friday, as technology shares  
continued to set the course for the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks tumbled after analysts warned that Dell  
Computer's sales growth may be slowing. By the end of the day, the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market composite index had fallen 
83.66 points to 2,321.89 in its fourth-biggest point loss ever. The 
fall nearly erased Thursday's 96-point record point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.57 points to close at  
9,274.89. The blue-chip index ended the week 29.35 points, or 0.3 
percent, lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The market closed out a volatile week in which technology shares  
experienced the sharpest dips and rallies. For the week, the Nasdaq 
composite gave up 51.73 points, a drop of 2.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an on-again, off-again market,'' said Hugh Johnson,  
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The emotional 
swings in the market are extraordinary,'' he said. ``It's a 
hair-trigger environment. One thing can throw everything off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the catalyst was Dell Computer, which came under  
selling pressure after BancBoston Robertson Stephens and Salomon 
Smith Barney warned of slowing sales growth due to increasing 
competition from other computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, which will report its earnings on Tuesday, fell 11 15/16  
to close at 91 3/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell dragged shares of other computer makers lower as well.  
Compaq Computer fell 1 13/16 to close at 43, and IBM, a component 
of the Dow, fell 5 3/4 to close at 172 3/4. Both trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer makers weren't the only technology sector to  
falter. Makers of software and modems, as well as the increasingly 
volatile Internet companies, were all lower as they continued to 
set the pace for the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney  
Montgomery Scott, said the market has ``been jittery throughout the 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp selloff in bonds has also weighed on the stock market.  
The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 5.42 percent Friday from 
5.30 percent Thursday as a government auction overwhelmed customer 
demand for the new securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think bonds are really the focal point for the market,''  
Peroni said. ``There's a concern that higher interest rates could 
hamper corporate profits over the next quarter or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of higher interest rates kept the banking and  
financial sectors mostly lower Friday Chase Manhattan fell 2 1/16 
to 74 1/16, BankAmerica dropped 2 1/16 to 62 7/8, and Bank One lost 1 3/4 
to 49 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was virtually unmoved by the U.S. Senate's vote to  
acquit President Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. The verdict in the case, only the second presidential 
impeachment trial in U.S. history, was largely expected. Analysts 
said traders appeared to set the course early and shrugged off the 
outcome of the historic vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 824.06 million shares, down from 972.51 
million shares on Thursday. Many market players got an early start 
on the three-day weekend to observe Presidents' Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 23.91 at 1,230.13, the  
NYSE composite index was down 8.28 at 581.46, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.29 at 696.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.15 percent,  
Germany's DAX index gave up some of its early gains to finish 0.6 
percent higher, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.1 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 fell 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested in $1M Armored Car Heist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- An armored car company employee was arrested with  
two other men early Friday in a $1 million heist after one of the 
robbery victims recognized him as a co-worker, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't take very long to solve this,'' Police Chief Benny  
Napoleon said. ``This was a stupid type of robbery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The robbery took place Thursday morning when a Total Armored Car  
Service courier went into a White Castle restaurant to pick up 
receipts. A gunman opened the passenger door with a key and forced 
the driver out. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were able to use video surveillance images from  
the White Castle to identify suspects, and one of the men assigned 
to the armored car thought one of the robbers was a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers arrested the three men at a house in Detroit and found  
nearly all the money in a different house. No names were released.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals, Renteria OK $1.9M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals and new shortstop Edgar  
Renteria agreed to a one-year contract worth $1,975,000 and avoided 
a salary arbitration hearing set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria's new salary is more than seven times the $255,000 he  
made last season. He had asked for $2.45 million in arbitration and 
had been offered $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, he would earn a $25,000 bonus if  
he has 625 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis acquired Renteria, 23, in December in a trade that  
sent three minor-leaguers to the Florida Marlins. Renteria is a 
career .288 hitter who stole 41 bases last season. He is expected 
to bat leadoff this season for St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria was the Marlins only representative in last year's  
All-Star game and ended the 1997 Series with a two-out single off 
Cleveland's Charles Nagy in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 
7, giving Florida a 3-2 victory.

<HEADLINE> Lyons' Asst. Takes Blame for Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A secretary for the Rev. Henry Lyons told  
jurors Friday she accidentally sent a letter to the Anti-Defamation 
League indicating he'd distributed $225,000 the group gave him to 
help burned black churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, is  
accused of stealing the money. Prosecutors say he deposited $60,000 
in his personal bank account, gave $12,000 to his wife, sent checks 
to love interests, paid his credit card and redecorated his house. 
</P>
<P>
	ADL officials testified earlier in Lyons' grand theft and  
racketeering trial that he sent them a letter saying he had given 
the money to six burned churches and needed more money. They sent 
another $19,500 before learning only a fraction of the money had 
been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just so new at that time,'' Deborah Blake, a secretary  
for the black church organization, testified Friday. Lyons, she 
said, had dictated the letter while he was out of town and she 
typed it up, stamped his name to it and mailed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' lawyers maintain he had planned to distribute the money,  
but first was researching where it should go. But before he could, 
the defense contends, prosecutors began investigating his finances. 
Money that never went to churches was repaid to the ADL.

<HEADLINE> Former NFL Player Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMERON PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A former NFL lineman convicted of  
killing four people in Florida -- and a member of a notorious 1980s 
sect -- was arrested and charged with writing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Rozier, a former University of California defensive end  
who played six games for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1979, was being 
held without bail Thursday at the El Dorado County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	El Dorado County Sheriff's Detective Tony Campagna said Rozier,  
who gave the name Robert Rameses when arrested, was a member of a 
1980s sect founded by Yahweh ben Yahweh that is believed to be 
responsible for 14 killings and a series of firebombings in the 
Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real unusual, like nothing I've ever seen,'' Campagna  
said. ``Once he gave up his real name and said he was in the 
federal witness program, we ran his criminal history and, lo and 
behold, we came up with the convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing commercial burglary charges for allegedly writing bad  
checks totaling $125.24 to video and auto parts stores in Cameron 
Park, Rozier has been designated for prosecution under California's 
``three strikes'' law. If convicted, he would be subject to a 
sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozier, 43, who according to media reports in the 1980s adopted  
the name Neariah Israel -- ``Child of God'' -- and claimed to be 404 
years old, was charged with committing four murders under the 
orders of the Yahweh cult. 
</P>
<P>
	Campagna said Rozier, who admitted to a total of seven killings,  
was sentenced to 22 years in prison, but was released after five 
years when he testified against Yahweh and other followers in the 
so-called ``Temple of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he was released on probation from an undisclosed prison,  
he relocated last summer to the rural northern California county, 
near Sacramento, where he grew up.

<HEADLINE> Group of 15 Wants Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Leaders of developing nations on  
Friday called for restrictions on currency speculators and huge 
multinationals to prevent them from wreaking havoc on small 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yearning for a stronger voice on the world stage, the diverse  
nations of the Group of 15 meeting in Jamaica agreed that a more 
humane financial world order was needed to prevent a few rich 
players from getting richer at the expense of hundreds of millions 
of poor people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been reminded of the spread of the consequences of the  
process of globalization in a world that has become increasingly 
cold and heartless,'' Jamaica's Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said 
in closing the summit of the G-15 -- which actually has 17 members 
and represents about 30 percent of the world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of a summit dominated by bitterness over the dark  
side of globalization, the leaders declared that the fallout from 
Southeast Asia's financial crisis shows that industrialized nations 
must address the developing world's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-15 leaders emphasized their commitment to free trade, but  
they said it must be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's crisis ``did not stem from resistance of the affected  
economies to a globalizing world ... (but) our failure to manage 
the integration,'' said Indonesia's economy minister, Ginandjar 
Kartasasmita. 
</P>
<P>
	The diversity of interests of the G-15 -- which includes Brazil,  
Mexico, India and Egypt -- was reflected in a statement at the end 
of the three-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It called for:  
</P>
<P>
	-- International rules to monitor large financial players,  
especially hedge funds and currency speculators blamed in part for 
the Asian crisis. The suggested measures fell short of Malaysian 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's calls for an international 
regulating body. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Social safety nets'' in development policies and programs to  
meet the needs of the poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Speedy implementation of initiatives by the Group of Eight  
industrialized nations and the European Union to forgive the debts 
of the poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Urgent programs to fight increasing poverty and unemployment  
``as a means for ensuring international peace and stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Opposing ``disguised protectionist measures'' by  
industrialized nations and the use of trade sanctions to achieve 
environmental objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Resisting ``unilateral measures with extra-territorial  
effects'' -- an apparent reference to the U.S. economic embargo 
against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A comprehensive international convention to combat terrorism.  
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also called for more dialogue with the G-8 to change  
policies at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which 
they said reacted too late and with too little aid to the Asian 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing nations say the institutions, whose loans are tied to  
stringent measures that often hit the poorest hardest, should offer 
more flexible lending packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was agreed to by senior ministers from all the  
participating countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, 
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, 
Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Commit Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce Saturday the  
United States is prepared to contribute ground troops to a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo if Serbs and ethnic Albanians agree to 
a political settlement, a senior administration official said 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will discuss his plans in his Saturday radio address,  
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, hinted at Clinton's decision. ``There's going to be a 
serious announcement by the president on Kosovo ... what we're 
going to do,'' Warner said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said he had talked with Pentagon officials and Senate  
colleagues, and that the Senate would be supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Warner's comment, National Security Council  
spokesman David Leavy said Clinton, in his radio address, would 
``continue his conversation with the American people about the U.S. 
national interests and the stakes in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision to send U.S. troops would depend upon Serbs and  
ethnic Albanians reaching an agreement to end their fighting, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties have an informal deadline of Feb. 20 for reaching an  
accord and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is flying toy 
Paris on Saturday to assess peace talks between the two sides. 
Officials said it was not a foregone conclusion that there would be 
a settlement despite the threat of NATO military intervention if 
one isn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depending on the character and composition of a political  
settlement, the president is prepared to contribute U.S. ground 
forces to a potential implementation force,'' the senior 
administration official said. Some reports have suggested as many 
as 4,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said earlier Friday that the United States  
would send 2,200 Marines to Kosovo in the first stage of any 
peacekeeping mission if there's a need to move quickly and U.S. 
troops are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of  
thousands have been driven from their homes in clashes in Kosovo 
between ethnic Albanian separatists and Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been no decision made to send troops and there won't  
be until there's a peace agreement,'' Col. Richard Bridges, a 
Pentagon spokesman, said earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France are serving as co-hosts for the talks at  
Rambouillet. Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, 
heads the U.S. delegation, and Albright will meet with him and 
``make her own on-the-ground assessment,'' the State Department 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is due this weekend on whether to extend negotiations  
into a second week. That would depend on how much progress the two 
sides were making on a self-rule plan for the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration does not support independence for  
Kosovo, but is insisting any settlement provide maximum self-rule 
for a three-year trial period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines, from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at  
Camp Lejeune, N.C., are already deployed near Kosovo as part of an 
amphibious ready group in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Army soldiers and heavy equipment, which sometimes take weeks to  
deploy, would follow Marines to Kosovo as part of a long-term NATO 
peacekeeping operation that could include up to 4,000 U.S. ground 
troops, said a Pentagon official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Army troops could come from Europe, Asia or U.S. bases, 
depending on what type of units are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading with the Marines is the primary option, the official  
said, because of the inability of mechanized infantry and armored 
Army units to move as quickly as might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Marines on the USS Nassau, USS Pensacola and USS Nashville, on  
the other hand, can get into Kosovo immediately with helicopter 
transports and gunships and 1,150 combat troops with artillery, 
tanks and light armored vehicles. The amphibious unit carries food 
and supplies for 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
	European nations are expected to provide most Kosovo ground  
forces with NATO planners contemplating sending up to around 30,000 
troops, U.S. defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, is expected to provide the main  
sea and air power from forces based in the region, most likely from 
the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force unit based at Aviano, Italy, 
and from the Navy's Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, according to 
Pentagon planners. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is wary of sending too many troops to Kosovo  
because of congressional criticism over the U.S. peacekeeping 
obligation for the past few years in Bosnia, where about 6,700 
American troops remain. Initially, the United States sent 30,000 
troops to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain announced Friday it is pre-deploying military equipment,  
including an armored battle group, to the Balkans on Monday to 
prepare for a Kosovo peacekeeping mission. London also said it 
would contribute an initial 2,350 ground troops and be willing to 
provide up to 8,000.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Re-Sign Robert Griffith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings safety Robert  
Griffith has signed a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not disclose terms of the deal, but it's worth $9.9  
million, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported today. The 
newspaper said the deal includes a signing bonus of about $2.7 
million, some of which is deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd make the money I'm  
making now to play football,'' Griffith said. ``I'm just glad I'm a 
Viking next year. I'm going to do everything in my power to help 
them win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, who would have become an unrestricted free agent  
today, led all defensive backs on the Vikings with 109 tackles and 
also intercepted seven passes. He was named the NFL Defensive 
Player of the Week after the playoff game against Arizona and was 
second team All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's a very important signing because he was certainly  
one of our priority guys,'' said Jeff Diamond, Vikings senior vice 
president of football operations. ``He had an excellent season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond said the team's focus going into free agency is to keep  
as many players as possible because ``we think we have a good team 
and we want to keep it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith's re-signing left the Vikings with five defensive  
starters who became free agents today, including Pro Bowl middle 
linebacker Ed McDaniel, cornerback Corey Fuller, nose tackle Jerry 
Ball, lineman Derrick Alexander and safety Orlando Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other key players will be allowed to negotiate with  
other teams if they want, including return specialist David Palmer 
and fullback Chuck Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond said there were no serious discussions Thursday about a  
possible trade involving quarterback Brad Johnson. Today is the 
first day the Vikings could announce a trade.

<HEADLINE> UN Wants Report on Civilians in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Touched by the flight of refugees and the  
plight of children in armed conflicts, the Security Council on 
Friday ordered the U.N. secretary-general to report on specific 
ways to protect civilians in war. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicating some unease with the way the United Nations is  
operating under Kofi Annan, Canada's foreign minister said the 
council wanted to ``emphasize a need for concrete acts that we hope 
the secretary-general will provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four hours of deliberations in which Canada's Lloyd  
Axworthy spoke of a lack of ``political will,'' the Security 
Council ordered Annan to submit a report by September detailing 
actions the United Nations can take to protect civilians in the 
world's conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. ambassador Peter Burleigh backed the Canadian  
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	While China said the ``ultimate solution'' was to eliminate all  
conflicts, its ambassador, Huasun Qin, said a more realistic effort 
would be for the United Nations to devise ways to ``help keep 
civilians out of harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olara Otunnu, Annan's special representative on children in  
armed conflict, UNICEF head Carol Bellamy and Cornelio Sommaruga, 
president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, all told 
the council how armed hostilities increasingly involve youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Otunnu, the former foreign minister of Uganda, said the minimum  
legal age for recruitment of child soldiers should be raised from 
15 to 18 and that public pressure should be exerted to make schools 
and playgrounds battle-free zones. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300,000 youths 18 and under, mainly in Africa, are child  
warriors, said Otunnu -- and 2 million children were killed in 
conflicts from 1987-97. 
</P>
<P>
	``Destroy the children,'' he said, and you're ``destroying our  
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sommaruga said the problem goes beyond children being involved  
in war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross ``is faced today with 20 open conflicts all around  
the world, in many of which civilians are the first and principal 
target,'' Sommaruga said. ``Women and children, the elderly, the 
sick, refugees and internally displaced persons have been attacked 
in large numbers and methodically driven from their homes.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Ready To Grab Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A lot of NFL teams got very jumpy when they saw the Cleveland  
Browns take low-priced player after low-priced player in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft left Cleveland with nearly $40 million to spend on  
free agents, allowing the Browns to outbid any team they want for 
top players in the free-agent period that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to bring aboard any significant player who can  
have a major impact on the team,'' Carmen Policy, the new team's 
president, said. ``Neither cap space nor cash should be an 
impediment to our going forward in free agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a new feeling for Policy, who was always over the cap  
when he ran the San Francisco 49ers. And look for 49ers to be 
targets, particularly young wide receivers Terrell Owens and J.J. 
Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens is a restricted free agent, meaning San Francisco can  
retain him by matching any offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niners entered the free-agent period close to $20 million  
over the $57.3 million cap, a $70 million differential from the 
Browns that makes it almost impossible for them to match a 
Cleveland offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 30 teams, of course, have one advantage -- established  
rosters -- and most of them want to re-sign their own players rather 
than go after unknowns in the free-agent pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The best example of that is Minnesota, which finished 15-1 last  
season after re-signing four key players -- defensive tackle John 
Randle, offensive tackle Todd Steussie, wide receiver Jake Reed and 
running back Robert Smith. But that set them back $93 million, 
which presents a problem this season, with eight key players 
becoming unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they've already resigned quarterback Randall Cunningham  
and offensive tackle Korey Stringer, and chances are they'll keep 
most or at least the best, like Pro Bowl linebacker Ed McDaniel, 
strong safety Robert Griffith and defensive end Derrick Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way you like to do it, particularly when you can  
keep people of that quality,'' Buffalo general manager John Butler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what your own players can do -- on and off the field.  
You're never sure when you bring in new people. But that doesn't 
mean you won't look to plug holes or be forced to let people go 
because of the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, teams are looking to rid themselves of players whose  
salaries exceed their value. This year's salary cap is just short 
of $57.3 million, $5 million more than last year. But even if they 
do, there are not a lot of prime unrestricted players out there, 
and few teams that have money to outbid Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepest position in free agency is wide receiver, headed by  
All-Pro Antonio Freeman of Green Bay, who is likely to be given a 
franchise player tag to protect him. Cincinnati did the same this 
week with Carl Pickens, whom they may trade for the two first-round 
draft picks that come with that tag. Arizona might do the same with 
Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Others receivers available include Stokes, Sean Dawkins of New  
Orleans, Charles Johnson of Pittsburgh and Leslie Shepherd of 
Washington, all unrestricted, unlike Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Vikings contrasts with the way other teams  
have thrown money around with little result. For example, Seattle 
spent millions on big-name free agents for the second straight 
year, but finished 8-8, costing coach Dennis Erickson his job. One 
problem: the revolving door game in which the Seahawks lost center 
Kevin Mawae, who went to the New York Jets and became the hub of 
their vastly improved offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year teams that were close to the Super Bowl got  
extremely aggressive in free agency, and that got the coach 
fired,'' said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. ``Look at Carolina and 
Kansas City and Seattle. They wreck their salary cap, which costs 
them for years to come. The longer free agency goes on, the more 
that teams are disappointed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes free agency risky.  
</P>
<P>
	Many players are improved by the players around them, like wide  
Alvin Harper, a standout in Dallas playing opposite Michael Irvin. 
He did nothing after signing in 1995 with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's example of that could be the Giants' Chad Bratzke, a  
good but not great defensive end, to whom the Browns are said to be 
ready to offer $5 million a year. He had 11 1/2 sacks, but they came 
in part because All-Pro Michael Strahan played the other end, and 
he could slide without help from skilled linemates. 
</P>
<P>
	What the Vikings do might turn on what happens with Brad  
Johnson, who began last season as the starting quarterback, got 
hurt twice and never got his job back from Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, due a $1.15 million bonus March 1, might be traded to  
Baltimore, coached by former Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick. He's by far the most attractive quarterback available in a 
market that includes Kerry Collins and veteran backups like Rich 
Gannon of Kansas City and Steve Bono of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	That would provide cap room to sign those Vikings who might  
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management will do an excellent job,'' Cunningham said. ``They  
did an excellent job getting guys signed last year, and they'll do 
it again this year, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down La. Sodomy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A state appeals court has struck down a  
194-year-old Louisiana law that made oral and anal sex a felony, 
saying the law violated the privacy rights of consenting adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision adds to the growing list of states that have struck  
down sodomy laws based on rights to privacy granted in state 
constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana court on Tuesday reversed the 1996 conviction of  
Mitchell E. Smith. He had been accused of raping a woman but found 
guilty under the state's ``crimes against nature'' statute only of 
having her perform oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no doubt that the right of consenting adults to  
engage in private non-commercial sexual activity, free from 
governmental interference, is protected by the privacy clause of 
the Louisiana Constitution,'' the court held. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in Georgia, Kentucky, Montana and Tennessee previously  
had reached the same conclusion in interpreting their respective 
state constitutions and striking down sodomy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the U.S. Supreme Court held in 1986 in a Georgia case that  
consenting adults have no federal constitutional right to private 
homosexual conduct, activists have turned to individual state 
constitutions to find protection from the sodomy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Constitution does not mention the word ``privacy,'' but  
the Supreme Court since 1965 has recognized that such a right 
predates the 1787 document itself. However, many state 
constitutions expressly grant a right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Goldberg, senior staff attorney with the Lambda Legal  
Defense Fund in New York City, was jubilant about Tuesday's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``These laws have no legitimate purpose and that's what courts  
are starting to recognize,'' she said. ``The government should not 
be in the business of policing private sexual behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be appealed, said prosecutor Tim McElroy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He's Sorry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering and asking forgiveness, President  
Clinton said today his impeachment acquittal should begin ``a time 
of reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Rose Garden of the White House he will hold for two more  
years, the president again apologized for the Monica Lewinsky 
affair and his deceptions about it. He said he is humbled and 
grateful for the support he has received from millions of Americans 
over the past year, since the scandal began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans here in  
Washington and throughout our land will rededicate ourselves to the 
work of serving our nation and building our future,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke solemnly and plainly, about two hours after the  
Senate voted to acquit him on articles of impeachment for perjury 
and obstruction of justice, and began with an expression of 
remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He answered one question: ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive  
and forget?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be  
prepared to give it,'' Clinton said, then walked back into the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 55-45 against conviction for perjury and 50-50  
against obstruction of justice. It would have taken 67 votes to 
convict Clinton and expel him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' roll began to be called,  
Clinton was in the White House residence doing his daily exercises 
and -- after a quick hello to his visiting mother-in-law and friends 
that Mrs. Clinton had over -- working on the Rose Garden statement 
he'd begun the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief of staff John Podesta telephoned Clinton after each vote  
and ``listed who had voted which way,'' said press secretary Joe 
Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	His acquittal secured, Clinton emerged from the Oval Office to  
face a crowded row of news cameras. ``This can be and this must be 
a time of reconciliation and renewal for America,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His brief and sober words were in contrast to the scene two  
months ago, in the same setting, after the House voted to impeach 
him. Then, as only the second president ever to suffer that and 
face Senate trial, the White House recruited more than 200 House 
Democrats to the Rose Garden, and they applauded as Clinton vowed 
to go back to his work as president and do it to the last hour of 
the last day of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans bristled at what they called a victory rally in the  
face of disgrace, and until the end of the trial, they said 
repeatedly that this time, there should be no semblance of 
gloating. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said there would not be, and Clinton's demeanor  
was subdued, contrite, an apology not a defense.

<HEADLINE> Senators Set To Vote on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirteen months after the Monica Lewinsky  
affair rattled the White House, senators spent their last few hours 
today in private debate before a historic vote expected to acquit 
Bill Clinton and end the second presidential impeachment trial in 
U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott also gave Democrats 
a long-shot opportunity to force a discussion of censure. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes on two articles of impeachment charging Clinton  
with perjury and obstruction of justice complete a drama that has 
riveted official Washington, roiled a midterm congressional 
election and worn out the patience of the American public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate will resume final deliberations now in the closed  
session, thank goodness,'' Lott said at the start of today's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said, ``The president's  
self-indulgent actions were immoral, disgraceful, reprehensible. 
History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that William 
Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office in our 
American democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four Republicans certain to vote against the two articles,  
the only remaining drama was whether a majority of the 100 senators 
would vote to acquit the president. Several senators predicted Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine, also would vote to acquit, although her 
office declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	After those votes, Lott announced this morning, Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., would be allowed to introduce a motion to 
censure the president and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the most vocal 
opponent of the rebuke, would be able to offer a rival motion to 
kill the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing a censure motion to the floor would require 67 votes to  
change the Senate's rules -- a high threshold that many senators did 
not expect would be met. Nonetheless, the debate was a symbolic 
gesture to allow senators who vote to acquit Clinton to express 
their disdain for his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Some already had begun the process of airing their  
dissatisfaction with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah predicted that Clinton's  
concealment of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, which grew out of the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, would forever tar him as 
``the most accomplished, polished liar we've ever had serving in 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After acquittal, Clinton would not remain without troubles: He  
could face indictment, while in office or after his term, by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and must finish his remaining 
months in office facing a GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him 
evicted from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes cap a five-week trial that featured for the first time  
videotaped testimony on the Senate floor and provided the world its 
first good look at Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A 
national TV audience was able to watch as 13 House impeachment 
managers, all Republicans, argued that Clinton deserved to be 
thrown out of office, while White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings;  
furtive gropings and sex acts between the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky near the Oval Office; late night phone calls between the 
president and the intern; and, most damning for Clinton, a stained 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Starr's findings, the House approved one article of  
impeachment accusing the president of lying to a federal grand jury 
on Aug. 17, 1998, about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The second charge said Clinton obstructed justice by trying to  
have Ms. Lewinsky sign a false affidavit in the Jones case; by a 
job search conducted by presidential friend Vernon Jordan; by the 
retrieval of presidential gifts by Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie; and the alleged ``coaching'' of Mrs. Currie by the 
president for her grad jury appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators said it was their constitutional duty to proceed with a  
trial, even though from the beginning there were doubts that the 
two-thirds vote required to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office would materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of closed-door deliberations this week, senators  
denounced Clinton's conduct ``over and over again from both sides 
of the aisle,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and Republicans alike said the votes were not  
there for conviction. Bennett, for one, has joined a 
Democratic-sponsored initiative to have the Senate pass a strong 
resolution of censure immediately after Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist gavels the trial to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters agree the resolution is ailing because of  
stiff Republican opposition, and the pro-censure senators may have 
to settle for a statement denouncing the president's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joined three  
GOP senators who previously announced their decisions against 
removing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``After due consideration, I am persuaded that the president's  
wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by the criminal 
justice system,'' she said. ``And I am further persuaded that 
future presidents and future generations can be effectively 
deterred from such wrongdoing by this impeachment and that 
potential prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of  
Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania previously came out 
against conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began private deliberations on Tuesday, and by Thursday  
night they were holding news conferences and issuing written 
statements to announce their votes and explain their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not any senator in this chamber nor any person in this  
country, will look at this president in the same way again,'' 
Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that the president abused his sacred power by lying and  
obstructing justice,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``How can 
parents instill values and morality in their children? if Clinton 
isn't removed, he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore: ``There can be no doubt that  
President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of his 
words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to 
our culture and to our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate trial began Jan. 7. Inside the tradition-steeped  
Senate chamber, where the only other presidential impeachment trial 
was held in 1868 in the case of Andrew Johnson, senators conducted 
the case with decorum and dignity.

<HEADLINE> Fans Say Bye to Maple Leafs Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dozens of former Maple Leafs players converged  
Friday to attend the last NHL game at Maple Leafs Gardens, and 
police braced for showdowns with nostalgic fans who might try to 
rip away seats as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's game between the Maple Leafs and Chicago  
Blackhawks will end the NHL's 68-year run at the Gardens and mark 
the league's departure from the last of the arenas built in the 
1920s and '30s for its Original Six franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 former Leafs are expected to attend and join in an  
hour-long, nationally televised ceremony afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	There will 16,000 spectators packed into the arena, and 2,000  
more fans attending a brewery-sponsored street party outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardens officials say a security force of about 300 will be  
mobilized inside the arena, on the lookout for fans trying to take 
parts of the building away with them as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to understand that the Gardens isn't closing,''  
said Gardens president Bob Hunter. ``We're not going to tolerate 
anything disappearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arena, built in 1931 for $1.5 million, will remain open for  
at least two more years as a venue for minor league hockey, 
concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs are moving about a mile away to the new Air Canada  
Centre, and play their first game there Feb. 20 against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago was selected to be the last Gardens visitor because it  
was the first to play the Leafs when the arena opened in 1931. The 
ceremonial faceoff will feature former Blackhawk Harold (Mush) 
March, now 90, who scored the first goal in the Gardens, and Red 
Horner, 89, the last survivor of the 1931 Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs have tried to keep some secrets about Saturday night's  
celebrations, such as who will be providing entertainment. Many 
former Leafs stars, including Frank Mahovlich, Darryl Sittler, 
Lanny McDonald and Borje Salming, will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sittler, a former captain, teamed up with current captain Mats  
Sundin for a conference call Friday to discuss the finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sittler said the final game might even top his own personal  
Gardens highlight, his record 10-point game when he had six goals 
and four assists against Boston in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very emotional evening seeing all the  
players from the past,'' Sittler said. ``It's only going to happen 
once so we're all going to be very emotional... It'll have an 
impact on all of us for the remainder of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin first heard of the Gardens as a child in Sweden and first  
played in the arena in 1990 as a member of the Quebec Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't understand the tradition, the history or the  
atmosphere of the Gardens until I got here five years ago,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mixed emotions,'' he said of the move to a new area.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can bring the atmosphere and the feeling we've  
had this season in the Gardens to the Air Canada Centre. Hopefully, 
we'll be able to feel comfortable playing there by the time the 
playoffs begin.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Appeal State Farm Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A lawyer for six people in a  
class-action lawsuit accusing State Farm Insurance Co. of 
fraudulent sales practices said Friday he will appeal a $238 
million settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, State Farm would make varying payments --  
averaging about $1,300 -- to every one of the 3 million customers 
represented by the class action. However, those entitled to a 
larger award must undergo what lawyer Kenneth Nelson described as a 
confusing claim process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that will have the effect of discriminating against  
policy holders who are poor, disabled, elderly, unsophisticated -- 
in other words, the easiest targets for fraud,'' said Nelson, of 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Any appeal would only serve to stall State Farm's payments, said  
Tom Schneider, a State Farm lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean County Judge Ronald Dozier approved the settlement on  
Thursday. The lawsuit contended that State Farm cheated people 
while selling them whole life and universal life insurance policies 
from January 1982 to December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, State Farm agreed to settle the lawsuit in order to  
avoid a protracted trial. In Thursday's agreement, the company does 
not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Each member of the class will get the initial payment. Others  
who allege they are entitled to more must apply to an independent 
company. That neutral firm will determine the size of the 
additional award using an intricate scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, State Farm expects as few as 5 percent of those  
eligible for a larger award will apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, of the 3 million, only a handful  
are going to actually follow the claim relief procedure,'' said 
Robert Cummins, a Chicago lawyer who also objects to the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's only if the folks step through the hoops correctly.  
But my goodness, the folks in the complaints are elderly, 
unsophisticated people,'' Cummins said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is common for complicated, legalistic notices to deter  
members of a class-action from filing for a claim, said Robert 
Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a big, 65-page document, or 50 pages or something, and  
it's just incredibly intimidating,'' Hunter said. ``First of all, 
are you going to read it? And if you are, can you understand it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused State Farm of duping policy holders to  
switch policies and lose value; promising unrealistic returns on 
cash value policies; inflating dividend projections; and soliciting 
sales by referring to life insurance policies as ``investments'' 
and ``retirement plans.''

<HEADLINE> Poster Controversy in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Vietnamese activists who staged days  
of protests outside a business displaying a portrait of Ho Chi Minh 
say the shop owner has taunted them by fax. 
</P>
<P>
	The HiTek video shop has been the site of controversy since Jan.  
18, when Truong Van Tran posted the display of the late communist 
leader and a Vietnamese flag. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered Tran to take down the display three days later,  
but on Wednesday he was allowed to put it back up again. Tran also 
won a court order barring protests on the property of the strip 
mall where he rents his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, police broke up a demonstration at the shop. Tran  
was also released from the hospital after collapsing Wednesday when 
he was slapped by a protester. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in connection with the court case revealed Tran  
not only displayed the picture and flag, but also challenged 
anti-communist groups to come to his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, I dare all of you ... if you all think you are great,  
then go ahead, come over to clear me out,'' he wrote in a fax to 
two anti-communist groups and other activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax, handwritten in Vietnamese and accompanied by a  
certified translation, was entered as evidence in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He challenged us,'' said Ky Ngo of the Vietnamese Community of  
Southern California, one of two groups organizing the protests. 
``He provoked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran is known for flaunting his support of the Socialist  
Republic of Vietnam, a minority view in this community of 200,000 
dominated by South Vietnamese refugees who fled the communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Constitutional law attorney Ronald Talmo, who represents Tran,  
said his client thinks the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ``has made 
great strides for the people of Vietnam. He wants the people here 
to better understand that. And why he wants to do that instead of 
selling stereos, I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> El Nino Surprised Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From its speedy development to its unusual  
strength and sudden departure, last year's El Nino provided 
surprise after surprise to scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	They responded by making it what may have been the most  
completely studied, measured, probed and prodded weather phenomenon 
on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. McPhaden of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle 
details that analysis in today's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone in the community realized how strong it  
would be,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another great surprise was how quickly it ended,'' he said.  
``We basically went from the strongest El Nino on record to 
moderate to strong La Nina conditions in the course of a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino is a periodic warming of the eastern tropical Pacific  
Ocean that can cause unusual weather worldwide. La Nina is its 
opposite, a cooling of that water to below normal readings. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino was blamed for a series of storms that swept across the  
West Coast, battering California and the Northwest. But the El Nino 
patterns were beneficial in other areas, reducing the number of 
hurricanes in the East. With the arrival of La Nina, abundant 
powerful hurricanes returned last summer. The impact on winter 
weather patterns is less clear so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers collected data from satellites and a network of  
buoys moored near the equator to continuously measure surface and 
subsurface conditions in the tropical Pacific during the event. 
</P>
<P>
	It started suddenly in early 1997, triggered, scientists  
discovered, by strong weather systems migrating into the western 
Pacific from the Indian Ocean in late 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past there was scientific discussion of an Indian Ocean  
connection, but it was controversial, McPhaden said. This time 
there was a very clear relationship to El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that the Pacific Ocean was conditioned for  
the start of an El Nino in 1995 and 1996 by a buildup of excess 
heat in the western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests that ocean conditions that naturally  
fluctuate from one decade to another, as well as global warming 
trends that occur over even longer time scales, may have influenced 
the 1997-98 El Nino, McPhaden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how El Nino may interact with these longer-term climate  
variations is not clear, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some forecasters predicted unusually warm conditions in the  
tropical Pacific for 1997. But, McPhaden said, almost all 
underestimated the strength of the event and the speed at which 
temperatures would rise. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino developed so quickly that from June to December 1997, a  
record high for sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial 
Pacific was set every month, rising to 83-84 degrees Fahrenheit, 7 
degrees above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not until the easterly trade winds, which had reversed in  
1997, abruptly returned to near-normal strength in the eastern 
Pacific in mid-May 1998 that the cold subsurface waters were drawn 
upward. When that happened, sea surface temperatures plummeted 14 
degrees during one 30-day period from May to June, marking the end 
of El Nino.

<HEADLINE> Judge Approves State Farm Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A judge has approved a settlement in  
which State Farm Insurance Cos. expects to pay $238 million to 
customers who sued the company accusing it of fraudulent practices 
in selling life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3 million State Farm customers were represented under the  
class-action lawsuit. A tentative settlement was announced in 
August, and McLean County Judge Ronald Dozier approved it Thursday, 
although he said it wasn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm expects to pay more than $26 million in attorney fees  
and expenses related to the case. The Bloomington-based company 
denied any wrongdoing but said it agreed to settle the class-action 
lawsuit to avoid a protracted court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement involves current and former owners of whole life  
and universal life policies issued between January 1982 and 
December 1997. The lawsuit accused the company of several 
fraudulent practices, including artificially inflating dividend 
projections and promising returns based on assumptions the company 
knew to be unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the settlement does not necessarily end the dispute. A  
lawyer representing six people in the lawsuit announced plans today 
to appeal, saying the process of making a claim beyond the token 
award offered by State Farm is too confusing and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that will have the effect of discriminating against  
policy holders who are poor, disabled, elderly, unsophisticated -- 
in other words, the easiest targets for fraud,'' said the lawyer, 
Kenneth Nelson of Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Schneider, a lawyer for State Farm, said an appeal would  
only delay State Farm in paying the awards under the settlement to 
those who sued the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's appeal could stall plans to mail notices to the  
affected parties, or the Appellate Court could allow the settlement 
to go forth while weighing the appeal. Qualified current and former 
policy holders also were notified after the tentative settlement 
was reached in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people will be paid with credits to their State Farm  
accounts, but the company said those payments can be converted to 
cash. The company expects just 5 percent of those eligible to 
collect. Critics say that's because the notices are difficult to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, State Farm paid more than $100 million to settle a  
lawsuit alleging it covertly trimmed earthquake policies in 
California.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Lead Fall; Dow Off 29.09 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, led by a decline in  
technology stocks after analysts warned that Dell Computer's sales 
growth may be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 29.09 at 9,334.37. The blue-chip index gained as much as 
26-points in early trading, then fell by nearly 90 points before 
bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell today, including the  
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which was down 53.21 at 
2,352.34. That erased nearly half of Thursday's 96-point gain, the 
biggest one-day climb ever for the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another volatile session for technology shares, which  
have made some wide swings this week. On Tuesday, there were huge 
losses, then they were mostly unchanged Wednesday and soared on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an on-again, off-again market,'' said Hugh Johnson,  
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotional swings in the market are extraordinary,'' he  
said. ``It's a hair trigger environment. One thing can throw 
everything off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's losses came amid a big decline in Dell Computer, which  
came under selling pressure after BancBoston Robertson Stephens and 
Salomon Smith Barney warned of slowing sales growth due to 
increasing competition from other computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, which will report its earnings on Tuesday, was down 9 9/16  
at 92 5/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer makers also fell today, including Compaq  
Computer, which was down 1 1/4 at 43 9/16, and Dow component IBM, 
which fell 6 1/16 to 172 7/16. Both trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the losses this morning, analysts said that there was  
hope for a rebound later today after the Senate's historic vote on 
the impeachment of President Clinton. Many expected him to be 
acquitted, which will end the second presidential impeachment trial 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 316.62 million shares, down from 359.34 
million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 13.29 at 1,240.75, the  
NYSE composite index was down 4.24 at 585.50, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.26 at 696.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.15 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.02 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
1.06 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Win Short Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The standings look exactly the way  
everyone expected. The way Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss got to 
the top in their short programs wasn't quite so expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both blew away weakened fields Thursday at the U.S.  
Figure Skating Championships, neither was spectacular. Sure, Kwan 
got a 6.0 and eight 5.9s for presentation in her ``The Fate of 
Carmen'' routine. But even she and coach Frank Carroll found fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine, consistent, but don't think it was the  
greatest short program she has ever done,'' Carroll said. ``But I 
certainly will take it. I thought she did her job and thought it 
was a very good performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was like the greatest it has ever been. But  
what you want to do in the short program is nail everything, and 
she did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Weiss, albeit with some bobbles in his footwork. He, too,  
swept the judges in the short program, worth one-third of the total 
score. And, like Kwan -- who is seeking her third American crown; 
Weiss is after his first -- the two-time U.S. runner-up should have 
no trouble clinching the title on Saturday in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit different going in as the favorite, I'm used  
to going in as the underdog,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously it's a good 
position to be in, though. I went out and skated the way I wanted 
to and I'm sitting where I want to be right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each get a day of rest while the free dance and pairs free skate  
are held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion and the sport's biggest star,  
was ``honored'' about the 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really strong and confident,'' said Kwan, a two-time  
world champion closing in on her third American crown. ``My lutz 
was a little shaky, higher than usual. But I guess I have to be 
prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except losing, it would seem. Against a group of young,  
generally unproven skaters -- at least at this level -- Kwan appears 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Hughes, the rising 13-year-old who was runner-up in the  
recent World Junior Championships, was second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really like to think about placements,'' she said. ``I  
just wanted to be happy with my performances, and I am happy with 
my short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, the American junior winner a year ago, edged 20-year-old  
Amber Corwin, who wound up third in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are people out there working as hard and maybe  
harder than you,'' Kwan said after hitting a triple lutz-double toe 
loop combination, a double axel and a triple toe loop, along with 
some sensational spirals. ``I have to work to stay at the top of my 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss had to work quite hard to get to the top of American  
skating. He was a close loser to five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge 
the last two years. With Eldredge not defending his title, despite 
still being eligible, Weiss is an odds-on choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He handled that situation well enough Thursday, hitting all of  
his jumps and spins. But his footwork was sloppy and he lacked 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The short program is just getting through it and having fun,  
and I think I did that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel, fresh out of juniors and the only U.S. skater to  
land a quadruple jump in competition, was second. Goebel performed 
solidly, but lacks the flair that usually marks Weiss' routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic was third. Both he and Goebel, like Hughes and  
Corwin, are light years from the level of the skaters they trail. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't breed overconfidence in the leaders, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put them down,'' Kwan said. ``There are some great  
skaters here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are, but not below first place.

<HEADLINE> `MNF' May Go to a Two-Man Booth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Dan Dierdorf's departure from ``Monday Night Football,''  
one of the most prominent broadcasting jobs is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be filled.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC may return to a two-man booth on ``MNF'' for the first time  
in 13 years, back when Al Michaels teamed with Frank Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most booths in the NFL are two-man,'' said Jim Nantz, the  
``NFL Today'' host. ``It's not that unusual. We've come to be 
accustomed to the three-man booth in prime time, but it's the 
exception and not the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels and Gifford each were established veterans when they  
were paired. Boomer Esiason just completed his rookie stint after 
replacing Gifford, to mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe ABC came to the conclusion that this three-man booth  
wasn't working and another one would be a risk, and Al Michaels and 
Boomer Esiason would be a better two-man,'' said Neal Pilson, the 
former president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Boomer is coachable and can improve, but they need to  
work with him,'' Pilson added. ``He needs to be more insightful. 
There wasn't much humor or entertainment this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Esiason doesn't show progress, his faults would be magnified  
with Michaels as his only partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Fried, Esiason's agent, said the ex-quarterback has fielded  
inquiries from several teams about returning to the field. But 
Esiason wants to stay upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	If ABC does go with a third man in the booth, it will likely  
cost the network about $1 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading candidates:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Paul Maguire is the ideal -- and safe -- choice. He has been an  
analyst for two Super Bowls with NBC, he adds humor and is 
insightful. Maguire Currently works Sunday night games and has 
already had success bringing along one blond former QB, Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sterling Sharpe has been grabbing most of the headlines, but  
he has been a studio analyst for three years and pairing him with 
Esiason would put far too much inexperience in the booth. It would 
be a major risk for NFL's biggest showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Joe Theismann is knowledgeable, but he and Esiason would  
battle for airtime -- much as Boomer and Dierdorf did. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Jackson is more of a football guy and is the favorite to  
replace Gifford as the co-host of the pregame show. He offers a 
blend of humor and football savvy. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CONTRACT DISPUTE: Jerry Glanville jumped from his job as an NFL  
analyst at Fox to a spot with the revamped CBS pregame show on 
Wednesday. That was a complete shock to Fox, which believes it has 
an agreement for a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville said neither he nor Fox signed the deal, which he  
called a ``suicide contract.'' According to the outspoken former 
NFL coach, the deal had an option after each season. 
</P>
<P>
	``After this season, they had until June 1 to decide whether  
they wanted to bring me back. Next year it was July 31 and the 
final year it was in August. That's not a contract -- it's suicide. 
By June 1, there are no jobs out there if they decide to let me 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville's former agent, Ed Hookstratten, negotiated the deal  
with Fox and has said that he has a written agreement between the 
two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one of us signed it,'' Glanville said. ``If he's got a  
document with my signature, I promise you the FBI will be called in 
-- because it's a forgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville will team with Nantz, Craig James and Randy Cross --  
once CBS finds a replacement for Cross as its No. 2 analyst.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Lawmakers Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Lawmakers from Pakistan and India sat  
across the negotiating table today to try to chip away at 51 years 
of hostility, lay the foundations for friendship and stanch their 
nuclear rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference represents the first time that lawmakers  
from the uneasy rivals have gotten together in an attempt to ease 
decades of stormy relations characterized by war and relentless 
bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side is expecting to achieve a major breakthrough.  
Pakistan's former foreign minister, Gohar Ayub, said, ``We have a 
shared history, culture, (but) we are like oil and water in a 
barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings between Pakistan and India have taken on increased  
significance since last May, when the nations conducted underground 
nuclear tests. World leaders have strongly lobbied the two 
countries to take steps to ease tensions and avert a possible 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and India have fought three wars since British rule of  
the subcontinent ended in 1947. Since May, the overwhelming fear is 
that another confrontation could escalate into a nuclear one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan and India are entrapped in both declared and  
undeclared wars and a most costly arms race which their economies 
cannot afford,'' said Imtiaz Alam of Pakistan's Jang group of 
newspapers, the organizers of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 35 lawmakers from India and 60 from Pakistan are  
attending the conference. The Asian subcontinent, home to more than 
1 billion people, is one of the poorest regions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	According to estimates, more than 400 million people in the two  
countries live well below the poverty level. Yet the two countries 
are among the biggest consumers of weapons, Alam said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks, Alam told participants that the  
motivation for the conference was, in part, to ``save this beloved 
subcontinent of ours from nuclear catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition Indian legislator K. Asungba Sangtam said, ``We have  
not come with any special agenda. ... We have come here to become 
good neighbors and to live together in peace and tranquility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani lawmakers said the nagging dispute over the region of  
Kashmir has to be settled if the relationship between the two 
countries is to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three wars fought between India and Pakistan have  
been over Kashmir, a former princely state divided between them 
after independence. Both countries claim the Himalayan territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the solution of this problem there cannot be any  
progress in any other field,'' said Pakistani lawmaker Yasin 
Wattoo, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pakistan is pushing for international mediation in the  
dispute, India wants it settled bilaterally.

<HEADLINE> Browns Bring in Spielman, Two 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- While Mr. Ohio was trying to show them he could  
still play football, the Browns brought in two more guys from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro linebacker Chris Spielman, who hasn't played a down in  
the NFL since 1997, had a workout and underwent a physical for 
Cleveland at the team's headquarters on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the expansion Browns took a look to see if Spielman  
could be part of their future, they completed their first trade, 
acquiring defensive end Roy Barker and tight end Irv Smith from the 
San Francisco 49ers for unspecified past considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the 49ers said the considerations involved the  
Browns' selection of cornerback Antonio Langham -- a former Brown -- 
in Tuesday's expansion draft, which relieved San Francisco of a $3 
million salary cap liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were granted permission by the Bills to bring in  
Spielman, 33, who sat out the 1998 season while his wife, Stefanie, 
was treated for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Ohio State All-American missed half the '97 season  
with a neck injury that required surgery to fuse two vertebrae. He 
then chose to sit out this past year to help take care of his two 
children while his wife underwent chemotherapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Spielman said he would welcome a chance to  
join the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to finish my career in Buffalo,'' said Spielman.  
``If it doesn't happen, I'll play anywhere. If Cleveland's the 
place, that would be great. I'm an Ohio guy born and bred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman has started all 148 NFL games he's played and said he  
wants to remain a starter wherever he's playing next fall. With 
Spielman gone, the Bills started John Holecek and rookie Sam Cowart 
at inside linebacker last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns president Carmen Policy was unavailable to comment on  
Spielman's situation or the deal with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade with San Francisco had been rumored for days, but when  
finalized, it didn't include the biggest name, quarterback Ty 
Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer has a no-trade clause in his contract with the 49ers, who  
gave the Browns permission to discuss a new deal in order to 
acquire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, a seven-year pro who spent last season backing up Steve  
Young, is wanted by the Browns because he could help tutor Tim 
Couch if Cleveland decides to take the Kentucky star quarterback 
with their first draft pick in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the expansion draft in Canton, Browns coach Chris  
Palmer said he hoped to pick up a pass rushing defensive end, and 
he found a good one in Barker. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, who'll turn 30 on Sunday, had 12 sacks last season for  
the 49ers and forced three fumbles. Before joining San Francisco in 
1996, he played four seasons in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 27, caught 25 passes for 266 yards and five TDs last  
season. Tight end was the only position -- other than punter and 
place kicker -- not filled by the Browns in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy and Irv are both quality players whose abilities I've seen  
firsthand,'' said Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football 
operations, who had the same position with the 49ers. ``I'm 
confident that they will make important contributions to the Browns 
on their respective sides of the ball.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gone were his defiant glare, wagging finger  
and angry tone. President Clinton asked forgiveness in plain, sober 
words as he declared his impeachment acquittal Friday the start of 
``reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the Senate cleared him of charges in the  
13-month-long Monica Lewinsky investigation, Clinton stepped from 
an Oval Office now secure as his for the next two years to deliver 
his response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spring-like breeze lifted the gray hair at his temple. A trio  
of remote-controlled news cameras hidden low in the planters behind 
him captured the picture of Clinton, as a towering survivor, facing 
reporters in the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The conquering image did not fit the words.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is humbled and grateful for the support he has  
received from millions of Americans consumed by scandal and 
investigation and legal argument and, ultimately, his impeachment -- 
``the process,'' as he called it -- by the House for perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the five-week trial as the Senate's  
``constitutional responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I ask all Americans, and I hope ALL Americans -- here in  
Washington and throughout our land -- will rededicate ourselves to 
the work of serving our nation and building our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finished, he turned and had one foot on the bottom stone step as  
ABC's Sam Donaldson boomed, ``In your heart, sir, can you forgive 
and forget? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused and nodded before pivoting back to the  
microphone. ``I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to 
be prepared to give it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Save the placement of his presidential lectern near the saucer  
magnolia that shades the Oval Office, Clinton's appearance Friday 
bore no resemblance to the defiant show of force that he, Vice 
President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly 100 
House Democrats staged after the Dec. 19 impeachment vote by the 
Republican majority that controls the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Clinton faced cameras with a set jaw and denounced the  
``poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity 
and uncontrolled anger.'' Republicans and some Democrats bristled 
at what they saw as a victory rally in the face of disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Clinton exhorted, ``This can be and this must be a time of  
reconciliation and renewal for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to his staff, Clinton apologized for how his  
scandal made their work harder. ``The best way I can repay you is 
to redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we share,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady kept to the White House residence with her  
mother, some friends and informal business meetings. ``Like the 
rest of us, she's relieved,'' her spokeswoman said. Gore, who hopes 
to take over in two years, was making campaign-style stops in 
Albany, N.Y. He called the Senate votes ``a reaffirmation of the 
wisdom of our founders and their design of our Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton penned the 82-second statement himself, starting it  
Thursday night and polishing it the next morning after his daily 
workout, even as the ``guilty'' and ``not guilty'' roll was called 
on Capitol Hill. He ran his draft by a handful of top advisers, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not watch on television, but got the final tallies,  
including a list of ``who had voted which way,'' in two short 
telephone calls from chief of staff John Podesta, said press 
secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has insisted Clinton will not seek political  
revenge on those who condemned him. Lockhart stammered, then, when 
pressed Friday to say why Clinton got a senator-by-senator 
accounting of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be a relevant piece of information at the time  
and John chose to pass it on,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading up to the trial's predictable finale, senators warned  
the White House against any semblance of gloating. The White House 
complied and only described Clinton as relieved and back to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent the hour after his statement attending briefing on  
his trip to Mexico this weekend. Then he quietly telephoned his 
thanks to key Senate supporters.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Ill. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- Police were searching for a masked gunman who  
walked into an alternative education center and gunned down a 
teen-age student. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Rodriguez, who would have turned 15 next week, was  
pronounced dead at Provena St. Joseph Hospital after the midday 
shooting Thursday at the Ombudsman Educational Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students were sitting at computers when the gunman  
opened the door, walked toward Rodriguez and fired, striking him 
multiple times, police investigators said on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another student was slightly injured while scrambling to get out  
of the way. Investigators said they believed the shooting was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Ombudsman, a private company with 70 educational centers  
nationwide, holds contracts with local school districts to provide 
tutorial services for at-risk high school students, said Lori 
Sweeney, a co-owner of the Libertyville-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elgin center provides classes for approximately 20 students,  
and there have been no prior problems during its 10 years of 
operation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is located in a strip mall in this city of about  
85,000 on the outskirts of Chicago's northwest suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Messier Out for 4-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Vancouver Canucks captain  
Mark Messier will be sidelined for 4-6 weeks after injuring his 
left knee in a loss to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier, second in Canucks scoring with 13 goals and 31 assists,  
said he hurt himself Thursday in the 6-5 overtime loss to the 
Penguins on his first shift when his skate caught a groove in the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to cut back with the puck on my first shift and tweaked  
it there,'' Messier said Friday. ``I thought maybe it was just 
bruised because it hit the boards. But then a couple of times after 
that I could feel the joint start to open up. And then it started 
swelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the first period, Darius Kasparaitis hit Messier near  
the Canucks bench and their knees appeared to collide. Messier lost 
his balance but remained on his skates and limped to the bench, but 
did not return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't need surgery and it will heal 100 percent,''  
Messier said. ``But it just takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messier will miss at least half of the final 29 games for the  
Canucks.

<HEADLINE> Dad of Separated Kids Files Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The father of two young children is opposing a  
request that the U.S. Supreme Court reunite the two in the foster 
home where they were raised after the parents lost custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The father filed papers Wednesday asking the court not to hear  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	His 4-year-old son was taken in January from the foster home  
where he lived with his 6-year-old sister after the Massachusetts 
Supreme Judicial Court upheld a decision separating the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's lawyers have appealed to the Supreme Court to keep the  
brother and sister together, and a ruling in favor of the boy could 
potentially affect thousands of separated siblings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, who is developmentally disabled, was ordered to live  
with an aunt in New Jersey while his sister remains in Boston with 
the foster family that adopted her. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, called ``Hugo'' and ``Gloria'' in court papers to  
protect their identities, have spoken three times by telephone 
since their court-ordered separation, according to the boy's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get pretty sad, and they cry and miss each other,'' said  
R. Susan Dillard. ``The little girl is having a hard time. She had 
a hard time at school. She's very angry at the aunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard argues the Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental  
right that parents cannot be permanently separated from their 
children without clear and convincing evidence. She said the same 
principle should apply to sibling relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	The father says the boy is better off with the aunt. Hugo may  
have been injured by the cocaine his mother used while pregnant, 
and his aunt has already successfully raised her own special-needs 
child, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Drogin, lawyer for Hugo's father, said it isn't practical  
to require that the state Department of Social Services keep 
siblings together. The agency is siding with the father in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten kids were removed in two days in Everett and Framingham,''  
Drogin said, referring to recent neglect cases. ``What are the odds 
that DSS would find a home for all five kids from Everett, and then 
two days later for five kids from Framingham? Slim and none.''

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Says Quartey Bout a Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya is unbeaten, but not  
unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
	So the WBC welterweight champion knows Ike Quartey can provide a  
positive answer for him to a question often asked of young, 
successful fighters: ``Who has he beaten?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first real test in my boxing career,'' De  
La Hoya (29-0, 24 knockouts) said of his 147-pound title defense 
Saturday night in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. ``He is a former world 
champion. He is unbeaten. I took this fight because I know that 
style wise Ike Quartey -- heavy hitter, dangerous puncher -- will 
bring out the best in me. I'm up for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey also sees the match as ``definitely my biggest fight.  
It's biggest challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has predicted he'll meet the challenge with a knockout.  
</P>
<P>
	While the 29-year-old Quartey certainly is not as well-known to  
U.S. boxing fans as De La Hoya victims Pernell Whitaker, Hector 
Camacho and Julio Cesar Chavez (twice), he certainly has impressive 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger from Ghana was WBA welterweight champion in  
1995-97 until stripped by that organization for not making a 
mandatory defense in a prescribed time. He also is unbeaten, 
although he was knocked down and held to a draw by Jose Lopez in 
his last title defense, which also was his last fight Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``who's he beaten'' clique, which includes Quartey, contends  
De La Hoya might not have won the Whitaker fight and that Camacho 
and Chavez were past their primes when he fought them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about fighting and winning,'' said De La Hoya, who  
turned 26 Feb. 4. ``It (criticism) doesn't bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But De La Hoya knows that when a fighter commands the kind of  
purses he gets -- a $9 million guarantee Saturday night -- he is 
expected to do more than just win. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to win impressively,'' he said. ``A decision is nice,  
I'd be happy with that. But a strong knockout over an opponent 
everyone is talking about, that would be nice, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for caliber of opposition, De La Hoya took a couple of verbal  
jabs at Quartey was his draw against Lopez and his decision win 
against Oba Carr in a title defense in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a tough fight against Lopez and he claimed he was  
sick,'' De La Hoya said. ``He was up against a good fighter, and he 
made an excuse. It was not a walk in the park against Oba Carr, who 
is not the most dangerous fighter out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Who has he (Quartey) fought?''  
</P>
<P>
	Quartey is just happy to be getting a payday (a $3 million  
purse) after having three fights fall through in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A match against Whitaker was canceled when Whitaker tested  
positive for cocaine after a fight. A fight against IBF 
welterweight champion Felix Trinidad failed to materialize when 
Trinidad became embroiled in litigation with promoter Don King. His 
challenge to De La Hoya set for Nov. 21 was postponed when De La 
Hoya suffered a minor cut over his left eye while sparring and said 
he did want to risk fighting at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 De La Hoya, tall for a welterweight, weighed in  
officially Friday at 147 pounds. The 5-8 Quartey weighed 146 1/2 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot of criticism comes from my opponents being  
smaller,'' De La Hoya said. ``That's not my fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said he thought he would weight 152-153 pounds by  
fight time and that ``Quartey will be in the 160s. He always has 
been. That's not natural, it's all water weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should he win, De La Hoya is next expected to fight the winner  
of a 10-round match between Carr and Frankie Randall on Saturday's 
pay-per-view show. The fight set for May 22 would be held in a 
12,000-seat arena at the new Mandalay Bay and be televised by HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is rooting for Randall, a 37-year-old former WBA  
super lightweight champion. Carr is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr wouldn't motivate me as much as Randall would,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``Frankie is still hungry. He has a name. He'd help 
me fill up an arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens to the Carr-Randall winner if Quartey wins remains  
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	In another undercard fight Saturday night, Erik Morales of  
Mexico will defend the WBC super bantamweight title against Angel 
Chacon of Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted on Both Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson  
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month 
drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only 
the second presidential impeachment trial in history. The vote 
allows the 42nd president to finish his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is therefore ordered and adjudged that William Jefferson  
Clinton be and hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said 
articles,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing Clinton  
of obstruction of justice, far short of the two-thirds required for 
conviction. Earlier, senators rejected the charge of perjury by a 
55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a  
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the votes, Rehnquist banged his gavel to end the  
five-week trial. Senators then rejected an effort by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., to force a vote today on her recommendation to 
censure the president for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Her proposed censure, which Democrats may try to resurrect after  
a mid-February recess, would rebuke Clinton for giving false or 
misleading testimony and ``impeding discovery of evidence in 
judicial proceedings.'' The symbolic effort was a reminder that, 
acquittal aside, Clinton remains forever tarnished as only the 
second president in history to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote but did  
not watch it on television. The White House press staff watched on 
TV, displaying no emotions. The votes were broadcast by the 
networks to a nation long since weary of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who testified earlier this month by videotape,  
watched on television, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeat, the lead House prosecutor said his team had nothing  
to be ashamed of, rejecting any idea that the GOP House's 
impeachment effort -- which proceeded despite public opposition -- 
tarnished its credibility. ``All Americans can take great 
comfort,'' Rep Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said. ``Congress has 
strengthened, not weakened the ties that bind our nation 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, the second and third floors of the Senate side  
of the Capitol were evacuated by police checking a bomb threat, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators relished the opportunity to end the unpopular trial and  
return to legislative business. They ended two final hours of 
closed door debate on Clinton's transgressions this morning shortly 
before noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson Clinton  
guilty or not guilty?'' Rehnquist said to a hushed chamber, 
beginning the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared  
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of  
Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, 
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted 
Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators opposing the obstruction article were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Snowe and Specter.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,  
were opened for a final vote shortly after noon EST. Before the 
votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were read for a final 
time. Lott declared it was time for senators to fulfill their 
``obligation under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final outcome of the votes was known for days as five  
moderate Republicans announced in advance that they planned to vote 
against both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators thanked the chief justice for presiding over the trial  
and presented him with a gavel on a plaque. He said he was leaving 
the Senate chamber a ``wiser but not a sadder man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers exited the chamber, shaking hands with senators  
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the inevitable acquittal, senators wanted the public  
to know they abhorred the president's conduct in concealing his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,  
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt 
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life,'' said Sen. 
Collins, who today became the fifth Republican to announce an 
intention to vote for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also had sharp words for the president. ``The  
president's self-indulgent actions were immoral, disgraceful, 
reprehensible. History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that 
William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office 
in our American democracy,'' said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes complete a drama that has riveted official  
Washington, roiled a midterm congressional election and worn out 
the patience of the American public. ``The Senate will resume final 
deliberations now in the closed session, thank goodness,'' Lott 
said at the start of today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton is not free from troubles: He could face indictment,  
while in office or after his term, by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, and must finish his remaining months in office facing a 
GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him evicted from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured for the first time videotaped testimony on  
the Senate floor and provided the world its first good look at Ms. 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A national TV audience was 
able to watch as 13 House impeachment managers, all Republicans, 
argued that Clinton deserved to be thrown out of office, while 
White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr.

<HEADLINE> Senators Set To Vote on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirteen months after the Monica Lewinsky  
affair rattled the White House, senators spent their last few hours 
today in private debate before a historic vote expected to acquit 
Bill Clinton and end the second presidential impeachment trial in 
U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott offered Democrats a 
long-shot opportunity to force a discussion of censure. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs that neither article of impeachment, charging  
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice, would gain a 
majority of the 100 senators' votes. Five moderate Republicans 
planned to vote against both articles and the lone Democrat who 
opposed ending the trial early also announced today he would vote 
to acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-seven votes were required to convict and remove Clinton  
from office, and both sides have known for weeks that threshold 
would not be met, But House prosecutors had hoped to attract 
support from most or all the Senate's 55 Republicans, a prospect 
that faded this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to get beyond an impeachment crisis that paralyzed the  
capital for a year, the president was prepared to make a statement 
about an hour after the verdict, though he wasn't saying whether it 
would be on paper or in person. Clinton leaves Sunday for a trip to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with an inevitable acquittal, senators wanted the public to  
know they abhorred the president's conduct in concealing his affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young,  
star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt 
to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life,'' said Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine, who today became the fifth Republican to 
announce an intention to vote for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said in a statement she came to her decision because the  
president's actions failed to reach the ``very high standard'' 
needed to remove him from office. She joined fellow Republicans 
Olympia Snowe of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont, John Chafee of 
Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania in opposition to the 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also had sharp words for the president. ``The  
president's self-indulgent actions were immoral, disgraceful, 
reprehensible. History should -- and, I suspect, will -- judge that 
William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the highest office 
in our American democracy,'' said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., who joined Republicans in refusing  
to end the trial early, announced today he, too, would vote for 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's votes complete a drama that has riveted official  
Washington, roiled a midterm congressional election and worn out 
the patience of the American public. ``The Senate will resume final 
deliberations now in the closed session, thank goodness,'' Lott 
said at the start of today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	After the votes on the articles, Lott said, Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., would be allowed to introduce a motion to 
censure the president and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the most vocal 
opponent of the rebuke, would be able to offer a rival motion to 
kill the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing a censure motion to the floor would require 67 votes to  
change the Senate's rules -- a high threshold that many senators did 
not expect would be met. Nonetheless, the debate was a symbolic 
gesture to allow senators who vote to acquit Clinton to express 
their disdain for his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Some already had begun the process of airing their  
dissatisfaction with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah predicted that Clinton's  
concealment of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, which grew out of the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, would forever tar him as 
``the most accomplished, polished liar we've ever had serving in 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After acquittal, Clinton would not remain without troubles: He  
could face indictment, while in office or after his term, by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and must finish his remaining 
months in office facing a GOP-controlled Congress that wanted him 
evicted from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes cap a five-week trial that featured for the first time  
videotaped testimony on the Senate floor and provided the world its 
first good look at Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. A 
national TV audience was able to watch as 13 House impeachment 
managers, all Republicans, argued that Clinton deserved to be 
thrown out of office, while White House lawyers said he should not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the impeachment proceedings, opinion polls showed  
that most of the public gave Clinton low marks for personal trust 
and morality -- and were repulsed when Clinton's now-famous 
televised, finger-wagging assertion, ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' proved less than 
truthful. But they approved of the job he was doing in a time of 
peace and a booming economy and did not think the sex and cover-up 
scandal was serious enough to warrant his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a Republican-controlled House in December voted virtually  
along party lines to send to the Senate for trial an impeachment 
case based almost entirely upon a voluminous report by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings;  
furtive sex acts between the president and Ms. Lewinsky near the 
Oval Office; late night phone calls between the president and the 
intern and, most damning for Clinton, a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Starr's findings, the House approved one article of  
impeachment accusing the president of lying to a federal grand jury 
on Aug. 17, 1998, about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The second charge said Clinton obstructed justice by trying to  
have Ms. Lewinsky sign a false affidavit in the Jones case; by a 
job search conducted by presidential friend Vernon Jordan; by the 
retrieval of presidential gifts by Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie and the alleged ``coaching'' of Mrs. Currie by the president 
for her grad jury appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators said it was their constitutional duty to proceed with a  
trial, even though from the beginning there were doubts that the 
two-thirds vote required to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office would materialize.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirteen months after the Monica Lewinsky  
affair rattled the nation, senators ended a closed-door debate 
today over President Clinton's transgressions and prepared for a 
historic vote expected to acquit America's 42nd chief executive and 
allow him to finish his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott also offered Democrats a  
long-shot opportunity to force a discussion of censure immediately 
after the trial ended -- a reminder that even in acquittal Clinton 
would be forever tarnished as the second president in history to be 
impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,  
were to open for a final vote around noon EST. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs that neither article of impeachment, charging  
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice, would gain a

</P>
<P>
	Feinstein's proposal called Clinton's conduct ``shameful,  
reckless and indefensible'' and accused him of giving false or 
misleading testimony and ``impeding discovery of evidence in 
judicial proceedings.'' The California senator said, however, she 
did not have enough support to bring the matter to a vote today.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Sees More Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- On his first full day as head of the  
beleaguered Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Mitt Romney saw another 
member resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Badami, chairman of the board of the company that owns Park  
City Mountain Resort, told Gov. Mike Leavitt that he was ``prepared 
to withdraw his service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badami's resort is the venue for giant slalom and snowboarding  
events. His departure brought to four the number of trustees to 
resign in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt's earlier request that any trustee with a conflict of  
interest resign within 60 days prompted three of them, including 
Badami, to resign. Each has had business dealings with SLOC, which 
were OK under the old ethics policy requiring only disclosure of 
conflicts and withdrawal during votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The other trustee to resign, Verl Topham, had no conflict but  
resigned because he was on the bid committee board that, according 
to the ethics panel, didn't give proper oversight when two 
executives ran amok. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, 51, the son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney and a  
descendant of Utah's Mormon pioneers, said he will entertain 
suggestions from all quarters, even critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like a political system that has two parties,'' said Romney,  
a Republican who lost a challenge to Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy 
in 1994. ``This enterprise doesn't really have two parties, so 
having people from the community weighing in on issues is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He even made this interesting gesture Friday -- he asked  
anti-Olympic crusader Stephen Pace for a replica of his ``Slalom 
and Gomorrah'' T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience is the loyal opposition is both loyal and  
valuable,'' said Romney, the Boston venture capitalist chosen 
Thursday to head the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace, who leads a group called Utahns for Responsible Public  
Spending, has been wearing a shirt emblazoned with ``Slalom and 
Gomorrah'' to SLOC's purges this week. 
</P>
<P>
	First there was Tuesday's meeting where an independent ethics  
panel said former executives of the bid committee had unethically 
spent more than $1 million in cash, shopping sprees, vacations, 
medical care, bogus jobs and scholarships for International Olympic 
Committee members who voted on whether Salt Lake could host the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore it again Thursday, when Romney, the ``white knight''  
Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff had been hoping to hire, was 
embraced by the SLOC board of trustees and where Leavitt announced 
a sweep of reforms to foster openness and raise the ethical bar for 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace was a bit taken aback when Romney returned his call Friday  
and asked for a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a real touch,'' said Pace. ``He's got the benefit of  
the doubt. But this ethics report is a mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his first tasks, Romney said Friday, is making sure  
SLOC's budget includes contingencies for lower levels of funding 
and hiring a chief operating officer who can ensure preparations 
for the games really are on track, as former chief executive Frank 
Joklik and his staff have been saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he has a right-hand operations chief, Romney can turn his  
attention to wooing corporate sponsors back to the games. He hopes 
to send Utah executives and those with Utah ties such as Bill 
Marriott out as ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might be willing to open doors, to help people to see the  
wisdom of sponsoring our young athletes going for the gold,'' 
Romney said.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Probe Fingers 9 IOC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese Olympic officials investigating Nagano's  
bid for the 1998 Winter Games said today that nine International 
Olympic Committee members might have broken IOC rules during visits 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Yushiro Yagi, who headed the team looking into possible  
misconduct during the bid, refused to give their names or details 
of their conduct. Those will be included in a report to the IOC, 
which will be sent by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would only say that those engaged in questionable conduct  
included one IOC member who visited Nagano several times, four who 
brought ``large numbers'' of people, and four who brought along 
families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials are generally allowed one trip to a bidding city  
and permitted to bring along one guest at the bidders' expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi also brushed aside questions about whether there was a  
conflict of interest in forming the investigative team from members 
of the Japanese Olympic Committee, some of whom also served on the 
Nagano bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did all we could,'' Yagi said. ``I'm satisfied with this  
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His task force was unable to confirm any expensive gifts,  
reimbursement of medical costs or outright transfers of money, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force based the findings on seven days of interviews  
with former Nagano bid committee members and an examination of bid 
committee records. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi said records were incomplete because the bid committee  
burned its accounting ledgers in 1992, which he called 
``regrettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force will continue its investigation, Yagi said,  
although he refused to say what it would look into next. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano's bid cost $18 million. In the wake of the Salt Lake City  
scandal, Nagano's bid also has come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders have said they wined and dined visiting IOC officials,  
entertaining some with geisha and taking others to the tourist spot 
of Kyoto.

<HEADLINE> USA Plan To Buy Lycos in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc.'s plans to buy Web gateway  
Lycos Inc. appeared in jeopardy Thursday as Lycos' largest 
shareholder started waivering in its support of the $22 billion 
deal because of a sharp decline in Lycos' stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI Inc., a venture capital firm that owns 20 percent of Lycos,  
said it wouldn't vote for the deal if Lycos' stock price didn't 
recover from its two-day, 31 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks wants to forge a three-way deal, merging its cable  
television network with Lycos, which provides Internet search and 
information services, and Ticketmaster Online Citysearch, an online 
seller of tickets to concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI's original statement in support of the deal was drowned out  
by sell-orders from other investors in Lycos and Ticketmaster who 
felt they were getting a raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' shares, which fell from $127.25 to $87 in two days, got a  
boost Thursday from speculation that the deal would either be 
scrapped or sweetened. Lycos shares rose 18 percent to close at 
$103.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketmaster shares, which had fallen 35 percent to $37.50 in  
the two-day selloff, recovered slightly on Thursday, closing at 
$39.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Some credited the stocks' partial rebound on bullish analysts  
hawking the virtues of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Noglows, a financial analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,  
upgraded his recommendation to a ``strong buy'' from a ``buy'' 
early Thursday, reiterating that the combined company would be an 
electronic commerce powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the retreat by CMGI reflects broader concern that  
the deal benefits shareholders of USA Networks more than 
shareholders of Lycos. Lycos investors were offered less than the 
$127.25 closing price of their stock late Monday, instead of the 
fat premium typically showered on shareholders in merged Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge in Lycos shares reflected doubts that the combined  
company, which will have an estimated $1.7 billion in revenue in 
the first year, isn't worth the $22 billion stock-market value 
placed on it by dealmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, in a statement, said its ``long-term view of the prospects  
of the Lycos-USA transaction remains very positive, but we want to 
ensure that the overall deal proves to be accretive to Lycos 
shareholders, including CMGI,'' a spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company was ``pleased'' by the stock-price recovery on  
Thursday it said it would ``continue to evaluate our position as 
the synergies of the deal are better understood by the markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokeswoman, Deidre Moore, said the stance reflected the  
view of CMGI's chief executive, David Wetherell, who sits on the 
Lycos board. Wetherell did not immediately return phone calls 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Braverman, a financial analyst with Deutsche Bank  
Securities Inc., said the deal could be restructured to soothe 
skeptical investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that the deal continues to go through,'' he said,  
adding that revised terms could offer Lycos shareholders an option 
to buy additional shares at an attractive price. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of Lycos and USA Networks, meanwhile, scrambled to  
reassure large institutional investors their merger was a good 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're talking to everybody,'' said Michele Perry, a  
Lycos spokeswoman. She said executives were playing up the deal's 
potential to increase online sales of Home Shopping Network's 
consumer goods and Ticketmaster's tickets for concerts and other 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said the company was still confident the deal would be  
completed this spring.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Sign Two Linebackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers, shying away from  
some of the big-name players on the market, opened the free-agency 
signing period Friday by adding linebackers Donta Jones and Steve 
Tovar. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jamir Miller of Arizona and Ed McDaniel of Minnesota were  
considered the top linebackers in the 1999 free-agent crop, new 
Carolina coach George Seifert said Jones and Tovar were good fits 
for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 26, who has played four seasons with Pittsburgh, had 32  
tackles and a career-high three sacks in 1998, starting three games 
at inside and outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a mobile outside linebacker,'' Seifert  
said, ``and we feel that Donta's movement and aggressive play are 
perfectly suited for our outside linebacker position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tovar, 28, was a third-round pick by Cincinnati in 1993 and  
spent five seasons with the Bengals before being cut in training 
camp last year. He played 1998 with San Diego, where his 39 tackles 
included one sack. Tovar led the Bengals in tackles in 1994 and 
1995 before being slowed by a knee injury in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a good, big, strong inside run defender,''  
Seifert said, ``and Steve Tovar fits the bill.''

Switlik is a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real buffs would insist that the head still be here,''  
Switlik said, gazing at a headless stew of bones and meat. ``The 
last couple of years, the caterer would do that and I'd be looking 
at these little teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Algonquin Club of Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, gathered  
Thursday to celebrate local history over their annual dinner of 
boiled muskrat. Club member Bob Cosgrove, 63, struggled to define 
the taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever read `Green Eggs and Ham?''' he asked. ``Kiddingly, it  
tastes like cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local historians said the muskrat helped shaped the diets of the  
area's French-Canadian settlers, who were more inclined to call the 
animal ``mushrat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan health officials once cited eateries and nonprofit  
groups for serving muskrat on grounds that the meat hadn't been 
certified disease-free. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed in 1988, when state lawmakers approved a compromise  
that allowed clubs and churches to serve trapped muskrat -- at their 
own risk. 
</P>
<P>
	And so they partook at the Monroe County Historical Museum. The  
stars of the night were roughly three dozen of the animals -- 
trapped locally before being wine-soaked and boiled to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd cook it a little more tender than this, but it's good,''  
said Ralph Naveaux, the museum's assistant director. ``I'll 
probably take a doggie bag of this home if there's any left.''

<HEADLINE> American Goes To Court Over Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines cancelled nearly half of its  
flights today as a federal judge prepared for a hearing on a 
contempt motion against the pilots union as a job action continued 
despite a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, company spokesman Tim Smith said the carrier was  
canceling 1,046 flights out of its normal 2,250 daily flights for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier's flights  
were canceled Thursday as the airline's problems with the 
disgruntled pilots union grew. Pilots continued to call in sick and 
refused to fly overtime, leaving thousands of passengers stranded 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, Lucia Bernan and her 4-year-old daughter Melanie were  
trying to figure out how to get back home to Caracas after their 
flight was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``My flight was supposed to go out at 10:30 and here I am. I  
don't know what's going to happen,'' said Bernan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to me how such a prestigious company could do  
something like this ... Everything is so disorganized that it's 
extremely hard to believe this is actually happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are angry over the integration of recently purchased Reno  
Air, which has resulted in disparities in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the  
issue, but federal regulations do require individual pilots to call 
in sick if they think they are under undue emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered an end to  
the ``sickout'' job action that has been going on since last 
Saturday, but that seemed to have little effect. He has scheduled a 
hearing for this morning in his Dallas court on a request by 
American to hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, 1,170 of its 2,250 scheduled flights were  
canceled Thursday, the most in one day since the job action began. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised by the conduct of the union leadership,'' said  
John Hotard, a spokesman for AMR Corp., the parent of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jim Philpot, a spokesman for the union, said, however,  
that the APA is complying with the temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are meeting or exceeding the judge's requirements,'' said  
Philpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 3,800 flights have been canceled since  
Saturday, affecting the plans of more than 380,000 travelers. AMR 
said its American Eagle flights have not been affect by the job 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers attempting to reschedule or get refunds through the  
company's reservation desk found their calls disconnected by the 
overloaded system or forced to wait on hold for an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	For those with low-priority tickets, it has been especially  
trying. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Midge Griffin of Cincinnati had been at Chicago's  
O'Hare International Airport since Wednesday trying to get a flight 
to Ecuador to visit their daughter. They'd purchased discount 
tickets from a relative who works for American, and that gave their 
travel plans a lower priority than those holding full-price 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the bottom of the barrel,'' George Griffin bemoaned.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had been bumped three times in their efforts to get  
on a flight to Miami on Wednesday and had finally given up. They 
were trying unsuccessfully Thursday to get a flight back to 
Cincinnati and planned to reschedule their trip in September. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time the Allied Pilots Association has  
ignored a judge's ruling. During a similar dispute in 1990, 
hundreds of pilots called in sick after being ordered back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots have had a contentious relationship with company  
management for the past decade. Two years ago when contract talks 
failed, the pilots went on strike for a few minutes until they were 
called back to work by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me that we are having more trouble. As  
long as AMR management uses this confrontational approach, it is 
not likely to get better,'' said Capt. Neil Ekblaw, an American 
pilot based out of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if everybody heeded the judge's order, travelers shouldn't  
expect smooth holiday travels. There will be more cancellations as 
the company works to get planes and crews moved to the cities where 
flights are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots say the disagreement is as much over the contract, the  
outsourcing of jobs and past management decisions as it is about 
Reno Air pilots' pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes. The American pilots want AMR to 
add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale more quickly, and want some 
of their own to move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Miller Gets 18th in Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Once again, Americans had to be content with  
an also-ran finish in a World Alpine Ski Championship race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., was the top North American in  
Friday's men's giant slalom, but he was only 18th in the field of 
95, 3.82 seconds behind gold medalist Lasse Kjus of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was bummed to let the crowd down,'' the 21-year-old Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy any time I'm close to Kjus and those guys,'' he  
said. ``That's just the best. They're on it, they make no 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, was 24th, 4.92 behind the  
Norwegian champion, and Thomas Grandi paced the Canadian contingent 
in 25th in 2 minutes, 24.66 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it everything I had, but I made mistakes in just the  
right spots,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first run was fun but not really suited to me,'' Miller  
said of the morning course, which was turnier than the afternoon 
course. ``I tried to do my best. I blew it on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The middle part, Swiss Face, was really tough. It goes from  
light to dark -- and it's right in front of my coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller summed up the championships for the Americans when he  
called the two-week festival of skiing ``a disappointment, one 
after another. It's challenging to try to beat those guys on a 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're a young team and we're ready to experience and I  
think in a couple of years you'll see something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Jean-Philippe Roy was 30th in 2:26.75, Casey Puckett of  
Crested Butte, Colo., was 31st in 2:26.77 and Vincent Lavoie of 
Canada was 33rd in 2:29.69. Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, N.Y., 22nd in 
the first run, failed to finish the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The last chance for the North Americans to put a dent in  
European domination comes in the slaloms. Kristina Koznick of 
Burnsville, Minn., is a legitimate medal contender in Saturday's 
women's race. Miller, who was fourth at Wengen, Switzerland, last 
month, and Grandi, who has developed into a solid slalomist the 
last two seasons, are the top contenders in the men's slalom, which 
wraps up the competition on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Students Protest Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- To drink or not to drink -- that is the  
underlying question for Dartmouth College students who think the 
administration's decision to phase out single-sex fraternities and 
sororities is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of people come here and double major -- economics and  
alcohol, math and alcohol,'' said Pedro De Los Santos, 18, a 
freshman from New York. ``I only came because of the quality of the 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Dartmouth trustees, announced Tuesday as part of  
a sweeping campaign to make campus social life ``substantially 
coed'' and eliminate alcohol abuse, has drawn major protests from 
fraternity and sorority members. 
</P>
<P>
	They canceled 21 parties and events associated with this  
weekend's Winter Carnival to demonstrate the large role they play 
in campus social life, and protested outside college President 
James Wright's home Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 fraternity and sorority members marched Thursday night  
from fraternity row to the Dartmouth Green to hear Wright open the 
carnival. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of a 20-foot snow sculpture of a dog, Wright  
joked: ``I have not been invited to any fraternity parties this 
weekend, but I still intend to have a good time.'' Most of the 
crowd booed. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials have not said whether they will make the  
single-sex houses go co-ed or phase them out altogether. But Wright 
says single-sex, residential fraternities and sororities are on the 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 percent of Dartmouth's 4,300 undergraduates are members  
of 25 fraternities or sororities. There are also three coed 
fraternities, but their numbers are small. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ivy League school is located in Hanover, a town of about  
9,000 in the rural northern part of the state near the Vermont 
line. Chris Miller, a member of Alpha Delta when he was a Dartmouth 
student, co-wrote ``Animal House,'' the 1978 film comedy about 
frat-house debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternity members say they have been cooperating with the  
administration to control underage drinking and binge drinking, and 
feel betrayed by the administration's decision to change things. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of benefits to having a central location for  
drinking monitored by us, by student monitors and campus 
security,'' said Teddy Rice, 21, president of Psi Upsilon, the 
oldest fraternity on campus. ``The alternative is off-campus 
parties where people drink and drive.''

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft OK After Semi-Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Galileo spacecraft is operating  
normally again, nearly two weeks after it went into semi-shutdown 
when its onboard computer became confused after a pass by Jupiter's 
moon Europa, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft went back into normal mode on Wednesday after  
technicians sent it a series of commands. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo went into ``safing mode'' on Jan. 31, four hours after  
zooming by Europa to try to determine if it has ice-spewing 
volcanoes, said David Senske, a member of the Galileo imaging team 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	After the approach, Galileo was turning to locate the sun so it  
could better position its antenna and beam data back to Earth, 
Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a ``blind spot'' between two sun sensors confused the  
onboard computer, which automatically shut down nonessential 
activities, including some instruments, switched to some backup 
hardware and sent out a signal to let technicians know it was going 
into the safing mode, Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem apparently was caused by the unusual angle Galileo  
had adopted in order to study Europa, Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7,  
1995. It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway 
through a $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other 
moons.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan, India Lawmakers Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Lawmakers from Pakistan and India sat  
across the negotiating table today to try to chip away at 51 years 
of hostility, lay the foundations for friendship and stanch their 
nuclear rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference represents the first time that lawmakers  
from the uneasy rivals have gotten together in an attempt to ease 
decades of stormy relations characterized by war and relentless 
bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side is expecting to achieve a major breakthrough.  
Pakistan's former foreign minister, Gohar Ayub, said, ``We have a 
shared history, culture, (but) we are like oil and water in a 
barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings between Pakistan and India have taken on increased  
significance since last May, when the nations conducted underground 
nuclear tests. World leaders have strongly lobbied the two 
countries to take steps to ease tensions and avert a possible 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and India have fought three wars since British rule of  
the subcontinent ended in 1947. Since May, the overwhelming fear is 
that another confrontation could escalate into a nuclear one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan and India are entrapped in both declared and  
undeclared wars and a most costly arms race which their economies 
cannot afford,'' said Imtiaz Alam of Pakistan's Jang group of 
newspapers, the organizers of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 35 lawmakers from India and 60 from Pakistan are  
attending the conference. The Asian subcontinent, home to more than 
1 billion people, is one of the poorest regions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	According to estimates, more than 400 million people in the two  
countries live well below the poverty level. Yet the two countries 
are among the biggest consumers of weapons, Alam said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks, Alam told participants that the  
motivation for the conference was, in part, to ``save this beloved 
subcontinent of ours from nuclear catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition Indian legislator K. Asungba Sangtam said, ``We have  
not come with any special agenda. ... We have come here to become 
good neighbors and to live together in peace and tranquility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani lawmakers said the nagging dispute over the region of  
Kashmir has to be settled if the relationship between the two 
countries is to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three wars fought between India and Pakistan have  
been over Kashmir, a former princely state divided between them 
after independence. Both countries claim the Himalayan territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the solution of this problem there cannot be any  
progress in any other field,'' said Pakistani lawmaker Yasin 
Wattoo, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pakistan is pushing for international mediation in the  
dispute, India wants it settled bilaterally.

<HEADLINE> Mom Accused of Trying To Drown Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DESTIN, Fla. (AP) -- A mother who was rescued from the Gulf of  
Mexico along with her 5-year-old son has been charged with 
attempting to murder the boy by drowning him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly A. Laye, 34, of Orange Beach, Ala., told investigators  
she had no place to stay and tried to drown herself and the boy 
because of family problems and financial troubles, according to a 
sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Laye had been hospitalized at the Fort Walton Beach Medical  
Center for treatment and psychiatric evaluation after the Jan. 28 
rescue in Destin. She was jailed after her arrest Wednesday; no 
bond had been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was in state custody.  
</P>
<P>
	Tourists staying at a beachfront condominium in this Florida  
Panhandle resort city pulled the mother and son from the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Laye had walked into the water fully clothed after suddenly  
picking up the boy, said witness Berry Beebe of Clinton, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just walked out until the waves took her under,'' he said.  
``She kind of went down and he started floating at the surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beebe's daughter, Tracy, and her fiance, Matt Palmer, reached  
Ms. Laye about 75 feet from shore and dragged her to shallow water. 
Palmer then retrieved the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Beebe's wife, Judy, said she figured Ms. Laye's desperate act  
was a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of assumed that because it happened in the daytime, it  
was a cry for help,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Sue Diet Drug Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A drug company delayed reporting the possibility  
of potentially deadly side effects from taking its now-recalled 
diet drug fenfluramine, a lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst allegedly delayed putting stronger warning labels  
on fenfluramine -- half of the prescription diet-drug cocktail 
``fen-phen'' -- until it had rolled out another weight-loss drug, 
according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of 100 people suing the 
drug maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that what was done in this case was putting profits  
in front of patients' lives,'' lawyer Robert Kisselburgh said 
Thursday. His law partner, Kip Petroff, represents the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine, which was sold by Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin and  
paired with phentermine in ``fen-phen,'' carried labels starting in 
1988 warning that in rare instances it caused primary pulmonary 
hypertension, a potentially fatal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1994, the company's medical monitor, Dr. Frederick  
Wilson, told executives he knew of 37 PPH cases, even though 
Wyeth-Ayerst had notified federal regulators of only four, 
according to documents acquired by Petroff. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of this, as well as other case reports ... revision of  
the current labeling should be considered,'' Wilson wrote in a 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst did not change the warning label until June 1996 --  
weeks after the federal Food and Drug Administration had approved 
sales of the pharmaceutical company's new drug Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said Wyeth-Ayerst was obligated by federal law to amend  
the labeling immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman Doug Petkus insisted the FDA knew about  
the additional PPH cases while it was reviewing the application for 
Redux. He said the cases were discussed publicly by FDA advisory 
committee members twice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst has been hit with hundreds of lawsuits over  
fenfluramine and Redux, both of which the FDA recalled in 1997 over 
concerns that they caused heart-valve damage. Phentermine is still 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The first case is scheduled to go to trial on March 16 in Fort  
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff represents clients in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and  
Arkansas who are seeking unspecified damages for ailments including 
heart valve injuries and pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence in the lawsuit includes an internal document calling  
for additional warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Petroff, such warnings were delayed by a June 1995  
note from Dr. Marc Deitch, Wyeth medical affairs director, who 
warned of the need ``to discuss implication re: dexfenfluramine 
before proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kisselburgh said it was in Wyeth-Ayerst's economic interest ``to  
get Redux approved. It was worth millions of dollars to them.''

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Set on Fire in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- A grounded cargo ship and its load of fuel  
oil burned like a blast furnace today, sparked by explosives, 
napalm and a desperate desire to save Oregon's pristine beaches 
from a disastrous spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives experts touched the blaze off Thursday night with a  
series of remote-controlled blasts that engulfed the 639-foot New 
Carissa in an orange fireball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to go for this all or nothing,'' said Coast Guard Capt.  
Mike Hall. ``Every gallon that is burned in the fire is a gallon 
that is not on the shore of the coast of Oregon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire could take days to burn, and a growing concern was  
whether the ship would hold together. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``even if sections do break apart, the fire will continue to  
consume the oil, even if it's on the surface of the water,'' said 
Lt. Scott Wilson, head of the Navy demolitions team. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts ruptured the fuel tanks, filling the cargo holds with  
the molasses-like bunker oil. Simultaneous ignitions of the C-4 
plastic explosives touched off hundreds of gallons of napalm gel. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames soared hundreds of feet into the night sky, followed  
by an acrid black smoke that poured from cargo holds and drifted up 
the coast. As the fire gained in intensity, it erupted in a series 
of smaller explosions and the steel hull glowed bright red. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese-owned freighter was waiting to pick up a load of  
wood chips in Coos Bay when it ran aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards 
offshore with nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil aboard. It began 
leaking early Monday as the pounding of the waves widened the 
cracks in its hull. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state authorities decided to burn the vessel and its  
fuel rather than risk trying to bring the New Carissa out intact. 
Forecasts of advancing storms also played a role, though severe 
weather has yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first attempt to set fire to the ship Wednesday night  
using grenades and buckets of gasoline fizzled, Navy demolitions 
experts took no chances Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 gallons of napalm and 400 pounds of explosives --  
including battlefield torpedoes, shaped charges and firehose bombs 
-- were set off at once for maximum impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bill Milwee, a spokesman for the ship's owner: ``We think --  
no, we don't think it, we know -- what we did was the best option 
for the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 workers have been mobilized to scrape up oil and  
watch for fouled wildlife. Five dead birds have been found and some 
threatened Western snowy plovers were seen with spots of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	An oil sheen was detected entering the mouth of Coos Bay, a  
biologically rich estuary that is home to Oregon's largest oyster 
farms. Harvesting of clams and mussels has been banned.

<HEADLINE> Six Bodies Found in Okla. Apartment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A man shot his estranged girlfriend, their  
three young children and his mother before turning the gun on 
himself, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found all six bodies in the living room of a small  
apartment. There were no signs of a struggle or that anyone had 
tried to flee the room. Authorities feel certain it was a 
murder-suicide because the gun was located near the body of the 
children's father, 23-year-old Edwin Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we had is that he came over to pick the  
children up and it happened then,'' Officer Andy Phillips said. 
``There are bodies all over the room. I don't think they had a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the victims as Bell's mother, Linda Farris,  
45; Markita King, 21; and Ebony, 4, Essyce, 2, and 8-month-old 
Marjonna Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. King apparently had moved to Tulsa to get away from Bell in  
Oklahoma City, Phillips said. Bell and his mother had traveled 
together to Tulsa to visit the children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't discovered any notes or have any motive at all,''  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hunter, a 43-year-old father of five, shook his head  
sadly at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't nothing in the world bad enough to make you want  
to do something that bad to your kids,'' he said. ``To anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Vote, Then Head Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three hours after the Senate voted, Rep.  
Lindsey Graham hopped out of a car at Washington Reagan National 
Airport and bolted for a plane to South Carolina to ``chill out'' 
with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of trying to find a way out of the impeachment  
dilemma, members of Congress were certain of one exit strategy on 
Friday: Get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while to wind down,'' said Graham,  
R-S.C., one of 13 House prosecutors who lost their case to convict 
President Clinton. ``Tonight, I'm going to go out with some friends 
and chill out. Monday I'm going to play golf. Tuesday I'm going to 
be part of a national town meeting on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes after the acquittal, lawmakers scattered. Senators  
poured out of the chamber, said their piece to gaggles of 
reporters, summoned drivers and cabs and were off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Liberated!'' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., exclaimed.  
</P>
<P>
	At the base of the Capitol steps, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,  
glanced at his watch and jumped into the front seat of a white 
Blazer bound for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his plans, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,  
couldn't resist the opening to quip: ``I'm going to Disney World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist was first to make a getaway.  
Silently, he left to a shower of camera flashes. Rep. Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., the lead impeachment prosecutor, followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the senators.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going home,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said. ``Our  
grandchildren have a sleepover with us tonight and I'm looking 
forward to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., wasn't in  
the mood to talk about the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been out of our realm for a while,'' the soft-spoken  
Hastert said. ``I think we can return and get some work done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They had drawn the curtain on impeachment.  
</P>
<P>
	But when Graham got to the airport, he still was in impeachment  
mode. He barely took a breath as he rode down an escalator, 
discoursing about the consequences of the trial, perjury, 
obstruction of justice and the meaning of the whole affair for 
future presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped when he got to the security checkpoint where Jane  
Kiser of Bluffton, S.C., shouted her support of Graham's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from South Carolina,'' she said. ``We're so proud!''  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go home,'' Graham told her, and then strode off to his  
gate.

<HEADLINE> No Happy Ending in Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There were no heroes, only survivors, as a  
somber pair of roll-call votes brought a dignified end to an 
unseemly chapter of America's political history. At the final 
gavel, there was relief on Capitol Hill, humility at the White 
House and mercy for Americans who tired of the rancor long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After a strange year of political soap opera, constitutional  
crises and savage politics, Washington was already taking stock, 
debating the consequences of their impeachment battle and jockeying 
for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody comes out of this looking good,'' said  
Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley. ``The president, the 
independent counsel, the courts, the press and now the Congress -- 
everyone has looked bad, everyone has behaved badly and everyone 
has lost respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was spared dismissal but stained in history.  
His House prosecutors went away angry with the Senate that 
acquitted him. Democrats and Republicans who wanted to censure the 
president for his behavior wound up frustrated by a legislative 
maneuver that deprived them of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The only satisfaction, perhaps, was the end to a 13-month  
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners? Hard to find.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one is going to get scot free in the minds of most  
voters,'' said Republican strategist Ralph Reed. ``Clinton is not 
going to be viewed as exonerated. Everyone is a loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be, I fear, no happy ending,'' said Democratic Sen.  
Robert C. Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial of the century? Hardly. It broke no new ground about the  
tawdry story of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky or his 
efforts to conceal their relationship. Senators gave magnificent 
speeches, baring heart and soul, Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
afterward. But all their splendid oratory was unheard by Americans, 
spoken behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the bitterly divided House, the Senate took pride about  
its air of civility and a measure of bipartisanship. Ten 
Republicans joined Democrats in voting 55-45 to acquit Clinton of 
perjury. Five Republicans broke with their party as the Senate 
split 50-50 on the charge of obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gravity of its assignment, the Senate applauded  
itself and went home in a congratulatory mood, its 100 Republicans 
and Democrats hoping they have repaired their reputations in the 
eyes of voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, one of the most respected voices of the Senate, saw no  
cause for celebration. ``All of the institutions of government, the 
presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the system of 
justice and law, yes, even the media -- all have been damaged by 
this unhappy and sorry chapter in our nation's history,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Watergate scandal drove Richard Nixon from office 25  
years ago, President Ford tried to heal the nation's wounds, 
declaring at his swearing-in, ``Our long national nightmare is 
over.'' Similarly, Clinton tried to bring closure Friday by saying 
his acquittal should be ``a time of reconciliation and renewal for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events, and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he had expressed such sentiments last Aug. 17, when he  
appeared defiant after his grand jury testimony, the whole 
impeachment drama probably would never have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	With two years remaining in his term, Clinton has an opportunity  
to try to rebuild his legacy beyond the impeachment saga. ``I don't 
think it destroys his presidency,'' said University of Pennsylvania 
political scientist Mark Rozell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plausible historians will look back and be very critical  
of Congress for its actions and not consider the president so 
strongly tainted by the impeachment,'' Rozell said. ``But without a 
doubt, even his strongest defenders acknowledge this president 
behaved badly and that will be part of his legacy no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last year, Republicans suffered along with Clinton,  
plunging at the polls last November. They lost House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich after he mismanaged the GOP's Lewinsky strategy and then 
Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston when he was forced to admit his own 
indiscretions. Republicans need healing, too, and to prove to 
Americans that they stand for more than impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain how closely Clinton and Republicans can work  
together for the remaining two years of his term -- although 
analysts in both parties believe it's in the best interest of 
Congress and the White House to find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both -- for very separate reasons that are closely tied to  
their political survival -- need to demonstrate an ability to get 
something done,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to deal with him as long as he's president,'' Lott  
said grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the memories of this and the impact of this will  
reverberate for a very long time,'' said historian Brinkley. ``This 
just has accelerated the trend in politics toward a kind of 
partisan hatred, tactical savagery, that's been going on since the 
70s and particularly the 80s.''

<HEADLINE> Soldier Sentenced in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former soldier who was stationed in West  
Germany was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison for plotting to 
deliver highly sensitive defense documents to Hungarian and Czech 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said the espionage involved one of the most  
serious breaches of U.S. and NATO security during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Therese Warren, 32, of Warner Robins, Ga., pleaded guilty  
in November to conspiring to commit espionage while stationed with 
the U.S. Army 8th Infantry Division headquarters in Bad Kreuznach, 
West Germany, from 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped prepare classified documents that concerned the  
Allied defense of Central Europe in case of an attack by former 
Warsaw Pact countries, plans for the use of nuclear weapons and 
documents related to chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compromise of this classified material was devastating to  
our national security and with this information the enemy probably 
could have defeated a conventional counterattack,'' said retired 
Gen. Clayton Otis, a former commander in chief of the Army in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren was the fifth person convicted of taking part in the  
scheme. One man was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to 
forfeit $1.7 million. Another man got 36 years in prison, and two 
others 18 years.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Poster Sparks Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Angry protesters were ordered away  
from a Little Saigon video store Thursday where a portrait of Ho 
Chi Minh has prompted days of demonstrations by immigrants from the 
former South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 50 or so dispersed after officers passed out fliers  
in English and Vietnamese that explained a court order barring 
protests just outside the HiTek video store. 
</P>
<P>
	Small groups of demonstrators continued to chant ``Down with  
communists'' and wave the yellow and red flag of the former South 
Vietnam nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Store owner Truong Van Tran was released from the hospital  
Thursday after collapsing Wednesday when he was slapped by a 
protester. He was trying to return to the store to re-hang the 
poster of the late communist leader after a judge recently lifted a 
temporary order that had blocked him from displaying the portrait 
and the flag of communist Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran is known for promoting better relations with Vietnam -- a  
minority view in this community of 200,000 dominated by South 
Vietnamese refugees who fled the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in connection with the court case revealed he  
not only displayed the picture and flag, but also challenged 
anti-communist groups to come to his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, I dare all of you!'' he wrote in a fax to two  
anti-communist groups and other activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Constitutional law attorney Ronald Talmo, who represents Tran,  
said his client ``thinks the Republic of Vietnam has made great 
strides for the people of Vietnam. He wants the people here to 
better understand that. And why he wants to do that instead of 
selling stereos ...''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Before Long Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly Friday in thin,  
shortened trading as traders sold off bad bets ahead of a three-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange transactions ended early as traders took off  
ahead of the Presidents Day holiday on Monday. Traders in Europe 
and the United States settled many of their accounts with 
dollar-selling that contributed to the currency's modest drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty much stuck'' in tight trading ranges, said John  
Beerling, chief foreign exchange dealer at Norwest Bank Corp. in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1292, up  
from $1.1235 late Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 114.21 
Japanese yen, down from 114.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders took the dollar as high as 115.80 yen when the Bank of  
Japan announced after stock markets closed that it was lowering a 
key interest rate to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent. The rate is 
the lowest ever for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank is hoping to spur growth to pull Japan out of  
deep recession, even if the low interest rates make Japan's assets 
and currency less appealing to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar fell within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold the U.S. currency because they wondered ``just how  
much is a rate cut going to do in Japan at the moment. It does not 
leave any opportunity (for) any further rate cut,'' Beerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose against the dollar in muted trading, ``just  
continuing the trend of the last day or so after it hit bottom. 
(The euro) just kind of steadily crept higher,'' Beerling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was undermined by selloffs in U.S. stocks and  
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bond-selling did induce some dollar-selling as well,''  
Beerling said. ``You can attribute some of the bond sales to 
foreign investors dumping a little bit. There's a little 
dollar-selling in conjunction with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4160 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4236, and 1.4910 Canadian dollars, unchanged. The British pound 
rose to $1.6297 from $1.6226. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7320 German  
marks, down from 1.7408; 5.8090 French francs, down from 5.8385; 
and 1,714.70 Italian lire, down from 1,723.43.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels 1,170 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A judge's back-to-work prescription for American  
Airlines' pilots hasn't cured the labor clash that has grounded 
hundreds of flights and stranded thousands of passengers across the 
country for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots calling in sick and refusing to fly overtime grounded  
more than half of American Airlines' 2,250 scheduled flights 
Thursday, a day after a federal judge ordered them to return to the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,170 cancellations -- the most in a single day since  
problems began Saturday -- left angry passengers stuck in airports 
as the Presidents Day holiday weekend drew near. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucia Bernan fretted about how she and her 4-year-old daughter,  
Melanie, would get home to Caracas, Venezuela, after their flight 
out of Miami was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is so disorganized that it's extremely hard to  
believe this is actually happening,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall, who on Wednesday ordered pilots  
back to work, scheduled a hearing in Dallas today on the airline's 
request to hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if pilots return to work immediately, travel is expected to  
be disrupted for days as planes and crews are moved from city to 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 3,800 flights have been canceled since  
Saturday, affecting more than 380,000 travelers. Analysts have 
predicted the airline will lose millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	American estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots -- one in every  
four -- called in sick Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised by the conduct of the union leadership,'' said  
John Hotard, a spokesman for AMR Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas-based 
parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Union President Rich LaVoy urged pilots to return to work. But  
during a previous pilot sickout against American in 1990, many 
failed to return despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are disgruntled over pay disparities that have resulted  
from American's slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air. 
Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an 
experienced American pilot is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said the pilot union's demands to add Reno pilots to the  
higher pay scale more quickly would cost as much as $50 million 
this year, and no progress has been reported in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the  
issue, but federal regulations require pilots to call in sick if 
they think they are undue emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jim Philpot, a union spokesman, said: ``We are meeting or  
exceeding the judge's requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, passengers were still trying to reschedule or get  
refunds, swamping American's reservation desk with calls and 
finding themselves disconnected or waiting on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Midge Griffin of Cincinnati had been at Chicago's  
O'Hare International Airport since Wednesday trying to get a flight 
to Ecuador to visit their daughter. They'd purchased discount 
tickets, which gave their travel plans a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the bottom of the barrel,'' Griffin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had been bumped three times in efforts to get on a  
flight to Miami, which, like Chicago, is one of American's hub 
operations. The Griffins were trying unsuccessfully Thursday to get 
a flight back home, with plans to try the trip again in September.

<HEADLINE> Italy Cable Car Accident Described </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- After a low-flying Marine jet clipped  
an Italian ski gondola cable, the yellow car swayed back and forth 
as it plunged into the alpine valley, killing 20 people, a witness 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Demattio testified at the court-martial of the jet's  
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, that she was baby-sitting for a friend 
near Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998, when she saw and heard the 
jet roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet rattled the house, caused the TV antennae to sway and  
woke up the baby, she said. When she looked out the window, the 
plane was so close she could only see part of its belly. The plane 
flipped over and flew near the gondola wires, but Demattio didn't 
see it strike a cable, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	But she saw the yellow gondola come off the cable. ``It started  
to wave back and forth, falling to the ground,'' Demattio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter, destruction of property and 
dereliction of duty. His jet hit the cable between 360 and 370 feet 
at 621 mph. If convicted of all charges, Ashby faces a maximum 
sentence of more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Ashby flew the four-man radar-jamming  
jet far below the 1,000-foot altitude minimum and faster than the 
517 mph mission speed during a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Ashby is being scapegoated by the Marine  
Corps to conceal errors by higher-ups, including a 
government-issued map that didn't show the ski lift and a 
malfunctioning altitude gauge. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, defense attorneys claimed there were flaws in a  
computer simulation of the jet's route before it cut the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	After prosecutors showed eight military jurors the simulation, a  
lawyer for Ashby criticized the data on which it was based. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've heard the term, garbage in, garbage out?'' asked  
defense lawyer Maj. Bill Webber.

<HEADLINE> Senators Denounce Clinton Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators announced, one by one, how they  
would vote in the impeachment trial, some of them used harsh words 
to describe the conduct that led to the case against President 
Clinton. A sampling: immoral, deplorable, disgraceful, 
indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said he was arrogant.  
</P>
<P>
	And those were the president's Democratic supporters talking.  
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct at the heart of the charges is deplorable,'' said  
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``The president acted immorally, he 
acted recklessly, he acted disgracefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harshness aside, Feinstein said she was not convinced beyond a  
reasonable doubt that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of 
justice, as alleged by House prosecutors. She said she would vote 
to acquit him when the Senate met today to decide the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators have tongue-lashed Clinton during closed-door  
deliberations on his fate and then described their feelings outside 
the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism was to be expected, from both parties, but it  
seemed to resonate loudest when it came from the president's 
Democratic friends. They had little choice but to talk tough, lest 
they be accused of condoning his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's actions were wrong and arrogant,'' said Sen.  
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announcing that he, too, would vote to 
acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also were scathing in their assessment of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most accomplished, polished liar that we have ever had  
serving in the White House,'' Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah said in 
announcing he would vote to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, one of a handful of moderate  
Republicans who intend to vote for acquittal, said she ``struggled 
throughout ... to reconcile the president's lowly conduct with the 
Constitution's high standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the president's behavior deplorable and indefensible,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said Clinton ``debased'' his office  
and ``violated the soul of justice -- truth. He has thereby debased 
and violated the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer, the former House member who voted against the articles  
of impeachment in December on the House floor and in the Judiciary 
Committee, said the charges failed to meet the standard outlined in 
the Constitution of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., concurred, saying the evidence ``does  
not prove high crimes, but it does prove low character in our 
highest office.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks To Try Out With Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Garth Brooks is trading in his cowboy hat for a  
baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma country singer will join the boys of summer and  
suit up at San Diego Padres training camp in Peoria, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming down there to play ball,'' Brooks said today from  
Los Angeles during a conference call in which he was introduced as 
``the newest San Diego Padres outfielder -- Garth Brooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm scared. You know, it's going to  
be neat,'' the switch-hitting Brooks said. ``I want to be a 10th 
man, a utility man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 37, appeared as a pinch runner for the Padres last March  
during an exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fantasy for the ``Unanswered Prayer'' singer, who was a  
four-sport schoolboy star in Yukon, Okla., and earned a track and 
field scholarship to Oklahoma State, where he threw the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	He left behind his life as a jock when he graduated in 1985 --  
with a degree in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was asked if heading to spring training was a publicity  
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's totally serious,'' he said. ``I don't need the  
publicity. ... I'm going to go down there to live out my dream and 
the dream of 99 percent of the other guys out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he often does, Brooks spoke in the plural: ``We're going to  
take it extremely serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres owner John Moores said earlier it was no secret that  
Brooks longed to play professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had indicated through channels that he was interested in  
going to spring training,'' Moores said, adding, ``I think that 
would add a dimension to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some regard the move as a vehicle designed to shore up support  
for a publicly funded new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team badly needs community goodwill after failing to keep  
the core of last season's championship team, said Diane Dixon, one 
of the leaders of an unsuccessful campaign last year against public 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this as damage control, grasping for straws in an  
attempt to manipulate the fans to get what they want, which is a 
new stadium at the taxpayers' expense,'' Dixon said. ``I don't 
think he's going to mend the hearts of the Padres' fans -- unless he 
can really play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the spring training invitation leads is anyone's guess. If  
Brooks is a bust, he certainly won't have to go hunting for another 
job. He's sold almost as many albums as Elvis and the Beatles, and 
makes millions selling out concert dates across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has taken the year off from touring. If he shows he can  
play, he likely would be sent to a minor league club to live out 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent developments pointed to Brooks' involvement in  
baseball. He and several baseball stars, including some Padres 
players, recently announced formation of the Teach 'Em All: 
Teammates for Kids'' foundation to benefit children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk that Brooks would make a cameo appearance with  
the Padres at spring training like he did last year, and one of the 
Padres' vice presidents is now head of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the controversial trade of slugger Greg Vaughn still fresh  
in the minds of fans, the Padres likely will make it clear Brooks 
isn't going to be paid. In lieu of a salary, the Padres are 
expected to make a donation to his foundation, with assurances that 
some will be spent in San Diego. A fling in camp might allow Brooks 
the chance to develop relationships with ballplayers so his 
foundation will flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever heard was that he wanted to play baseball,'' Moores  
said. ``I understand he routinely takes batting practice at home. 
He's got an athletic build and a big pair of wheels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he can make it work -- he obviously knows the Michael  
Jordan story. Obviously, it would be very hard. If Garth makes it, 
I'll try to do it myself,'' Moores joked. ``I'm sure he knows this 
is a tough row to hoe. Everybody's got to follow their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan tried baseball after his first retirement from the  
Chicago Bulls, but struggled as a member of the Birmingham Barons 
and went back to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks spent two days working out with the Padres last spring,  
and even got into a game as a pinch runner. Brooks, who sings of 
``Friends in Low Places,'' was almost picked off twice, diving back 
into the bag once. He hugged the umpire after he was called safe on 
what appeared to be a generous call. Finally, he was forced out in 
a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nicely received by the ball club,'' Moores said. ``The  
players liked the hell out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he's with the big league club, he'll merely be the  
third musician in camp, albeit the most-recognized. Third base 
coach Tim Flannery recently released his third CD, and pitcher Mark 
Langston, who's friends with Bruce Hornsby, plays guitar in his own 
band.

<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- A man who said the devil told him to kill  
a 12-year-old boy and drink his blood was sentenced to death Friday 
by a jury that rejected claims he should be spared because he has 
mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Lucio Vasquez, 21, was convicted in the slaying of David  
Cardenas, who was found scalped and dismembered in a field near the 
Mexican border last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the slaying occurred at a time of year when a  
``satanic calendar'' called for human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves to die,'' said Oralia Palacios, the boy's mother.  
``He acted like a coward. Why couldn't he find someone his own 
size?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez confessed he hit David with a pipe, cut him with a knife  
and drank his blood. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-year-old cousin of Vasquez's is also charged with murder.  
Six others, including two teen-age girls, are accused of helping to 
cover up the crime.

York. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wheatley was the Giants' first-round pick in 1995, coach  
Jimmy Johnson said the much-maligned running back comes to Miami as 
``a bottom-of-the-roster guy,'' not a potential starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the chance, I think all doubt will be washed away,''  
Wheatley said. ``I'm happy to be out of a stifling situation and 
with a team that's on the rise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, 27, was a bust for the Giants, who considered him an  
overweight underachiever with a bad attitude. Relegated to coach 
Jim Fassel's doghouse, Wheatley carried just 14 times last year for 
52 yards. He started eight games in four seasons at New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been accusations made regarding my weight and  
attitude,'' the former Michigan star said. ``I just have to live 
with the assumptions and criticism. I'm starting with a clean 
slate. I have my chance now, and it's time for me to produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley provides Miami depth behind Karim Abdul-Jabbar. At 235  
pounds, he also gives the Dolphins a big back to help in 
short-yardage situations, a chronic problem for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson notes that the trade involves little risk for Miami.  
Wheatley was under contract for $770,000 this year but agreed to a 
restructured deal for about $375,000 this season -- the veteran 
minimum -- with a one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley rushed for 4,186 yards and 47 touchdowns with the  
Wolverines.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Court Will Uphold Miranda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legal experts doubt the Supreme Court ever  
will let state and local police ignore its 1966 Miranda decision on 
criminal suspects' rights. But they say a new federal appeals court 
ruling could cause the justices to restudy the landmark ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this goes to the Supreme Court, the justices will have to  
decide whether they want to toss out more than 30 years of 
jurisprudence that stemmed from Miranda,'' said Stephen Saltzburg, 
a George Washington University law professor. ``I don't think 
they'll go for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar said, ``It  
would be an interesting battle, but I think Miranda would win 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Americans have seen movie and TV police officers  
read suspects their rights. ``You have the right to remain silent. 
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You 
have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, an 
attorney will be appointed for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police nationwide have been giving such warnings before  
questioning criminal suspects in custody ever since the Supreme 
Court said they had to in a decision called Miranda vs. Arizona. 
Failure to do so often means a confession or incriminating remark 
made to police is inadmissible as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court threw out an Arizona  
court's conviction of Ernesto Miranda on charges of kidnapping and 
rape. Miranda, who was identified in a police lineup, confessed and 
signed a written statement without being told he had a right to a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was steeped in the constitutional protection  
against self-incrimination, but the court never explicitly said the 
Constitution requires such warnings to guard against police 
coercion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling in a Virginia bank robbery case this week, a three-judge  
panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a long-ignored 
1968 federal law trumped the Miranda decision and freed federal law 
enforcement officers from having to give the familiar warnings in 
every case. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling is now binding law in the 4th Circuit's five states  
-- Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress said such evidence could be used at trial as long as  
federal judges are sure the statements were made voluntarily. The 
federal law says compliance with Miranda is just one factor to be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic  
alike, have refused to enforce the 1968 law, however, out of 
concern for its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... have determined the Supreme Court has concluded that  
(Miranda) is constitutionally based since ... it has applied it to 
the states as well,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday. 
``It would be up to the Supreme Court to make the determination 
that it was not constitutionally based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court is far more conservative than it was  
33 years ago. Several of its members -- most notably Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist -- repeatedly have played down the Miranda 
decision's constitutional dimensions even as the court rebuffed 
numerous attempts to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no groundswell to get rid of Miranda,'' Kamisar said.  
``Most police like it because it makes life simple. If it's not 
broken, why fix it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia case likely will be referred to the full 4th  
Circuit court, and then to the Supreme Court. ``This is not a case 
the Supreme Court would duck'' if the three-judge panel's reasoning 
is upheld by the entire appeals court, predicted Northwestern 
University law professor Ronald Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	What if the Supreme Court agrees that the 1968 federal law is  
valid? ``You'll see numerous state legislatures adopting state 
analogues,'' Allen said, leaving police forces free to re-examine 
their policies on questioning criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps not all states would see a need for change. ``We're  
a Miranda state and we'll stay that way,'' said Mike O'Neal, 
R-Hutchinson, chairman of the Kansas House Judiciary Committee. 
``In fact, we're going the opposite direction. We now apply Miranda 
to juvenile cases.''

<HEADLINE> Cav's Kemp Carrying His Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- This national obsession with Shawn Kemp's  
weight has gone off the scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Leno and David Letterman have taken turns poking fun at  
Kemp's portliness while some sports columnists -- not the fittest 
pros, either -- have routinely joked about Cleveland's All-Star 
forward spending the six-month lockout in Wendy's. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems only Ally McBeal has had to endure under more scrutiny  
about her weight. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kemp, who admittedly came to training camp overweight, has  
been more than carrying his load for the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Through five games, here's the, er, skinny on Kemp.  
</P>
<P>
	He is averaging 20.4 points and 9.8 rebounds for the Cavs, who  
ended a 10-game losing streak to San Antonio on Thursday night with 
a 99-89 win over the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Battling and bulling his way underneath against David Robinson  
and Tim Duncan, Kemp scored 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. He 
was also mainly responsible for getting Robinson in foul trouble 
with his aggressive play near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a big guy and you go up against San Antonio's team,  
you know going in that you have your work cut out for you,'' Cavs 
coach Mike Fratello said. ``You have to dig in the trenches there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shawn hasn't had too many breaks when you look at who he's  
gone up against each night. He's really had his work cut out for 
him and he's been terrific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp is still not at his listed playing weight of 280, but he's  
nowhere near the reported 305 pounds that he was carrying a few 
weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
	With his changed physique, he's changed his game. No longer a  
high-flying finisher, Kemp's now a down-in-the-blocks banger. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice against the Spurs, Kemp has his shot blocked underneath --  
once by Robinson and once by Duncan. But both times, Kemp stayed 
after it, grabbed the loose ball and scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shawn doesn't back down,'' Cavaliers forward Vitaly Potapenko  
said. ``When he gets the ball inside, it's like he's saying, 'The 
paint is mine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp has 71 points and 33 rebounds in his last three games. He's  
been getting to the foul line and has made 35 of his 44 free-throw 
attempts. He's gone to the floor for loose balls and in the second 
quarter against the Spurs, Kemp went diving into the second row of 
seats trying to make a save. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprawled on the floor, his jersey wet with beer after sending  
two fans and their beverages flying, Kemp peeked over his shoulder 
to see what he had flattened. 
</P>
<P>
	After sharing a laugh with the fans, Kemp walked back onto the  
Gund Arena court as the crowd stood for one of the first times all 
season and applauded his hustle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp and the Cavs had been hustling in their first three games,  
but the shots didn't fall and some careless late-game turnovers led 
to an 0-3 start. But in its last two games -- wins over Charlotte 
and San Antonio -- Cleveland has looked more like a team that could 
contend for the Eastern Conference crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're playing more as a team and sharing the ball  
more,'' Kemp said. ``We're concentrating on the little things more 
than we did in the first three games. We're just trying to get this 
streak going a little bit. When you lose three straight, all you 
can do is come back and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp has played hard despite the weight issue and the lingering  
fallout from a Sport Illustrated story last spring that revealed he 
had fathered seven illegitimate children by six women. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Kemp addressed the SI piece for the first time,  
saying he was wrong and accepting responsibilty for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can say what they want about me,'' Kemp told the Akron  
Beacon Journal. I'm still going to go out and play basketball. I'm 
going to play like I've been playing for the last 10 years.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Chamber Briefly Evacuated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capitol police, reacting to a bomb threat,  
cleared the Senate chamber and nearby Capitol offices Friday less 
than an hour after senators ended President Clinton's impeachment 
trial with an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation lasted about 75 minutes, ending after police  
officers and bomb-sniffing dogs failed to locate anything 
suspicious, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that although the threatening call was made to a  
suburban hotel at about noon, Capitol authorities learned of it 
after the Senate completed its two impeachment votes at 12:39 p.m. 
``I can tell you that by the time it reached me, we were in 
closedown mode in just a few minutes,'' said Senate 
Sergeant-at-Arms James Ziglar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitol receives bomb threats from time to time, but Ziglar  
said officials determined ``this could be a legitimate threat.'' He 
and other officials also said authorities' sensitivity to security 
threats was heightened by the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Chief Bob Howe of the Capitol Police said an anonymous  
male telephoned a hotel in Bethesda, Md., saying a bomb would go 
off in the Senate chamber at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe would not identify the hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	The hotel contacted District of Columbia police, who notified  
the Capitol Police, who are in charge of security in the Capitol 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after the impeachment votes, the Senate  
abruptly went into recess and senators left the chamber. Tourists, 
reporters and others observing the proceedings were ordered to 
leave the galleries, and Senate offices on the second and third 
floors of the Capitol were also evacuated. The chamber is on the 
building's second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation was ordered after authorities discussed it with  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate offices on the first floor and House offices on the other  
side of the building were not cleared.

<HEADLINE> Romney Hired for Salt Lake Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake's Olympics have a new boss, a  
renovated leadership -- and a bribery scandal that just keeps 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, whose Boston firm turns around troubled companies,  
was hired Thursday to do the same for the 2002 Winter Games, which 
have been tarnished by misconduct that has scared sponsors and 
shaken the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games and the preparations leading up to the games will  
comply with the highest level of ethical conduct,'' Romney vowed. 
``There is absolutely no excuse for the compromise of principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will preside over a revamped Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
which has been expanded, its role reduced and three of its members 
forced out -- two of them with a shove from Gov. Mike Leavitt, who 
said conflicts of interest no longer will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the changes are hard, Leavitt said, but the Olympic  
Games gain their power through trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to raise our standard to the highest possible  
standard,'' said Leavitt, who gave any board member with a 
perceived conflict of interest 60 days to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's selection as president of SLOC will help move the  
Olympics' focus from ``money and materialism back to its roots of 
athletes and altruism,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romney was no sooner introduced when trouble flared again,  
this time involving an IOC member from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	James Easton, who also serves on the U.S. Olympic Committee and  
SLOC, said his sporting goods firm had responded to Salt Lake 
bidders' requests and hired the son another IOC member who has 
already resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton said he Sibo Sibandze, the son of David Sibandze of  
Swaziland, was paid by Easton Sports and did a good job. He said he 
saw nothing wrong with the hiring but acknowledged that in 
hindsight be probably should have turned down the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton said he did not consider his own behavior as unethical,  
but said he may resign from the IOC if five members already 
expelled are reinstated next month at a special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	And Japanese Olympic officials investigating Nagano's bid for  
the 1998 Winter Games said today that nine IOC members might have 
broken rules during visits to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Yushiro Yagi, who headed the team looking into possible  
misconduct during the bid, refused to give their names or details 
of their conduct. Those will be included in a report to the IOC, 
which will be sent by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would only say that one IOC member visited Nagano several  
times, four brought ``large numbers'' of people, and four brought 
along families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, whose ancestors were Mormon pioneers, was chosen by  
Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff. Their choice was endorsed 
this week by a hastily formed search committee amid some complaints 
about a short-circuited search. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my job to hire a leader now, not three or five months  
from now,'' said Garff, who alternately referred to Romney as ``the 
white knight'' and ``the cream of the crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been in a crisis and needed leadership now,'' Garff  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganizing of the board and the hiring of Romney came two  
days after SLOC's ethics panel issued a report blaming executives 
of Salt Lake City's bid committee for giving more than $1 million 
in cash, scholarships, shopping sprees, vacations and free medical 
care to 24 International Olympic Committee members in exchange for 
getting the games. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled. That  
number could increase, as an IOC investigation prepares to 
reconvene to review allegations in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he doesn't believe the Olympic movement will be  
permanently stained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have messed up big time. The athletes haven't,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney pledged to spend no more money than the games take in, to  
spare taxpayers, to protect the environment and to take no salary 
until the Olympics are over and in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	When he is paid, it will be $285,000 per year -- the same rate as  
his predecessor, Frank Joklik, who resigned Jan. 8. Joklik claimed 
to know nothing about the excesses of bid executives while he 
served as chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The roles of Joklik, First Security Corp. Chairman Spence Eccles  
and PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham all came under question 
because of their importance on both the bid committee and SLOC, but 
the ethics panel found no fault with them beyond general criticism 
of a lack of oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik will remain on SLOC's board of trustees, which was  
expanded from 33 to 50 members. So will Eccles, who will also fill 
one of six at-large spots on the new management board. 
</P>
<P>
	Topham resigned from the board on his own, ``In careful  
consideration of my own personal interests, and probably in the 
interests of going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the board under the new no-conflict policy were Alan  
Layton and Earl Holding. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC has a $13.8 million contract to hold downhill ski races at  
Holding's Snowbasin Ski Area and use his downtown Salt Lake 
properties. Layton's construction company is building a $29 million 
enclosure of the speedskating oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said he wanted one more resignation, but would not  
identify the person. The Tribune said it was believed to be 
Nicholas Badami, who has ties to Park City Mountain Resort, a venue 
for skiing and snowboarding events. He was not at Thursday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board's been purged,'' said House Speaker Marty Stephens,  
a new appointee to the board of trustees. ``The message needs to go 
out today that this is a new era. The Mitt Romney Era has begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selling the 2002 Winter Games to corporate sponsors will be a  
big part of Romney's focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he has little doubt corporations will jump at the  
chance to sponsor the first U.S. Winter Games in nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you see John Hancock and others like them standing in  
line to support the Salt Lake Olympics,'' Romney said, referring to 
comments Tuesday by the president of the insurance company. David 
D'Alessandro said he was protesting the IOC's failure to deal with 
the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, met for three hours with 11 key sponsors in 
New York Thursday and said there was no indication corporations 
were considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said. ``There 
is nobody that has withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Sherman, a spokesman for Visa International, said the  
sponsors ``voiced our concerns and encouraged reforms and they 
listened,'' but declined to offer further details. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' Pound said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Market's Main Index Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index edged higher  
today for the second consecutive day as the market waited for the 
outcome of a policy-setting meeting of Japan's central bank. The 
dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.32 yen in late afternoon, down 0.98 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 114.61 yen overnight. It ranged during the day from 114.08 yen 
to 114.78 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 128.54 yen, down from 130.22 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Thursday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 21.29  
points, or 0.15 percent, closing the week at 13,973.69 points. On 
Wednesday, the index rose 49.74 points, or 0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were moderately higher for much of the day amid hopes  
that the Bank of Japan may decide to take action to curb a recent 
surge in long-term interest rates. The results of the Bank of 
Japan's meeting were not announced by late afternoon after trading 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to touch the market right now, ahead of the  
outcome of the BOJ's meeting,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant general 
manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International Trust 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Political pressure has been building for the Bank of Japan to  
buy government bonds to help lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank has refused, saying such a measure would set  
off inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 452  
million shares, up from Wednesday's turnover of 423 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 583 to 534, with 165 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 6.44 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,089.53. The 
TOPIX shed 0.56 points, or 0.05 percent, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, some U.S. hedge funds sold the American  
currency on speculation that the Bank of Japan will leave interest 
rates alone for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.080 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.995 percent, driving its price down to 97.81 yen from 98.46 yen.

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Says Trial Made Him Wiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presiding over the Senate trial was a bit of a  
``culture shock,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said Friday 
as he completed his duties as only the second chief justice to 
oversee a presidential impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I leave you now a wiser, but not a sadder, man,'' Rehnquist  
told senators shortly after pronouncing President Clinton ``not 
guilty as charged'' on both impeachment articles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate gave Rehnquist a standing ovation and a golden gavel  
on a plaque, and Majority Leader Trent Lott thanked him for lending 
the proceedings ``a gentle dignity and an unfailing sense of 
purpose and sometimes a sense of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all come back soon, but I hope that's not taken the wrong  
way and not for an occasion like this one,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, who is used to presiding over the Supreme Court's  
non-televised proceedings, noted, ``I was a stranger to the great 
majority of you'' when he came to the Senate in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I underwent the sort of culture shock that naturally occurs  
when one moves from the very structured (environment) of the 
Supreme Court to what I shall call, for want of a better phrase, 
the more freeform environment of the Senate,'' he said, causing the 
senators to break into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was impressed with Senate leaders' ability to agree  
on procedural rules and by ``the quality of the debate in closed 
session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work as a court of impeachment is now done,'' Rehnquist  
said. ``I leave you with the hope that our several paths may cross 
again, under happier circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Shaq Might Return Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal's latest injury is not  
believed to be serious, and he might return to action Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said team physician Dr. Stephen  
Lombardo examined O'Neal on Friday and confirmed that the NBA's 
leading scorer has a strained right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who averaged 30.5 points and 12.3 rebounds in the team's  
first four games -- three of them wins -- was listed as day-to-day. 
O'Neal and the Lakers took Friday off after returning from a 
three-game, four-day road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was injured during Wednesday night's 103-98 victory at  
Denver, but finished the game. However, he sat out Thursday night's 
86-75 loss at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who missed 21 games with a similar injury last season,  
said after the Minnesota game that he hoped to play against Indiana 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal has missed significant time each of the past three  
seasons. He played 54 games with Orlando in 1995-96, 51 in his 
first season with the Lakers and 60 last season.

<HEADLINE> Agent Orange Again Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Benefits for Vietnam War veterans are not  
likely to be affected by an independent review that confirms ties 
of Agent Orange to several diseases without resolving lingering 
questions about birth defects or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study retains three forms of cancer as well as chemical acne  
as definitely linked to use of herbicides to defoliate the Vietnam 
countryside. It also confirms a list of six other diseases, 
including a spinal birth defect that has appeared in some children 
of veterans, as possibly linked. 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 diseases remain on the list of those for which all  
veterans who served in Vietnam may receive benefits from the 
Veterans Affairs Department. Since 1996, Vietnam veterans' children 
have been eligible for coverage for spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has received more than 92,000 claims from  
veterans who believed their condition was related to Agent Orange. 
Of those, about 50,000 were deemed service-related for any 
condition, and about 5,000 were linked to diseases on the Agent 
Orange list, said spokesman Ken McKinnon. About 2.1 million U.S. 
military personnel served in Vietnam during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all Vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed  
to Agent Orange and anyone with any of the 10 diseases is presumed 
to have contracted it from the exposure, without any need for 
additional proof. 
</P>
<P>
	But a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Thursday that the  
Veterans Administration must reconsider the denial of benefits for 
hundreds of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 court ruling voided all benefit decisions the agency had  
made based on the agency's outdated assertion that only the skin 
disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency failed to review claims made before the ruling and  
continued to insist that benefit applicants state that their 
disabilities were linked to Agent Orange exposure, U.S. District 
Judge Thelton Henderson concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court expected that the VA would revisit those benefit  
decisions that had been erroneously decided under the invalidated 
regulations,'' Henderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart Stichman, lawyer for plaintiffs in the case, estimated the  
decision affects about 1,000 veterans whose claims were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent report released Thursday by the Institute of  
Medicine, affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences, was 
praised for its thoroughness by the Veterans Affairs Department, 
which said it would be useful in further research. Congress has 
ordered a review every two years of links of various diseases to 
the use of chemicals in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of diabetes' link to use of herbicides or dioxin is  
listed by the study as still ``inadequate or insufficient'' to draw 
an association with Agent Orange or other chemicals used in Vietnam 
between 1962 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more research is being done, which we are very  
optimistic will continue to provide useful information to answer 
the questions that remain,'' said Dr. David Tollerud, who directed 
the study and heads the Center for Environmental and Occupation 
Health at Hahnemann University School of Public Health in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The four diseases on the list of those for which there is  
sufficient evidence to establish a link with exposure to herbicides 
are soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease 
and cholaracne. The first three are forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,  
six other diseases were listed as those with ``limited or 
suggestive evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other 
herbicides or the contaminant dioxin. Added to the list then was 
spina bifida, the spinal birth defect found in the children of some 
Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the recent literature,'' the new report said, ``there  
are no additional diseases that satisfy this category's criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tollerud, in an interview, said new research was conducted on  
diabetes and on spina bifida, as well as other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	About 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other chemicals  
were used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam, beginning 
in 1962. Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies 
first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks To Unite With Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- In a surprise move, Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat said today that he is interested in forging a 
confederation between Jordan and a future Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians have proposed a confederation in the past,  
including in a 1985 decision by the Palestine National Council, a 
top decision-making forum. But the concept was never fully defined 
when it was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's late King Hussein initially considered, then rejected,  
the idea, apparently fearing for the stability of his kingdom. 
About two-thirds of Jordan's population are Palestinians. In a 
Jordanian-Palestinian confederation, that percentage would rise 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address today to loyalists of his Fatah movement, Arafat  
said he wished Hussein's son and successor, King Abdullah, all the 
best and then floated what appeared to be a trial balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want him (Abdullah) to know that the PNC has agreed to a  
confederation with Jordan. But that is up to Abdullah. We are, 
after all, twin brothers, Palestine and Jordan,'' Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader apparently took his advisers by surprise  
when he raised the idea. Several aides refused comment and others 
played down the renewed proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only a new affirmation of the solidarity between the  
Palestinian and Jordanian people, and the close twin relationship 
between the countries,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the 
secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister  
Benjamin Netanyahu, said a confederation would do nothing to allay 
Israel's concerns about an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	``A confederation itself does not remove danger of a Palestinian  
state declared unilaterally that could raise a large army and forge 
alliances with countries like Iraq, Syria and Iran and control 
Israel's airspace and water resources,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has said he was reviewing plans to declare statehood on  
May 4, at the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy. 
Israel has said it would annex parts of the West Bank in response 
to such a move.

<HEADLINE> IOC: Sponsors Are Still Supportive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A full-scale rebellion by the top Olympic sponsors is being  
avoided for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who negotiates key television  
and marketing deals, said after a meeting with 11 key sponsors in 
New York on Thursday that there was no indication corporations were 
considering pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also reiterated that international sponsors are pushing  
the IOC's attempts to clean house following the Olympic City 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've  
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Pound said in a 
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has 
withdrawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between Olympic officials and sponsors lasted about  
three hours. Mike Sherman, a spokesman for Visa International, 
said, ``We voiced our concerns and encouraged reforms and they 
listened,'' but declined to offer further details. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsor group has been very good, proper and  
businesslike,'' Pound said. ``They say, `We understand you have 
problems, we appreciate what you are doing to clean up and we are 
supportive of your efforts to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other sponsors and IOC spokesmen either didn't return phone  
calls or declined to comment on the substance of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only outspoken critic among the sponsors has been  
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro announced this week that his company was canceling  
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's 
handling of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is part of the IOC's TOP program, a group of 11  
international sponsors who pay around $50 million each for 
exclusive rights to use the five-ring Olympic logo in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said John Hancock will also remove the Olympic  
rings from its annual report, company stationery and certain 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound downplayed Hancock's protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has postponed its television discussions, which  
is an add-on to its sponsorship,'' he said. ``I have spoken with 
Mr. D'Alessandro. There is no question of abandoning or thinking of 
abandoning the Olympic sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for longtime Olympics sponsor Coca-Cola  
Co., said the sponsors said they would like to see the bribery 
scandal resolved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have committed to us that they will do that. We won't be  
completely satisfied until this issue is put to rest, and that's 
going to take some time,'' Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsch said the sponsors will be monitoring steps the the IOC  
takes at its March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Sherman, a spokesman for credit card provider Visa  
International, said, ``We voiced our concerns and encouraged 
reforms and they listened to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive of General Motors Holden, a major sponsor of the  
Sydney Olympics, also expressed concern about the growing scandal 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``New things seem to be coming to the surface each day, and each  
time it obviously adds to the concern that we have,'' John Morrison 
of GMH told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	While Morrison said the company was ``disturbed'' by the  
revelations, it was a ``long way'' from considering withdrawing its 
Sydney sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview with The Associated Press in New York,  
Pound said critics should wait for the outcome of a special IOC 
meeting in March, called to deal just with the corruption issue, 
before voicing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said in the conference call that TV ad sales in North  
America and Australia are ``way ahead of schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described D'Alessandro as ``the most positive'' of Olympic  
sponsors in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Hancock has made fabulous use of that sponsorship for the  
betterment of the business,'' Pound said. ``I think he would like 
very much to continue it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said D'Alessandro believes he is helping the IOC by  
keeping up pressure on the committee to deal with the crisis. Pound 
said that's not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying that even without that pressure, we would be  
doing the same thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also countered D'Alessandro's suggestion that IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch has failed to handle the crisis 
and may be near the end of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem (Samaranch) acknowledges has arisen on his  
watch and has become a serious problem,'' Pound said. ``He wants to 
make sure action is taken to clean up and whatever changes are 
necessary to take us into the future are done under his leadership. 
I think that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Pound said, Olympic sponsorship ``is still a fabulous  
investment.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Acquitted but Tarnished </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
Clinton told Americans he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said 
and did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to 
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Senators also 
put the idea of censure aside, probably for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five  
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort  
led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Several 
Democrats said they did not expect the issue to resurface when 
lawmakers return to the Capitol after a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said one Republican,  
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who twice voted to convict the 
president and strip him of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for  
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, asked Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to autograph a blank Senate roll call form, 
then used it to record the results. Hyde the leader of the 
prosecution effort, sat silently as the verdict was sealed. So, 
too, the legal team that had defended the president. 
</P>
<P>
	For each article of impeachment, a clerk read the charges aloud,  
then Rehnquist said, ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, 
William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the lawmakers rose at their seats to respond. Sen.  
Spencer Abraham of Michigan was first, Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon 
was last. Between the votes, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West 
Virginia sat at his seat, perusing his breast pocket copy of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes, the trial -- the first since Andrew Johnson  
sat in the White House in 1868 -- was over. Under 19th century 
impeachment rules, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was 
formally notified of the results. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was exercising  
in the White House when he received word of the first vote in a 
phone call from his chief of staff, John Podesta. The president had 
returned to work in time to learn he was finally free of the threat 
of removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said later in the Rose Garden that he was ``humbled and very  
grateful for the support and the prayers I have received from 
millions of Americans over this past year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and  
renewal for America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' the president said. Similarly, staff members were sent an 
e-mail message from Clinton apologizing that ``my actions and the 
events they triggered have made your work even harder.'' He 
promised to ``redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we 
share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate votes, coming several months after the dismissal of  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, marked the second 
consecutive major legal and political victory for Clinton. He still 
faces the threat of an indictment from Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, either before or after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, the 74-year-old, white-haired chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee, said he hopes that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, he told reporters that despite the verdict  
``I have no regrets. We fulfilled our oath of office to discharge 
our duty according to the Constitution. And when people do that, 
when elected representatives do that, democracy works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had not been any doubt for weeks about the outcome, the  
only suspense coming over whether either article of impeachment 
would gain a majority. In the end, neither did. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia Snowe and  
Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter 
of Pennsylvania, voted to acquit the president on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	On perjury, there were five other Republicans voting to acquit:  
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard 
Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was harsh, bipartisan condemnation of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In comments late Thursday night, as senators were emerging from  
a third long day of closed-door deliberations on Clinton's fate, 
Utah Sen. Robert Bennett said that ``over and over again from both 
sides of the aisle,'' senators had denounced the president as a 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who alone among Democrats had  
voted earlier against dismissal of the charges, said ``President 
Clinton has disgraced himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said in a  
statement, ``I have never been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly 
disappointed again'' as he was in Clinton's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts were broadcast nationally to a public that had long  
since said it wanted the trial over -- but seemingly never tired of 
watching, reading and joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the politicians said it was time to move on, other key  
players in the sex and cover-up drama were only just starting to 
speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is expected to write a book and make several media  
appearances in the coming months. Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded 
conversations helped propel Starr's investigation, is also 
embarking on a series of media appearances to refurbish her image. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation began in January 1998, when the nation awoke  
to the shocking allegations that the president had had a sexual 
relationship with a young woman in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	His denials were famously forthright -- ``I did not have sexual  
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' he said a few days 
later. But that depended, it later developed, on the definition of 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a string of embarrassing disclosures, and at one point  
it turned out that Ms. Lewinsky had evidence of a sexual encounter, 
a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress what he said was evidence of impeachable  
offenses in September, 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of pages of salacious material was released to the  
public at cyber-speed. Republicans and Democrats went to war almost 
immediately in the House, and by year's end, the GOP muscled 
through a formal impeachment inquiry unlimited in time or scope. 
</P>
<P>
	Their drive was stalled at the elections, though, when the GOP  
lost seats in a campaign that was widely viewed as a referendum of 
sorts on the president's fate. Republicans returned to a lame duck 
session determined to wrap up the case speedily, and narrowly won 
approval of two of four articles of impeachment that had been 
approved by the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened in the Senate on Jan. 7, with the unforgettable  
sight of Rehnquist mounting the dais, senators vowing to do 
impartial justice and walking to the front of the chamber to sign 
an impeachment book. 
</P>
<P>
	The two legal teams clashed for days on end, but the real  
struggle played out in closed-door party caucuses. There, 
Democratic support for Clinton hardened. Republicans, sensing 
political damage, fractured.

<HEADLINE> GM: Others' Side Air Bags Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rival automakers are questioning findings by  
General Motors Corp. that some competitors' side air bags could 
seriously injure or kill children who are leaning against them 
during a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	At the media preview of the Chicago Auto Show on Thursday, GM  
played videotapes of tests that show the neck of a small test dummy 
being snapped forward violently as an air bag was deployed. The 
dummy representing a 3-year-old was positioned as if it were a 
child sleeping against the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Tape of the same test on GM's Chevrolet Venture minivan showed  
its side air bags deployed more gently. While GM's side air bags 
are as powerful as others, they allow some of the air to escape 
through vents if someone is seated too close. 
</P>
<P>
	GM did not identify whose air bags pose a threat. ``We're not  
interested in poking our competition in the eye,'' said Robert C. 
Lange, director of GM's safety center near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the announcement was immediately questioned by automakers  
who have led the industry in offering side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had three years of experience with this technology and  
we have not had a report of that sort of injury,'' said spokesman 
Steven Rossi of Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. ``We've put it 
through exhaustive testing and have not had any surprising 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Mitchell, a spokesman for another German automaker, BMW,  
said passengers are better off in a car with air bags than without. 
``The risk of injury from an air bag is nothing near the risk of 
injury from an accident,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While side air bags can reduce the risk of head, chest and  
pelvis injuries to properly seated and belted adults, there are no 
government regulations to guide automakers on how forceful side air 
bags should be to limit potential injury to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently  
asked automakers to thoroughly test side air bags with adult and 
child dummies in a variety of positions to determine the risk of 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	While front air bags have been blamed on the deaths of at least  
69 children and 56 adults since 1990, they have saved an estimated 
3,800 lives. There have been no documented deaths yet from side air 
bags, which have just entered the market in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Ford, several other automakers  
have introduced side air bags on some models recently. GM offers 
side air bags standard on its Chevy, Oldsmobile and Pontiac 
minivans, the Cadillac Seville and DeVille, and as an option on the 
subcompact Chevrolet Prizm.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Jefferson Clinton won bipartisan  
acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a searing national drama 
that tarnished him forever as the second president to be impeached. 
Clinton told Americans he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said 
and did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``hereby is acquitted of the charges,'' declared Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to 
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Senators also 
put the idea of censure aside, probably for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five  
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort  
led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Several 
Democrats said they did not expect the issue to resurface when 
lawmakers return to the Capitol after a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said one Republican,  
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who twice voted to convict the 
president and strip him of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for  
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, asked Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to autograph a blank Senate roll call form, 
then used it to record the results. Hyde the leader of the 
prosecution effort, sat silently as the verdict was sealed. So, 
too, the legal team that had defended the president. 
</P>
<P>
	For each article of impeachment, a clerk read the charges aloud,  
then Rehnquist said, ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, 
William Jefferson Clinton guilty or not guilty?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the lawmakers rose at their seats to respond. Sen.  
Spencer Abraham of Michigan was first, Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon 
was last. Between the votes, Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West 
Virginia sat at his seat, perusing his breast pocket copy of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes, the trial -- the first since Andrew Johnson  
sat in the White House in 1868 -- was over. Under 19th century 
impeachment rules, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was 
formally notified of the results. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was exercising  
in the White House when he received word of the first vote in a 
phone call from his chief of staff, John Podesta. The president had 
returned to work in time to learn he was finally free of the threat 
of removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said later in the Rose Garden that he was ``humbled and very  
grateful for the support and the prayers I have received from 
millions of Americans over this past year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and  
renewal for America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again to the American people how profoundly  
sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the 
great burden they have imposed on the Congress and the American 
people,'' the president said. Similarly, staff members were sent an 
e-mail message from Clinton apologizing that ``my actions and the 
events they triggered have made your work even harder.'' He 
promised to ``redouble my own efforts on behalf of the ideals we 
share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate votes, coming several months after the dismissal of  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, marked the second 
consecutive major legal and political victory for Clinton. He still 
faces the threat of an indictment from Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, either before or after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, the 74-year-old, white-haired chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee, said he hopes that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, he told reporters that despite the verdict  
``I have no regrets. We fulfilled our oath of office to discharge 
our duty according to the Constitution. And when people do that, 
when elected representatives do that, democracy works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had not been any doubt for weeks about the outcome, the  
only suspense coming over whether either article of impeachment 
would gain a majority. In the end, neither did. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia Snowe and  
Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter 
of Pennsylvania, voted to acquit the president on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	On perjury, there were five other Republicans voting to acquit:  
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard 
Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was harsh, bipartisan condemnation of Clinton's  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In comments late Thursday night, as senators were emerging from  
a third long day of closed-door deliberations on Clinton's fate, 
Utah Sen. Robert Bennett said that ``over and over again from both 
sides of the aisle,'' senators had denounced the president as a 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who alone among Democrats had  
voted earlier against dismissal of the charges, said ``President 
Clinton has disgraced himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said in a  
statement, ``I have never been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly 
disappointed again'' as he was in Clinton's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts were broadcast nationally to a public that had long  
since said it wanted the trial over -- but seemingly never tired of 
watching, reading and joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the politicians said it was time to move on, other key  
players in the sex and cover-up drama were only just starting to 
speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is expected to write a book and make several media  
appearances in the coming months. Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded 
conversations helped propel Starr's investigation, is also 
embarking on a series of media appearances to refurbish her image. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation began in January 1998, when the nation awoke  
to the shocking allegations that the president had had a sexual 
relationship with a young woman in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	His denials were famously forthright -- ``I did not have sexual  
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' he said a few days 
later. But that depended, it later developed, on the definition of 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a string of embarrassing disclosures, and at one point  
it turned out that Ms. Lewinsky had evidence of a sexual encounter, 
a stained dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress what he said was evidence of impeachable  
offenses in September, 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of pages of salacious material was released to the  
public at cyber-speed. Republicans and Democrats went to war almost 
immediately in the House, and by year's end, the GOP muscled 
through a formal impeachment inquiry unlimited in time or scope. 
</P>
<P>
	Their drive was stalled at the elections, though, when the GOP  
lost seats in a campaign that was widely viewed as a referendum of 
sorts on the president's fate. Republicans returned to a lame duck 
session determined to wrap up the case speedily, and narrowly won 
approval of two of four articles of impeachment that had been 
approved by the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened in the Senate on Jan. 7, with the unforgettable  
sight of Rehnquist mounting the dais, senators vowing to do 
impartial justice and walking to the front of the chamber to sign 
an impeachment book. 
</P>
<P>
	The two legal teams clashed for days on end, but the real  
struggle played out in closed-door party caucuses. There, 
Democratic support for Clinton hardened. Republicans, sensing 
political damage, fractured.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Cast of Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They never will shake their past, but the  
people embroiled in the Clinton impeachment drama are finding ways 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lewinsky, the presidential paramour-turned celebrity, is  
poised to tell her story her way. Linda Tripp, the woman with the 
secret tell-all tapes of the affair, wants to return to her desk at 
the Pentagon. Book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who encouraged the 
taping, is starting a radio talk show, but has no Clinton-Lewinsky 
books in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to relive it,'' she says. ``When Jonah got out of  
the whale, he didn't go back for his hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here are their post-impeachment plans:  
</P>
<P>
	BILL CLINTON. Only the second president ever impeached, Clinton  
will work to burnish his place in history. He plans to go to Mexico 
to meet President Ernesto Zedillo this week. His advisers say he is 
appearing at fund-raising events in nine cities, including San 
Francisco in two weeks, to help Democrats try to win back the House 
in 2000 and get Vice President Al Gore elected president. His 
agenda includes work on Social Security, Medicare, education, 
improving communities and maintaining economic growth. Impeachment 
does not necessarily end Clinton's legal problems. He still could 
be indicted after he leaves office, and legal sources say 
Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr concluded some time ago that 
he had the authority to indict a sitting president. 
</P>
<P>
	MONICA LEWINSKY. The former White House intern whose affair with  
Clinton led to his impeachment has not decided where she will 
reside. She spends time with friends, her mother in New York and 
her father in Los Angeles. A book on her story, being written by 
Andrew Morton, Princess Diana's biographer, is due out this year. 
She also has agreed to a planned television interview with Barbara 
Walters, but first must get permission from the independent 
counsel's office, which granted her immunity from prosecution for 
her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	KENNETH STARR. The independent counsel whose investigation  
spurred the impeachment is still investigating Clinton, 4 1/2 years 
after his appointment to look into Clinton's Arkansas land dealings 
during the 1980s. In 1997, Starr said he was going to Pepperdine 
University as dean of the law and public policy schools. His 
colleagues persuaded him to change his mind and he vowed to stay 
until his Clinton probes were over. Asked if he still would like to 
be on the Supreme Court, Starr told ABC in November, ``I guess the 
answer is yes ... but I think that time, had there been one, has 
long since passed.'' Starr took a leave of absence from his Chicago 
law firm after being criticized for working for private clients, 
including the tobacco industry, while he was investigating the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	LINDA TRIPP. The woman whose secret tapes of Ms. Lewinsky  
launched the investigation hopes to return to her former position 
at the Pentagon, her spokesman Philip Coughter says. Several 
publishers have approached Mrs. Tripp. Coughter says there is no 
deal, but she has not ruled out a book in the future. For now, she 
remains on the Pentagon payroll, working from home. She is 
developing a manual for running the Joint Civilian Orientation 
Conference, a program to familiarize opinion leaders nationwide 
with the military. Mrs. Tripp has set up a defense fund to pay in 
excess of $350,000 in legal fees, Coughter says. A grand jury is 
still investigating whether Mrs. Tripp broke Maryland's wiretap 
law, which makes it illegal to audiotape a conversation without 
another person's consent. In an NBC interview broadcast Friday, she 
said ``Yes, I would do it all again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LUCIANNE GOLDBERG. The New York book agent who encouraged Mrs.  
Tripp to tape her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky plans to serve as 
host of a radio talk show for syndication on 60 stations. The show, 
to air as early as this month, is tentatively called ``Vast 
Right-Wing Conspiracy,'' a play on Hillary Rodham Clinton's comment 
that radical conservatives were waging all-out war to bring down 
the president. She plans to keep a hand in her literary agency, 
which will be run by her two sons, but she has no Clinton-Lewinsky 
books in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. The nation's first lady, who earned  
respect for standing by her man, is mentioned as a possible 
candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y. Her confidants say she hasn't ruled it out, but 
for now will continue her work as first lady. A state dinner with 
the leader of Ghana is scheduled later this month, and she is 
planning a foreign trip next month. At home, Mrs. Clinton will work 
on family issues, child care, health care and foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	DAVID SCHIPPERS. The chief Republican investigator on the House  
Judiciary Committee plans to return to his Chicago law practice at 
the end of the month. ``Strange as it may seem, I've got a couple 
of sexual harassment cases and I've got a retaliation case, based 
on sexual harassment,'' Schippers says. 
</P>
<P>
	DAVID KENDALL. The Clintons' private lawyer since 1993 likely  
will continue to represent the first family as long as Starr's 
office is operating. 
</P>
<P>
	VERNON JORDAN: A close friend of the Clintons who testified at  
the impeachment trial via videotape, Jordan remains one of the 
Washington's best-known lawyers. Jordan, one of Clinton's golf 
buddies, sits on the boards of directors of nearly a dozen 
companies and is a partner at one of Washington's most prestigious 
law firms. Rarely in a courtroom, he is a bridge between corporate 
America and Washington's political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	WILLIAM GINSBURG. A Los Angeles medical malpractice lawyer who  
had long represented Ms. Lewinsky's father, Ginsburg was summoned 
to her side soon after she was confronted by Starr's prosecutors at 
a suburban Washington hotel in January 1998. He quickly became a 
fixture on TV talk shows and gave varying accounts of his client's 
reliability as a potential witness for Starr. Ginsburg eventually 
was replaced as Ms. Lewinsky's attorney by two veteran Washington 
lawyers. He returned to California, where he still practices law. 
Ginsburg told The New Yorker recently that he feels as if he 
suffered from traumatic stress syndrome from the case. ``It took 
months to recover,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CHARLES RUFF. A former Watergate prosecutor who led the  
president's team of seven lawyers, he will continue to manage the 
White House counsel's office, completing his impeachment work and 
handling regular jobs, including reviewing possible nominations for 
judgeships. Ruff, who is in a wheelchair because he contracted a 
paralyzing disease while working in Africa in the 1960s, has had an 
illustrious legal career, representing clients like Anita Hill, 
Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., and former Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL. A presidential aide who testified via  
videotape at the trial, he continues his work at the White House on 
themes, speeches and policies. ``I'm going to do what I've been 
during throughout,'' he says. His testimony became controversial 
when he said he never passed on to reporters derogatory information 
he had received from Clinton privately that Ms. Lewinsky was a 
``stalker.'' Two journalists have filed affidavits challenging that 
assertion. Some lawmakers have asked the Justice Department to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	PAULA JONES. The woman who filed a suit in 1994 alleging Clinton  
sexually harassed her in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel room, is still 
figuring out how to divide her $850,000 settlement among herself 
and her lawyers. A friend, Susan Carpenter McMillan, says Mrs. 
Jones, who is staying right now with her mother, is moving back to 
Little Rock. Late last year, Mrs. Jones did a paid TV interview 
with ``Inside Edition.'' ``She does have to figure out how to pay 
the $3 million worth of legal bills,'' McMillan says.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Seeks More TV Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Ty Votaw, the new LPGA commissioner,  
hopes to have more TV coverage of women's tournaments, as well as 
tapping into a global market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus will be on getting more of our tournaments on  
television (currently 33 of the 43), increasing the size of purses, 
and expanding internationally with more lucrative television 
packages from foreign nations such as Korea, Australia and 
Sweden,'' Votaw said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Presently, there are only five or six domestic tournaments  
that are not on television, and we're trying to get all of those on 
TV, be it national network or cable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw's goal of more international exposure should be helped by  
the multinational makeup of the women's tour, which includes such 
stars as Se Ri Pak of South Korea, Karrie Webb of Australia and 
Annika Sorenstam of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also striving to keep all the tournament fields strong  
and increase prize money,'' Votaw said. ``We now have 11 events 
with at least $1 million in purses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw, who replaced Jim Ritts, has been with the LPGA since  
1991. As vice president of business affairs, he was responsible for 
handling business transactions, including tournament sponsorships 
and television rights negotiations.

<HEADLINE> German Railway Faces Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) - The German railway plans to cut more  
jobs than previously announced, with up to 60,000 job eliminations 
by 2003, a magazine reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway spokesman Stephan Heimbach declined to confirm the  
figure cited by the magazine Der Spiegel but said ``the way the 
business runs dictates the need for personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been slimming down since the government approved  
a plan in 1992 to privatize the railway over eight years. At the 
time, there were nearly 400,000 railway employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The workforce had declined to 255,000 by last October, and  
18,000 jobs were already slated to be cut this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel cited an internal railway paper that it said shows  
plans exist to reduce the number of employees to 193,000 through 
early retirement and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly said that most of the workers affected, 31,000, are  
employed in the railway's networking system. Heimback confirmed 
that the networking division, which includes signaling and other 
systems, was being modernized and would no longer require such 
intensive preventive maintenance as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	GdED railway union chairman Norbert Hansen criticized the plan  
and demanded a make-work offensive, citing Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder's efforts to reduce Germany's high unemployment, 
currently above 11 percent. He said the railway should reduce 
overtime and retain more personnel.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Cheese Ad Assessments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It's the cheese -- and it's the law too, a  
federal appeals court ruled, upholding assessments on milk 
producers to pay for ads promoting California cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
rejected arguments by Gallo Cattle Co., the state's largest cheese 
maker, that its freedom of speech was violated by mandatory 
payments for ads it opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallo called the ads ``corny and even idiotic.'' The company  
said the underlying message -- that products bearing a ``Real 
California Cheese'' seal were superior -- suggested that all 
California cheeses were equal and that Gallo's was worse if it 
lacked the seal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court said the program was similar to a promotional  
campaign for California peaches, plums and nectarines upheld by the 
Supreme Court in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred M. Isaacs, a lawyer for Gallo, declined comment, saying he  
had not seen the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheese campaign is one of dozens run by federal and state  
regulators, using producer fees, to boost consumption of particular 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards proclaim ``It's the cheese!'' as the answer to such  
questions as why Wisconsin hates California and what's the only 
thing Berkeley never protested. 
</P>
<P>
	The trademarked seal can be used on any cheese that was made  
entirely from California milk, contains no preservatives and meets 
certain federal and state quality standards.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced a plan  
Friday to let disabled people earn more money before the government 
cuts off their cash and medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 1 percent of Americans who begin receiving disability  
benefits ever return to jobs, in part because of strict rules that 
cut benefits for those who earn $500 or more a month. Under the 
proposal Gore announced, the monthly limit would be raised to $700. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president said the plan would cost $1.2 billion over  
five years and could help at least 250,000 Americans with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to build an America in the 21st century where no one is  
denied a chance to contribute or a chance to lead because of a 
disability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration does not need congressional approval for the  
plan. After hearing public comment, the Social Security 
Administration can change the rules on its own. The new regulations 
are expected to take effect June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced the plan at a suburban hotel just minutes after  
the Senate voted to acquit President Clinton in his impeachment 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Eyes Promise of America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the Northeast's industrial revolution to  
the long struggle back from slavery and the social challenges 
facing immigrants, a new Smithsonian Institution exhibit chronicles 
the promise of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we approach a new millennium, it's important to look back  
at where we have been,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport, 
Conn., whose city was selected for a profile of the promise of 
industrialization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Communities in a Changing Nation,'' a permanent exhibit at the  
Museum of American History, uses Charleston, S.C., and its nearby 
Lowcountry rice plantations to illustrate life during and after 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the promise is still evolving, this exhibit gives us  
the opportunity to reflect on the abundant accomplishments of 
African Americans, and it inspires each of us to keep their hopes 
and dreams alive,'' said Vanessa Turner-Maybank, clerk of the 
council of the city of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	The third section of the exhibit, opening today, looks at the  
promise of a new life in Cincinnati, focus of a flood of Jewish 
immigrants from central Europe a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 19th century Cincinnati was a boomtown, a center for  
immigration, said Mayor Roxanne Qualls. ``As a result of the 
industriousness of the Jewish community at that time, Cincinnati 
developed many of its best-known industries,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the new exhibit is to explain the promise of America  
through specific communities. ``We hope it will help many people to 
remember and rediscover the challenges and opportunities of 19th 
century America,'' said curator Lonnie G. Bunch III. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum Director Spencer R. Crew said Bridgeport provided a  
strong example of early industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the other communities were picked to illustrate less  
well-known regions -- the rice plantations and free blacks of 
Charleston rather than the more studied cotton plantations; the 
Jewish immigrants to Cincinnati instead of the better-known floods 
of Irish and Germans elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	After passing an introductory area viewers begin in Bridgeport  
with ``Owners, Mechanics and Operatives: The Promise of 
Industrialization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wheeler and Wilson factory is the focus -- inside and  
outside. On view are an early sewing machine made at the factory, a 
milling machine and the factory gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A tool chest and union badge illustrate the struggles of the  
working class while the owners formed a new American aristocracy, 
illustrated by a social register and even an imitation medieval 
suit of armor, purchased to decorate the library of a grand home. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning a corner, visitors enter ``Jewish Immigrants: The  
Promise of a New Life,'' viewing such artifacts as a peddler's 
cart, a goldsmith's doll and historic wedding and engagement 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minhag Amerika,'' Rabbi Weiss' 1857 prayer book, is on  
display, reflecting the desire to find compromise between radical 
reform and more traditional Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally comes ``African Americans in Slavery and Freedom:  
Promise Deferred,'' where shackles hang on the wall and an old 
slave shack is populated by mannequins of children, recorded voices 
discussing life on the plantation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on display is city life in Charleston, where free slaves  
found work and traded. A register of ``free negroes'' is presented, 
along with a flag of the 84th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, the 
black unit that fought in the Civil War.

<HEADLINE> Valentine Cards Don't Amuse Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Pat Helmberger thought it was all in fun  
when she and a friend made Valentine's Day cards depicting Gov. 
Jesse Ventura in his wrestling garb, complete with pink hearts and 
a pink feather boa. 
</P>
<P>
	The response she got from Ventura was anything but affectionate.  
</P>
<P>
	Helmberger, a state Capitol secretary who runs a card business  
on the side, thought she was on firm legal ground with her card, 
which reads ``Happy Valentine's Day, Honey!'' on the outside and 
``Get Ready to Rumble'' inside. She has sold $200 worth of the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Two attorneys told her she was protected by First Amendment  
rights to free speech because Ventura was a public official. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured this is America,'' she said. ``I've seen lots of  
cards and things with politicians on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura figured otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
	Helmberger received a ``cease-and-desist'' letter Thursday from  
Ventura for Minnesota Inc., the nonprofit company that licenses 
Ventura products and hunts down unlicensed products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a former pro wrestler and movie actor, has become a hot  
marketing property, with everything from unauthorized ``Our 
governor can beat up your governor'' T-shirts to the official Jesse 
Ventura action figure due out in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being that his business relies heavily on his name and  
persona, it's in his interests to protect them during this interim 
period in which he's governor,'' said Ventura spokesman John 
Wodele. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has long guarded his intellectual property rights -- a  
developing part of the law that allows people to protect their name 
and likeness. In 1995, he was awarded $1 million from the World 
Wrestling Federation, which sold videotapes that used his image 
without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sumners, a Minneapolis intellectual property rights  
attorney, said Ventura has his rights, but there is an enormous 
gray area where First Amendment rights and the ``right to 
publicity'' intersect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cards appear to be purely commercial, so he probably would  
have a legal case there,'' he said. ``But if those same cards 
carried a political statement, that might well be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helmberger said she would be happy to share the profits with  
Ventura, but she won't become a licensee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll give him 10 percent,'' she said. ``That would be about 20  
bucks. I just don't want anyone telling me how I can or can't 
express myself artistically.''

	Clinton Is Acquitted by Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today acquitted President Clinton  
of perjury and obstruction of justice. It ended a 13-month scandal 
over his affair with ex-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
Senators voted 50-50 on the obstruction of justice impeachment 
article, far short of the two-thirds required to convict. The 
Senate had rejected the perjury charge by a 55-45 vote. So Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist declared the five-week trial ended. 
Thereafter, senators rejected a bid by Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
to force a vote today on her recommendation to censure Clinton. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Is 'Sorry' for Scandal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following his impeachment acquittal, President  
Clinton today offered and asked for forgiveness. At the White 
House, he said it should begin ``a time of reconciliation and 
renewal for America.'' Clinton said: ``I want to say again to the 
American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said and did 
to trigger these events, and the great burden they have imposed on 
the Congress and the American people.'' On Capitol Hill, Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Clinton wasn't vindicated. Of 
impeachment, Daschle said: ``This was a rebuke.'' 

</P>
<P>
	First Lady Ponders Senate Bid  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With her husband's impeachment trial over,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton is prepared to think about running for the 
Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``In 
the backdrop we've been in for the past few weeks, she wasn't in a 
position to do that,'' Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for the first 
lady, said. ``Clearly, there's a change in that situation, and at 
some point in the future I'm sure she will be giving thought to 
it.'' 

</P>
<P>
	American Opposes Pilots in Court  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a judge to find pilots in  
contempt for ignoring a back-to-work order as the nation's 
second-largest airline canceled hundreds of flights for all of the 
long holiday weekend. Stranded passengers fumed at airports across 
the country today as U.S. Judge Joe Kendall heard arguments on 
whether the Allied Pilots Union should be held in contempt for 
ignoring his back-to-work order. An estimated one out of every four 
American pilots continued to call in sick today in the job action 
over pilot pay levels. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Jet Bombs Iraqi Gun Position  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. jet returned safely after bombing an  
Iraqi anti-aircraft gun position that fired on it in the third 
``no-fly'' clash in three days, U.S. officials said. The incident 
occurred 250 miles north of Baghdad, said the U.S. European Command 
in Germany. The official Iraqi News Agency said one civilian was 
killed and another injured. American military officials said damage 
was still being assessed. 

</P>
<P>
	Oil Burns on Grounded Oregon Ship  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- A grounded, broken cargo ship blazed away  
today after it was set on fire to prevent a disastrous oil spill, 
with most of the fuel burning up before it could reach the 
shoreline. Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall added: ``Every gallon that 
is burned means one less gallon in the environment and the coastal 
habitat.'' The 639-foot New Carissa, a Japanese-owned freighter, 
ran aground Feb. 4. 

</P>
<P>
	US Finds Brazil, Japan Dumped Steel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department announced today it has  
found evidence that Brazil and Japan have illegally dumped steel in 
the United States at up to 70 percent below normal prices. The 
Clinton administration still faces difficult choices about how 
exactly to respond to complaints from U.S. steel companies and 
workers' unions. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Ends 88.57 Lower  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, led by a decline in  
technology shares after analysts warned that Dell Computer's sales 
growth may be slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 
88.57 to close at 9,274.89. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 
2,235-824. Broader stock indicators also fell, including the 
technology-laden Nasdaq, which was down 83.61 at 2,321.94. 

</P>
<P>
	49ers Trade Barker, Smith to Browns  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Defensive end Roy Barker and tight  
end Irv Smith, both key players for the San Francisco 49ers, were 
traded today to the Cleveland Browns for unspecified past 
considerations. A source close to the 49ers said the deal was 
linked to the Browns' selection of cornerback Antonio Langham in 
Tuesday's expansion draft, relieving San Francisco of a free-agent 
bust and a $3 million salary.

<HEADLINE> Racing Journalist Tower Dead at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whitney Tower, a long-time racing journalist and  
former chairman of the National Racing Museum and Hall of Fame, is 
dead at 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower died Thursday at his home in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He had  
been ill since suffering a stroke last year.

	He left SI in 1975 to join Classic, a new magazine devoted to  
horse racing. Classic survived only a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tower was president of the museum's board of directors from 1982  
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for Tower will be held Tuesday at St. James

<HEADLINE> Report: TV Exec Denies IOC Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An American TV network executive  
reportedly denied playing host to Australian Olympic official Phil 
Coles at the 1995 Super Bowl and said Coles was a guest of the head 
of the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has been implicated in the scandal surrounding the  
Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, said he 
attended the Super Bowl as a guest of CBS, which had the U.S. TV 
rights to the Winter Games at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But former CBS executive Rick Gentile said it was clear Coles  
was a guest of the head of Salt Lake City's bid, Tom Welch, and 
said he didn't even attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I flew home to New York on the morning of the game to watch it  
on TV,'' Gentile told the Sydney Morning Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been accused by the board of ethics of the Salt Lake  
City organizing committee of using four trips supplied by the bid 
committee for ``recreational'' purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old IOC delegate and former Olympic kayaker has  
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he visited the city once on an official visit permitted  
under IOC guidelines and made several post-bid visits, paying for 
his own airfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IOC has reportedly agreed to reduce the  
commission it receives from future sponsorship deals negotiated by 
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, in a 
windfall worth up to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC agreed the commission, usually 5 percent, will fluctuate  
from zero to 4 per cent for the remaining $130 million SOCOG needs 
to meet its revenue targets, a report in Sydney's Daily Telegraph 
said.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Wins Giant Slalom World Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Norway's Lasse Kjus fashioned the quickest  
second run to win the men's giant slalom on Friday and collect his 
fourth medal in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who now owns two gold and two silver medals in four events  
with a slalom remaining on Sunday, overtook Liechtenstein's Marco 
Buechel, who was the surprise leader of the first run, to win by 
.05 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel settled for the silver medal in the best finish of his  
career, and Switzerland's Steve Locher captured the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, trailed Buechel by .25 seconds after the first run but  
forged a second run of 1 minute, 7.75 seconds for a combined time 
of 2:19.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel was faster than Kjus early in his second heat but lost  
time in the middle and bottom sections. He was timed in 1:08.05 -- 
the second-fastest of the afternoon runs but not fast enough to 
hold off Kjus. Buechel's combined time was 2:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing, unbelievable,'' Kjus said. ``I knew if I  
wanted a medal, I had to ski aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest gold I've ever won. To me, giant slalom is  
the most challenging event, the most technically difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Locher, in fifth place after the initial run, finished in  
2:20.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Fredrik Nyberg and Switzerland's Paul Accola tied for  
fourth in 2:21.14. Italy's Patrick Holzer was sixth in 2:21.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, who leads the World Cup  
giant slalom standings and is the defending world champion in GS, 
couldn't overcome a ninth-place finish in the first run and was 
seventh overall in 2:21.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria, which has dominated these championships, had its worst  
showing in eight races. Christian Mayer was Austria's top finisher, 
placing eighth in 2:21.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., was the top American, finishing  
18th in 2:23.13. Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, was 24th, in 
2:24.23, one spot ahead of Canada's Thomas Grandi, in 2:24.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel, first out of the start gate in the morning, posted a  
time of 1:11.31 on an icy, steep course in brisk, but sunny, 
15-degree weather. Kjus, skiing 14th, was .34 seconds off Buechel's 
time at the first and second intermediate clockings but gained 
slightly on the bottom to finish in 1:11.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian rookie Benjamin Raich stood third, .41 seconds off the  
pace at 1:11.72. World Cup overall leader Hermann Maier of Austria, 
seeking his third gold medal in these championships, was fourth in 
1:11.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was one of three medal contenders who failed to finish the  
second run, held in warmer conditions. He and Norway's Kjetil Andre 
Aamodt both lost edges on Pepi's Face, the final steep slope before 
the finish. Raich lost an edge and missed a gate early in his 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the steep, I got on my boot,'' said Maier, explaining that  
the side of his boot hit the snow, disengaging his ski. ``I was 
risking full. When I came into the pitch down here, I was maybe too 
aggressive. But I'm very happy. The downhill gold was the one I 
wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan Eberharter of Austria, another favorite, skied into soft  
snow and skidded wide of a gate, failing to finish the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being shut out, Austria retained its lead in medals with  
12. Runner-up Norway has seven.

<HEADLINE> Youth Wins Out in `Babes in Arms' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Youth does win out.  
</P>
<P>
	It has taken a sparkling concert version of ``Babes in Arms'' to  
make us realize how much we have been missing in this most 
musically barren of theater seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that its story is a variation on the tale of ``Hey kids,  
let's put on show.'' How many musicals boast a score that contains 
as many standards as this 1937 Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart 
collaboration -- ``Where or When,'' ``I Wish I Were in Love Again,'' 
``My Funny Valentine,'' ``Johnny One Note'' and ``The Lady Is a 
Tramp''? 
</P>
<P>
	Director and choreographer Kathleen Marshall is the evening's  
heroine, pulling together a cast of largely unknown young 
performers for this year's opening offering of ``Encores! Great 
American Musicals in Concert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Concert'' has become something of a misnomer at these annual  
proceedings. Performers do carry bound copies of the script, the 
excellent orchestra (under the inspired direction of Rob Fisher) 
does sit on stage and microphones are scattered prominently across 
the front of the large playing area. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Marshall has done such a splendid job of moving the musical,  
including two large-scale dance numbers, that the production has 
the feeling of a fully staged show. 
</P>
<P>
	If ``Babes in Arms'' is to succeed, it must capture the high  
spirits its title suggests. This concert does -- with talent to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
	David Campbell and Erin Dilly, the musical's leads, exude the  
brashness and sass that the rousing title song only suggests. Yet 
when necessary, they can be meltingly romantic, especially when 
singing ``Where or When,'' one of Rodgers and Hart's finest love 
songs. Dilly also delivers an exuberant version of ``The Lady Is a 
Tramp,'' while ricocheting across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering fine support are Melissa Rain Anderson as a former  
child star, who can still belt out a song; a fleet-footed Kevin 
Cahoon as an impressionistic Irish sweepstakes winner, and little 
Cartier Anthony Williams, a tap-dancer who could be a younger 
version of Savion Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimal story, about the children of touring vaudevillians,  
youngsters who may be forced to go to a work farm unless the revue 
they are staging succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that never happens. This is musical comedy after all.  
But the device that wraps up the plot literally falls from the sky, 
in the form of a French aviator, who is a Gallic equivalent of 
Lucky Lindy. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs, particularly in the original orchestrations by Hans  
Spialek, don't sound as if they are more than 60 years old. They 
are fresh and fun, just like the show itself.

<HEADLINE> America West Moves Closer to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Flight attendants for America West Airlines  
neared a strike Friday, rejecting binding arbitration with the 
airline over salary issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on the eve now of a major dispute. America West has put  
us here,'' said Bill McGlashen, president of the America West 
Association of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the National Mediation Board asked the airline and  
flight attendants to submit to arbitration, but McGlashen said the 
union rejected the request on Friday in an effort to pressure the 
company to bring a quick end to the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the board acknowledges the rejection, the countdown for a  
30-day ``cooling off'' period will begin and the union can declare 
a strike at any time after that. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, America West criticized the flight attendants'  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision by the flight attendants' union is not  
surprising,'' said Greg Garger, vice president in charge labor 
relations. ``It reflects an attitude among its leadership that 
favors confrontation versus negotiation and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGlashen said salaries for America West flight attendants put  
them at the bottom of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants to bring America West salaries in line with  
average pay of the top 10 airlines -- an increase in the top pay 
scale from $21,972 to $32,724. The airline has said flight 
attendants are paid an average of $22,856 annually for 115 hours a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendants also want to receive the same per diem rates as  
the pilots, $1.80 per hour away from their base city. The 
attendants currently get no per diem. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap between the union and the company on salary and per diem  
issues adds up to about $16.5 million, McGlashen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking for a phenomenal amount of money. We're not  
asking to be rich, just to be brought up to industry standards,'' 
said Deanna Clarkson, a spokeswoman for America West flight 
attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing to the union's salary demands would not keep the  
airline from being competitive, McGlashen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, America West has logged record profits. America  
West Holdings Corp., the airline's parent company, racked up $108.6 
million in profits last year, exceeding the previous record set in 
1997 at $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is making money. We're not,'' McGlashen said.  
``Arbitration takes a long time. We have waited four years. We are 
not going to wait any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said if a strike is declared, it will be a  
series of random strikes. Flight attendants will simply fail to 
show up for randomly selected flights in targeted cities. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike at America West could make travelers' woes worse as  
pilots at Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines continued to 
call in sick as part of their own labor dispute on Friday. The 
airline canceled more than half of its flights Friday leaving 
thousands of travelers stranded in airports around the country.

<HEADLINE> Draft Is Key To Winning at Daytona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The art of drafting, not speed, will  
determine the Daytona 500 champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Jeff Gordon: Being behind at the right time can be even  
more important than being ahead in the 200-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't play the draft right, it doesn't matter how much  
speed you have,'' said Gordon, the 1997 Daytona winner who'll start 
from the pole Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafting is perhaps the least understood technique in stock car  
racing. A driver hugs the bumper of the car ahead of him -- 
sometimes getting within inches -- and uses the airflow over and 
around it for momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	That allows him to get into position to make a move around the  
lead car and eventually take the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be some shuffling going on and there's  
certain times in the race when that stuff's OK,'' Gordon said, 
``but after you get past the halfway point of the race, you want to 
get the lead and keep it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy puts a premium on good pit stops, something that  
Gordon usually gets from his Hendrick Motorsports crew. If it does 
keep him out front, Gordon needs to use his ability in the draft to 
stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to work hard to stay in front of those guys and not  
let them get a run on you,'' the two-time defending Winston Cup 
champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be a preview of the 43-car main event, Gordon was  
out front for 38 laps in his qualifying race on Thursday. Then 
Bobby Labonte and Ken Schrader ganged up on him and roared past 
high up on the banking of the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon managed to regain second place a few laps later, but it  
was Labonte, another favorite in Sunday's race, who held on for the 
victory in the 50-lap preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really wasn't anything I could do when those guys went  
together, and that's what you have to worry about in these races,'' 
Gordon said. ``You try to move around and keep them from getting a 
good run at you, but sometimes you just can't hold them up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But trying to pass in the draft can be a disaster if you don't  
get some help from another car. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have the right amount of momentum and some help  
when you make a commitment to pass a car, you probably won't get 
past him,'' said Rusty Wallace, who'll start 10th Sunday. ``Then 
those guys will line up behind the void that you left and 
freight-train right on past you. You've got to make real sure when 
you make that commitment that you can get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That puts a premium on patience, a virtue not often attributed  
to race drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe how tough it is sometimes to stay in line  
lap after lap,'' Labonte said. ``It can be real frustrating because 
you want to get out and race. But, if you try it, and nobody goes 
with you, you're hung out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A car working alone often cannot pass in a draft because it  
doesn't have enough momentum. One way to make a pass is to work 
with another car or two to form a separate draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield hope to do just that on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you can't find each other out there often enough to  
make a difference,'' Wallace said. ``But last year, somehow we were 
together most of the day and, man, did that help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A late scramble separated the teammates at the Daytona 500 last  
February. Mayfield held on for third; Wallace got kicked back to 
fifth. But, in theory, their cooperation could get one of them to 
victory lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to work together the same way we did last  
year,'' Mayfield said. ``I hope we can draft right to the end and 
one of us wins and the other finishes second. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, somehow, it always winds up being every man for  
himself.''

<HEADLINE> What if You Can't Earn a Living? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The most important financial asset for many  
people isn't a house, car, or even investment portfolio. It's 
earning power. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet while most individuals will protect themselves from the loss  
of personal property, few consider the consequences of losing the 
ability to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can lose everything you own,'' the Society of Financial  
Service Professionals noted in a recent newsletter urging investors 
to annually review insurance coverage. ``Most people give little 
thought to how they would handle ... mortgage and car payments, 
college tuition, grocery bills and utility expenses if their income 
suddenly ceased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of those ages 35 to 65 will suffer a disability  
for at least 90 days during their working careers; about one in 
seven can expect to become disabled for five years or more, 
according to the Health Insurance Association of America. It 
estimates 8 million adults have some disability that limits or 
prevents them from working now. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security, worker's compensation or employer disability  
insurance fills in some income gaps for some people, but each has 
it's shortcomings: Social Security won't kick in until at least six 
months after a disability and carries many restrictions; worker's 
comp only covers disabilities due to a job and certain occupations 
aren't covered; and employer plans typically last up to six months 
and end when employment ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial advisers say private disability insurance, which  
provides monthly payments of around 60 percent of current income 
for an extended time, is crucial for most working adults -- just as 
life, homeowners' and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical income-replacement plan pays policy holders if they  
can no longer work in the field in which they were employed or 
trained, or makes up the difference if they no longer can earn as 
much as they once did in their chosen field. A 40-year-old 
nonsmoking professional male could expect to pay about $1,000 a 
year on premiums for a standard plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a policy, however, may take some work. More and more  
carriers, burned by fraud, have stopped offering individual 
policies, opting to focus on group plans. Those still offering such 
plans have placed more restrictions on them or have greatly limited 
coverage options. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one area of insurance where people buy too little  
... (and) this is one area where insurers don't oversell their 
product,'' said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the 
Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He says agents typically don't push for disability plans because  
commissions are lower than those on other products, like life 
insurance. The reason for that, the insurance carriers acknowledge, 
is because such plans are more costly to provide and more difficult 
to underwrite. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 200 carriers are active in the $10 billion disability  
insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Frantzen, senior vice president of group long-term  
disability for UNUM Life Insurance Co. of Portland, Maine, says it 
has become increasingly difficult determining the level of 
benefits, particularly for professionals working in evolving 
industries. Take the physician, for example: 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of benefit that's issued is geared toward a  
person's income at that time ... but what about changing pay levels 
due to managed care?'' he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	UNUM, one of the largest providers of disability insurance, has  
redesigned its products. In 1994, it abandoned its most liberal 
offering -- the nondeductible guaranteed renewable plan, Frantzen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While costs vary widely, Frantzen says individuals can save at  
least 40 percent on premiums by purchasing policies within a group. 
Even if a company doesn't provide coverage, an employee can ask if 
such a group can be formed with other employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those shopping for a plan will find a wide range of options.  
</P>
<P>
	For starters, the definition of ``disability'' will vary. ``Own  
occupation'' means you're considered disabled if you can't perform 
the duties of your usual job; ``any occupation'' means you'll only 
be considered disabled if you're unable to work at any job. 
</P>
<P>
	Policies generally are offered in two forms: short-term, for  
five years or less, and long-term, up to age 65 or for a lifetime. 
The longer the coverage, the higher the cost.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Income Vary By State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mississippi retained the dubious honor of  
poorest state in the nation, with more than one in five people 
living in poverty, while New Hampshire remained the state with the 
smallest poor population -- just 6.9 percent, the government 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty dropped in every state except Hawaii, Idaho and Montana  
between 1993 and 1995, according to the new report from the Census 
Bureau, which also estimates poverty rates for every county in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 13.8 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 1995.  
A family of four was considered poor if its income was below 
$15,569 per year. For a family of three, it was $12,158. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also examined median income levels in every state and  
county. Nationally, the typical family earned $34,076 in 1995, but 
that ranged considerably across the country -- from $25,354 in West 
Virginia to $44,345 in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The variations are explained by a variety of factors, including  
the economic conditions in each state, the types of industry and 
demographics such as the proportion of single-parent households, 
said Gregory Acs, senior research associate at the Urban Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, some $20 billion in federal money is allocated based  
on the poverty rates in each county. That includes about $8 billion 
in Title I education dollars to aid schools serving disadvantaged 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Because so much rides on these numbers, the Census Bureau  
updates its estimates every few years, rather than waiting for the 
official census every 10 years. The latest update is based on 1995 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic conditions can change rapidly,'' the Census Bureau  
said in its summary of the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The last report was conducted for 1993, when the economy was not  
as strong. As a result, poverty was higher and incomes were lower. 
Each estimate is based on a three-year average, meaning the 1993 
figures represented the 1992-1994 average, and the 1995 figures 
average 1994-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1995, the poverty rate dropped in every state  
except Hawaii, Idaho and Montana, plus the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Median incomes rose in every state, as would be expected because  
the figures were not adjusted for inflation. Half the families have 
incomes above the median level and half have incomes below. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long economic expansion and the very low unemployment  
rates are clearly having a beneficial impact on family incomes, and 
you can see that in the drop in poverty rates, not just nationally 
but in virtually every state,'' Acs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mississippi, two other states -- Louisiana and New Mexico  
-- and the District of Columbia had poverty rates above 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen others -- largely Southern states -- had poverty rates  
over 15 percent: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Texas and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides New Hampshire, 12 other states -- mostly in the Northeast  
and Midwest -- had poverty rates below 10 percent: Connecticut, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Utah and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Acs noted that living in poverty may be very different in  
different states. There is one poverty level for the nation, but 
some states have much higher costs of living, meaning families that 
are not officially ``poor'' may still be struggling. Similarly, 
poor families living in low-cost areas may be better off than their 
counterparts elsewhere.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya Says Quartey Bout a Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya is unbeaten, but not  
unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
	So the WBC welterweight champion knows Ike Quartey can provide a  
positive answer for him to a question often asked of young, 
successful fighters: ``Who has he beaten?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first real test in my boxing career,'' De  
La Hoya (29-0, 24 knockouts) said of his 147-pound title defense 
Saturday night in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. ``He is a former world 
champion. He is unbeaten. I took this fight because I know that 
style wise Ike Quartey -- heavy hitter, dangerous puncher -- will 
bring out the best in me. I'm up for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey also sees the match as ``definitely my biggest fight.  
It's biggest challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has predicted he'll meet the challenge with a knockout.  
</P>
<P>
	While the 29-year-old Quartey certainly is not as well-known to  
U.S. boxing fans as De La Hoya victims Pernell Whitaker, Hector 
Camacho and Julio Cesar Chavez (twice), he certainly has impressive 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger from Ghana was WBA welterweight champion in  
1995-97 until stripped by that organization for not making a 
mandatory defense in a prescribed time. He also is unbeaten, 
although he was knocked down and held to a draw by Jose Lopez in 
his last title defense, which also was his last fight Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``who's he beaten'' clique, which includes Quartey, contends  
De La Hoya might not have won the Whitaker fight and that Camacho 
and Chavez were past their primes when he fought them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about fighting and winning,'' said De La Hoya, who  
turned 26 Feb. 4. ``It (criticism) doesn't bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But De La Hoya knows that when a fighter commands the kind of  
purses he gets -- a $9 million guarantee Saturday night -- he is 
expected to do more than just win. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to win impressively,'' he said. ``A decision is nice,  
I'd be happy with that. But a strong knockout over an opponent 
everyone is talking about, that would be nice, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for caliber of opposition, De La Hoya took a couple of verbal  
jabs at Quartey was his draw against Lopez and his decision win 
against Oba Carr in a title defense in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a tough fight against Lopez and he claimed he was  
sick,'' De La Hoya said. ``He was up against a good fighter, and he 
made an excuse. It was not a walk in the park against Oba Carr, who 
is not the most dangerous fighter out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Who has he (Quartey) fought?''  
</P>
<P>
	Quartey is just happy to be getting a payday (a $3 million  
purse) after having three fights fall through in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A match against Whitaker was canceled when Whitaker tested  
positive for cocaine after a fight. A fight against IBF 
welterweight champion Felix Trinidad failed to materialize when 
Trinidad became embroiled in litigation with promoter Don King. His 
challenge to De La Hoya set for Nov. 21 was postponed when De La 
Hoya suffered a minor cut over his left eye while sparring and said 
he did want to risk fighting at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 De La Hoya, tall for a welterweight, weighed in  
officially Friday at 147 pounds. The 5-8 Quartey weighed 146 1/2 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot of criticism comes from my opponents being  
smaller,'' De La Hoya said. ``That's not my fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said he thought he would weight 152-153 pounds by  
fight time and that ``Quartey will be in the 160s. He always has 
been. That's not natural, it's all water weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should he win, De La Hoya is next expected to fight the winner  
of a 10-round match between Carr and Frankie Randall on Saturday's 
pay-per-view show. The fight set for May 22 would be held in a 
12,000-seat arena at the new Mandalay Bay and be televised by HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is rooting for Randall, a 37-year-old former WBA  
super lightweight champion. Carr is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr wouldn't motivate me as much as Randall would,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``Frankie is still hungry. He has a name. He'd help 
me fill up an arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens to the Carr-Randall winner if Quartey wins remains  
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	In another undercard fight Saturday night, Erik Morales of  
Mexico will defend the WBC super bantamweight title against Angel 
Chacon of Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Oil Burns on Grounded Oregon Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- A grounded, broken cargo ship blazed away  
Friday after it was set on fire to prevent a disastrous oil spill, 
and the strategy appeared to be working, with most of the fuel 
burning up before it could reach the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did the right thing,'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer  
Gene Maestas. ``By burning the oil we prevented it from spilling 
into the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall added: ``Every gallon that is burned  
means one less gallon in the environment and the coastal habitat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot New Carissa, a Japanese-owned freighter, ran  
aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards offshore with nearly 400,000 gallons 
of diesel and tarlike bunker oil on board. It began leaking Monday 
as the pounding waves widened cracks in its hull, sending streaks 
of goo over six miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts made the daring decision to burn the hulk before the  
ship broke up and fouled Oregon's coast with the molasses-like 
fuel. They used explosives to set it ablaze on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the blaze erupted into a tremendous fireball, the  
ship broke into two huge pieces, which experts said was not 
unexpected and no reason for alarm. Flames still raged Friday on 
the stern section. Salvage crews boarded the bow section and tossed 
flares into one cargo hold to reignite the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Infrared images of the burning wreckage Friday morning revealed  
that about two-thirds of the fuel has already burned away, and that 
no more than 10 percent of the load had spilled onto the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon environmental officials said that even the air pollution  
from the burning wreckage was minimal. Mike Szerlog, a spokesman 
for the Department of Environmental Quality, said the pollution 
levels in the town of Coos Bay were ``less than a good day in 
L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities estimated that by Friday night, nearly 90 percent of  
the fuel would have burned and much of the rest would have been 
reduced to a waxy residue. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, the rest of the oil will be removed, and the  
wreckage cut up and hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
	Burning of a ship's oil to save beaches had never before been  
tried in the Lower 48 states, and officials said that the success 
of the New Carissa could make it a more common option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like it is something that will be scrutinized and  
accepted throughout the world,'' said Jerry Craft of Williams Fire 
and Hazard Control, a Baton Rouge, La., company that puts out oil 
platform fires. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 workers in yellow slickers have fanned out on the  
beach with shovels and plastic bags to scrape up oil, and 
authorities put out a call for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Five dead birds have been found and state wildlife officials  
reported two Western snowy plovers spotted with oil were seen 
flying away. Only about 100 breeding pairs of the birds can be 
found in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Peter DeFazio said he plans to file a bill to  
prevent companies from shipping good under ``flags of 
convenience,'' or countries with histories of not following 
international law for training and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama, where the New Carissa is registered, is on the Coast  
Guard's watch list of such countries, the Oregon Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFazio said his proposal would make ships that are registered  
in countries on the list stop at international borders 12 miles out 
to sea until they receive a U.S pilot or are found competent to 
enter U.S. waters. ``That would prevent these disasters from 
happening in the future,'' DeFazio said.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Person Dies From Ford Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A third worker died Friday from injuries in an  
explosion at a Ford Motor Co. plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Blow, 51, had been in critical condition since the Feb. 1  
accident at the company's Rouge complex. Thirteen other workers 
remained hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	A state inspector said the explosion was caused by a natural gas  
buildup inside a coal-fired boiler at the power station. A final 
determination of the cause is expected this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex makes Ford Mustangs as well as engines and a variety  
of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North American 
assembly plants. Production resumed this week.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Naomi Nari Nam's first trip to the  
national championships as a senior turned into one big headache. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year-old was in the midst of a near-perfect short program  
Thursday night when she fell on a triple flip and smacked her head. 
She appeared ready to stop skating, hesitating and rubbing her 
head, but then she got right back into her program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling OK. I'm feeling better already,'' Nam said. ``I  
will be OK for the long program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nam finished strongly, nailing a triple toe and all the rest of  
her elements to finish fourth. She rubbed her head again as she 
skated off the ice, and coach John Nicks checked the bump before 
putting his arm around her shoulder and hugging her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was treated for a bump on the head and a strained neck.  
</P>
<P>
	Nam, who won the novice title in 1997, said she fell because she  
rushed into the jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I did wrong,'' she said. ``I'll do better in the  
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nam spins better than everyone but Michelle Kwan, and she's got  
the potential to be on the medals podium someday very soon. But 
even if she finishes in the top three at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships -- the ladies free skate is Saturday night -- she's too 
young to make the world championship team. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUNIOR RESULTS:* After hitting seven triple jumps, Ryan Bradley  
had one thought on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thrilled to be done and not have to worry about  
breathing anymore,'' said Bradley, who won the junior men's crown 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, 15, of Colorado Springs, Colo., also won the short  
program and clearly was the best in a field of 17. He edged Don 
Baldwin of San Diego and Parker Pennington of Windsor, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who was 10th at the 1999 World Junior Championships,  
said his performance at nationals was the best he's ever skated. He 
joined such future senior men's champions as Dick Button (1945), 
Scott Hamilton (1976), Brian Boitano (1978) and Todd Eldredge 
(1987) as a junior winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great to be up there with the big guys. I have never  
really had a title like this,'' said Bradley, whose previous best 
national finish was second in novice a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sima and Amir Ganaba, who were only fifth in novice nationals  
last year, won the junior pairs event. Their throw double salchow 
and throw double loop were enormous, putting them comfortably ahead 
of Jaisa MacAdam and Garrett Lucash. Another brother-sister team, 
Megan and Dustin Sierk, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAN I GET A RIDE?* As if six hours of training a day isn't  
enough, pairs skater Craig Joeright puts in a few hours on the 
Zamboni. 
</P>
<P>
	Joeright, who skates with Larisa Spielberg, is working three  
jobs to keep his career going. He teaches at the Detroit Skating 
Club, drives a Zamboni and is also a waiter at a local restaurant. 
Oh, yeah, he takes two classes at Oakland University, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joeright isn't all work and no play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really want a new car,'' he said of his hard work. He's got  
a 1992 Oldsmobile Achieva now and wants to trade up for a Ford 
Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
	Joeright and partner Larisa Spielberg are eighth heading into  
tonight's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REWARDING PERFECTION:* Michelle Kwan is doing her part to help  
out the U.S. Figure Skating Association's memorial fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet Cavalier is donating $1,000 each time a skater is  
awarded a 6.0 -- the perfect mark -- in the short program at 
nationals and Kwan was the only skater to get one. She received a 
6.0 for presentation in the short program Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve high school students will receive $1,000 scholarship  
stipends from the USFSA and Chevrolet. The winners will be 
announced later this week.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels 1,170 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A judge's back-to-work prescription for American  
Airlines' pilots hasn't cured the labor clash that has grounded 
hundreds of flights and stranded thousands of passengers across the 
country for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots calling in sick and refusing to fly overtime grounded  
more than half of American Airlines' 2,250 scheduled flights 
Thursday, a day after a federal judge ordered them to return to the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,170 cancellations -- the most in a single day since  
problems began Saturday -- left angry passengers stuck in airports 
as the Presidents Day holiday weekend drew near. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucia Bernan fretted about how she and her 4-year-old daughter,  
Melanie, would get home to Caracas, Venezuela, after their flight 
out of Miami was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is so disorganized that it's extremely hard to  
believe this is actually happening,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall, who on Wednesday ordered pilots  
back to work, scheduled a hearing in Dallas today on the airline's 
request to hold the Allied Pilots Association in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if pilots return to work immediately, travel is expected to  
be disrupted for days as planes and crews are moved from city to 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 3,800 flights have been canceled since  
Saturday, affecting more than 380,000 travelers. Analysts have 
predicted the airline will lose millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	American estimated that 2,400 of its 9,400 pilots -- one in every  
four -- called in sick Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised by the conduct of the union leadership,'' said  
John Hotard, a spokesman for AMR Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas-based 
parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Union President Rich LaVoy urged pilots to return to work. But  
during a previous pilot sickout against American in 1990, many 
failed to return despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are disgruntled over pay disparities that have resulted  
from American's slow integration of recently purchased Reno Air. 
Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an 
experienced American pilot is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said the pilot union's demands to add Reno pilots to the  
higher pay scale more quickly would cost as much as $50 million 
this year, and no progress has been reported in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots are barred by federal law from striking over the  
issue, but federal regulations require pilots to call in sick if 
they think they are undue emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jim Philpot, a union spokesman, said: ``We are meeting or  
exceeding the judge's requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, passengers were still trying to reschedule or get  
refunds, swamping American's reservation desk with calls and 
finding themselves disconnected or waiting on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Midge Griffin of Cincinnati had been at Chicago's  
O'Hare International Airport since Wednesday trying to get a flight 
to Ecuador to visit their daughter. They'd purchased discount 
tickets, which gave their travel plans a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the bottom of the barrel,'' Griffin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had been bumped three times in efforts to get on a  
flight to Miami, which, like Chicago, is one of American's hub 
operations. The Griffins were trying unsuccessfully Thursday to get 
a flight back home, with plans to try the trip again in September.
