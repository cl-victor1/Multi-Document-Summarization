<HEADLINE> Turkey Signs 430-Million-Dollar Chopper Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Undersecretariat for
Defense Industries (SSM) today signed a 430-million-deal with
Eurocopter and Sikorsky firms to produce 30 Cougar helicopters
for the Turkish Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony here, Turkish Defense Minister Turhan
Tayan said that Turkey has made important developments in the
airplane industry over the past 10 years in a bid to meet
emergency needs for the national defense.
</P>
<P>
The joint production project, with around 30 percent local
input, will be carried out at both the Eurocopter base in
France and the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) plant
near Ankara, which has produced F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The first two cougars will be produced in the Eurocopter
bases and will be delivered to Turkey in July 1999. The other 28
Cougars will be produced in the TAI plant.
</P>
<P>
The project for producing the Cougars will be finished at
the end of year of 2002.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of Cougars will be an advanced version
of the Cougars that will be built in Turkey for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
Out of 30 Cougars, 10 will be produced for general
purpose, 16 for search and rescue and four for armed search
and rescue.

<HEADLINE> German Scientists Find Ways to Kill Cancer Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Berlin scientists have found
that they can label cancer cells with magnetic nanoparticles and
destroy them with heat activated by external magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
This means for the first time, the heat treatment or
hyperthermia -- so far only complementary to surgery, chemotherapy
and radiotherapy in tackling tumours -- will be able to function
directly on cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
Medical sources said the success was achieved at the radiology
clinic of Berlin's Rudolf Virchow University where scientists have
cured laboratory mice of artificially induced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Similar tests were undertaken in the United States in the
1950s, but failed because of the lack satisfactory nanoparticles.
</P>
<P>
Nanoparticles are minute spherical bodies, only a few millionth
of a millimetre in diameter. The magnetic nanoparticles used in
Berlin are provided by the Saarland Institute for New Materials in
Saarbruecken. They are made of iron oxide and their surface can be
camouflaged against the immune system.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, scientists found that cancer cells absorb a lot of
certain types of nanoparticles and pass them on to daughter
cells. When an external magnetic field is switched on, the
magnetic nanoparticles will heat up and cause only the cancer
cells to die at between 43 and 46 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The whole process has so far been found to be
"innocuous". However, it is believed it will still be a few years
before the process can be tried on human bodies.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 975,000 U.S. dollars would have to be raised for
building a necessary external instrument to heat the magnetically
marked cancer cells.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a last-minute effort to avoid a major breach with the
United States that could threaten the future of the World Trade
Organization, Europe Wednesday postponed its legal challenge to
American sanctions against companies doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The surging stock market reached a new high yesterday as
a rally in technology stocks spread to other sectors and the
public continued to pour money into mutual funds. The latest
sign of investor frenzy comes despite worries by Washington
policymakers that the markests are being driven by what Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a Dec. 5 speech, called
"irrational exuberance."
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- (Tokyo) Japan's troubled banks now have another headache:
The strong dollar may make it harder for them to meet internaional
banking standards. The rising dollar in essence makes their
balance sheets look riskier. Japanese banks lend lots of maney in
dollars, but their ledgers account for those loans in yen. As
those lent-out dollars stengthen, they represent more yen and
swell the value of the banks' loans outstanding.

<HEADLINE> OAU, AEC Urge Attendance of 7th All-Africa Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- African business people
are urged to attend the 7th All-Africa Trade Fair scheduled for
March 29 to April 6 this year in Nigeria's northern city of
Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The call was made today by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and the African Economic Community (AEC), stressing that
this year's fair is significant for three important reasons.
</P>
<P>
"First, the All-African Fair, the first of its kind since the
Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community came
into force in May, 1994, is aimed at promoting intra-African
trade," Vijay Makhan, Assistant Secretary-General in charge of
economic affairs of the OAU, told at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Second, it is held at a time when the twin processes of
globalization and liberalization have become recognized as
distinct phenomena of our times," said Makhan.
</P>
<P>
"Third, this year's fair is special and significant because it
will be the last to be held this century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU/AEC general secretariat is organizing an investment
forum at the fair to provide practical information and guidance
to the business community in raising equity capital, promoting
joint venture and triangular projects and other business
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
And in collaboration with the Geneva-based International Trade
Center, it is also organizing buyer/seller encounters at the
fair.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Conference Fails to Adopt Annual Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
(CD) has not succeeded in adopting its annual agenda, nor in
establishing the work program for 1997 since it began its current
session last January 21.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made today by outgoing CD President Joun Yung
Sun, who is also South Korea's Ambassador to the CD.
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, representatives from CD members
had identified their priority issues and made their positions on
such issues more clear through their statements in the plenaries,
informal plenaries, and other forms of consultations, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the three sessions of the open-ended informal
presidential consultations respectively devoted to such issues as
nuclear disarmament, a fissile material cut-off treaty and
anti-personnel landmines, were useful and contributed to moving
the overall process of the CD forward." he said.
</P>
<P>
But he regretted that the question of how to enhance the
credibility of the CD as the single multilateral negotiating forum
for disarmament had not yet been answered by all CD members.
</P>
<P>
The CD had accepted Japan's proposal to appoint a special
coordinator to conduct consultations with its members to identify
the issues in nuclear disarmament which could be negotiated in the
CD, and to report to the CD on the results no later than the
conclusion of the 1997 session.
</P>
<P>
China held that the CD agenda should not be limited to the
three subjects listed by Sun. A Chinese representative said that
discussion on these points was not sufficient to achieve consensus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the CD on January 30, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he strongly supported continued
efforts towards nuclear disarmament, including negotiation of a
convention banning production of fissile material. He also
supported efforts to ban anti-personnel landmines and said it
seemed logical for the CD to play a role.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the CD to continue to use "one of its strongest
instruments", a consensus approach to problem solving. "Consensus
protects the interests of each state, big or small, and ensures
that negotiated treaties and conventions command the widest
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Group of 21 non-aligned countries
stressed that their proposals should be taken into account, in
particular on nuclear disarmament, the Groups's overall priority.
Pakistan underlined that nuclear disarmament, security assurances
for non-nuclear powers and regional conventional arms reduction
were its priorities.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expressed reservations against the separation of the
fissile material issue from that of nuclear disarmament. The ban
on fissile material for military purposes should become a sub-item
of the nuclear disarmamnet issue, like questions of security
assurances and the prevention of an arms race in outer space, its
representative said.
</P>
<P>
Western countries like the United States, Italy and Spain have
said clearly that their priorities are the following two: a ban on
production of fissile material and a ban on anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half years of negotiations culminating in the
drafting of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treat approved by
the UN General Assembly last September, the CD is now ready to
focus increased attention on other issues on the international
disarmament agenda.
</P>
<P>
The CD presidency rotates among all of its members over a four
working-week period in accordance with the listing of the
membership in English alphabetical order. The representative from
Romania will chair the remaining part of the current session from
January 21 to March 27. The adoption of an annual agenda will be
one of his major challenges.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rises to 2.8 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government received
a blow today to its inflation policy after new figures shows a
rise in the annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today that the
headline annual inflation rate rose to 2.8 percent in January from
2.5 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments
and also the government's preferred target, fell 0.2 percent in
January, but the annual rate remained unchanged from December at
3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise in headline inflation was greater than that expected
by economists and the figure is now at its highest rate for
exactly a year.
</P>
<P>
It was mainly due to increased housing costs and a rise in food
prices, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Treasury insists that inflation remains under firm
control and expects it to fall back in coming months.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of sterling and this week's excellent producer
price figures show inflation remains under firm control," Economic
Secretary to the Treasury Angela Knight said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Behavior Change Reduces AIDS Infection Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts said today
that lower AIDS infection rates in some parts of east Africa may
be linked to new behaviors including putting off first sexual
experience, sticking to fewer partners and using more condoms.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, Dr. Michel Carael of
UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva said that "we are delighted to see
signs that new infections are dropping in some areas,"
particularly in Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Omwony-Ojwok, the Director General of the Uganda AIDS
Commission, told reporters that Uganda is one of the few
countries in the world showing that "the struggle against
HIV/AIDS can achieve results."
</P>
<P>
At Nsambya Hospital in Kampala, capital of Uganda, HIV
infection dropped from close to 28 percent in pregnant women aged
between 15 and 19 in 1991 to 10 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Mbarara Hospital in the western region of Uganda, rates in
the same age group have halved to around nine percent since the
beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the falling infection rates may be linked
with later first sex, fewer sexual partners and more condoms.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, condom use has risen dramatically in the last few
years and the rise has been most pronounced among teenagers, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, nearly two thirds of men and over half of women
reported that they had used a condom with their last casual
partner while the figure was below one in ten at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
A four-day workshop which ended today reached a conclusion
that the pattern of infection in the region shows that changing
behavior can have an effect on rates of AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
However, participants at the workshop noted that AIDS infection
levels in the region remain unacceptably high and far more
could be done to prevent and cure AIDS disease which is rampant
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS-sponsored workshop was attended by program managers
and policy-makers from Kenya, Tanzania, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Increase Moderately in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose by a
moderate 0.6 percent in January after a disappointing holiday
shopping season, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 207.9 billion dollars in January, up from 207.3 billion
last December.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest advance since identical 0.7 percent gains
last September and October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report revised down the increase of December
sales to 0.3 percent, just half the government estimate of 0.6
percent announced one month ago.
</P>
<P>
It confirmed what many merchants had said was a weak Christmas
season that often accounts for half of all sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of durable goods -- items expected
to last more than three years -- rose by 0.7 percent in January,
up sharply from the 0.2 percent gain a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales were up by 1.2 percent in the month, the
steepest gain since September. But excluding the auto component,
durable goods sales increased only by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods matched a 0.5 percent advance in
October. The sales had fallen 0.1 percent in November and
increased by 0.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The January advance had been expected by many analysts and was
consistent with moderate economic growth that many are forecasting
this year.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales represent about half of overall consumer spending
in the U.S. and the consumer spending in turn accounts for about
two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity.

support them to establish democracy.''
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the situation in Angola, Lesotho,
Swaziland, Zambia and the Great Lakes region, particularly the Zaire
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who jetted in Harare this morning, left here around
mid-day for Botswana, where he was expected to hold a similar
round of talks with President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has eight renegade policemen who seized control of the
police headquarters and have been resisting arrest for the 1995
murders of three fellow policemen.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said mutinous policemen were demanding the resignation of
National Commissioner and that there was need to restore order to the
tiny southern African kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in swaziland was ''almost explosive'' with
Swazi authorities facing pressure from pro-democracy movements, led
by trade unionists, calling for a change in the system of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, ''we would want to see the situation in swaziland
unfold to democracy as the king has promised us but our solution is
to facilitate not to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Angola, Mugabe said it was necessary to get
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to participate in an effective way in
bringing a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angola's two warring factions have been given a
two-month ultimatum by the UN to choose parliamentary
representatives, after which peace-keeping forces will be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
On the Great Lakes region, which includes Burundi, Rwanda and
Zaire, currently entangled in tribal turmoil which has seen over a
million people died, Magabe said the two southern African leaders
would rely more on the recommendations of leaders in that region.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Mandela are members of a team set-up at an
African heads of state and government summit in December to try and
find a lasting solution to the Great Lakes crises.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, ''as southern Africans, we feel concerned about the
instability in Zaire and while we will help, we will do so on the
basis and understanding of those directly affected in the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
Mandela said, however, he considered the initiative taken by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to persuade warring parties in
Zaire to decide on a truce and prepare for general elections as the
best way forward.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the situation in zambia, where
opposition leaders have threatened to cause upheaval because, they
charge, the general elections held last year were not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the regional leaders were exchanging views with
President Frederick Chiluba and would want to ensure that the
situation did not deteriorate. enditem

<HEADLINE> Canada to Challenge US Sugar Subsidy Under NAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada is expected to launch a
challenge under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to
force the United States to end a sugar support program that should
have been phased out.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale told a group of
representatives from the sugar industry here that he had "no
choice" but to ask for a dispute settlement panel.
</P>
<P>
Goodale will formally notify the U.S. of his intention to ask
for a panel at an upcoming NAFTA commission meeting, the Globe and
Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade representative's office then has 30 days to
respond.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what that response is. If it's unsatisfactory, then
we'll have to get them to follow their obligations under the NAFTA
and get them to engage in a dispute settlement mechanism," the
minister's spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the NAFTA, Canada and the United States agreed to
eliminate all subsidy programs such as the U.S. re-exporting
program for sugar-containing products by January 1, 1996. The U.S.
has failed to keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
Canadian manufacturers of sugar-containing food products have
been complaining that the U.S. export program allows those
products to be dumped on the Canadian market at unfairly low
prices.
</P>
<P>
By failing to eliminate the program, the U.S. is "taking away
the only gain that we made under NAFTA and taking away our
competitive advantage," said Sandra Marsden of the Canadian Sugar
Institute.

<HEADLINE> S. African Doctor Invents Eye Laser Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The rotary epithelial
scrubber, a device claimed to have revolutionized laser eye
surgery worldwide, has been invented by a South African
ophthalmologist.
</P>
<P>
The device, which has been approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration early this year, was invented by Dr.
Percy Amoils, President Nelson Mandela's eye specialist and
Director of Innovations Africa, according to medical sources.
</P>
<P>
The scrubber is used to remove the membrane covering the eyeball,
the epithelium, during laser surgery to correct short-sightedness,
long-sightedness and stigmatism.
</P>
<P>
During the previous eye surgery, the membrane was scraped off
with a scalpel, leaving a rough surface which could delay the
healing.
</P>
<P>
However, the new device, which resembles an electric
toothbrush, eliminates time-consuming scraping, leaves a smoother
surface for the laser and minimizes regression.
</P>
<P>
The entire procedure of the surgery is painless and takes
about 15 minutes, enabling patients to see perfectly without
spectacles or allowing them to change to a less strong pair.
</P>
<P>
Amoils said he started his research on the scrubber in 1993
and the device was patented in 1994 after extensive clinical
testing.
</P>
<P>
The Amoils epithelial scrubber is manufactured by a Canadian
company which distributes about 15,000 items weekly in Europe,
the United States, Korea, Malaysia, Japan, Australia and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Raise 100,000 Tons of Food for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has appealed for 41.6 million U.S. dollars in emergency food aid
for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to
a news release by the Rome-base United Nations food aid agency
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's aim is to raise a total of 100,000 metric tons of
food for 1,730,000 adults and children, the most seriously
affected by worsening food shortages, said the WFP.
</P>
<P>
"Currently people in the DPRK are receiving as little as 100 to
150 grams of food a day through the ration system," said Namanga
Ngongi, WFP deputy executive director.
</P>
<P>
"This is about one quarter of the minimum recommended ration.
The situation is critical because if, as feared, food stocks run
out in April or May, then there is a very real possibility of
famine," Ngongi said.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP field staff, the food supply situation in the
country has reached a critical stage. It has only half of the 5.4
million tons of cereals needed for this year.
</P>
<P>
Floods in 1995 and 1996 left half a million people in the DPRK
homeless and destroyed or badly damaged some 400,000 hectares of
cropland, resulting in a cumulative loss of 2 million tons of
grain, the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 farmers and 850,000 dependents will receive food
for 160 workdays as part of a "food for work" program to
rehabilitate agricultural lands affected by the floods.

HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Defense
Minister Voker Ruhe said here today southern Africa should move
towards greater regional cooperation to further exploit
advantages of coordinating policies, security and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
Addressing army officers at the Zimbabwe Staff College in

networks of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Southern Africa needs to join this movement towards greater
regional cooperation if it does not want to fall behind," he

The German minister commended the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) for forming the organ on politics, defense and

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Rejects Criticism of Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy today rejected the criticism by some coalition
members of the government's failure to build Jewish settlements
and shut down Palestinian institutions in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Levy's made the remarks to reporters after holding talks
with visiting French Defense Minister Charles Millon. Urging the
opponents of government's Jerusalem policy to end the debate,
he said he had never before heard of such criticism of
their own government by coalition members.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the issue of building in eastern
Jerusalem was being dealt with by the government. "Let those
responsible to decide when and what to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the accusation of the government's failure to close
institutions run by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Levy
said that Israeli government would not allow any PNA political
activities in eastern Jerusalem. He noted that many PNA
institutions had already been shut down as a result of Israeli
government's pressure.
</P>
<P>
But he added that institutions with social and cultural
functions were a different matter. "We do not want to wipe
out the Arabs in Jerusalem, on the contrary, I'm for
allowing them to develop social services and folk laws," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Levy's comments came at a time when some coalition members
are increasing pressure on the government to expand Jewish
settlements in eastern Jerusalem and harden crackdown on the
PNA activities.
</P>
<P>
A group of coalition lawmakers have threatened to topple
their own government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
in a bid to press him to go ahead with the building in
the Har Homa neighborhood, southeastern Jerusalem, and paving of
a road around the city.
</P>
<P>
The rebel lawmakers come from Netanyahu's own Likud
party, the Third Way, National Religious Party and Yisrael
Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 15 lawmakers who form the rightist Land of
Israel Front held a meeting with Netanyahu, in which the
premier briefed them on his policy on building in eastern
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyhu reportedly said, while Israel had the right to
build in eastern Jerusalem, he also had to take into
considerations the timing of these actions. He even asked his
staff to play down a list of 20 violations of Oslo accords
by the PNA on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Jerusalem police head Arye Amit has warned that
building in Har Homa would be an extreme act that could
trigger Palestinian unrest.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes and its final status is expected to be settled in
the final-status talks. Israel has declared Jerusalem as its
eternal and indivisible capital, while the PNA is demanding the
eastern Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in 1967, to
be the capital of a future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Israel FM: Syrians Must Prove They Want Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said here today that the Syrians must prove that
they want peace with Israel, according to an Israel Radio
report.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the remarks after his meeting with visiting French
Defense Minister Charles Millon, who arrived in Israel Tuesday
for what the French described as a 48-hour "technical visit" aimed
at improving defense ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Levy said "it is now up to Syria, and (Syrian President
Hafez) Assad has to prove he really wants peace with
Israel."
</P>
<P>
"Each state will have to move toward the other," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli foreign minister revealed that Syria was
still permitting Iranian air lift of weapons and ammunitions
to Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Iranian air transports have landed in Damascus,
capital of Syria, since Israel's Grape of Wrath military
operation against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon last April, Levy
said.
</P>
<P>
He also told his French guest that Israel was unhappy with the
fact that France and the international community acquiesce in
Syria's domination in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Levy declared that Israel wants to see a sovereign Lebanon,
free of foreign forces and free of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, currently
 visiting the United States, is due to meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton later today to discuss the Middle East peace
process, particularly the Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Netanyahu is expected to raise ideas
for a bridging formula which would enable to renew peace
negotiations between his country and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Washington today, Netanyahu said
that Israel "is ready and willing" to return to the
negotiation table, and now it is up to Assad to make the
next move.
</P>
<P>
With this, Netanyahu stressed that it was impossible to
advance in peace talks with the Syrians, when Hezbollah
continued its attack on Israeli army in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Netanyahu is also expected to ask
Clinton to pressure the Syrians to restrain Hezbollah activities
in the region.

CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Ambassador to Egypt Juan
Alfonso Ortiz today reaffirmed his country's keenness on boosting
the Mideast peace process and supporting the U.S. major role
through the efforts of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz made the statement while addressing a press conference on
the forthcoming visit of King of Spain Juan Carlos and Queen
Sophia to Egypt which starts on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government and other parties to respect
the agreed-upon principles and push forward negotiations to
maintain the aspired peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador told reporters that Spain has a diplomatic
delegate to the European Union entrusted with boosting the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He urged respecting all agreements signed following 1991 Madrid
conference which for the first time gathered together parties of
the Mideast conflict and paved the way for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Calling the King's visit "a turning point in bilateral
relations," he said the Spanish businessmen are eager to discuss
ways of investment in Egypt during their four-day stay in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The royal couple, making their first visit to Egypt in 20
years, will be accompanied by 55 Spanish businessmen and investors
specializing in oil, contracting, communications, electricity and
power.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reviewed the development of joint cooperation
between Egypt and Spain but described bilateral trade as still
"modest."
</P>
<P>
Volume of trade exchange does not exceed 500 million U.S.
dollars annually including Egyptian exports worth 200 million
dollars with Egyptian imports standing at 300 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
The King will hold talks with President Hosni Mubarak next
Tuesday on the Mideast peace process and Europe's role in it as
well as the economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting will also deal with the efforts exerted to boost
the dialogue between Europe and the Mediterranean Basin countries
in light of the Barcelona II conference to be held in Malta next
April.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides will also define the timing of
the meetings of the Egyptian-Spanish Joint Higher Committee on
the ministerial level to be held in Madrid this year.
</P>
<P>
The monarch will attend an economic symposium on the expansion
of trade exchange and joint investments in both countries.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet Egyptian businessmen over a luncheon and
speak on economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
and boosting joint projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Spanish investors and businessmen will have
talks with their counterparts in Egypt on the possibility of
augmenting Egyptian exports to Spain and increasing Spanish
investments and joint projects.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement on economic and industrial
cooperation in March 1991, agreement on investment protection and
an agreement to avoid dual taxation in November 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Investment

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen in Tanzania
and Kenya have been urged to strengthen trade ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Officialy opening a four-day exhibition of Kenyan products
here today, Industries and Trade Minister
William Shija said trade relations between the two countries should
be enhanced for economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"It's good that Kenya has kicked off the ball in terms of
promoting trade with Tanzania, that should be the spirit," the
minister told local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Tanzanian business community to emulate the
Kenyans, saying that trade ties must be a two-way traffic and not just
a one-sided activity.
</P>
<P>
He challenged local businesmen to organise a similar event in Kenya
and Uganda in future with a view to promoting Tanzanian goods in the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan High Commissioner to Tanzania, Jelani Habib, told
the minister that his country wanted closer trade relations between
the two countries, explaining that Kenya has organized the exhibition
for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the show was intended to reflect on the new
spirit of the business co-operation within the business community of
the East African Co-operation (EAC) which was launched last March.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 Kenyan exhibitors are participating in the event known as
Kenya in Tanzania 1997, displaying consumer and industrial goods. It
will wind up next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A similar exhibition was held in Kampala, Uganda, from August 28 to
31, last year.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Netanyahu Start to Discuss New Peace Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
seeking ways to build on the momentum, set in motion by last
month's deal on Hebron, for the overall Middle East peace with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with President Bill
Clinton, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president is very anxious to see the parties build on the
momentum of the recent agreement," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters. "We'll be very keen on learning the prime
minister's views on how the process can be advanced at this point,
how we can continue the momentum."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had breakfast with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright this morning before heading for his first meeting with
the president since he struck a deal on Hebron to pull Israeli
troops out of most part of that West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Netanyahu are expected to discuss how to restart
negotiations between Israel and Syria, but McCurry said no one
should expect any major developments on that issue.
</P>
<P>
Albright, before meeting with Netanyahu, told Congress today
that the United States was "trying to seek... a formula for
dealing on the Israeli-Syrian track."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to present proposals for resuming peace
talks with Syria, including a possible compromise on the Golan
Heights, part of Syrian territory, captured by Israel during the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have held sporadic talks since 1991, but they
broke off last spring before Netanyahu's victory in election and
have yet to resume.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians have demanded that the talks pick up where they
left off, reportedly within reach of a peace agreement, to which
Israel's previous Labor prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon
Peres, had agreed to return the Golan Heights in exchange for full
peace with Syrians, but which remained unsigned.
</P>
<P>
And Netanyahu's Likud government said it is not obligated to
honor the informal agreement since it was not signed.
</P>
<P>
During their three-hour meeting, Netanyahu will also express
his concern to Clinton on a possible U.S. deal to sell F-16 jet
fighters to Saudi Arabia, which he believes would violate the
balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We view this with severity," he said before he left for
Washington Wednesday. "Arming Saudi Arabia with 100 advanced
planes and advanced weaponry is in violation of the strategic
balance in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is the first in a parade of Middle East leaders
scheduled to visit Washington over the next several weeks. He will
be followed by Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, PNA Set Up Technical Cooperation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) has established a fund for economic and
technical cooperation, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry was the principal coordinator of
the fund that will operate in the style of the Egyptian fund for
technical cooperation with Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the new fund is yet to be decided, said the
minister, quoted by the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the fund would contribute to establishing PNA
institutions and coordinating work between the different Egyptian
and Palestinian ministries.
</P>
<P>
The fund would organize seminars and workshops for businessmen
and investors from both countries to develop economic and trade
ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also stressed the importance of offering facilities at
their borders to enhance mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, an important mediator in the Mideast peace process, has
been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Egyptian top diplomat hailed the
release of Palestinian female prisoners as a positive step forward
on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good step on the right track and will help to execute
what was agreed upon within the Hebron deal," Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
Israel released 30 Palestinian women prisoners on Tuesday night
in a positive gesture that will help push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The release was agreed upon at a meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat on Sunday.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The talks with Tajik rebel head
Bakhrom Sodirov on the release of 14 foreign hostages may break

<HEADLINE> Nominee for Ambassador to Vietnam Puts MIA Issue First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States will put
the top priority on accounting for American servicemen missing
during the Vietnam War before considering to improve its relations
with Vietnam, the Clinton administration's nominee to be
ambassador to Vietnam said today.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a Senate confirmation hearing, Pete Peterson
said the pace of normalization of economic and political relations
with Vietnam will depend on progress in accounting for MIAs.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're in for a long haul" in achieving a full
accounting for the more than 1,600 U.S. servicemen still listed as
missing from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Rejection assertions by some that Vietnam is not helping enough
in the MIA search, Peterson said cooperation "has never been
better."
</P>
<P>
Peterson, a former Democratic congressman, was shot down over
Vietnam on September 10, 1966 and held prisoner for more than six
years.
</P>
<P>
Craig Thomas, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on East Asian
and Pacific affairs, said he disagreed with President Clinton's
decision to normalize relations with Vietnam but supported
Peterson's nomination to be the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam
since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans on the panel made similar comments. No
senator suggested opposition to Peterson's nomination.

<HEADLINE> Nation-wide Police Strike Launched in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Police officers
throughout Lesotho have stopped work to protest against the
closing down of the Police Training College in the capital city
of Maseru, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Since last night, heavily armed law enforcement agents have
been blocking main entrances to police stations. Service to the
public has since come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Tension is mounting amid speculation that the country's
defense force is preparing to intervene in the crisis, following
a request for assistance by the country's Police Commissioner
Bolutu Makoaba.
</P>
<P>
He said the mutinous police members, who last week claimed
they had ousted him, are refusing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertain and tense atmosphere within the police
force, the streets of the capital remain calm with people doing
their business as usual.
</P>
<P>
The strike comes after last Thursday's seizure by the mutinous
officers of the police headquarters in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The rebellious policemen dismissed six senior officers,
including Commissioner Makoaba, who was at the time out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The renegade policemen have been resisting arrest for the 1995
murders of three fellow policemen. They allegedly want to be
pardoned for the crime.

<HEADLINE> Eastern German State Ministers Against Cut in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Economics ministers from the
eastern German states voiced strong opposition at a meeting in
Potsdam today to the reduction of government funds to eastern
Germany, saying this might jeopardize German unity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed that economy in the eastern part of the
country could not yet survive on its own. They also showed concern
over a possibly widened gap this year in prosperity between east
and west Germans.
</P>
<P>
The economic upturn in the east lost impetus in 1996 in the
wake of the slowdown in the building sector. Many east German
firms have difficulties in competing on markets both at home and
abroad, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the cost of living in the east has risen
near to the west German level while incomes on average remain at
between 70 percent and 80 percent of those in the west.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed the jobless rate for January in the
east was 18.7 percent. This figure is believed to reach 25 to 30
percent if people on state-funded make-work and job retraining
programs are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Bonn government annually provided the
eastern part of the country with about 92 billion U.S. dollars in
funds over recent years.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Jewish Settlers Clash in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian residents and
Jewish settlers traded abuses and threw oranges at each other
today in dispute over the reopening of a vegetable market.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by municipal inspectors and hundreds of Palestinian
 residents, several Palestinian shop-owners came this morning to
reopen their shops in the vegetable market in central Hebron.
</P>
<P>
To their anger, they found on the shop doors some posters
put up by the Jewish residents, claiming that the shops were
built on Jewish land "stolen following the Arab massacre of
Jews in 1929."
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, dozens of Jewish residents from the nearby
Avraham Avinu settlement rushed to the scene and exchanged
abuses with the Palestinians. The quarrel quickly erupted into
a clash after both sides began throwing oranges and vegetables
at each other.
</P>
<P>
But the confrontation did not escalate into violent clashes
as a large number of Israeli police and troops were sent
to disperse the crowd and restore order.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable market, used to be a wholesale market, has
been closed since the 1994 massacre in which a Jewish
extremist gunned down 29 Palestinian worshipers in the Tomb of
Patriarchs (or Ibrahim Mosque as called by the Palestinians).
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed last month, the market
would be reopened only as a retail market in order to
curtail the flow of Palestinian passengers in the area, thus
reducing risk of Palestinian attacks against Jewish residents.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that reopening the market could expose them to more
Palestinian violence, Jewish residents living nearby have been
fighting in vain a long battle to get the market moved away
from the site.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish residents were particularly angered by the fact
that they had been denied permits to build new houses while
the Palestinians are allowed to reopen their shops.
</P>
<P>
Israel handed over 80 percent of Hebron last month to the
Palestinian self-rule, but maintains security control over the
remaining 20 percent of the city where about 450 Jewish settlers
live among some 200,000 Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Ease Foreign Bank Rules: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
expected to announce as early as Friday that it plans to allow
foreign banks to operate in Canada through branches.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Peters, secretary of state for international financial
institutions, will announce the change which will make banking in
Canada much more competitive, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"That's the plan," and the minister could decide to delay the
branching announcement by a few days, sources close to the
developments were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
And it will probably take up to a year for the new regime to
come into effect, freeing foreign banks from the present
restraints, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign banks are generally required to operate here
as separately capitalized and incorporated subsidiaries, unable to
tap into their corporate parents' much larger capital reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to a committee of 10 foreign banks, Canada and Mexico
are the only two members of the 26-member Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development that prohibit direct branching.
</P>
<P>
At present, 45 foreign banks operate in Canada, compared to a
high of 59 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Many that have left have blamed their departures on the
restrictive regulatory regime and the entrenched position of the
Big Six Canadian banks, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> OECD Calls on France to Adopt More Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today called on France to adopt
more flexible socio-economic policies in its on-going structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today,
the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to
the French government over economic growth and cutting public
deficits.
</P>
<P>
It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5
percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit
could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This means that the aim by the French government to attain the
Maastricht deficit limit for joining the European single currency,
the euro, is within reach, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the real problem France is faced with is not
only "cyclical" but also "structural."
</P>
<P>
France is greatly lagging behind other OECD countries in
flexibility and de-regulation, especially in budgetary policy and
the role played by the state in the country's economy, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It said that as France's public spending is one of the highest
among OECD countries in terms of its GDP, it is inevitable for the
country to vigorously continue the process of the reform of public
spendings.
</P>
<P>
The OECD called on France to pay attention to the reform of its
public sector management, pointing out that many other OECD
countries have more flexible public sector management.
</P>
<P>
It also called on France to pursue the reform of public
spending "beyond Maastricht."
</P>
<P>
"In view of demographic changes, which would suggest that
spending pressures are likely to build up after the year 2000,
further public spending cuts will probably prove necessary," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which
stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the "substantial structural
impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
</P>
<P>
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over
the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while
the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of
the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits South Africa to Smooth Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
left Washington today for South Africa in an attempt to smooth
relations recently disturbed by a proposed South African arms sale
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Gore, leading a high-level U.S. delegation, will meet South
African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at the U.S.-South Africa
binational commission, which meets about every six months.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that while the commission will concentrate on
trade, the environment, energy, agriculture, education and
science, Gore and Mbeki are likely to focus on foreign affairs in
private discussions in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The once smooth relations between the United States and South
Africa went ajar when the United States attacked South Africa for
its proposed 650 million U.S. dollar sale of a laser-guided tank
firing control system to Syria, and warned it would annul 120
million U.S. dollar aid to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela angrily rejected the
U.S. accusation, calling it an affront to his country's national
pride and independence.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Proper Sewage Disposal System Complained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some residents of Addis
Ababa said poor sanitary conditions resulting from lack of proper
sewage disposal system is creating health hazards fomenting
communicable diseases, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one of the residents as saying that 30
people living in a compound use one toilet built adjacent to her
house.
</P>
<P>
Members of her family have contracted typhoid, influenza,
asthma and other communicable diseases due to the overflowing
sewage in the vicinity, she complained.
</P>
<P>
A worker quoted by the report said that there are no enough
toilets for all the people and bureaucratic hurdles in the Water
Sewerage Authority to timely deploy suction tankers for waste
disposal have aggravated the condition.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health Bureau of the capital city, 50 percent
of Addis Ababa residents use private toilets, 25 percent public
toilets and the rest do not have at all, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Health Bureau said three more public toilets are under
construction in the city which will bring the total number of
such toilets to 71.

The Health Bureau admitted that the number of toilets are few
in number when compared to the population in the capital, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Tension Eases in S. Lebanon Following Israeli Air Raids (I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Tension eased in the southern
border areas today following a wave of Israeli air raids in
eastern and south Lebanon, according to a report of the official
Lebanese National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation in
south Lebanon, said today that mounting Israeli military and
political pressures are expected upon Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A relative calm returned to south Lebanon after a
wide-scale sweep carried out by Israeli helicopters, gunships
and artilleries earlier this morning in the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli helicopters hovered over southeast Lebanon and
shot opened heavy machingun fire at random after the midnight
before an air raid was launched at a farm near the Syrian
border. In the attack, Israeli helicopters fired four missiles,
destroying an empty house and killing some livestocks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia fired heavy machinguns, built their front positions
in the so-called "security zone" directed at suspected targets
opposite the border strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli gunships cruising in south Lebanon's water fired
machineguns on the coast south of the port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported in the pre-dawn sweep, according to
 the LNNA report.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters also flew at medium altitude over south
Lebanon, and Israel's artillery bombarded a number of targets
throughout the night without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israeli warplanes fired more than 30 illuminating
shells over the villages.
</P>
<P>
In the first of a series of air raids Tuesday, Israeli
warplanes launched missiles at a radio station of Hezbollah
on the outskirts of the Shiite Muslim stronghold of Baalbek
city, 90 kilometers east of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A shepherd was wounded and dozens of goats and sheep were
killed in the air raid, prompting the Lebanese government to
file a complaint to the five-nation committee supervising a
limited truce in the border area between Lebanon and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tension Eases in S. Lebanon Following Israeli Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanon accused Israel of violating a cease-fire understanding
the two countries reached in April, 1996, which bars the fighting
sides in south Lebanon from targeting civilians in their military
operation.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives
of France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, was set
up according to the April understanding.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also launched an offensive at a base of
a radical Palestinian group south of Beirut Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi condemned today the Israeli
air strikes, saying that "they were not only for warning,
but also an operation of revenge in the depth,"
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's Secretary General,
expected today mounting Israeli pressure and more military
operation in order to force Lebanon and Syria into talks with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a televised statement, the Hezbollah leader said that
after signing the Hebron agreement with the Palestinians last
month, Israeli prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu "needs a little
more time in order to invest with this political achievement."
</P>
<P>
"He will try to demonstrate as if he is a man of peace,
meanwhile he will bring more military and political pressure on
Syria and Lebanon to push them to the negotiation table," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In case that they do not yield to the pressure, Netanyahu
will resort to a large-scale military operation, which we can
not forecast its extent and degrees, in order to impose new
conditions on Syria and Lebanon," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to make a commitment that his party
will put down arms after an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are resisting in order to liberate the land, and we
are not concerned in making commitments to anyone else because
we are not a state or a government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for what will take place after the Israeli withdrawal,
let the Israelis withdraw and all the things to happen will
happen." Basrallah added.
</P>
<P>
Israel demands a disarmament of Hezbollah as one of the
preconditions for an Israeli pullout from the
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" it established in
1985.

<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A total number of 1,239
Liberian faction fighters have been disarmed during the one-week
grace period for the fighters to surrender their arms, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Major-General Victor Malu, commander of the
west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG, as saying this
in Monrovia while briefing the chiefs of staff of the west
African countries behind the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to the commander, this has brought the total number
of faction fighters disarmed by the ECOMOG to over 30,058, or 91
percent of the soldiers of the Liberian warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The grace period also saw the handing over of 989 pieces of
weapons and 22,148 ammunitions by the faction fighters to the
ECOMOG, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that so far some 14,156 pieces of arms, 1,650,732
ammunitions and 4,369 bombs have been recovered by the
peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of staff of the nine countries with their troops to

sending more troops to Liberia to reinforce the peace-keeping
force. The meeting is expected to end on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan Speaks on UN Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The reform of the
United Nations is in steady process, though the process is not
fast enough over the past six weeks, said Kofi Annan,
secretary-general of the international organization, today.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is a process, not an event," he said at his first press
conference after he officially took the seat of U.N.
secretary-general at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
A press release circulated after the meeting said Annan is
currently pursuing U.N. reform on two tracks. First, streamlining
the Secretariat in ways "that are within his authority." Second,
he will seek to work with member governments to make structural
changes in the organizations "which can be done only with their
approval."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he has introduced a cabinet-type approach by
creating a policy coordination group made up of senior officials
from the Secretariat as well as from U.N. funds and programs. In
addition, he has set up four core groups, covering peace and
security, humanitarian issues and social and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the reformative work he has done so far, Annan said he
has asked each department to initiate internal reform reviews to
improve management, simplify administration, modernize work
methods and achieve effective cost savings.
</P>
<P>
He for himself has eliminated the posts of three senior
political advisers. In addition, he has ordered a 25 percent
reduction of paperwork in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he supports the creation of the deputy
secretary-general's post. But he has not found a candidate so far,
although he said he will "look very seriously for a woman
candidate." He said he hopes ideally that the position will be
filled by autumn this year.
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to have a serious reform, and build the
United Nations that is better able to cope with the challenges
ahead, we may have to make investment in some areas to bring in
skills we do not have today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the Security Council is obviously an issue for
the member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also made comments on his talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the relationship between the United Nations and the
U.S. Annan made a Washington visit last month to urge U.S.
authorities to pay the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars they owe the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"The payment of the U.N. contribution is a legal obligation,"
he said. "No member states should impose conditions before
payment," he said, adding that none of the other 184 member states
have ever done.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to see some constructive work with the support
of the U.S. congressmen by the end of this year. He said he cannot
say when he is going to get the check from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Angola, Annan said that he hopes to go to
Angola next month and to see the Angola issue be resolved this
year, which is important not only to Angola but also to the whole
south African region.
</P>
<P>
For the eastern Zaire issue, which Annan described as very
tragic, he said the U.N. is focusing on a political settlement
with the support of the government of the region. The U.N.
officials there are trying to persuade them to cease fire and back
to the table for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also stated the U.N. position on the
issues in Rwanda, and issues in Latin American countries such as
Guatemala and Haiti.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Orders Arrest of Dismissed Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara State Security Court
today ordered the arrest of former Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz, who
was removed from his office as a result of rendering support for
illegal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist mayor is charged with both provoking religious
enmity and providing assistance to an outlawed armed gang, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish law, the two charges may bring a
person to face a prison term of up to eight years.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz called for a Shariah-based state system in his
speech at the commemoration of "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night" on
February 1, which led to his removal three days later.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 people were reportedly arrested with the former
Sincan mayor for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
Police had earlier handed over to the court prosecutor
statements made by the accused as well as some cassettes and
documents discovered during searches conducted at their residence
and offices.
</P>
<P>
Sincan, 40 kilometers west of Ankara, has been at the
center of controversy for some time due to its Islamic mayor's
anti-secular practices and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara, Muhammed Reza Bagheri, was also
involved in the incident for his disputed religious remarks made
at the rally.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry had summoned Bagheri and lodged a
protest note against his presence and supportive remarks at the
rally.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today said that his government will put more emphasis on
preventive approach than curative one in oral health care.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first ever Dental Surgeons Congress in Africa
opened here today, the president noted that oral health care
activities will form part of the overall primary health care
policy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered on his behalf by Vice-President George
Saitoti, Moi pointed out that though most cases of oral health
diseases may not be life threatening, the high prevalence and
great misery impose a great deal of strain on human and economic
resources.
</P>
<P>
George Owino, organizer of the congress, said that the seminar
is historic due to the fact of it being the first one of its kind
in the continent as well as it being attended by leading dental
experts from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The congress sponsored by the World Dental Federation is
scheduled to discuss ways on how to solve the dental problems in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Owino noted that about 90 percent of dental ailments in Kenya
remain untreated due to poor dental training policies and
inadequate health care.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Kenyan government has taken a positive
initiative towards solving the dental problems through the
establishment of a national dental board.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Israeli, Palestinian Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that he was looking forward to the next steps to
be taken for a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a picture-taking session at the start of his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton praised him and
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat for the "terrific effort" they
made to achieve an agreement on the pullout of Israeli troops from
the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"It was a brave and wise thing to do," he told Netanyahu, who
arrived in Washington on Wednesday and held talks with new
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking ways to build on the momentum, set
in motion by last month's deal on Hebron, for the overall Middle
East peace with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
in Washington for talks with President Bill Clinton, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
"The president is very anxious to see the parties build on the
momentum of the recent agreement," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters. "We'll be very keen on learning the prime
minister's views on how the process can be advanced at this point,
how we can continue the momentum."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Netanyahu are expected to discuss how to restart
negotiations between Israel and Syria, but McCurry said no one
should expect any major developments on that issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to present proposals for resuming peace
talks with Syria, including a possible compromise on the Golan
Heights, part of Syrian territory, captured by Israel during the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have held sporadic talks since 1991, but they
broke off last Spring, before Netanyahu's victory in election and
have yet to resume.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians have demanded that the talks pick up where they
left off, reportedly with the reach of a peace agreement, which
Israel's previous Labor prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon
Peres, had agreed to return the Golan Heights in exchange for full
peace with Syrians, but which remained unsigned.
</P>
<P>
And Netanyahu's Likud government said it is not obligated to
honor the informal agreement since it was not signed.
</P>
<P>
During their three-hour meeting, Netanyahu will also express
his concern to Clinton on a possible U.S. deal to sell F-16 jet
fighters to Saudi Arabia, which he believes would violate the
balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We view this with severity," he said before he left for
Washington on Wednesday. "Arming Saudi Arabia with 100 advanced
planes and advanced weaponry in violation of the strategic balance
in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is the first in a parade of Middle East leaders
scheduled to visit Washington over the next several weeks. He will
be followed by Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Commemorates 6th Anniversary of US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Iraqis today held a
ceremony to commemorate the 6th anniversary of the U.S. bombing of
al-Amiriya air raid shelter.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds people, including some government officials,
attended the ceremony held at the underground exhibition hall
attached to the Martyr's Monument here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the gathering lashed out at the U.S barbaric
bombing, and two famous Iraqi poets read excitedly their poems
denouncing "the crimes committed against the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra daily, organ of the Arab Baa'th Socialist Party,
said today that six years ago, the U.S. "perpetrated the most
heinous and barbaric war crime" by bombing the Amiriya shelter.
</P>
<P>
"The crime constitutes a gross violation of all laws of war,"
the daily stressed, adding that it also unmasked the false
slogans raised by the west in defense of so-called human rights.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. warplane fired two missiles at the shelter at 4:00
a.m.(0100GMT) on February 13, 1991, when about 2,000 people took
shelter there from air strikes launched by the U.S.-led allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 people were killed in the bombing, most of them were
children, women and the elderly. The U.S. military later described
the bombing as a misunderstanding because it took the shelter as a
military command.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Dangerous to Driving, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Talking on a cellular phone
while driving have a four times high a risk of having an accident,
according to a Canadian study.
</P>
<P>
Driving while talking on a phone is as dangerous as driving
under the influence of alcohol, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The research, published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine, involved 699 drivers who had cellular phones and who had
been involved in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
It found the number of accidents that happened during or just
after a conversation was more than four times higher than would be
expected in normal driving.
</P>
<P>
And younger drivers were more prone to problems than older
drivers and accidents were likely to happen at high speed.
</P>
<P>
"This may indicate the main factor...is a driver's limitations
in attention rather than dexterity," said Dr. Don Redelmeier, an
epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. He did the study
along with the university's statistician Robert Tibshirani.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, such as Britain and Australia, have already
imposed strict rules on the use of car phones, requiring drivers
to pull over to make calls.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Redelmeier stopped short of calling for similar laws for
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said the study suggests car phone users must keep
their calls short and end conversations when road conditions
demand their attention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends More FBIs to Saudi Arabia for Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
sending more FBI teams to Saudi Arabia to assist in the probe into
the bombing of a U.S. military housing complex last June, an FBI
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bryant, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), said that the probe into the truck bomb
attack, which killed 19 Americans, had been at a "low ebb" during
the past month because of the Muslim fast of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
"But there are additional teams going there literally as we
speak," Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
Testifying on the Khobar bombing before the House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee, Bryant
characterized Saudi cooperation with U.S. investigators as uneven.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation that we've gotten from the Saudis has been in
some areas exceptional and in some areas where we've made requests
for evidentiary-type information, that information has not been
forthcoming to date," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But he said there were "ongoing serious and sensitive
conversations regarding information that we need and seek, and
this type of conversations are going forward right at this time."
</P>
<P>
Bryant's remarks come after U.S. officials have publicly
complained about Saudi cooperation in the bombing investigations.
</P>
<P>
Both FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno
said last month the Saudi authorities had failed to meet U.S.
demands for specific data gained from the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis have reportedly arrested a number of Saudi Shiites
for the bombing attack, and claim to have evidence linking them to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Bryant said that it was still "an open question" whether
there had been a state sponsor backing the bombers at Khobar.
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged that U.S. investigators had not been
allowed to interview witnesses to the Khobar attack "who were not
under U.S. control."
</P>
<P>
Bryant indicated that "the thing that we have to be mindful of
is that when deal in another society with other laws besides ours,
that we have to be a little bit patient".

<HEADLINE> France Can Deploy 20,000 Soldiers for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- France is now capable of
deploying 20,000 soldiers in one military action, more than the
size of French force which took part in the Gulf War in 1991, a
senior French military officer says.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly "Le Point", General Philippe
Mercier, the chief of staff of the French army, said the mass
deployment of soldiers was a new method of war different from the
old concept of an expedition force.
</P>
<P>
"This projection can be applied to the national territory, as
in the case of Vigipirate (anti-terrorist operation) in Paris" he
said.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand French troops were mobilized to reinforce the
security of Paris after the terrorist bombing of an underground
train at the Port Royal station last December.
</P>
<P>
He said France would be able to deploy 40,000 ground forces
troops by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of the austerity budget plans on the
army, Mercier said the army would participate in "mastering the
public spending" in order to update equipment.
</P>
<P>
It was true the army was a little short of major
equipment. "But the Tiger helicopter will be available, the NH 90
program (for jointly developing transport helicopters with
Germany, Italy and the Netherlands) is maintained and we will have
307 Leclerc tanks in 2002," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that the navy and air force had "a more
favorable allowance system".
</P>
<P>
The Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces, Admiral
Jean-Philippe Douin, told the French National Assembly (lower
house of parliament) last October that the equipment of the French
armed forces had remained the same as during the Gulf War.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- All 14 hostages taken by Tajik
rebels headed by Bakhrom Sodirov are alive, a United Nations
hostage from Switzerland informed Russian deputy prime minister
Vitaly Ignatenko by telephone Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. hostage quoted Sodirov as saying that all 14 hostage
were alive.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Ignatenko told the
Swiss hostage that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were trying their best to help settle
the hostage crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Russian leadership hoped the
hostages would be released soon.
</P>
<P>
The hostages held by Sodirov's group are five Russian
reporters, eight U.N. representatives and the Tajik Security
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik rebels surprised the world when they took hostage
U.N. military observers, Red Cross aid workers and Russian
Reporters on February 4 and 5. They demanded that authorities
provide a corridor on the Afghan border for Sodirov's armed
supporters to cross into Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Bakhrom Sodirov, who used to fight for
the Islamic opposition and whose aims are now unclear, has been
engaged in a civil war in this mountainous former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
But a ceasefire agreed between the government and the armed
Islamic opposition last December seems to be working.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Okinawa Prefectural
assembly today adopted a resolution requiring immediate
notification in future of incidents by the United States forces
located in the region.
</P>
<P>
The assembly protested against both the Japanese and
U.S. governments over a belated notification about the firing of
radioactive bullets by American fighters.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of incident occurs repetitiously and the anger of
local residents has reached its peak. It is inexcusable that
depleted uranium bullets were used in Okinawa Prefecture," the
resolution, quoted by the Kyodo News, said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said: "It was an act of ignoring local
residents, and greatly regrettable, that the U.S. military did not
disclose the incident for more than one year, and the Foreign
Ministry delayed the notification for nearly one month."
</P>
<P>
United States Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier jet fighters fired
1,520 radioactive bullets during military exercises on Torishima
Island, an uninhabited coral island about 100 kilometers from the
main Okinawa island, between December 1995 and January 1996.
Washington informed the Japanese foreign ministry of the incident
only last month.
</P>
<P>
On February 10, the Japanese foreign ministry informed the
Okinawa prefectural government of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The belated notification has prompted Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota to fiercely criticize the U.S. military and the Japanese
government.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and they had profound discussions on the
two countries' relations, particularly the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said Sino-British ties have improved
in the past one year and more and high-level visits and contacts
have increased.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two countries has also resumed or
developed in various degrees in the economic, trade, financial and
other fields, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side hopes this momentum will be
maintained, stressing that the maintaining of a good relationship
of cooperation between the two countries is in the fundamental
interests of both peoples and is conducive to cooperation between
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind agreed to the Chinese side's assessment of the two
countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
He said British-Chinese relationship is progressing steadily,
with a continuous flow of high-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He believed that contacts between the leaders of the two
countries have helped the restoration and development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary noted that British entrepreneurs,
especially those in finance and insurance, have shown strong
interests in expanding cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Hong Kong is excellent at present and
the prospects of a smooth transition are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Britain will do its best to ensure that Hong Kong will pass its
transition period smoothly, he said, adding that to realize this
objective is important and beneficial for both Britain and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind also expressed his concerns about the
Provisional Legislative Council set up recently and certain laws
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian said the Chinese government attaches
importance to the development of relations with Britain.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the question of Hong Kong is the most
important question between the two countries and only by handling
well this question, can the two sides increase trust, promote
cooperation and establish a 21st century-oriented, lasting, stable
and mutually beneficial relationship of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian added that China's policy of "one country, two systems"
and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of
autonomy" remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at present, Hong Kong enjoys social stability and
an excellent economic situation and that smooth transition in Hong
Kong is in keeping with the historical trend and the aspirations
of the people and no insurmountable obstacles and difficulties
exist.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the days are numbered before Hong Kong's
return to China on July 1 this year and he hoped that the British
side will adopt a forward-looking and cooperative attitude.

questions of mutual concern in the Sino-British relations.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here this afternoon with the
foreign ministers of Denmark and Spain.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen, Qian said Petersen's visit to China last September was
very successful and gave an impetus to the development of the two
countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Danish ties have witnessed smooth development in recent
years, but it seems that there exists great potential for further
growth, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is in the fundamental interests of both
countries to further boost their relations and this is also in
keeping with the trend of strengthening cooperation between Asia
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Petersen said his trip to China last year was
fruitful and some follow-up actions are now under way.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country will continue to work for the
development of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the World Trade Organization (WTO), he said
China's participation in the WTO is very important. Only after
China's entry can the WTO work out more comprehensive trade rules
and implement them in earnest.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said China, as a country with the
largest population and rapid economic growth, should join the WTO,
which will live up to its name only after China is admitted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the parties concerned will adopt a more pragmatic
attitude.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting between the Chinese and Spanish foreign
ministers, the two sides noted that cooperation between the two
countries is developing smoothly in various fields and the two
countries will continue to promote their relations and
cooperation, particularly in the economic field and trade, to
their mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral and
international questions of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to Spain last year was fruitful and gave a strong
push to the development of the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his welcome to Foreign Minister Abel Matutes y
Juan's forthcoming visit to China and he believed that the trip
will be successful.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Spain is playing an important role on the
international arena and China is ready to further strengthen its
cooperation with Spain in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the two foreign ministries maintain regular
political consultations.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers are here to attend the First ASEM
Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> China to Stabilize Finished Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China will take prompt
measures to ensure the steady supply of finished oil during the
Spring Festival transportation and spring plowing periods,
according to a circular issued by the General Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The circular which is available today calls for governments at
various levels to make efforts to stabilize the market for
finished oil in order to meet the needs of industrial and farm
production and people's daily use.
</P>
<P>
It is a tradition of the Chinese people to have family reunions
during the Spring Festival, which fell on February 7 this year.
People all across the country travel extensively to join their
family members, which requires a huge amount of diesel oil to keep
transportation vehicles of various kinds operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the increasing mechanization of farm vehicles,
the spring plowing season requires an increasing amount of
finished oil as well.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges departments concerned to keep enough oil in
reserve during the period and strictly abide by the state price
policies concerning finished oil products.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Plagued with Influx of Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after being
deported will also be subject to caning.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further influx of illegals, surveillance along
Malaysia's borders, especially the Malaysia-Thai border, have been
intensified, according to Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat
Ayob.
</P>
<P>
More and more illegals were detained near the border areas in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants has
started with the immigration Department having formed 16
enforcement teams to round up the illegal aliens who will be
deported, according to Megat Junid.
</P>
<P>
Police, armed forces, the Customs and Excise departments as
well as the Task force on Foreign Workers are also involved in the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The authorities called on house owners and employers to fully
cooperate with the government in its efforts to resolve the
problem of illegal immigrants in the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the combined efforts by government agencies
involved to track down the illegal immigrants showed that the
government really meant business.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate objective is to end this episode in the best
possible way," Megat Junid said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now facing problems in deporting the 8,000 illegal
immigrants from Myanmar and 5,000 from Bangladesh as Myanmar does
not regard them as its citizen and the Bangladeshi government has
so far not shown any serious commitment in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is seeking the assistance of the countries concerned
for efficient deportation of the illegals.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Plagued with Influx of Illegal Immigrants (1)  (By Wu Dingbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 14 (Xinhua) -- When Malaysia is
resorting to harsher punitive measures to flush out numerous
illegal immigrants, many more are sneaking in to seek their
fortune in this flourishing country.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants are slipping into Malaysia as the
country with a population of about 20 million is facing a serious
shortage of workers resulting from the rapid economic development
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
There are still about one million illegal foreign workers in
the country even after a nationwide exercise to register and
legalize illegal from mid August to December 31 last year and a
follow-up voluntary repatriation program which allowed them to
surrender before January 31 to be deported to their respective
homeland, according to official estimates which put the total
foreign workers (including Iegal) at more than two million.
</P>
<P>
The illegal in the country are mainly from Indonesia,
Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, who are mostly involved in the
fields of plantations, services, construction and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Already, the illegal are an ugly dimension of Malaysia's rapid
economic development illustrated by the increasing violent crimes
perpetrated by them, apart from taking over lucrative jobs of
locals and bringing social ills.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Malaysian authorities are worried that the
presence of two million foreign workers along with the illegal
immigrants is posing a threat to the nation's security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
To rid the nation of this burgeoning problem, the Malaysian
government is now waging an all-out war against the illegal. It is
meting out harsher punishment to those bringing in and harboring
illegals and has launched a massive crackdown against illegal
immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Arbitration on Bosnian Town Brcko Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- International mediators have
postponed for at least a year a decision on the ownership of the
strategic town of Brcko in north-eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Roberts Owen, chairman of the International Arbitration
Committee for Brcko, said in Rome it would postpone arbitration
so as to give more time to the three candidates (the Serbs,
Muslims and the Bosnian governments) to ease the tension as well
as improve their governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Brcko would be under international administration for
one more year since none of the Serbs, the Muslims and the Bosnian
governments were stable enough to take control of the area.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was expected to make the final decision on the
ownership of Brcko no later than March 1998, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
Brcko controls the narrow Posavina corridor linking the east
and west parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. It also contains the
main road across the Sava River which links the Muslims and
Croatians.
</P>
<P>
Before the Bosnian war broke out in 1992, more than half the
local population in Brcko were Muslims and Croats.Soon after the
war began, the Serbs took over the town and around 30,000 Serb
refugees fled to it from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Bocko is the only place in Bosnia which is still under dispute
in the Dayton agreement signed in November 1995. A decision on the
fate of the town had been postponed for two months from December
14, 1996 till now.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Serb and Muslim leaders have threatened to go to
war if arbitration did not favor either.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NATO-led Stabilization Force has been on high
alert as the tension between the two sides increased.

<HEADLINE> Major Rules Out Election On March 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major ruled out a March 20 election last night, and amid feverish
speculation about a polling date advised people to sit back and
relax.
</P>
<P>
In a interview on Sky TV, Major said: "People should not get
over-excited about it at the moment."
</P>
<P>
He said there were several reasons for waiting until May 1,
though he confirmed he would not go beyond that date.
</P>
<P>
"I have a date in my mind and in due course we will see how
events unroll, and I will make an announcement," he added.
</P>
<P>
After yesterday's Cabinet meeting, sources close to Major also
confirmed that he had ruled out a March 20 poll.
</P>
<P>
Labour is speculating about an earlier snap poll, with its
Deputy Leader, John Prescott, saying Major was to lead a debate on
the constitution next Thursday, followed by a Tory conference
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Major's move came as the Government prepared to fight off the
Opposition censure motion on Monday over its handling of the mad
cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
Major rejected the charge that Labor's censure was a crisis for
the Government, dismissing the motion as a "stunt" and insisting
the Tories would beat it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Swazi, Lesotho Crises Arouses Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- An indefinite national
strike in Swaziland and a mutiny by hundreds of policemen in
Lesotho are becoming "hot spots" in the Southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Tense situation in Swaziland began since the beginning of
February when Jan Sithole, Secretary-General of the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), and several other top SFTU
officials were arrested for calling for national strikes.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made one day after the Swazi government
issued an ultimatum for SFTU leaders to call off a planned
two-day national strike scheduled to start on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The strike was designed to force King Mswati III to lift a
1973 decree banning activities of political parties and to agree
to multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
While the protest leaders were behind the bars, the Swazi
police forces were also mobilized to set roadblocks as preemptive
measures against the massive stayaway.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swazi government's precautions have by no means
had the protest nipped in the bud. On the contrary, the proposed
two-day strike has turned into an indefinite national turmoil.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse and more complicated, other regional
trade unions including the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU) have also been involved in the protest.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the South African government's persuasion,
COSATU threatened to blockade Swaziland's border to show its
support for its Swazi counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU-sponsored strike, backed by outlawed political groups
in the country, has entered into its 12th day, and there is no sign
of ending it.
</P>
<P>
While Swaziland has been gripped by national strikes which
have caused considerable damages to national economy in the
country, Lesotho, another southern African country, is also
falling into chaos caused by a police mutiny.
</P>
<P>
At least 400 mutineers, led by eight renegade officers who
have been resisting arrest for the 1995 murders of three fellow
policemen, have for days seized control of Lesotho's police
headquarters and dismissed six senior officers including Police
Commissioner Bolutu Makoaba.
</P>
<P>
As the mutinying officers refused to give up their demands,
the Swazi troops were reportedly mobilized to prepare for
intervening in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation in Swaziland and Lesotho have
apparently drawn grave concern from leaders of southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who is on his southern
African tour, has consulted with his Zimbabwean and Botswanan
counterparts over tensions in Swaziland and Lesotho, both of
which are neighbors of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is also Chairman of Southern African Development
Community (SADC), told reporters yesterday that he was very much
concerned about the "almost explosive" situation in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Referring to tensions in Lesotho, Mandela said his government
would be ready to provide whatever advice it can to help the
Lesotho government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets Greek, Austrian Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with the foreign ministers of
Greece and Austria here today.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,
Qian said that since the two countries established diplomatic ties
in 1972, China and Greece have seen the continuous development of
their friendly relations and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to the growth of Sino-Greek ties and
will make joint efforts with Greece to push the two countries'
relations to a new high, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Greece have their respective
strong points economically and in recent years bilateral trade has
been increasing year by year.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, the two countries should further boost
mutual understanding, tap the potential for cooperation and expand
their economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister said his country values highly the
achievements made by China in its economic development and he
expressed the hope that the ties between the two countries will
continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believed that the two old civilizations could
further enhance their cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Austrian Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel, Qian said that in recent years, Sino-Austrian
relations have maintained a good momentum of development and there
have been frequent high-level visits between the two countries.
The successful visit by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky to China last
year, in particular, gave a further push to the two countries'
ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that at present, economic relations and trade
are developing smoothly and exchanges and cooperation in science
and technology, culture, education and other fields are deepening
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's readiness to work together with Austria to
promote the development of the Sino-Austrian relations in an
all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said that the whole European continent including
Austria is showing greater and greater interest in China and that
positive results have been achieved in the friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries, which culminated in the
Austrian chancellor's visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a number of major projects are under way between
the two countries and their success will further boost
Austrian-Chinese economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Qian welcomed the consolidation and expansion of
the European Union (E.U.), saying the strengthening of the E.U.
will make more balanced political and economic development in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cooperation between China and the E.U. has
been progressing smoothly and expanding, but there exists great
potential to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese foreign minister and his counterparts from
Greece and Austria are here to attend the First ASEM foreign
Ministers' Meeting to be held tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> 89 Cattle Die from Anthrax in Victoria, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 89 cattle have
died from anthrax since it was first detected in the Stanhope and
Tatura region of northern Victoria, while another 16,000 have been
vaccinated, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Natural Resources and Environment of Victoria
state said that by 2 p.m. on Thursday, 75 cattle died of the
disease, that means during the past 24 hours 14 more cattle died.
</P>
<P>
The latest discoveries took to 40 from 37 the number of
properties found to have infected stock, but the department
stressed all were within the designated 45 square kilometer
quarantine zone in the Stanhope and Tatura region.
</P>
<P>
Vets today continued a program of vaccinations on 157
quarantined farms in an attempt to prevent further outbreaks of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Victoria's chief veterinary officer Andrew Turner said the fact
the number of new properties becoming infected had slowed down
over the past two days showed the massive vaccination program was
working, "It will take up to 10-14 days for the properties to
become solidly immune".
</P>
<P>
Anthrax, first detected on January 26, has not been recorded in
this region for the past 80 years, while the last recorded case
was in 1984 on the east side of Goulburn river.
</P>
<P>
The disease causes rapid death in cattle, sheep and goats when
they eat contaminated soil or feed.

<HEADLINE> China's Collecting Craze (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- An interest in private
collections in China seems to have grown alongside the socialist
market economy since the 1980s, according to a survey conducted by
a well-known collector in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the survey Chen Baodin estimates that the number of
collectors in China has climbed to over 30 million, from two
million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Collection was mostly for a handful of wealthy and influential
people in the past and covers a diverse range of objects at
present, Chen said, adding that now it touches the daily lives of
everyone from officials, teachers, and military officers to
students and common folk.
</P>
<P>
"It is a common practice not only for people in booming coastal
cities, but also for those living in the remote, mountainous
northwestern parts of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of farmers in northern Shaanxi and Henan
provinces have taken an interest in stamps, match-box covers,
cigarette trademarks, and coins to add color to their lives.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the rapid growth of private collections to
the country's social stability and sustained economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rapid development is the improved
standard of living. In addition to color TVs and refrigerators,
people now want other items. Even farmers have more leisure, with
the adoption of the contract responsibility system in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
The China Association for Collectors was founded in Beijing in
June, 1996 and there are now a number of associations and
societies for collectors nationwide. In more than 20 big cities,
there are special markets for stamps, antiques, paintings, and
calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
Fairs and exhibitions of collections have been held in the past
several years. Among these are the Beijing International Stamp and
Coin Fair and an exhibition of private collectors.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that over 600 different types of private
collection have appeared, with stamp collection still the
largest. There were more than 10 million stamp collectors with a
business worth a billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Next come match-box covers, cigarette trademarks, antiques,
coins, and arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that collecting has become more
specialized and detailed in recent years. The things people are
likely to be interested in now include candy coats, invitations,
wallets, bottle caps, Mao badges, Mao's "little red book", subway
tickets, telephone cards, and souvenirs like coins commemorating
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred private museums have been built in China for
various collections since the first one, an abacus museum, was
built by Chen in Shanghai in Match, 1981. In a nearly
30-sq.m. room Chen has over 520 different kinds of Chinese and
foreign calculators from different periods, with the biggest
abacus being four meters long and the smallest small enough to fit
on a ring.

<P>
The province will expand its local telephone exchange capacity
this year by one million lines and long-distance switching
capacity by 210,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zhejiang will add 20,000 channels and 253 basic

</P>
<P>
The GSM mobile telecommunications service is expected to reach
most of the towns or townships in the province, and Internet
service will be available in most cities and prefectures by the
end of this year, it was learned.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Aircraft to Transport Pilgrims to Saudi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Libyan pilgrims will fly to
Saudi Arabia this year aboard their national aircraft despite the
U.N. air ban imposed on Libya, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan News Agency said that Libya decided Thursday to
transfer its pilgrims to Saudi Arabia aboard the airplanes of the
Libyan Airways, not aboard EgyptAir airliners.
</P>
<P>
It said that performance of pilgrimage with the U.N. permission
was unlawful, stressing on the Libyan people's right to proceed to
the holy land by Libyan aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The state-run news agency noted that to make pilgrimage was a
spiritual rather than a political affair subject to U.N. Security
Council approval.
</P>
<P>
Libya has reportedly turned down the proposed transport of
Libyan pilgrims to Saudi Arabia by EgyptAir, the national carrier
of Egypt, as was the case in the previous two years with the
permission of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has recently obtained a permission to transport
Libyans to Saudi Arabia to perform pilgrimage for the third
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed an air ban on Libya since 1992
as part of the sanctions against Tripoli for having failed to hand
over two Libyan citizens who are accused by the United States and
Britain of involvement in the bombing of a Pan AM airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libyan airlines had one symbolic flight in 1995 and 1996
respectively, carrying Libyan pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
A Libyan plane carried an official delegation to the Ghanian
capital of Accra last month.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Libyan-registered aircraft transported Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi to Cairo in June 1996 to attend an Arab
summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty of the private museums are in Shanghai, China's biggest
industrial and commercial city, and 10 are in the nation's capital
of Beijing, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
It also found that private collectors' museums can be divided
into four different categories: humanities, arts and crafts,
natural sciences, and popular science.
</P>
<P>
Private collection have also become a form of investment.
</P>
<P>
Stamp collection is said to be the oldest form both in China
and in the rest of the world, but in recent years, new stamp
collectors have focused their attention on monetary value.
</P>
<P>
One stamp issued during the "Cultural Revolution", referred to
"the country is red all over", is now worth more than 100,000
yuan, while a military mail stamp issued before 1949 is now valued
at more than 620,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ancient coins have been gradually replaced in new collectors'
eyes by commemorative coins. One set of coins with a face value of
50 yuan issued in 1992 now bring 1,500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The new magnetic phone cards are a favorite of
collectors. There are at least 23 different cards that have been
issued in China. One example is a card commemorating late Chairman
Mao Zedong's birthday that was issued in central China's Henan
Province at the end of 1993. When it was issued, it had a face
value of 20 yuan but now brings several hundred yuan because of
the wrong date printed on it.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, there is at least one auction every month. At an
auction in November, 1996, the value of sales reached a record 130
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that investment in private collections is
quite different from that in securities or property. The former is
also cultural and the latter purely for economic
purposes. Investing in collections may improve the quality of life
in many ways, they say, and some collectors go on to become
recognized experts in a particular field.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, retired official Lan Xiang has collected more than
1,200 pairs of chopsticks classified in over 800 different
categories. Lan has studied the cultural background of chopsticks
for over 20 years and has written a book on the history of
chopsticks, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tiejun, an employee of a textile factory in Beijing, began
collecting books, newspaper and journal articles, and other
memorabilia about Premier Zhou Enlai in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
During his 3-year collection, he found that Zhou Enlai held 500
different positions in his lifetime, and wrote a book about the
late premier's experiences that will be published soon.
</P>
<P>
Li Zengwen, 55, a deputy director of a personnel bureau in
Beijing, has spent his off-hours collecting and studying ancient
pottery and bronzeware for many years, and is now generally
acknowledged as an expert in that field.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's famous collector Chen Baocai has travelled a great
part of the country in the past several years collecting more than
100,000 butterfly specimens. One that he discovered last year
during a visit to southwest China was a deformed insect with eight
legs that has lead scientists to connect it with environmental
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently he has collected a large number of deformed
butterflies that have provided substantial grounds for ecological
research in China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sign Open Sky Pact with U.S. in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will officially
sign an open sky pact with the United States in May, according to
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama today quoting Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would firstly "initial" the agreement with the U.S.
either next month or April that would liberalize air travel
between the two countries, Ling Liong Sik said last night in Ipoh,
205 kilometers north from here, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ling, the delay in Malaysia signing the agreement
was that in the past the U.S. had been reluctant to have an open
sky policy with this country.
</P>
<P>
However this changed following the visit of U.S. Secretary of
Transport Federico Pena to Malaysia last year when the Malaysian
government was able to express its dissatisfaction with the
existing air space agreement which was considered to be lopsided.
</P>
<P>
Top U.S. aviation officials came to Malaysia after Pena's visit
to discuss a new agreement with their counterpart here, following
which there was an agreement for an addendum to the existing
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ling was quoted as saying "since then we had been making
tremendous progress with the U.S. to come up with a new air space
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Under the open sky agreement with the U.S, Malaysia Airlines
will have the right to fly anywhere in the U.S. compared to the
present where it only had rights to land in Los Angeles where
Malaysia Airlines makes six flights a week currently.
</P>
<P>
Ling said this would also augur well for Malaysia Airlines'
expansion plans since it could now look forward to securing
landing rights in other parts of the U.S., like New York or
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The open sky agreement, designed to deregulate commercial
aviation, will eliminate restrictions on the number of carriers
and the routes they may fly, and there will be no more limitations
on charter flights.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also provide for revenue sharing
opportunities between airlines where Malaysia Airlines, for
example, can also sell Delta Airlines tickets in Kuala Lumpur for
passengers flying from Los Angeles to any point within the U.S
and then share the revenue with Delta.
</P>
<P>
The open sky policy is believed to increase tourism and
businesses as people take advantage of cheaper air travel brought
about by increased competition between air carriers.

<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital's GDP
stood at 160.73 billion yuan in 1996, some 9.1 percent up over the
figure for the previous year, the municipality's statistics bureau
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Investment from overseas was one of the major propellants of
Beijing's economy, and the city received 14.7 percent more foreign
investment last year than in the previous year, said a spokesman
for the bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total overseas investment in the city last
year was 2.26 billion US dollars,
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of foreign investment accounts for more than one
fifth of the city's total investment in fixed assets," he told a
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the city's economy, spearheaded by the
service sector, also saw inflation further reduced last year,
</P>
<P>
The retail price index rose 7.3 percent last year, and the
growth rate was 5.3 percentage points less than in the previous
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time Beijing has seen its market prices rise
more slowly than its economy since 1993, when the city adopted a
tight monetary policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Beijing urban residents' per capita annual income
was 6,885 yuan (829.5 US dollars) last year, a net increase of 5.1
percent compared to the previous year.

LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain will take part in an
energy fair in Tehran in April, opening the way for British firms
to invest in Iran's gas and oil industry in defiance of United
States sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Reports today said the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)

<HEADLINE> U.N. Economic Body for Africa to Prop Up NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) has promised to strengthen the
network of Africa's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to help
socio-economic development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
ECA's Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako, who is here for a
four-day official visit, told Minister for
Community Development, Women and Children's Affairs Mary Nagu
here Thursday that most local NGOs are in weak state.
</P>
<P>
"NGOs have a key role in development because they complement
government's efforts in enhancing various sectors but the problem
is that most of them are still feeble," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's, therefore, ECA's concern that they should be
strengthened, especially those engaging in socio-economic
activities," said the ECA chief.
</P>
<P>
ECA is also working on a program aimed at propping up Africa's
investment promotion centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Amoako told Samwel Sitta, the Director General of the
Investment Promotion Center, that ECA is keen on assisting in the
formation of a data bank on investors.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets Thai, South Korean, German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here this morning Thai Foreign
Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian first of all congratulated Prachuab on
his appointment to the post.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Thailand enjoy long-standing friendly
relations and their cooperation and exchanges have been developing
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the foreign ministries of the two countries
have been in frequent contacts and have set up a mechanism of
consultations, thus playing an important role in promoting the
smooth development of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier expressed his pleasure at the fact
that Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh had decided to visit
China not long after he took office. Describing the visit as a
major event in the two countries' relations this year, he
expressed the belief that the trip will be successful and achieve
positive results.
</P>
<P>
China is happy to see that the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) is becoming more active and playing an
increasingly greater role in the region, he said, adding that
Sino-ASEAN cooperation is not only in the interests of the two
sides, but also of great significance to peace, stability and
prosperity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab said that although he had just become the foreign
minister, he has been to China a few times and has quite a few
friends there. He expressed his wish to work and promote the
Thai-Chinese friendly relations and cooperation during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
The Thai foreign minister noted that Prime Minister Chavalit is
China's old friend and the fact that he had decided to visit China
soon after he came to office is an indication of the importance
the Thai government attaches to Thai-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated China on the achievements it has made in its
economic development and reform and on the active role it has been
playing in regional and international affairs and expressed
satisfaction with the development of the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He was pleased at the fact that China attaches great importance
to the ASEAN region and has been actively developing relations
with the ASEAN. He expressed the belief that relations between the
ASEAN and China will witness continuous growth.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian also met with South
Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and German Vice-Chancellor
and Foreign Minister Kalus Kinkel this morning.
</P>
<P>
He exchanged views on a number of questions with the South
Korean foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Qian said China
always stands for peace and stability there. Although some
problems and twists and turns appear there, "It is our hope that
the situation on the peninsula will continue to be stable." He
hoped that the parties concerned will make efforts toward this
end.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting, both the Chinese and German foreign ministers
maintained that the state visit to China by German President Roman
Herzog last year was very successful and promoted the development
of relations between the two countries and Foreign Minister
Kinkel's trip to China was also fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believed that it is of great significance for
China and Germany to maintain their friendly relations and
cooperation and that there exist great potential and broad
prospects for the two countries' cooperation, which is mutually
complementary.
</P>
<P>
At present, they noted, the two countries enjoy an excellent
relationship and their cooperation in various fields is on a
normal and healthy track of development. Both sides are happy
about this and are willing to make joint efforts to enable their
relations to progress in a healthy and steady way.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also had an in-depth exchange of
views on cooperation between China and the European Union and
other regional and international questions of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Kinkel reaffirmed his
country's support for China to join the World Trade Organization
as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Both Foreign Minister Qian and his counterparts from Thailand,
South Korea and Germany are here to attend the First ASEM Foreign
Ministers' Meeting to be held here tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> IPU Specialized Conference Opens in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The five-day conference of
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) opened here today for enhancing
women' political position in the world.
</P>
<P>
Indian President S.D. Sharma in his inaugural speech called for
concerted efforts to root out prejudice against women and ensure
their participation in political decision-making processes.
</P>
<P>
The conference, regarded as the first high-level political
meeting of women since the 1995 Beijing meet, is attended by over
250 parliamentarians from nearly 80 countries and regions
including China.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma and Bangladesh Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina are among the prominent participants at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president regretted that despite numerous guarantees
and safeguards, gender discrimination and prejudice remained a
distressing reality.
</P>
<P>
He said that more work should be done to promote gender as a
central issue "in our political advancement."
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is in the women and the girl-child who remain among
the most vulnerable, weak and deprived sections of society," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a huge gap between men and women in political power,
a recent survey conducted by IPU revealed that the percentage of
women occupying parliamentary seats in the world has dropped from
an all-time high of 14.6 in 1988 to 11.7 now. Only 7.7 percent of
parliamentary group leaders are women.
</P>
<P>
The current conference would discuss ideas to bring about a
balance representation of men and women in politics, Indian
parliament Speaker P. Sangma said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Joins Inter-city Bus Service in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong public bus
company has launched an inter-city route in Southwestern China's
Sichuan, the most populous province in the country.
</P>
<P>
Citybus, which operates almost 60 percent franchised public bus
 routes in Hong Kong, announced today that shuttle buses began to
run along a superhighway connecting Chongqing and Chengdu, two
major cities in Sichuan from the end of January. There are now ten
 departures each day for the three and half hours' journey.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Cheng, general manager of Citybus said that it was the
company's first foray into operating bus services in the Chinese
mainland. Citybus has already operated 50 daily cross-border
departures between Hong Kong and three cities in South China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Citybus chose the Sichuan route for the growing strategic and
commercial importance of the two cities, according to
Cheng. Chongqing, a riverside city on the Yangtze River, is
located close to the site of the mammoth Three Gorges Water
Conservancy Project, while Chengdu is the capital city of
Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng believed that the express service between the two cities
would be attractive both to local business travelers and to
tourists. Citybus has set up a joint venture with Sichuan province
 -- the Chongqing Passenger Transport Company to run the route.

<HEADLINE> Marked Progress in China's Legislation for Nature Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- With a set of regulations on
the protection of wild plants going into effect earlier this year,
China has so far established a relatively complete legal system
for protecting the country's nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
China has been implementing policies to protect nature reserves
since 1956 when the Ministry of Forestry and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences were instructed to designated them, according to Wang
Zhibao, Vice-Minister of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, over the past 20 years, China has issued a
series of laws and regulations regarding the protection of the
country's forests, grasslands, wildlife and fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
"The relatively complete legal system for protecting nature
reserves has laid a good foundation for a better protection of the
nation's natural environment," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution stipulates that the state guarantees the
rational use of natural resources, protects the rare animals and
plants, and strictly forbids any organization and individual to
occupy and damage them by any illegal means.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Voters' Registration Centers in Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- No voters' registration centers
and polling stations will be allowed to open in military barracks
around Nigeria before and during the presidential elections set
for mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The ban is part of the revised Code of Conduct for soldiers
during the transition period, spokesman for the Nigerian army
Felix Chukwuma said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under former President Ibrahim Babangida's transition to civil
rule program, registration centers and polling stations were
located in military barracks all over this western African
country.
</P>
<P>
"But this time around, we want to divorce the military
entirely from the electoral processes. On election day, you go to
the polling booth nearest to you and cast your vote as a
citizen," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that any soldier violating the ban will face severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The registration of voters for multi-party general elections
and for other local elections included in Nigerian head of State
General Sani Abacha's transition program started throughout the
country on Monday.

<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Agriculture, Livestock
Development and Marketing Minister Darius Mbela said that the

<P>
The minister said the government will continue to work
tirelessly to curb the mounting cases of cattle rustling in
recent years.
</P>

efforts to recover stolen animals, but got troubles on the
identification of them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Veterinary Department has also embarked on a major cattle
branding exercise which is expected to be complete within the

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian armed forces and
police have formed a task force to intensify investigations into
the series of bomb blasts that hit Lagos in the last two months,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The task force was launched on Thursday at the directive of
the Presidency, after a bomb blast hit a military bus in Lagos on
the early morning of Wednesday, injuring five soldiers and two
civilians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's explosion is the fourth in two months in Lagos
that apparently has military subjects as the targets.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the task force indicates that the authority
might expand the scope of their investigations into the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Godwin Ugbo, the acting spokesman of the Defense
Headquarters reportedly said on Thursday: "The military is not
taking it lightly, if the perpetrators are within us, they will
be uncovered, and if they are being used, they'll be caught one
day."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's opposition National Democratic Coalition (NADECO),
which has been accused of involvement in the bombings by the
police, was quick to react.
</P>
<P>
Its Deputy Chairman, Senator Abraham Adesanya reportedly said
after Wednesday's bombing: "instead of blaming NADECO, they
should for once, look within. It's naive to blame NADECO for
everything."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, when Nigeria's police head Ibrahim Coomassi said they
have strong evidence indicating NADECO's involvement in the
bombings, a NADECO leader dared the police to bring the case to
the court.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's fish factories suspended from exporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
suspended the exports from seven out of nine fish processing
factories to the European Union (EU) because they fail to meet EU
market standards concerned.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two fishing processing plants -- Ngege Ltd. of
Luzira and Clovergem Fish and Food Ltd of Entebbe, 40 kilometers
south from here -- are allowed to continue its exporting, the New
Vision newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Spain banned importing fish from this eastern African
country or its neighbors and some EU countries voiced threats to
block the sale of Uganda's Nile perch there, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Spain, a major European fish importer for Uganda, charged that
there are high-level bacterial contamination and other
micro-organisms observed inside Uganda's fish product.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish authorities said in a report recently that they
would resume importation of Ugandan Nile perch fillet only if the
processors concerned can meet quality standards acceptable to EU.
</P>
<P>
However, Opika Opoka, the permanent secretary in the Ministry
of Fisheries, has denied that the ban was caused by the intended
chemical spraying of water Hyacinth in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
"The chemical spraying of the water hyacinth as a control
method, which at any rate has not taken off, has absolutely
nothing at all to do with the blacklisting," Opoka said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Joe de Deus Pinheiro, an EU Commission member, warned
that if chemical spraying is to be done, the EU will reject fish
from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda earns some 100 million U.S. Dollars every year from
fish exporting, which is the second foreign exchange earner in
the country. The top one is coffee.

KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda impounded narcotics
worth one million U.S. Dollars brought into the country by drug
traffickers in 1996, the New Vision paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The narcotics include four kilograms of cocaine worth 800,000
Dollars, 3.7 kilograms of heroine valued at 82,000 Dollars, 258.8
kilograms of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Ayela, an anti-narcotics unit official, told a seminar
on drug abuse in Jinja, 80 kilometers east of here Wednesday that
as many as 298 people were arrested on charge of drug
trafficking, 75 of them teenagers.
</P>
<P>
There are 15 suspects arrested for heroine smuggling, five of
them juveniles.
</P>
<P>
The arrested include a german carrying with four kilograms of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Ayela said under a bill being drafted, traffickers' assets
will be sold by the government for supporting anti-narcotics
fight.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has become a big source of corruption even in
the government and greatly hurts state economy as a result of
huge money laundering in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The crime also has a direct linkage with the spread of the
fatal disease of AIDS, he said.

<P>
Although Howard has no specific target or agreement to be
reached during the visit, as official sources told Xinhua,
Australia is keen to ensure its relations remain close with its
nearest neighbor.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is an important trading partner to Australia with
buying almost six billion Australian dollar (4.68 billion U.S.
dollar) products from this country in 1995-96, representing 7.4
percent of Australia's total exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade ties, the single aviation market and gun
laws are believed to be on the agenda, as New Zealand is facing
calls for gun laws after last weekend's massacre in which six
people died in the small North Island town of Raurimu.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some unresolved issues that might be
discussed, one of them being New Zealand fruit growers' demand to
have the right to export their products to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The visit will give Howard the chance to meet leaders of the
new government in New Zealand, including Prime Minister Jim Bolger
and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, to establish closer
personal relations.
</P>
<P>
Howard's visit will begin in the hot springs resort town of
Rotorua and move to the capital Wellington Sunday. He will leave
that country Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislators Exchange Views on Operational Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region held an informal meeting here today to exchange views on
administrative matters and rules of procedure, which are essential
to the operation of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai Tai, President of the provisional legislature,
said: "We had a very good exchange of views. The atmosphere was
very friendly. Basically, everybody spoke his or her mind."
</P>
<P>
According to her, the PLC is to establish two ad hoc groups on
administrative matters and rules of procedure at its first formal
meeting in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong, on February 22.
</P>
<P>
The PLC president stressed that the PLC would by no means
affect the operation of the current Legislative Council under the
British Hong Kong government. She said: "Before June 30, 1997 when
Hong Kong is still under British rule, the PLC will only make
preparations for legislative work after July 1."
</P>
<P>
"The legal status and basis of the two legislative bodies are
different," said Rita Fan. The power of the PLC stems from the
National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China,
while the power of the Legislative Council comes from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The British Hong Kong government does not favor the
establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council. Their
position is made very clear. In order to respect their governing
of Hong Kong, we do not hold the official meetings of the PLC in
Hong Kong before June 30, 1997," said Rita Fan.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member Provisional Legislative Council was elected on
December 21, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Planes Raid N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Sudanese army planes
bombed the northern Ugandan town of Moyo on Thursday afternoon,
killing one woman, the New Vision newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two Migs jets and an Antonov-26 warplane raided Moyo at 05:00
p.m. Thursday, dropping eight bombs targeting at army barracks in
the town, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bombs landed between the barracks and the town, five of
them exploding and making a 60-meter-wide crater.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army then cordoned off the area and experts will
be sent there to detonate the other three unexploded bombs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Salim Saleh, the president's military advisor in
the north, said the attack "deserves appropriate retaliation."
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to elaborate, only saying that the Defense
Ministry will issue a statement concerning the attack.
</P>
<P>
It was the first attack by Sudanese air forces on Uganda this
year.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has always been accusing Uganda of supporting rebels in
southern Sudan bordering on Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Entebbe Airport to Serve E. Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Entebbe international
airport, 40 km south of Kampala, capital of Uganda will continue
to be the main base for east Zaire aid operations, reported ''the
New Vision'' paper today.
</P>
<P>
Allen John, an official of the World Food Program was quoted
as saying that another air bridge is going to open at Mwanza in
Tanzania to back up the Entebbe corridor.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating relationship between Uganda and Zaire may
lead to a switch of the air bridge for aid from Entebbe to
Mwanza. Zaire accuses Uganda of backing its rebels and sending
troops to fight inside Zaire but Uganda has denied any
involvement repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
John said Mwanza would expand the airline. ''We may even open
more lines other than Entebbe and Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Entebbe airport was used as a main base in
international military operations to save more than one million
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. multi-national force for Zaire moved its
headquarters in Entebbe to Kampala on December 2, 1996 and moved
out of the country at the end of December last year completely.

<HEADLINE> Report: Arab GDP Increases 6 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The overall Arab economy
in 1995 registered an average growth of around 6 percent
compared with the previous year, according to an economic report
today.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Arab countries
amounted to 529 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, a 6 percent increase
of the previous year, the official Kuwaiti economic weekly Al-Shal
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report, classifying the Arab states in accordance with
their economic growth rate, places Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Libya,
Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Kuwait in the
first group which saw an average growth of up to 8.9 percent
against 2.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The second group, including Morocco, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania,
Djibouti, Bahrain and Qatar, registered an average growth of 3
percent in 1995 compared with 5.1 percent in 1994, while a
further negative growth from 3.1 percent in 1994 to 4.3 percent
in 1995 was registered in the third group including Algeria,
Sudan and Yemen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth of the first group is due to the rise of
average oil prices whereas the economy in the third group
countries further dropped because of civil wars following the
failure of their economic policies in earlier periods, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
On per capita income, the report put it at 2,090 U.S. dollars
on average, with countries as the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar being up
to 12,000 to 16,000 U.S. dollars, and 500 U.S. dollars for Sudan
and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The share of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in
the Arab GDP is up to 40 percent, despite the fact that their
population constitutes only 10 percent of that in all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, namely Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar and Bahrain, have stabilized their economies over the past
two years by slashing the deficit in their budgets and balance of
payments through adoption of policies aimed at rationalizing
expenditure and realizing fiscal balance.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were supported by a recovery in oil prices in
1995 and their economies recorded one of their best performances
in 1996 because of further improvement in crude prices.

<HEADLINE> 47 Ugandan rebels killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda troops have killed
recently at least 47 rebels including a former ambassador, and
the situation in the north is now brought under control, ''the
New Vision'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Aziz Amua, Uganda's envoy to Ghana in the 70s, was one
of the 27 rebels killed in a day-long fighting with the Uganda
army in northwestern Uganda. He was the logistics officer of the
West Nile Bank Front (WNBF).
</P>
<P>
Amua's body was brought to the northwestern town of Arua for
display. Colonel Wamala Katumba, the operation commander in West
Nile region, said that the WNBF group invaded Uganda from their
base in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In another ambush in western Rwenzori mountain, the government
troops killed yesterday at least 20 rebels of Allied Democratic
Corces (ADF), a source close to the public relation officer of
the second division said. The army captured 18 guns and a lot of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In the north, the fourth division has helped over 40 former
rebels settle down in its barracks in Gulu city. The 40 former
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) members had surrendered to the
government earlier and were moved from Kitgum.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Edson Muzoora, a Kitgum-based brigade commander,
said earlier that the government troops have so far brought the
situation in the north under control. Many LRA rebels are
reporting daily to the government troops with their guns, another
officer claimed.

NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic badminton champion
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen found his form again by beating Indonesia's
Ardy Wiranata in the 125,000-dollar Indian Open here on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who said he lost his next goal after winning the gold
medal at the Atlanta Olympics, took 50 minutes to get better of
Wiranata 8-15, 15-10, 15-1.
</P>
<P>
"This is just what I needed to hit top form again," Larsen
said. "But one win is not enough. I must continue like this for
the rest of the tournament -- and the rest of the year."
</P>
<P>
Second seed H. Hendrawan fell to Malaysia's Jason Wong 15-11,
18-15, while teammate and fourth seed Dwi Aryanto was upset by
India's national champion Gopi Chand 10-15, 15-13, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
That left only number three Heryanto Arbi to fight for
Indonesia at the quarter-final stage of the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised my teammates lost," Arbi said. "But their
rivals played much better. This is turning out to be a tough
competition."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus House of Representatives Approves Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has taken the first
concrete step toward delivery of the Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missile system when the House of Representatives
approved the country's defense budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget totalling 203 million Cyprus pounds (about 406
million U.S. dollars), approved Thursday by the House plenary
session, includes a deposit for the missiles and the purchase of
spare parts and other equipment for the National Guards, as well
as paying off debts, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the House's approval has
paved the way for the final act in the purchase of the Russian
missile system, which is expected to be deployed on the island
after 16 months.
</P>
<P>
The deal to purchase the S-300 system, signed last month, has
triggered criticism from the United States and some other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government has repeatedly stressed that
it is buying the missiles for purely defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup supported by Athens.

BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The expelled Moslem residents
of Mostar, a city in south Bosnia, will be allowed to return to
their homes in the Croat-controlled district under an accord on
solving the Moslem-Croat tension.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached between the Bosnian Moslem and Croat
authorities in Sarajevo Wednesday under the mediation of German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, obliged the Croats who first shot
at the Moslems on February 10 to take responsibility for the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered when Croats fired at about 5,000
Moslem pilgrims trying to visit a cemetery in Croat-controlled
west Mostar, killing three Moslems and wounding 22.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, the Moslems attacked Croat vehicles passing
Moslem-controlled east Mostar, leaving two Croats dead, 24 wounded
and 20 vehicles damaged.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled 2,000-year-old Government Envelope Lutes on Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 imperial and local
government envelope lutes dating back 2,000 years are on exhibit
in this capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
A lute is clay that is stamped onto envelopes or packages.
</P>
<P>
The 20 lutes were found a few years ago among thousands of
lutes near the site of the imperial palaces of the Qin Dynasty
(221-207 BC) in northern suburb of Xi'an. They were then smuggled
to antique markets in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lu Dongzhi, curator of a museum of ancient pottery in Beijing,
bought more than 1,000 of the lutes and selected 20 to be included
in the newly-opened Museum of History at Northwest University in
Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The other lutes are displayed in Lu's museum.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lutes were initiated in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty
(770-256 BC) and went out of style in the Southern and Northern
Dynasties (420-589).
</P>
<P>
They were most widely used during the Qin and Han (206 BC-220
AD) dynasties. To date, less than 10 lutes of the Qin dynasty have
been found.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the 1,000-odd Qin lutes,
representing 130 different official ranks, will contribute greatly
to the study of imperial and local government setups that have not
been recorded in historical documents.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Levy Garbage Tax in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A garbage tax will soon be
levied on the residents of Kampala, the capital of Uganda, the
New Vision daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Mwesigye, a city council town clerk, was quoted as
saying that the move aims to raise money to collect and dispose
of the garbage in the city.
</P>
<P>
People or firms producing industrial or commercial waste will
pay for waste removal and disposal and private firms will be
sought for dealing with the waste, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala City Council now is spending 5,500 U.S. Dollars
every day on removing and disposing garbage, which only accounts for
35 percent of all the 800 tons of garbage (solid waste) or more
generated daily in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of waste generated by Kampala's residents was
expected to increase to 977 tons per day in the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council allotted over two million Dollars for the
collection of 280 tons of waste per day in its 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
If the council, whose entire annual budget stands at some 12
million Dollars, was to move 90 percent of all the garbage, it
would require seven to 10 million Dollars a year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwesigye failed to disclose the exact amount to be
levied on household and commercial garbage collection.
</P>
<P>
He said the council is also drafting a by-law to deal with the
menace of the use, importation and manufacturing of polythene
bags.

<HEADLINE> New Seafood Production Base in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Rongcheng, a coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province, has become a leading seafood
breeding base for Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Local fish farms have combined pond storage for seven million
fish, and eight expensive species, with abalone, sea cucumbers,
and globefish predominating. The city produced 880,000 tons of
aquatic products and made profits of nine billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
It has imported a dozen marine varieties from the United States
and other countries in recent years, and fisheries have combined
with research institutes and universities in other provinces to
develop new marine products such as fish meal, fish oil, and
beverages and jams made of seaweed.
</P>
<P>
The 96 Sino-overseas joint ventures now engaged in fish
processing generated an aggregate profit of 120 million yuan and
150 million US dollars from exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the bigger fisheries have even opened offices in the
United States, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

MAPUTO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will provide 18.4
million U.S. Dollars to help develop Mozambique between 1997 and
1999 under three cooperation accords signed by the two sides here
Thursday, the Noticias paper said today.

<HEADLINE> Conditions for Inheritance Tax Getting Ready in China: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The time for China to levy a
tax on inheritances is getting ripe, according to a senior tax
expert.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for China to introduce the inheritance tax are
getting more mature by the day as the country's economy has been
growing rapidly for years and its people are better-off," Liu Zuo,
deputy-director of the Research Institute of the State
Administration of Taxation, told Xinhua News Agency in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese have become millionaires or multi-millionaires as
a result of the country's economic reform and opening-up drive
launched in the late 1970s, Liu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The laws and regulations pertinent to the inheritance tax, such
as those concerning heritage, notarization and financial and real
estate administration, have largely been in place, he said, adding
that Chinese citizens' awareness of paying taxes has also improved
over the years.
</P>
<P>
"All this has helped create the necessary conditions for an
inheritance tax in China," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The expected tax, as a supplement to the personal income tax,
will not only help ease a widening gap between the rich and the
poor, but also increase the government's fiscal income, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Though the tax volume may be small in the short term, the new
tax has a great potential in the long term," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the private industry and a huge
increase in properties like real estate, vehicles, deposits and
securities have combined to provide considerable resources for the
inheritance tax, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that an important factor delaying the
introduction of the new tax is that China lacks an effective
property registration system, which will make it hard for taxation
agencies to oversee the tax resources.
</P>
<P>
Liu proposed that the inheritance duty should target only those
people with a huge amount of inheritance, adding that he
personally prefers a graduated tax rate.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the inheritance tax, China should modify some
existing laws and rules and improve the property registration and
evaluation system, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Gold Dealers In Shanghai Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of gold shops in
China's largest city has dropped to some 300 from over 560 and the
sales of gold items was down from last year's peak.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, gold has become a form of household
investment, along with stocks and bonds, antiques, and real
estate, as individual incomes increased.
</P>
<P>
In the Yuyuan Tourist Shopping Center in the downtown area,
gold shops dotted the landscape and the local press commented that
the number of "gold shops in Shanghai was more than for grain
shops."
</P>
<P>
The city's gold market then went in a slump last year and a
significant number of small gold shops closed or were forced to
turn to other merchandise. Under these conditions, the more
prominent gold shops began to pay more attention to sales
promotions to attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
Sales at the Yayi Gold Shop, the No. 1 gold shop in Shanghai
with its 188 counters, in the Yuyuan Plaza, were more than 300
million yuan (37 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts here say they believe that the city's small gold shops
will have an increasingly harder time, while big ones will become
more prosperous and will gradually dominate the gold market.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Collects Record Personal Income Tax from Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing collected a record 130
million yuan in individual income tax from foreigners in the
capital city in January.
</P>
<P>
A local tax official said that the increase in the number of
foreign taxpayers was a major factor behind the record revenue.
</P>
<P>
More and more foreigners have been lured to work in Beijing as
overseas investment now abounds in the city. The number of
declared taxpayers grew by 216 over last December.
</P>
<P>
More bonuses for foreigners at the year-end also allowed local
tax officials to levy more tax, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's personal income tax revenue grew
46.9 percent to 19.3 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion US dollars)
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, Beijing led other areas in the amount of
collected individual income tax revenue, which neared 2.27 billion
yuan. Shanghai ranked second with an individual income revenue of
2.16 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Yunnan
Province has launched a project to strengthen environmental
protection, and will pour more investment into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its
environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest
coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve
zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be focused on 100 severely polluting sources, and
provincial officials will close 15 kinds of small enterprises. By
the year 2000, the volume of waste discharged by Yunnan will be
reduced to the national standard.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also has decided to strengthen environmental protection
of its lake areas, which are the main residential areas there, by
working out many restrictions for the use of lake resources. It
has already succeeded in improving the water quality of the
Dianchi Lake and Nanpanjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Regional ecological protection programs have also been launched
to reduce the deterioration of the ecological environment. The
province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the
forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar
factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only
tropical rain forest in the country located there.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Become China's Biggest Consumers Of Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans consume the largest
amount of meat in China, according to the agriculture and animal
husbandry department of the Tibetan Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Department statistics show that Tibetan herdsmen ate an average
of 102.5 kilograms of meat last year, and farmers, 84 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The region has seen rapid development in animal husbandry in
the past few years, with the number of sheep and oxen rising to
22.5 million in 1996, said an official with the department.
</P>
<P>
One indication of the level of consumption came from Yang Dron,
a farmer in south Tibet's Konggar County, who says, "I killed a
yak and five sheep during the Spring Festival," and she noted that
she has 20 legs of lamb in storage.
</P>
<P>
"I kill sheep in cold weather and keep the mutton in a
well-ventilated room," Yang explained, saying that it can be kept
for well over six months in this way.
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen in the northern part of the region consume the most
meat, figures show. One herdsman, Conyi, who has a family of seven
in north Tibet's Damxung County, says, "I butchered 73 sheep and
four yaks last year."
</P>
<P>
The region's meat output last year reached 116,000 tons,
according to statistics, and 68 percent of that was consumed by
local residents.

<HEADLINE> Entebbe Airport to Serve E. Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Entebbe international
airport, 40 km south of Kampala, capital of Uganda will continue
to be the main base for east Zaire aid operations, reported ''the
New Vision'' paper today.
</P>
<P>
Allen John, an official of the World Food Program was quoted
as saying that another air bridge is going to open at Mwanza in
Tanzania to back up the Entebbe corridor.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating relationship between Uganda and Zaire may
lead to a switch of the air bridge for aid from Entebbe to
Mwanza. Zaire accuses Uganda of backing its rebels and sending
troops to fight inside Zaire but Uganda has denied any
involvement repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
John said Mwanza would expand the airline. ''We may even open
more lines other than Entebbe and Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Entebbe airport was used as a main base in
international military operations to save more than one million
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. multi-national force for Zaire moved its
headquarters in Entebbe to Kampala on December 2, 1996 and moved
out of the country at the end of December this year completely.

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai Citizens Give Up Moonlighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Fewer residents in Shanghai,
China's leading industrial city and financial center, are
moonlighting to increase their income.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey of 1,000 citizens in various
professions, only 30.9 percent of employees of the state firms and
20.7 percent of senior employees in overseas-funded ventures are
interested in working a second job -- a practice which was popular
in the city a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that most of the people would rather work for
just one company, and others would like to try running their own
business.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, many Shanghai citizens had two jobs in
different companies, or did translation work, taught private
lessons or worked as sales agents.
</P>
<P>
A number of Shanghai enterprises currently do not allow their
employees to take a second job.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said people are giving up the practice of
moonlighting because of the intense competition in the job
market. In Shanghai, which has hundreds of thousands of laid-off
workers, people value their jobs that bring in a stable income,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 percent of state-owned enterprise workers said they
will place the most focus on their first job, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
More and more Shanghai citizens felt that though moonlighting
could increase their income, they could earn a satisfactory salary
simply by doing a good job in their posts.

in Istanbul at the small hours this morning, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official agency said that the fire was caused by
powerful explosions in the tanker, which broke out at 15:30 GMT
Thursday, in Tuzla Tersanesi of Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey. No casualties have been reported yet.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to Salih-C and Klaszina-C cargo ships in the
area, but the Turkish fire brigade soon put out the fire in the
two ships.
</P>
<P>
The fire brigade had been trying to extinguish the fire until
01:00 GMT and 17 fire brigade members were injured, two of
them in serious conditions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosions in the tanker was unknown so far.
</P>
<P>
However, Istanbul Governor Ridvan Yenisen said that there were
500 tonnes of fuel in the tanker that caused the big fire.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Environment Minister Ziyaettin Tokar said in Ankara
this morning that the tanker fire was "one of the worst"
accidents in Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 470,000
Tanzanians would have to be given food assistance due to the
prolonged drought hitting the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperatives Paul
Kmiti recently told the National Assembly in Dodoma that more
than 730,000 tons of grain, beans and other foods will be needed
to ease famine in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Monduli Parliamentarian Edward Lowassa, once the minister for
Lands, Housing and Urban Development, said more than 50,000
people in his constituency in Arusha Region, northern Tanzania,
are facing famine because of the prevailing severe drought.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government, donor community and individuals
to provide Monduli with food since people in the region do not
have any other means to survive the famine.
</P>
<P>
"They don't have money to buy food. Monduli people depend on
cattle keeping but the cattle are too weak to be bought by any
customer, while some are dying," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa said 47 out of 48 dams used for feeding cattle have
become dry in the region, therefore there is almost no water for
livestock there to drink.

<HEADLINE> 35 Kenyans Feared Dead in Lake Victoria Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- About 35 Kenyans who were
sailing between Homa Bay town and Asembo Bay in Siaya district
are feared dead after their boat capsized in Lake Victoria on
Wednesday afternoon, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
District Commissioner William Kerario who went to the scene
said that six people survived by clinging to pieces of wood,
jerry cans and baskets loaded with fish.
</P>
<P>
The boat Owila Transporters which was said to have been
overloaded by passengers and goods was caught in a storm and sank
about 40 kilometers from Homa Bay town in Western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A police officer at the Homa Bay said that the figure of the
dead could be higher because the boat with a carrying capacities
of 45 tons may have taken on more passengers from other beaches
on the way to Uyoma.
</P>
<P>
A rescue team from the Sukru Island and Uyoma beaches
abandoned their operations due to bad weather on Thursday and the
search for bodies is expected to start today.
</P>
<P>
Kerario told local reporters that the Kenyan government would
tighten its surveillance on the lake transport to curb the high
incidence of tragedies caused by overloading.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday tragedy is one of a series of tragedies taking
place in recent years in Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh
water lake in the world covering 70,000 square kilometers from
Uganda in the north, Tanzania in the south and Kenya in the east.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a boat ferrying more than 600 passengers
capsized 10 kilometers northwest of Mwanza and 288 bodies were
recovered after the boat sank in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Another boat capsized in the lake in rough weather in April
last year and 75 people died in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 36 people had drowned when a ferry
collided with a fishing boat in the area near Uganda's Bumba
Island.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The sudden death of 17-year-old
Sheema Chowdhury, who was kept in judicial custody in Chittagong
jail after she was gangraped allegedly by four police officer last
year, stirred great concern among various organizations in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Thursday ordered speedy inquiry
into the mysterious death of Sheema, who died in Chittagong jail
on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Sheema, a garments factory employee, was taken to custody by
Raozan Thana police on October 9 after she allegedly eloped with
her lover. But Sheema was allegedly gangraped at night at Raozan
Police Station.
</P>
<P>
The four police personnel involved with the rape case were
later arrested and sent to jail after a case was lodged against
them.
</P>
<P>
Legal action will be taken against those who harassed and raped
Sheema in Raozan Police Station, said the prime minister, adding
that the government is determined to take stern action against
women repression.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong jail officials, however, claimed that Sheema had
died from sickness. They said that she was earlier taken to
Chittagong Medical College Hospital for treatment on three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of women's rights groups in separate
statements Thursday alleged that Sheema was killed in a
pre-planned way to cover up the rape incident and demanded
immediate inquiry into the incident.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Comments on U.S. Use of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The cover-up by the U.S. and
Japanese governments of the use of radioactive bullets by U.S.
marines in Japan more than a year ago cannot but arouse the
public's suspicion over the U.S.-Japanese security treaty system,
a People's Daily article said today.
</P>
<P>
The signed article said that people could not help asking
questions whether the U.S.-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security, first signed in 1960 and revised last year, is
really, as Japan claimed, "not offensive," and whether there are
still some other modern weapons hidden in U.S. military bases in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese press reported Tuesday that U.S. warplanes
"accidentally" fired more than 1,500 bullets containing depleted
uranium during exercises in Okinawa, a U.S. military base in
southeastern Japan, in late 1995 and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The article said that it is unusual the incident was made
public by the media other than through official channels of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. Marine Corps regulations, the radioactive bullets,
each of which contained 5.2 ounces of depleted uranium, are not
allowed on training ranges except at certain sites on the
U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Americans know well the harmfulness of such bullets
and the regulations. Then, why did they transport the bullets into
Japan and later use them in routine shooting exercises? the
article asked.
</P>
<P>
It described as unconvincing a Washington explanation that the
bullets were used by mistake because they were mislabeled.
</P>
<P>
The second question the article asked was why the incident was
kept secret for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department said that there was no need to make
it public because the bullets posed no environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
That is obviously an excuse and the true reason is that the
United States administration wants to use radioactive bullets in
the shooting exercise but without public notice, the article
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
What puzzled the Japanese people even more is that the Japanese
government had delayed response to the incident after it was
notified on January 16.
</P>
<P>
As for whether it is true that the Japanese government was
notified of the facts as late as January 16 or whether the
Japanese and U.S. governments had any secret agreement on the
issue, only the insiders would know, the article added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sees More Economic Liberalization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Thursday great strides have been made in the
country's schedule to liberalize its economy, resulting
remarkable economic growth last year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 80 senior foreign diplomats in Zimbabwe,
Mugabe said the southern African country's gross domestic product
(GDP) went up by eight percent in 1996, according to a
newly-published report by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
However, a planned reduction of budget deficit to 8.5 percent
of GDP from the present 10.1 percent proved unattainable because
of some unavoidable factors, such as the civil servants pay hike,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe called on countries with diplomatic missions in
Zimbabwe to create and expand new areas of cooperation for the
welfare of all their respective people.
</P>
<P>
He added Zimbabwe is deeply concerned about inter-state and
internal conflicts taking place in the Great Lakes region,
Somalia, Liberia and Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Exports of Young Elephants to Hit Loggers in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- It is worried that an
increased export of young elephants could hit Thailand's logging
industry because of a shortage of the animal.
</P>
<P>
Under a Commerce Ministry's export scheme, over 40 elephants
aged between one and five years were exported last year, according
to Preecha Phuangkham, a veterinarian with the Friends of
Elephants Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said within the next few years, only old and ailing
elephants may be available to loggers if elephant exports remain
uncontrolled. Elephants are used for transporting logs.
</P>
<P>
Elephants export is highly lucrative as a young elephant in
good condition can fetch as much as 1 million baht (40,000 U.S.
dollars) from foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has an estimated 5,000 elephants, of which 3,000
are domesticated and 2,000 in the wild.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy to make domesticated elephants reproduce. Last
year only two female elephants raised by the foundation gave
birth.

KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadaka Ogata left here today for Tanzania after
discussing with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni the influx of
refugees in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Ogata briefed Museveni on the refugee situation in Zaire in
their private talks on Thursday, saying there are about 200,000
Rwandan refugees in the area near Kisangani in Zaire in need to
be assisted to return home.
</P>
<P>
It is a problem how to arrange a safe passage for the refugees
on their way back home, she said, adding the war in Zaire has
complicated provision of logistics to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Museveni advised her to discuss the problem with both the
Zairean authorities and the rebels, the New Vision paper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of those refugees who do not want to return
voluntarily, Museveni suggested that UNHCR should talk with them
and find out what their problems are.
</P>
<P>
Ogata also said there are about 42,000 refugees at Uganda's
Kisoro and Ishasha, both near the Ugandan-Zairean border.
</P>
<P>
Ogata arrived in Uganda Thursday form Zaire aboard a UNHCR
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Bans Reporting Strike by State-Owned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi government has
banned state-owned radio and television from reporting the
ongoing nationwide strike, the Media Institute of Southern Africa
(MISA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The order was in line with a section of the Criminal Procedure
and Evidence Act which bans all material likely to "incite the
public against the government", MISA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The act was passed on February 2 with effect from the next day,
a senior journalist, who asked not to be identified, was quoted
as saying by MISA.
</P>
<P>
MISA said it has been informed by staff of the Swazi National
TV Station that several programs dealing with the strike will be
shelved.
</P>
<P>
However, Swazi Cabinet Secretary Frank Buckham claimed he is
not aware of a governmental ban on coverage of the strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eric Dlamini, the under-secretary in the Ministry
of Information and Broadcasting, declined to comment on the ban.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite mass strike, sponsored by the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions with an aim of forcing King Mswati III
to agree to multi-party democracy, has been crippling Swaziland
for two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Rare Coins Found in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,900-year-old coins
bearing fish-like designs that are made by the two Chinese
characters "huo quan" have been unearthed in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the coins, unearthed in the ruins of
an ancient city in Boye County, are the first of their kind ever
discovered.
</P>
<P>
The coins were cast during the reign of Wang Mang, a former
minister of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-8 AD) who founded the
short-term Xin Dynasty (8-23).
</P>
<P>
During the period, knife-shaped and spade-shaped coins were
circulated throughout the country, but the most popular were round
coins with inscription of "huo quan."
</P>
<P>
The fish-designed "huo quan" coins are among some 15 tons of
ancient coins collected by the province in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The coins, falling in 1,000 different categories, were from the
Warring States Period (475-221 BC), Qin (221-207 BC), Han (206
BC-220 AD), Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), Sui
(581-618), Tang (618-907), Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms
(907-979), Song (960-1279), Liao (916-1125), Jin (1115-1234),
Western Xia (1038-1227), Yuan (1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644) and
Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and the early half of this century.
</P>
<P>
Also found among the collection were coins made by peasants and
those from Japan and Vietnam. Quite a number of the coins are
rare, according to experts.

NANNING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, a tourism resort in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, plans to enhance
the average per capita living space of its urban residents to
eight sq m by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the comfortable housing project
launched by the municipal authority has paid off: in 1996, the
city's average per capita living space hit 7.6 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The local authority noted that priority will be given this year
to solving housing shortages for those residents with average per
capita living space of less than six sq m, in order to lift the
figure to the desired eight sq m.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has an ambitious plan to raise the city's
average per capita living space to nine sq m by the year 2000.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The new export-import (Exim)
policy for 1997-2002 will stress on export promotion rather than
import liberalization as emphasized in the present policy,
Commercial Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
It would aim at increasing the country's share in global trade
from the present level of 0.6 percent to 1 percent at the
beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the policy would be to augment exports of
quality products by facilitating imports of quality technology and
production inputs.
</P>
<P>
The new policy would make export promotional scheme more
attractive. The policy is expected to lay emphasis on promotion of
agriculture and marine exports, which have registered negative
growth in recent months.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, EU Satisfied With Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Both Singapore Foreign
Minister S. Jayakumar and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo
today expressed their satisfaction with the just-concluded 12th
ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very successful meeting on the auspicious occasion of
the 20th year of the ASEAN-EU relationship," Foreign Minister
Jayakumar declared at a press conference he jointly held with his
Dutch counterpart here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two-day meeting had "set the right tone" for
a new dynamic partnership between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, attended for the first time in history
by the foreign ministers of all the seven ASEAN and 15 EU member
countries, ended here this morning after issuing a joint
declaration, which pledged to boost cooperation between the two
sides in the political, security, economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the two sides had spoken "spontaneously and
openly on many of the issues before us, including issues on which
we had divergent views."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was also successful because it went beyond mere
rhetoric and produced a positive joint declaration which can now
serve as a framework to strengthen ASEAN-EU relations in a
substantive manner," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He cited as example the differences between the sides on the
question of Myanmar, which the ASEAN plans to eventually accept as
a member.
</P>
<P>
"While there were divergent approaches, both sides had views
and concerns and agreed that the stability of Myanmar was
important," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar's prospective membership, "the ASEAN explained that
we have never imposed any precondition regarding the internal
political systems of the members," Jayakumar said, adding that the
ASEAN itself comprises countries with a variety of political and
legal systems.
</P>
<P>
However, the Europeans urged the ASEAN to negotiate "a
prenuptial agreement" with Myanmar before admitting it to the
ASEAN, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister van Mierlo, whose country now holds the
rotating EU presidency and together with Singapore was co-chairman
of the meeting, also struck a positive note about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very well, open, frank and free flow of discussion in
the past two days," he said. "This meeting was very positive."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ASEAN-EU relationship, which started 20
years ago, is characterized by "true friendship, mutual respect
and confidence." It is "strong enough to overcome the occasional
difficulties that might arise and flexible enough to cope with the
more itchy differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that at the meeting the two sides had open and
true discussion, not just an exchange of prepared statements.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine new baby animals,
including spotted leopards, spiral-horned antelopes, a black swan,
an Arabian baboon, a European brown bear, and a low-land buffalo
that are on the country's top protection list have given the
Shanghai Zoo a good beginning for this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the winter has been rather mild in Shanghai, the zoo,
which is China's second largest, has still made a special effort
to keep its 10,000-plus animals warm.
</P>
<P>
In related events, one orangutan provided by the Netherlands is
bothered by the cold so keepers added a warming light to its room,
and an 18-month-old chimpanzee likes to be held in the keeper's
arms when the weather is not so good, so it is provided with a
special heated room.
</P>
<P>
The polar bear was obviously quite at home in the winter
weather and felt at ease, while the African elephants and giraffes
seemed tamer in the cold weather after being caged for so long. A
mother elephant walked her children in the winter sunshine.
</P>
<P>
There were 11 tigers that suffered from rabies last December,
but nine passed their physical exam after treatment and were
released from the clinic, while the remaining two are showing
signs of improvement and will soon be returned to their pens.

</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union
(IPU) revealed that the percentage of women occupying
parliamentary seats in the world has dropped from an all-time high
of 14.6 in 1988 to 11.7 now.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest IPU statistics, only 7.1 percent of all
parliamentary assemblies are presided over by women while the fair
sex accounts for only 11 percent of political party heads despite
the large number of female party activists.
</P>
<P>
A five-day specialized conference of the IPU begins here today
to discuss ideas to bring about a balance representation of men
and women in politics. The conference, viewed as the first
high-level political meeting of women since the 1995 Beijing meet,
is likely to be attended by over 250 parliamentarians from nearly
80 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In the general elections to 73 of the 179 existing parliaments
during the last two years, the number of women parliamentarians
have risen by a tiny 0.4 percent, said the IPU survey.
</P>
<P>
Men hold 33,981 of all seats in the world's parliaments at
present while women hold just 4,512. Likewise, only 7.7 percent of
parliamentary group leaders are women and only nine percent of
party spokespersons are from the fair sex.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to enact a law by which the term of all the local
governments, irrespective of their duration, will end September 30
this year, concerned sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Law has formulated the draft of a bill "the
Local Government (Amendment) Act, 1997", which is likely to be
approved in the next weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing law, the elections to the local
governments should be held within 180 days prior to the expiration
of their five-year term. Sources said out of the country's 4,471
township councils, the tenure of 3,800 councils would end within
next March and April.
</P>
<P>
The delay in holding the township council elections has
compelled the government to enact the new law for giving legal
cover to the continuation of work of those councils, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft bill, the term of all the township
councils would expire on September 30 and elections would be held

<HEADLINE> Number of Dropouts Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that
the number of dropouts between the ages of six and 14 dropped by
nearly 10 percentage points between 1991 and 1995, and the
country's overall illiteracy rate has plunged to just over 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau sampled one percent of China's
1.2 billion population for the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 18.36 million children in the 6-14 age
range did not go to school in 1995, 14.51 million less compared
with that of 1990. The dropout rate among children in the group
went down to 8.38 percent in 1995 from 18.62 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The number of illiterate young people in the 15 to 19 age group
also was significantly reduced to 2.51 million in 1995, accounting
for 17.2 percent of the entire illiterate population above age
15. In 1990, the figure was 6.34 million.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of every 10 Chinese people could not read or write in
1949 when New China was founded. With government-sponsored
programs over the past 47 years, China's illiteracy rate stands
at 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
To improve the educational quality of Chinese people and
prevent young people from becoming illiterate, the SEC launched
the nine-year compulsory education plan meant to wipe out
illiteracy across the country by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
According to goals outlined by the SEC, at least 85 percent of
Chinese people will have access to the nine-year program. People
born over the past 45 years, and those over 15, are required to be
literate by the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released earlier by the State Statistics Bureau show
that the illiteracy rate among people in the 15 to 47 age bracket
is six percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, four million former illiterates learned to read and
write.

<HEADLINE> India to Tighten Entry Rules for Proprietary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to tighten the entry norms for foreign proprietary funds
in the secondary markets to pre-empt inflow of slush money and
possible violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) guidelines,
a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
It has also been decided that investments by such proprietary
funds would have to keep within the overall ceiling of 24 percent
applicable to financial institutional investors in a company, and
the investment ceiling of 10 percent on an FII individual.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken following a meeting of the Finance
Ministry and the Securities and Exchange Board of India officials
last week. It was felt that proprietary funds might open the
floodgates to slush funds, particularly narcotics money, into the
Indian capital markets, apart from impinging on existing foreign
direct investment norms.
</P>
<P>
The potential for violation of FDI norms arises from the fact
that every equity exposure by a foreign investor is subject to FDI
norms, whereby a foreign investor cannot take exposure in Indian
stocks without clearances from either the Reserve Bank of India or
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. An opening up of the
secondary market route to proprietary funds could thus be regarded
as a violation of FDI clearance norms, because a proprietary fund
strictly falls in the category of an individual foreign investor.

<HEADLINE> India to Amend Textiles Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government will
amend the Textiles (Development and Regulation) Order, 1993, to
include processing for standardizing the processing methods,
Textile Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The procedure prepared by the Textile Ministry envisages that
every processing unit, except those which have been exempted, will
be required to register themselves with the Textile Commissioner's
Office and give all relevant details in regard to the installation
of the essential processing machinery, the quality control
measures adopted, and the dyes and chemicals used in the
processing.
</P>
<P>
The Textile Commissioner's Office will issue necessary
instructions from time to time with regard to the installation of
machinery and adoption of processing technologies.
</P>
<P>
This move has been initiated following regulatory requirements
emerging from importing countries, such as the recent incident of
ban by Germany on azo-dyes and other harmful substances. The new
German law envisages ban of the usage of azo-dyes in textile
processing from April 1, 1996, and the sale of those goods
processed in Germany from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In order to sustain and increase the global market share of
Indian textiles, it is necessary to create the suitable
infrastructure to ensure quality, the same sources said. As the
Indian textile processing industry is unregulated at present, it
has been considered appropriate that minimum level of regulation
needs to be imposed to achieve the objectives of modernization so
as to safeguard the long-term interests of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Education Ministry of
Bangladesh has decided to set up 12 new universities of science
and technology in the public sector as part of the government plan
to bring about a qualitative change in the education system.
</P>
<P>
The initial cost of the project is estimated at 1.52 billion
taka (about 38 million U.S. dollars) and envisaged to be funded
from domestic resources, said sources in the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some officials from the high-powered Planning Commission,
however, expressed reservations in respect of the viability of the
project.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the government should look at the increasing
expenditure and problems in running the existing universities
before embarking upon such a huge project in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the project drafted by the Education Ministry, the
universities would be set up in important locations countrywide,
preferably in old district headquarters barring the places where
such institutions already exist.
</P>
<P>
The project document said of the 100,000 students passing out
higher secondary certificate examination every year, only 25,000
could currently get admission in the country's existing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The project would be sent to the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council for final approval, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Advertising Becomes a Boom Market in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Advertising has become a boom
industry in Vietnam, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Spending on advertising reached an estimated 270 million
U.S. dollars last year, mainly due to activities by foreign and
joint venture companies, and is predicted to reach 450 million
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of new private enterprises setting up every year,
competition is becoming fierce, as foreign and domestic businesses
realize that advertising and promotion can provide a major boost
to sales.
</P>
<P>
To win a foothold in the market in Vietnam, joint ventures have
been ready to spend vast amounts of money on advertisements and
promotion. In particular, automobile companies started advertising
their products to attract people who could afford their expensive
models.
</P>
<P>
Advertising was strongest for soft drinks, powdered milk,
detergents and medicines, but was relatively low in tourism,
entertainment and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The most widely advertised products were those belonging to
foreign companies such as Coca-cola, Pepsi, Tiger, San Miguel,
Decolgen, Esso and Castrol.
</P>
<P>
Television was the most popular medium for advertising,
capturing 60 percent of total advertising spending, compared with
20 percent for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But the explosion in advertising has led to problems.
</P>
<P>
Multinational advertising companies including J. Walter
Thompson, McCann Erickson, Bates, Leo Burnett, Praket and FCB
Public opened representative offices in Vietnam without strict
control from the country's relevant agencies, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements did not always reflect the quality of products,
and some pictures and words were unsuitable for Vietnam's morals
and customs.
</P>
<P>
Open-air advertising was also chaotic with dozens of
advertising establishments suspended, and tens of thousands of
illegal hoardings and billboards set up.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Expects Solution to Ex-Gurkhas' Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMADNU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has said that the welfare demands by former British
Gurkha soldiers in Nepal will be solved in the near future, the
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Deuba Thursday told an ex-armymen's group in West Nepal's Kaski
district that he was confident that the British government will
declare a solution to the problem of the ex-Gurkha soldiers within
two and a half months.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of those retired Gurkha soldiers in
Pokhara, about 100 km west of here, Deuba recalled his meeting
with British Prime Minister John Major during his visit to Britain
last November with regard to the welfare problem of the
ex-servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Deuba had reportedly taken up the issue of the ex-Gurkhas'
welfare demands with the British government during his trip to
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Gurkha soldiers in Nepal, who had served in the Gurkha
regiment of the British Army, earlier submitted four-point demands
to the British prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Their demands include pension facilities equal to that for
retired British servicemen, employment opportunities for their
children and their rights to live in Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to Gurkha sources here, about 25,000 ex-gurkhas in
Nepal, who had retired from the British Army after at least 15
years of service, receive monthly pensions ranging from 30 to 130
US dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
More than 230,000 Gurkha soldiers, mostly from Nepal's northern
mountainous areas, fought for Britain during World War I and II.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,500 Gurkha troops in the British Army
currently and most of them are stationed in Britain's overseas
military bases, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-E.U. Ministerial Meeting Ends With Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The 12th ASEAN-E.U.
Ministerial Meeting ended here today after issuing a joint
declaration which pledged to make efforts to further boost the
ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We had a productive and wide-ranging exchange of views on a
number of political, security, economic and other issues," said
the declaration issued by the foreign ministers of the
seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
the 15-member European Union (E.U.) after two days of discussion
here.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said, "While we recognize the existence of
internal and external challenges, we believe that our
determination to enhance cooperation, peace and prosperity in our
two regions will enable us to create a substantive and mutually
beneficial relationship."
</P>
<P>
The two sides in the declaration also expressed their
commitment "to reinvigorate and to intensify" their long-standing
dialogue and cooperation on issues such as peace and security, the
environment and sustainable development, trade and investment on
the basis of partnership, shared responsibility and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to increase economic flows between the two
regions, believing that this "will drive the dynamo in ASEAN-E.U.
relations."
</P>
<P>
In the political and security fields, they agreed to share
perspectives and information while deepening political dialogue
through "frank discussions of sensitive issues of common concern."
</P>
<P>
"Where differences exist, the spirit of dialogue and
cooperation between ASEAN and E.U. should continue,... keeping in
mind that the aim of the dialogue is to enhance mutual
understanding and foster greater cooperation and friendship," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also reaffirmed the importance of
mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two sides,
including in trade, business and investment and development.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to take action to consolidate, deepen and diversify
E.U.-ASEAN relations in a dynamic manner in particular regarding
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
"The developments taking place in the two regions give us
optimism that there is a great potential for a further
strengthening of our economic links," they said in the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN-E.U. trade has increased significantly. In 1995, the
value of trade between the two sides reached 86 billion U.S.
dollars, almost four times that in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were foreign ministers from the ASEAN
countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines and Vietnam -- and those from the E.U. members --
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) is launching an initiative to stimulate
economic growth and social development in Latin America by helping
countries apply information technology solutions to their problems.
</P>
<P>
The aid project, known as the IDB Infomatics 2000 Initiative,
will take one of its first steps in late May. The IDB and the
Global Information Infrastructure Commission (GIIC), a group
representing the world's leading telecommunications and
information technology companies, have agreed to co-sponsor a
seminar on technology in education in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will bring together experts in education and
technology to address progress in the use of technology in the
classroom. It will also discuss the policy and financial issues
relating to providing all students with access to global sources
of knowledge and life-long learning.
</P>
<P>
The IDB estimates that Latin America will need 10 billion
U.S. dollars worth of investment annually over the next five years
in order to meet the region's information infrastructure
needs. Most of the investment is expected to come from the private
sector.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Adjusts Investment Promotion Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's Board of
Investment (BOI) will adjust its investment promotion strategies
to better respond to changing economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
To combat problems the country is now facing, the board, which
is chaired by the prime minister, has decided to go on the
offensive by targeting Thailand as Southeast Asia's center for
telecommunications, transportation, education and service
industries, according to the BOI Secretary-General Staporn
Kavitanon.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is faced with declining economic growth rate, export
slowdown, concern over the current account deficit and
over-investment in the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
Other concerns include increasing labor costs and shortage of
skilled labor in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
To attain the target, the BOI has appointed a regional
investment promotion panel to encourage better distribution of
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The panel will make policy recommendations to the board on
special investment promotion zones.
</P>
<P>
Recently the BOI has given the green light to allow
BOI-promoted companies to own land, both for factories and for
residences, in an effort to stimulate the local real estate
market.
</P>
<P>
To make products more competitive, the BOI would help factories
to replace obsolete machinery by granting an import duty exemption
on replacement machinery.
</P>
<P>
To increase investor confidence, the BOI plans to announce
measures to help improve the relationship between labor and
investors. It will also coordinate with other government agencies
to cut through investment red tape.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the growth of high-technology industries and to
increase the future potential of these industries, the BOI would
push for better worker training and education.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's 37th Parliament Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's parliament disbanded
today after approving a bill authorizing the new caretaker
government to negotiate crucial loan agreements with international
financial institutions and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Parliament also passed a law cutting VAT and raising the income
tax threshold from 7,000 levs to 25,000 from 7,000 levs to take
account of hyper-inflation.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government was also allowed to invest 15 million
U.S. dollars of the proceeds of privatization into agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's authorization means the caretaker government can
now negotiate with the International Monetary Fund for new loans
to save Bulgaria's economy from total collapse, in particular to
feed the population and stabilize the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's economy is in tatters after years of mismanagement,
most recently by the ruling Socialists who won the general
election in 1994 but have been forced out of government after
widespread street protests and opposition calls for an early
general election.
</P>
<P>
The election will be held on April 19. Until then a caretaker
cabinet, appointed by President Petar Stoyanov and headed by Sofia
mayor Stefan Sofianski, will be in charge.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is facing a country in economic chaos. The
situation has deteriorated since the beginning of this year due to
worsened food and fuel shortages, which spawned two-month-long
political crisis and the depreciation of the nation's currency,
the lev, which plunged from 259 to the U.S. dollar to 2800.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has soared. Food prices rocketed an average 140
percent in the last 10 days, with meat price shooting up 165
percent and potatoes, the staple food for most Bulgarians, up more
than 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's domestic debt has reached 3
trillion levs (1.07 billion dollars) while its external debts
stood at 922.2 million dollars. Of this, 130.1 million dollars was
reportedly taken out in January.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation Wednesday, President
Stoyanov said the average monthly wage was now worth just 10
U.S. dollars compared with 70 dollars four years ago, and the
pension for retirees worth only four to six dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Caucasus Not NATO's Influence Sphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Caucasus is not NATO's
sphere of influence and the presence of the alliance's
peace-keeping forces would not help settle regional conflicts
there, a senior Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, press bureau director of the Russian Foreign
Ministry, said Russia's leading role in helping solve conflicts in
the Caucasus region was obvious to all.
</P>
<P>
As for peace-keeping, Tarasov said the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States would shoulder the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
There was no need for NATO involvement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Major regional conflicts in the Caucasus include the 18-month
war between Russia and its breakaway republic of Chechnya, the
territorial dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the conflict in Georgia's Black
Sea province of Abkhazia which is seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov's remarks coincided with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana's ongoing Caucasus visit.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Azerbaijan today on the last leg of his
four-nation tour, which started on Monday and has already taken
him to Moldova, Georgia and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the top NATO official has
discussed with leaders of the four ex-Soviet republics the
possibilities of sending a NATO peace-keeping force to the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Solana's visit, which Russian officials believe is aimed to
showing NATO's determination to press ahead with its plans for
eastward expansion, has triggered a wave of criticism in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to NATO's
plans since they were officially announced in January 1994. The
16-member alliance wants to take in former Warsaw Pact member
states from eastern and central Europe, but Russia regards that as
a threat to its own security.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Anatoly Chubais, director of Russia's Presidential
Office, warned that NATO's expansion would worsen relations
between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
That would damage the interests of both sides, Chubais told
visiting French Senate President Senate Rene Monory, a report by
the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Secretary of the Russian Security Council Ivan
Rybkin warned that his country would have to take retaliatory
measures if NATO insisted on carrying out its plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the European Union (EU) extended their
cooperation agreement to Vietnam today after a protocol to the
effect was signed here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The accord, first signed by the ASEAN and the EU in 1980, is a
non-preferential framework agreement, which sets out objectives
for commercial, economic and development cooperation activities
envisaged by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
It was last amended in 1985 after Brunei joined the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Manh Cam, who signed the document on behalf of his
government, described the occasion as "an event of great
significance for Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
He noted that since becoming an ASEAN member in 1995, his
country has been provided with tremendous assistance by the ASEAN
member countries and ASEAN dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
"This assistance has helped Vietnam to get expeditiously
involved in the cooperation programs and projects between the
ASEAN and the dialogue partners, which are instrumental in
Vietnam's efforts to integrate itself into the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that "This event also marks another step forward in
the development of ASEAN-EU cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Crimea Republic Elects New Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of Ukraine's
autonomous Crimean region elected a new speaker on Thursday and
withdrew a previous decision to sack the local government, the
Ukrainian Telegraph Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies voted 54 out of 58 to endorse 39-year-old Anatoly
Gritsenko, former leader of Crimea's local administration in
Simferopol.
</P>
<P>
Gritsenko was the fourth speaker of Crimea's parliament, which
has seen its leader changed for three times since its formation in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Gritsenko told reporters after the vote that he would do his
utmost to achieve cooperation and understanding between the
Crimean Republic and the Ukrainian central authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would strictly obey Ukraine's constitution
and laws.
</P>
<P>
The new speaker pledged to coordinate actions with his
predecessor Vasili Kiselev, who was sacked by the parliament on
February 6 after a no-confidence motion and then named by
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma as his permanent representative
to Crimea.
</P>
<P>
Crimea, two thirds of whose 2.7 million population are ethnic
Russians, was part of Russia for more than two centuries until
Russia gave it to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, as "gift" in
1954.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
that the country's rice production in 1996 slightly increased
compared to the 1995 output, but the production of several second
crops, except cassava, declined.
</P>
<P>
According to data published by the Ministry of Agriculture on
Thursday, in 1996 unhulled rice production reached 50.032 million
tons, up by 0.58 percent compared to the 49.744 million tons in
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of chief second crops, namely corn,
soybean, ground nut and mung bean, declined in the same period due
to a drop in harvest area.
</P>
<P>
With regard to corn, starting in 1996 the government has been
developing hybrid corn on 0.5 million hectares, and harvest was
scheduled in 1997, when corn imports were expected to drop, the
Agriculture Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for corn in the country has increased sharply from 1.28
million tons in 1990 to an expected 3.51 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's corn imports have risen from 1.12
million tons in 1994 to 1.3 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 200 million, Indonesia achieved
self-sufficiency in rice in 1984. However, the country is
currently under threat as rice-fields are being eaten away by
industrial expansion and disturbed by unfriendly weather.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Guatemala To Open Door to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today called on Guatemalans to
overcome the obstacles delaying the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped all problems would be solved so that the 155
U.N. military observers who will oversee the disarmament and
demobilization of the country's 3,000 guerrillas, can start their
mission as soon as possible, Annan said in a report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. has invested a great deal of resources in
the five-year peace process which ended 36 years of civil war in
the country. "This was the last stage in the stabilization of the
entire region, and Annan said he didn't believe anyone wanted to
be charged with thwarting peace in Guatemala."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has postponed the start of the observation mission
until March due to domestic obstacles, including the delay in
congressional approval for the deployment of the observation
group, known as the "Blue Berets".
</P>
<P>
The report warned that if such obstacles occurred again, there
would be delays in aid to the country from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the "Blue Berets" are reported to have already
arrived in Guatemala. The group is made up of military personnel
from Spain, Argentina, Canada, and Uruguay, under the command of
Spanish General Jose Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
The observers will stay in Guatemala for three months. They are
expected to oversee the demobilization and disarming of the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit which fought the government
for years to secure land, economic, political and cultural rights
for the indigenous population.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Call for Probe of Crime Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia's upper house of
parliament today ordered an investigation into the country's
crime epidemic, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said that the absence of a system "capable of
protecting civilian rights or freedoms" warranted such a probe.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the house, Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri
Skuratov warned that economic crime, including tax evasion,
already a serious problem, could reach epidemic proportions unless
corruption was contained and law enforcement stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Although the police's clear-up rate in solving crime rose from
64 percent in 1995 to 70 percent last year, the overall crime
situation hasn't improved, Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Council will begin hearings in the spring on the
state's fight against crime and the strengthening of law and order.
</P>
<P>
Crime, particularly economic crime, has become a major problem
in Russia over the last few years and government officials
estimate that between 20 to 50 percent of the economy has fallen
into an illegal "grey zone" -- the untaxed and unofficial shadow
economy which has become a breeding ground for corruption,
organized crime and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Last November, in a speech to interior ministry officials,
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said crime had reached such a
level that ordinary Russians lived in fear and state security was
under threat.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Lawmakers Launch Anti-Charter Change Drives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The two chambers of Congress
have launched anti-Charter-change drives against Philippine
President Fidel Ramos, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said at least 50 representatives Thursday crossed
party lines in filing a resolution urging the House to override
Ramos' veto on a provision in 1997 national budget prohibiting the
use of funds for the purposes of amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time that a serious attempt will be made
to override a presidential veto, the reports said, adding the
lawmakers were very confident that the resolution will be adopted
by the House.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, 19 of the 24 senators endorsed a resolution in
a meeting, denouncing President Ramos for exposing the Charter to
possible changes.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the "no-to-charter-change" provision was
included in the budget "precisely to safeguard the sanctity of the
Constitution and thwart any attempt" to amend it.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential veto would, in effect, allow the use of
unlimited public funds for the purpose of amending the
constitution," the senators said in the resolution.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos signed into law the 1997 budget on February 12,
but vetoed nine items in the budget, including the one that
forbids the use of public funds to amend the Constitution.

</P>
<P>
The exercise would be focused on mine-clearing capabilities and

and Palestinians signed an agreement on pullout of Israeli troops
from the West Bank city of Hebron last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after his three-hour talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House,
Clinton said: "The prime minister and I discussed what Israelis
and Palestinians need to do next to strengthen this relationship
that is so central to all our hopes for the Middle East. We have
an opportunity to build on the new momentum coming out of last
month's agreement (on Hebron)."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Netanyahu both said they exchanged ideas on how to
revive negotiations between Syria and Israel. But they did not
reveal how to put Israeli-Syrian peace talks on track, which broke
off last spring before Netanyahu's victory in election and have
yet to resume.
</P>
<P>
"I do feel encouraged by the discussions we've had, that there
are things worth working on, working through. It's hopeful that we
can get the Syrian track going again. But I have nothing specific
to say at this time," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had been said on his way to Washington on Wednesday
that he was going to present some proposals for resuming peace
talks with Syria, including a possible compromise on the Golan
Heights, part of Syrian territory, captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syrians have demanded the return of the Golan Heights, which
they said was agreed by Israeli former Labour prime ministers
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1995. That is the well-known
land-for-peace formula, which the Syrians insist should be the
basis for any peace talks with Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said his Likud government was not obligated to
honor the informal agreement between his predecessors and Syrians
since it was not signed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted that there were "a lot of things" to be solved
before reviving the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, but he was
optimistic as "there is a renewed sense of promise in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
When asked why the United States, while supporting Lebanon's
territorial integrity, stands against the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from Lebanon, Clinton argued that the United States should
be "somewhat differential" at this time for the security of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in answering the same question, said it was because
Hezbollah launches attacks against Israel. "If we simply walked
away to the border, the Hezbollah... would just come to the fence
and attack our towns and villages and our citizens from that
improved position."
</P>
<P>
Israel has for long occupied the southern part of Lebanon for
what it called a "buffer zone", which is another obstacle in
pushing the peace process forward in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Netanyahu had breakfast with new
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, during which they also
discussed ways to build on momentum for a comprehensive peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is the first in a parade of Middle East leaders
scheduled to visit Washington over the next several weeks. He will
be followed by Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock exchange listed
companies in China have been forging closer links with the
country's financial industry to seek new development
opportunities, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks alone a handful of big firms have
splashed out almost 160 million yuan (18.8 million US dollars)
snapping up shares in trust and investment companies.
</P>
<P>
So far, 50 listed companies, or 10 percent of the 530 companies
listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, have involved in
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
And many listed companies are negotiating with financial
institutions about participation.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that involvement in financial institutions can
enhance a listed company's strength, creating fund resources and
improving assets structure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that opportunities are enormous for listed
companies to participate in the financial industry since the
central bank has ordered state commercial banks to cut their links
with their funded investment and trust companies.
</P>
<P>
There are 180 trust companies originally funded by the four
state commercial banks, including Bank of China, Industrial and
Commercial Bank, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
Also, establishment of urban united banks and insurance
companies have offered good options for listed companies.

</P>
<P>
The Panamanian businessman said the Colon Free Trade Zone will

"Reports received from Quito say Ecuadoran customs have been
militarized, and now are under the care of the armed forces," said
Neahen.
</P>
<P>
He said the Free Zone businessmen who trade with Ecuador may
continue their operations when ducuments and bilateral agreements
signed by both countries are respected.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been suspended until the situation in that
country is clear. Commercial activities will not be resumed until
this happens."
</P>
<P>
The Free Trade Zone representative explained that Panamanian
businessmen must see their goods are protected and will not risk
losing them.

Deposed Ecuadoran president Abdala Bucaram, who is touring
several Latin American countries seeking support for his cause,
said in this capital he hopes to return to his country as
president and remain in the post until 1999, as established in the

SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Urban

BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- It is imperative that large
department stores improve their management if they want to be
competitive with chain-stores and special markets, the Minister of
Internal Trade has stressed.
</P>
<P>
The loose management of internal business operations is a major
reason for the decrease in profits recorded for the first time
last year by some state-run big department stores, Chen Bangzhu
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
One fundamental problem is the tendency to give too much
authority for ordering goods to middle-level management personnel,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the large department stores to set up computerized
ordering systems as soon as possible, in order to effectively
monitor the ordering process carried out by both manufacturers
and the traders.
</P>
<P>
The minister also demanded the improvement of financial
management, which will help to control costs and improve returns.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
returned Panama in the last 18 years 30 percent of land and 25
percent of buildings in the Panama Canal Zone, according to the
Torrijos-Carter treaties, the U.S. Army Southern Command said
today.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,408 buildings and 65,200 acres (26,080 hectares) of
land not yet returned, said the Southern Command in a report. The
Southern Command is a part of the U.S. Army operating in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
According to the Torrijos-Carter treaties signed in 1977, the
United States must revert all the military bases and the whole of
the Panama Canal no later than January 31 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1996 was important for the transferences. 6,009
acres (2,403 hectares) of land, which includes a 5,600 acres
(2,240 hectares) firing range," said the Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
Last year'S reversions included Fort Amador, a military complex
of 200 buildings on 200 acres (80 hectares) of land, where some
businessmen plan to build a luxurious tourism complex.
</P>
<P>
The reversion process diminished by 33 million dollars last
year U.S. military personnel spending in Panama, which had
repercussions on the economy of the country, said the Southern
Command.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Command stressed that the U.S. armed forces
disbursed last year 77 millon dollars in salaries for 3,368
Panamanian civilian employees who still work at the military bases.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces have planned to spend 238 million dollars
in salaries and social interest work in 1997, in coordination with
the Panamanian government.

Xiao said in an interview with China Daily that in 1996, the
rate of successful reform among inmates was above 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate of recidivism by inmates after their release from
prison was between six and eight percent, one of the lowest in the
world, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the last year, there were 1.4 million prisoners
in China, accounting for 0.0113 percent of the country's
population, according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
This is among the lowest in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the rate of escaped inmates decreased by 28 percent
from 1995. The rate of crime occurrences within prison decreased
by six percent from the previous year, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
China began to promote model prisons and centers of
re-educating through labor in 1994 to push the country's prison
and re-education through labor work to a new level, according to
Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Experience has proved that this has helped reform prisoners and
reduce crimes, according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Last year, five prisons were honored as models for providing
advanced prison equipment, effective correction systems, essential
facilities for prisoners' living and medical care, a favorable
atmosphere for prisoners' reform, viable education programs and a
highly-qualified prison police force.
</P>
<P>
These are included in the 42 standard items set for model
prisons by the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
China's prisons are intended to be a place of combining
penalties with reform and combining labor with education,
according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
"China's prisons are not so evil and full of violence as
described by some Western countries, but it is an active and
self-reforming world," Xiao quoted a British inmate jailed in
China as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that in 1996, the Ministry of Justice carried out
exchanges with many countries including Sweden, Finland, Norway
and Belgium and so deepened their understanding of China's
protection of judicial human rights.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that China is ready to further promote exchanges,
co-operation and dialogue with other countries on judicial human
rights.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers to See More Residential Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- More residents in the Chinese
capital are expected to bid farewell to their crowded bungalows
this year when eight million square meters of new residential
housing will be completed.
</P>
<P>
An official from the local planning commission claimed that per
capita floor space in the city will reach 14 square meters by the
end of 1997, an increase of 0.2 square meters from 1996, and that
flats with bathrooms and kitchens will account for more than 80
percent of the capital's homes.
</P>
<P>
Of the houses to be built this year, 600,000 square meters are
being built for the "comfortable housing project", which is
designed to ease the housing shortage of urban dwellers whose per
capita floor space is less than four square meters, according to
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Houses for the project are sold at 2,000 yuan (about 241 US
dollars) per square meter, about 40 percent of the price of an
average home.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital is welcomed in this sector, and it will be
exempt from tax or enjoy a tax break, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Investors in the "comfortable housing project" will thus have
their building costs reduced by 1,000 yuan (about 120 dollars) per
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Several residential housing projects financed by firms from
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao plan to start construction this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Finance have canceled 48 fees formerly collected in the course of
construction.
</P>
<P>
These fees, including some procedural and managerial fees, have
contributed to the high cost of building.
</P>
<P>
These fees accounts for 20-30 percent of the housing price in
some major cities.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is tightening its control on levying
fees on construction projects, strictly banning all items without
governmental approval.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to divert investment from the
construction of luxury hotels or business complexes to residential
houses since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Housing conditions in Beijing have improved considerably after
eight million square meters of houses were completed in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Bamboo Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- At a time when more and more
publishers are sending their works onto the Internet, a publishing
house in east China has published a book in the traditional form
-- written on bamboo.
</P>
<P>
"The Poetry of the Kingdom of Chu," the country's oldest
collection of poetry, has been re-printed thousands of times over
the past 2,000 years. But this is the first bamboo version of the
book made in modern China.
</P>
<P>
The poems, which follow both political and romantic themes,
were written by Qu Yuan, a member of the nobility and a politician
of the Chu Kingdom. He committed suicide in 278 B.C. after his
reform suggestions were refused by the ruler.
</P>
<P>
His poems were first inscribed on bamboo strips, the original
means of publication in China.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Publishing House used 197 bamboo strips to record
Qu's 4,600-character poems. These pieces were made by a group of
craftsmen under the guidance of a 98-year-old master.
</P>
<P>
Only 1,000 copies of the book will be distributed for
collectors, the publisher said.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Settle German-English Bidding Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- UEFA secretary general Gerhard
Aigner said on Thursday that the German and English football
federations would present their rival bids to host the 2006 World
Cup in Geneva on April 17.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital to debate this matter to see how we can settle
it," Aigner said.
</P>
<P>
According to AFP, UEFA, who will make a final decision on the
same day to settle which one gets their official support, hope
that only one European candidate to host the World Cup as they
feel two European candidates would split their vote and let
candidates from Africa or South America take advantage.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been hinted by English football chiefs that
England would make a bid even if UEFA chose Germany as their
official candidate.
</P>
<P>
The political leaders of the two countries also involoved in
the debate. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would campaign
hard for a German win while English Prime Minister John Major
enlisted the help of some of England's most famous footballers on
Wednesday to kickstart their campaign.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will make the final decision on who hosts the event in
2000.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Oil Company Sets New Deep Drilling Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's biggest state
oil company, Petrobras, has set a new world record by drilling
under water at a depth of 1,710 meters, the company announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The record was set in a well of the Marlim Sur field, which is
located in the basin of the state of Rio de Janeiro in the
Atlantic Ocean, said Petrobras president Joel Renno quoted by the
press today.
</P>
<P>
The previous world record of 1,027 meters was also set by
Petrobras. That was done last March in the same oil field.
</P>
<P>
Renno said that Brazil leads the world in deep-water oil
prospection. He explained that most of Brazil's oil reserves,
totalling 14.1 billion barrels, are in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras is one of the 15 biggest oil companies in the
world. Last month, it decided to boost production by increasing
investment to make Brazil self-sufficient in oil by 1998. Brazil's
current oil output is 900,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> NZ Bankers Trust Warns of Another Rise in Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rates of the
New Zealand dollar will climb again from the middle of this year
despite its recent fall, the NZ Bankers Trust has warned.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on the exchange rate, the Trust predicts
that the dollar will rise to 70 on the trade-weighted index by
mid-1998 although it stood at 68.66 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It expects the index to fall to 66 by June this year, rising to
67 by December before shooting up to 70 by mid next year.
</P>
<P>
It said the dollar will weaken further in the first half of
this year because of the Reserve Bank's policy tending to ease the
monetary conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, increased government spending and accelerated economic
growth in the second half will prompt the Bank to tighten the
monetary conditions, driving the dollar to strength again.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar had risen sharply by January this year against
the major world currencies, hitting NZ's export industries. The
opposition Labour Party estimates that the high dollar has cost
the export sectors 20 billion dollars (about 13.6 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Arbitration on Bosnian Town to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An arbitration decision on
the future of the Bosnian controversial town of Brcko will be made
on Friday, the U.S. State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
However, Nicholas Burns, the spokesman for the U.S. State
Department, refused to give any further details about the
decision.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton Agreement signed by the warring parties
in Bosnia over a year ago, a binding arbitration of the disputed
portion of the inter-entity boundary line in the Brcko area will
be made by a panel.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, the U.S. special envoy for Bosnia, is leaving
later today for Rome to discuss the arbitration with Contact Group
members.
</P>
<P>
Roberts Owen, an American attorney, is the presiding
arbitrator. "He is making final preparations for a decision,"
Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Roberts Owen intends to announce this
decision tomorrow in Rome," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to decide, not for
the United States government," he said. Therefore, he stressed,
it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment on the decision
before it was announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Thursday that he had nothing specific to say about resuming
Israel-Syrian peace talks although he was encouraged by
discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about
the prospect for those kind of talks.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful we can get the Syrian track going again... I do
feel encouraged by the discussions we've had that there are things
worth working on, but I have nothing specific to say at this
time," Clinton told a joint news conference after his talks with
Netanyahu at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had been said to present proposals for resuming peace
talks with Syria when he met Clinton in his fourth visit to the
White House. And he also said to make some compromise for the
resumption of talks, stalled for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
But the two leaders revealed nothing about how to put
Israel-Syria peace talks on track.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Killing of British Soldier in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today condemned the "callous" killing of a British soldier in
Northern Ireland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old soldier was shot to death by a suspected gunman
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) while manning a checkpoint
outside a village in the British province.
</P>
<P>
"All those who care about the future of Northern Ireland must
join me in condemning this cowardly crime," Clinton said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
"I remain convinced that the people of both of Northern
Ireland's traditions want to take the path of peace and
reconciliation, not hatred and violence," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I am grieved and outraged by the callous killing of a British
soldier in Northern Ireland yesterday," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The first lady and I extend our deepest sympathy to the
soldier's family and to the British government and people on the
loss of this young man," he added.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing.
However, both the British and Irish governments has put the blame
on IRA, which is fighting to reunite the province with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland has been in an
impasse since IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, ended
cease-fire one year ago. British and Irish governments demand the
organizations to renounce violence before Sinn Fein was invited to
peace table.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks in Belfast chaired by special U.S. envoy George
Mitchell, Clinton said, still had his full support. "I urge all
those taking part, who share a commitment to democratic values, to
move as rapidly as possible into substantive negotiation about the
future of Northern Ireland."

<HEADLINE> IMF Supports Peru's Reduction of Commercial Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced today that it has approved a disbursement
totaling SDR 160.5 million (about 223 million U.S. dollars)to
support Peru's debt and debt-service reduction (DDSR) operation
with its external commercial creditors.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that following the completion of the DDSR
operation, the ratio of Peru's scheduled debt-service obligations
to commercial banks will be reduced to 3.1 percent of exports of
goods and nonfactor services in 1997 from 7.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The operation is cost effective and is expected to provide the
basis for a return to voluntary financing by foreign commercial
creditors, it said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Hits Two-Year High in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's consumer confidence
has hit a two-year high and business confidence the highest level
ever, the Conference Board of Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian consumers feel that interest rates have bottomed out
and now is a good time to make a major purchase," said the board's
Winter 1997 Index of Consumer Attitudes.
</P>
<P>
The index reached a level of 104.6, up 2.3 points from an
adjusted third quarter level of 102.3, the highest level recorded
in two years.
</P>
<P>
The economic think tank's confidence barometer is based on
quarterly surveys of 1,500 households across Canada, the latest
being conducted in December.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of survey respondents who believe that now is a
good time to make a major purchase rose to 58 percent, the highest
level since 1987 and an increase of 9.4 percentage points from the
third quarter survey.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time since 1994 that respondents feel it is
a good time rather than a bad time to make a major purchase. This
bodes well for retailers," the board said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, absence of consumer spending has
been the major drag on Canada's economy.
</P>
<P>
To propel consumer spending, the Bank of Canada has cut
interest rates 11 times since late 1995, and commercial banks
reduced their prime rates to 4.75 percent, their lowest level
since March 1956.
</P>
<P>
Yet, consumer confidence would have been increased more were it
not for the chronic job insecurity. In 1996, Canada's jobless rate
remained stuck at around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the board's Winter 1997 Index of Business
Confidence reached a new all-time high of 153.1.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the increase are improved capacity
utilization and optimism regarding investment.
</P>
<P>
Yet, firms were pessimistic about their expected financial
situations, the board said.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of firms who believed their financial positions
would improve fell from 65.4 to 53.4, while the percentage of
those expecting financial situations to worsen rose from 5.8
percent to 6.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> CBO Says Clinton's Budget Plan Not Balanced in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) said today that President Clinton's budget
would leave at least 49 billion dollars in deficit in 2002 other
than the 17 billion surplus he claims.
</P>
<P>
The figure estimated by CBO, the non-partisan budget analysis
arm of the U.S. Congress, is gloomier than Clinton's projection
because the CBO analysts are slightly more pessimistic than the
White House about future economic performance.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton projected in his budget plan for fiscal 1998
a week ago that there will be a 101 billion dollars deficit in
2002. But the plan said its budget would produce 118 billion in
savings that year, yielding a 17 billion-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
But CBO expects a 2002 shortfall of 167 billion dollars without
any action. Accepting Clinton's claim that he would save 118
billion dollars that year leaves a 49 billion shortfall.
</P>
<P>
CBO Director June O'Neill said today that when Clinton's
proposals for paring Medicare, defense and other programs plus
raising some taxes are analyzed by the end of February, CBO's
estimate of Clinton's 2002 shortfall will probably get even worse.
</P>
<P>
She said an automatic trigger that would raise taxes and cut
spending in 2001 and 2002 if the economy does worse than expected
would have "uncertain" effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 budget plan, seventy-five percent of Clinton's
net 252 billion dollars in savings would occur in the five-year
plan's final two years after he has left the White House.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said Clinton's plans to delay most of the savings
"would not give total confidence that they would actually take
place."
</P>
<P>
How to balancing the budget by 2002 is the major dispute
between the U.S. government and Republican-controlled Congress and
it resulted in two government shutdowns a year ago.

<HEADLINE> OECD Calls on France to Adopt More Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua)-- The OECD report said that the
labor costs for low-skilled workers in France are too high, and
recommended that wage flexibility should be raised, including
reforming the country's minimum wage system, the SMIC.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that the role of minimum wage "as a distributive
instrument" be reassessed with the objective of increasing
employment opportunities, and that the minimum wage be
differentiated by age and region.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system
of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of
France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of
unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system,
replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained
relatively high for low income earners," it said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in
France be solved through "making the country's benefit system
less generous."
</P>
<P>
The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass
lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of
job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the
flexibility of work schedules.
</P>
<P>
It said that the costs of mass layoffs and the time they take
to implement are "substantial" in France, and that some
collective agreements on employment contain "stringent
obligations which can severely hamper the pace of restructuring."
</P>
<P>
It also regretted that while French enterprises can lay off
workers out of economic difficulties, they cannot legally do this
simply for obtaining economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since 1992, the supply of part-time jobs
has risen substantially in France, where part-time employment was
underdeveloped by comparison with other OECD countries in the
past.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that working hour flexibility for full-time
workers is "not as yet very developed" in France, even though
the relevant legislation has been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, agreements providing for greater flexibility
compensated by an overall reduction in working hours have been
allowed, but little progress in striking such agreements has
actually been made," it said.

<HEADLINE> French Trade Union Raps OECD Report on France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The French trade union Force
Ouvriere (FO) today rapped the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) for "imposing the liberal
model" in its 1997 annual economic report on France published
today.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization, deregulation and liberalization make up the
principal credo of OECD," said FO in a communique cited by the
Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The OECD called on France to reduce restrictions on mass
lay-offs by enterprises, lift restrictions on signing part-time
employment contracts, and increase flexibility of work schedules.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the French government reduce social
protection benefits and decrease minimum income for workers, the
SMIC.
</P>
<P>
FO Secretary General Marc Blondel said that "such reports are
good for being explicit: They lay bare the logic of liberalism and
fully justify the need for the union movement to accentuate its
international dimension."
</P>
<P>
"For salary-earners, such reports, under the cover of their
technocratic coldness and cynicism, make up the real decoders of
the economic policy currently followed in their countries," he
said, apparently referring to the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The FO also said that the latest social conflicts in Europe and
South Korea have proved that liberal economic norms "are not
imposed without bumping into oppositions."

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Says Stability Necessary for Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic said here Thursday 1997 will be the year of reform in
many fields but stability is of vital importance for that reform.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia has entered into a period of reform this year, not only
in economic domain but also in the overall social life, so as to
continue the process interrupted by the break-up of former
Yugoslavia, war and sanctions," the Serbian president said at a
meeting with the newly-appointed ministers of Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Serbian parliament made a reshuffle of the
government, relieving of several ministers and bringing into the
cabinet some new faces.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, "reforms should bring a higher standard,
security of citizens, enable a modern and humane development of
the society, establish economic, political and cultural links
between our country and the international community," official
Tanjug news agency quoted Milosevic as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that stability was absolutely necessary in
order to carry out reforms. "Stability implies a political
consensus, political and moral responsibility for reform of all
subjects of the society."
</P>
<P>
With attempts to end the political crisis in Serbia, the
Serbian parliament passed a special law on Tuesday, recognizing
the opposition victories in the November 17 local elections.
However, the opposition coalition continued its street protest
Thursday, which has almost run the past three months, demanding
freedom of press and more democratization.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent reshuffle in the cabinet, Milosevic
said he expected the reshuffled government would help create the
necessary economic environment, which would encourage production
growth and make use of the advantages.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary that all state institutions and the
society as a whole combat crime, corruption and all other illegal
actions. The government shoulders a special responsibility for the
affirmation of the legal order or protection of legality," he told
the new ministers.
