<HEADLINE> EU to Help Reform Steel Industry in Central, Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission,
executive body of the European Union (EU), reiterated Tuesday its
intention to help restructure the steel industry in central and
eastern European nations.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the industry was in a precarious state, the
commission proposed to help directly in the reform, or act as a
catalyst to stimulate investment from international financial
institutions and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The commission also pledged to boost the industry's
competitiveness and promote dialogue between central and eastern
European countries and the EU.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the restructuring is a success, those countries
will have to comply with agreements and priorities specified in
the accession partnership programs, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Those nations should also adopt a sound and comprehensive steel
restructuring program and strictly observe state aid rules, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials say the restructuring is necessary to
address problems of over-capacity and lack of competition in
central and eastern Europe, but the costs are high.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimate a need for 10 billion U.S. dollars
between 1994 and 2002 to pay for the social, regional and
industrial aspects of restructuring.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chairman of the Federation Council Yegor Stroyev told reporters
after the meeting that Kiriyenko had won the respect of regional
leaders when he spoke to the Federation Council on April 2 and
evaluated the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said the problem of endorsing Kiriyenko as new prime
minister would be positively resolved in the State Duma (the lower
house) as well.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with TV station ORT after the conference,
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the Kremlin did
not rule out the Duma's approval of Sergei Kiriyenko's candidacy
"at first go" on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the participants had varied attitudes toward
Kiriyenko's candidacy. The governors were increasingly in favor of
this nominee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Kiriyenko's policy report in the State Duma
on Friday would have an important bearing on people's attitude
toward him.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultranationalist Liberal
Democratic Party of Russia, has reportedly promised full support
for a government headed by Kiriyenko.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The main Protestant party in
Northern Ireland Tuesday refused to accept the draft document
outlining peace proposals for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This document is not something the Ulster Unionist Party could
recommend to the greater number of people in Northern Ireland for
approval," the UUP said in a statement sent to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Northern Ireland peace talks U.S. senator
George Mitchell presented a 65-page draft proposal earlier Tuesday
for a final peace deal that he wants the province's feuding
parties to strike by the deadline on April 9.
</P>
<P>
In the message, UUP leader David Trimble blamed the Irish
government for the current difficulties in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
"Before contemplating alternative proposals, I wish to know
from you and the Irish government if you are prepared to consider
radically different measures. I ask this especially as (Irish
Prime Minister Bertie) Ahern is on record as saying, as far back
as April 1 1998, that he was not prepared to compromise or
negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also telephoned Blair to demand that "radically different
measures" be considered, according to BBC Ceefax news.
</P>
<P>
"In all of this we have negotiated in good faith. It is now
apparent that others have not," Trimble said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Repatriate New Batch of POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Iran exchanged more than
700 prisoners of war (POWs) on Monday and Tuesday, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran released a fourth batch of 654 Iraqi POWs captured during
the 1980-88 war between the two countries. Iraq, in a reciprocal
measure, released 50 Iranian detainees captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
The swap ceremony, the fourth in a week, was supervised by the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) at the border
city of al-Mundhariya.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, Iran has set free a total of 3,954 Iraqi
POWs, and Iraq has released 251 Iranian POWs under the scheduled
program agreed on by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh al-Qaisi, Iraq's foreign under-secretary, was quoted as
saying that the Iraqi-Iranian Committee would continue its work
and efforts to accomplish all matters related to Iraqi POWs
detained in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"More Iraqi POWs would return home in successive groups under
the agreement with Iraq," said al-Qaisi.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports reaching here, Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammdi said that the exchange was
the start of an agreed release of 5,600 Iraqi POWs in exchange for
380 Iranian prisoners held by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been accusing each other of holding
thousands of POWs. The issue of POWs remains one of the major
obstacles that have been preventing the two neighbors from
resuming diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
At least 1 million people were killed or wounded during the
war.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Strives to Eliminate Woman Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will soon initiate a program
aimed at eliminating illiteracy among women in rural areas, the
Middle East News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program envisages teaching women in study groups at their
homes by instructors living in the same areas, said Amina el-Gindi,
secretary-general of Egypt's National Council for Childhood and
Motherhood.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will be carried out under the directives of
Suzan Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, is part
of a plan for comprehensive development of women and children
under implementation throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
People living in the southern governorates of Assiut, Sohag and
Aswan and the northern governorates of Red Sea, Giza, Qaliubia and
Port Said have been benefiting from the plan.
</P>
<P>
About 720 study groups in 36 villages of the governorates have
been formed and supplied with educational books prepared by
specialized teachers under the supervision of the council, which
was set up in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The groups will soon be doubled to cope with the increasing
demand by women, especially in Upper Egypt, el-Gindi said.
</P>
<P>
About 18 million woman villagers are living below poverty line
in Egypt, which has a population of 60 million. Woman's average
illiteracy rate stands at 64.7 percent, according to official
figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila arrived here Tuesday on a
three-day state visit to improve ties with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
This is Kabila's first state visit to the country since he
assumed power on May 17, 1997 after ousting former president
Moboto Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was given the red-carpet treatment at the airport by
his Ethiopian counterpart President Negasso Gidada, and both
inspected the guard of honor there.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his visit shortly after his arrival, Kabila
said, "we are here to consolidate the existing excellent
relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we have so many things to do especially at this
time when African countries are speaking about globalization.''
</P>
<P>
''We Africans cannot be part of the global economy if we don't
integrate ourselves regionally,'' Kabila stressed.
</P>
<P>
On instability in the Great Lakes region, the Congolese
president said the solution to the problem lies within the
peoples of the region who know better their own situation and
decried outside interference.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there will be a solidarity conference for
the Great Lakes region in Kinshasa soon.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government officials, diplomats and the Congolese
community residing here welcomed the president at the airport.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Reorder 1997 Fortune 500 List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A number of big U.S. companies
found that they are now sitting more forward in the latest Fortune
500 list as a result of mergers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Financial company Travelers Group jumped from No. 40 on the
1996 list to No. 17 in 1997 following its acquisition of Salomon
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley, another financial company, emerged as No. 35
from No. 162 as a result of its merger with Dean Witter, with its
revenues expanding two times.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, SBC Communications rose to No. 40 from No. 85 due to
its buyout of Pacific Telesis.
</P>
<P>
The Fortune magazine took into account size, increases in
revenues and profits, returns on revenues, assets, stockholders'
equity, market value and other measures to value the performance
of big corporations in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, with revenues of over 178 billion U.S. dollars,
captured the number one slot on the list for the 10th year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The other nine on the top 10 list are Ford Motor, Exxon,
Wal-mart, General Electric, IBM, Chrysler, Mobil, Philip Morris
and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
Total income for the Fortune 500 rose 7.8 percent in 1997
against 23.3 percent in 1996 as a result of rising labor costs,
weakness in Asia during the second half of the year, a strong
dollar and little room for price hikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the median return of companies on the list was more
than 30 percent, well ahead of the 21 percent return registered in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The greatest geographic concentration of companies on the list
is in New York with 61 companies, 46 of which are located in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
California follows with 52 companies, Illinois with 41 and
Texas with 36. Besides New York, the cities with the most Fortune
500 firms are Chicago and Huston with 15 each, and Atlanta and St
Louis with 11 each.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Cases Increase in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Cancer cases are on the rise in
Canada, with an estimated 129,200 cases to be diagnosed across the
country this year, according to statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 30-percent increase in the last decade,
and if trends continue, there will be another 30-percent increase
in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, "about 62,700 individuals will die from the disease,"
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The most frequent diagnosis among Canadian women will be breast
cancer, at 19,300 cases.
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer will again be the most commonly diagnosed
cancer among Canadian men, with an anticipated 16,100 new cases
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The total number of new cases and death for all cancer has
risen largely as a result of the growth and aging of the
population," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Better detection methods are another factor, according to the
National Cancer Institute of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The growing cancer cases will have serious repercussions for
Canada's health care system, which will face a cancer treatment
bill at least double that of 3.5 billion dollars (2.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in direct costs of treating cancer in 1993.

NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Weather changes in the past
winter brought lower heating and cooling bills to most homeowners

Home heating and cooling energy needs averaged 7.7 percent

in a report received here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Extremely mild weather in January and February caused energy
needs to plummet to about 25 percent below normal and in March,
and an early cold snap followed by record warm temperatures across
much of the U.S. pushed energy needs up about 18 percent above
normal.

<HEADLINE> Somali Leaders Go to Kenya on Peace Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The main faction leaders of the
Somali capital left here late Tuesday afternoon for Nairobi of
Kenya for an unexpected visit at the invitation of President
Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Confidential sources from the headquarters of the warlords
said Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid have gone on a
one-day visit to see Moi in connection with the current peace
movements in the capital, especially over the issue of fund
raising for the establishment of the up-coming administration of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The two faction leaders have been stuck together for more than
two hours at Issaley airstrip, 15 km North of Mogadishu, before
departing.
</P>
<P>
They were escorted by hundreds of their militiamen on dozens
of battle wagons to Issaley airstrip controlled by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, leader of north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the faction leaders depart from
the same airport since the civil war broke out in the Somali
capital 1991, which can be explained as a sign showing
understanding and trust between them.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders have so far agreed on the administrational
structure of the capital, the charter and the administration
build-up of Mogadishu's main installations, the airport and sea
ports which have been closed since 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the faction leaders are yet to finalize the power
sharing and name the individuals who would hold the key positions
of the forthcoming administration for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the faction leaders came at a time when tens
of thousands of goats and camels have been slaughtered Tuesday
here to commemorate Eid Al-Ad-ha, breaking the fasting month, for
the largest Islamic Holy festival.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of children in colorful clothes with sirens,
balloons and toy guns have moved around in the streets of
Mogadishu which have been quite and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
This Holy Eid has been marked in Mogadishu and elsewhere in
Somalia, especially in the main towns of Kismayu, Bossaso,
Jowhar, and Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway Somaliland
republic.

<P>
In a statement issued Monday in Lilongwe, capital of Malawi,

pupils, in addition to providing improved teaching and learning
materials to all secondary schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Educating girls has shown to have many important impacts:
reduced fertility rates, improved child health and increasing
income and potential for woman, all of which contribute
significantly to raising household incomes and reducing poverty,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Besides a "special HIV/AIDS education component," it added,
other components of the project include training school
administrators to better support teachers in their classrooms and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Financial Companies Invest More in Information Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. financial industries have
increased their spending in the strategic information technology,
a study has found.
</P>
<P>
Strategic spending means money put into systems allowing the
financial institutions to gain competitive differenciation and
advantages, according to Meridien Research and The American
Banker, the two U.S. companies doing the study.
</P>
<P>
In their Strategic Technology Investment Report 1998 released
Tuesday, they said the routine technology spending in maintenance,
hardware replacement, upgrades of operating systems and other
software licenses and enhancements to legacy systems has fallen in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, strategic spending was estimated at 16 percent of
total information technology (IT) spending or about 7.6 billion
U.S. dollars, compared to less than 10 percent of total IT
spending traditionally when routine spending occupied over 90
percent of IT spending, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While routine IT expenditures are set to grow at a relatively
modest rate-of-inflation-like 4.7 percent annually for the rest of
the century, the study found that strategic IT spending should
grow at a far more robust 17.7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, strategic projects are projected to account for more
than 20 percent of total IT spending.

<HEADLINE> Angola Thanks World for Help in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Robert de Almeida, Speaker of the
Angolan Parliament, Tuesday expressed his gratitude for all the
help the international community has offered to Angola's peace
process, which has achieved phenomenal progress.
</P>
<P>
Almeida said in his speech at the 99th annual conference of
the Inter-parliamentary Union in Windhoek of Namibia that the
great achievement in the peace process in the country is closely
connected with aid from international community, which has
imposed pressure on the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He said the consolidation of peace is an important condition
for economic reconstruction and development and that peace is
playing an unprecedented role in development.
</P>
<P>
Almeida said, however, that some of the UNITA military
remnants are still involving in cases against the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Protocol, by ambushing vehicles, looting, and mounting
military attacks on governmental institutions, thus sabotaging
stability in the country and hindering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As UNITA has failed to undertake its military commitments,
such as the establishment of government institutions in the six
UNITA-controlled areas, the government has not yet finished its
political tasks of collecting arms from the citizens as outlined
in the new peace timetable, he said.
</P>
<P>
After final peace is materialized in the country, Almeida
said, the government and the people would heal the wounds of the
civil war and realize democracy, social justice and economic
development in stability and peace.

<HEADLINE> Karadayi: Turkey's Problem With Greece Could Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military chief Ismail H.
Karadayi said Tuesday that Turkey's problems with Greece should be
settled by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
All disputes between Turkey and Greece could and should be
resolved through bilateral meetings and well-intentioned dialogue,
said Turkish Chief of Staff General Karadayi on the sidelines of a
meeting of Western European Union (WEU) chiefs of staff in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi, who arrived here Sunday to attend the WEU chiefs of
staff meeting, discussed Monday with his Greek counterpart,
General Athanasios Tzoganis, a broad range of military issues
regarding the two countries in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
During their one-hour "informal" meeting, both sides reportedly
confirmed their will to implement a previous agreement that
Turkish and Greek war games should not coincide in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their "positive stance" concerning possible
future meetings.
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek press, the Karadayi-Tzoganis meeting was
the result of the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) mediation.
</P>
<P>
As for the WEU military chief meeting, Karadayi stressed that
Turkey, an associate member of the WEU, would participate in
military exercises scheduled by the group's headquarters on equal
terms with the other WEU members.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said Tuesday that talks within the framework of NATO on
the adoption of confidence-building measures in the Aegean had
progressed to the point that decisions must now be taken.
</P>
<P>
If the Turkish side did not try to create fait accompli on
other matters concerning national sovereignty, Greece would be
able to adopt favorable measures which would improve the climate
in Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi's visit to Greece, the first since he became the
Turkish military chief two years ago, comes at a time of increased
tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over decades for their
disputes concerning the territorial waters, air space limits and
continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Although efforts have been made by both sides to better their
strained relations, no substantial progress has so far been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Slams PNA for Clearing Israel's Name in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hamas political leader in Gaza
Abdel Aziz Rantisi on Tuesday slammed Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) for clearing Israel's responsibility in the death
of Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in a Hamas rally in Gaza, Rantisi said
the conclusion of the PNA's investigation into Sharif's death was
full of contradictions. He insisted that Hamas' own investigation
showed Israel was responsible for killing Sharif, whose deformed
body was found in an exploded car in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on March 29.
</P>
<P>
The PNA announced Monday that its investigation into the
matter showed that Sharif was killed by fellow members in the
Hamas' military wing of Izzedin Kassim in internal feud. The PNA
security forces have arrested five suspects who were involved in
the killing and confiscated a large amount of explosives.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which was originally blamed for killing Sharif by both
Palestinian officials and Hamas, welcomed the PNA conclusion as a
positive sign. Israel feared that the allegation of its role in
killing Sharif could spark a new wave of avenge attacks by Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi accused the PNA of pursuing Hamas' military wing of
Izzedin Kassim, which is responsible for carrying out suicide
bombings in Israeli public places and buses. He said Palestinian
security forces had already detained about 250 Izzedin Kassim
members and are continuing the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces continue to be on high
alert against possible terror attacks because of Hamas' refusal
to accept the PNA's investigation results. Extra security forces
were deployed in public places and checkpoints ahead of the
coming Jewish holiday of Passover.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials said that although there are no
concrete warnings of terror attacks, the security measures would
be kept until after the Passover.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces
remain on high alert amid continued Hamas accusation that Israel
should be responsible for the death of its top bomb maker Muhi
Sharif, a senior Israeli army officer said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, Israeli Deputy Army Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofez said the security forces are doing their best to prevent
Hamas from attacking Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mofez said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is not
doing enough to fight the civilian infrastructure of Hamas and
that Israel is expecting it to do more.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more steps should be taken by the PNA to act
against the "anti-Israel incitement" preached in mosques.
</P>
<P>
Hamas maintained that Israel was behind the death of Sharif
despite PNA's Monday announcement of its findings that the Hamas
activist was killed by his rivals in an internal power struggle
for leadership.
</P>
<P>
It has rejected PNA's findings as "lies" and vowed to continue
its struggle against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The body of Sharif was found on March 29 in the West Bank city
of Ramallah in an explosive-rigged car, which had been detonated
by a remote control. Palestinian security officials said Sharif
was shot to death before he was dump in the car.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Discusses Troop Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu chaired a meeting of the so-called Kitchen Cabinet on
Tuesday to discuss the troop pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the prime minister's office told reporters that
the meeting focused on the policies that Israel would follow on
the issue and the conditions it would set for the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to fulfill before conducting the pullback.
</P>
<P>
No more details were released. But Israel Radio said the
meeting agreed Israel would not withdraw from more than 9 percent
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The top-level discussion was held at a time when the United
States is reportedly considering new steps aimed at breaking the
stalemate in the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Mideast Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross have reportedly briefed U.S. President
Bill Clinton on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross concluded a shuttle mission last week between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, but failed to win their acceptance of a
reported U.S. plan calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent
of the West Bank in 12 weeks, met by Palestinian crackdown on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly will return to the region next week for a new
round of mediation.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating possible U.S. pressure, Netanyahu is to send his
close adviser Yitzhak Molcho to Washington to try to soften the
U.S. position on the troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israel's security cabinet comprising 11 of the 18
ministers will discuss the troop pullback and coordinate the
government position.

WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Department
quietly gave permission six months ago for U.S. health care firms
to show their wares at a trade show in Cuba, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials minimized the significance of the decision,
noting that the issuance of such licenses is consistent with Cuba
legislation that exempts medicines and medical supplies from the
U.S. embargo against the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the license was issued to an
exhibition company, but each of the firms wishing to take part in
the trade show must acquire a separate license.
</P>
<P>
John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council, which seeks to promote trade with Cuba, praised the
Treasury Department decision.
</P>

He called it "the single most significant change in U.S.

<HEADLINE> Russian Main Parties on Kiriyenko's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's second largest party, Our
Home is Russia (NDR) headed by former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Tuesday said it will not back Sergei
Kiriyenko as prime minister unless NDR members receive key
portfolios in his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax, the definitive position was stated
by NDR following a so-called roundtable meeting held Tuesday,
involving the president, all the leaders of the parliamentary
factions and groups as well as some members of the Upper House and
representatives from the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
The Chernomyrdin's party is ready for rapid reaction to
specific government decisions, including joining the opposition,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said after the
roundtable discussion that Kiriyenko's candidacy to the prime
minister's post will most likely be rejected by the Duma Friday
when it holds a plenary debate on it.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Kiriyenko's candidacy may be approved later, he
said that the left-wing opposition will discuss this possibility.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's roundtable meeting, Zyuganov demanded that both
houses of the Russian parliament and representatives of the
government, within two weeks, work out a clear-cut program for
leading the country out of its crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko faction in the State Duma views Sergei Kiriyenko's
government as provisional, faction leader Grigory Yavlinsky told
reporters after the roundtable talks.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Yabloko faction will not vote for
Kiriyenko as a candidate for prime minister at the Duma's meeting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky held that the Kiriyenko government formed in this way
will not be able to pull the country out of the current crisis
without public support.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko party is ready to form a government that has its
program, its team and is prepared to assume the responsibility,
according to Yavlinsky.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Urged to Ratify Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
urged the Senate Tuesday to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) by the autumn.
</P>
<P>
The appeal by senior administration officials was aimed at Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, who has declined to hold hearings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State John Holum said that the United States
can rely on simulated tests for the American nuclear program, the
Senate has "a historic opportunity" to make it harder for
non-nuclear nations to develop the weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Without testing, it's an insurmountable barrier," Holum told
reporters as the State Department marked the 10th anniversary of a
direct link between Washington and Moscow to alert each other to
missile tests or other provocative moves that could jangle nuclear
nerves.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott exchanged congratulatory
messages by computer with the risk-reduction center in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said that the threat of an attack is graver today even
with several treaties to cut nuclear and chemical weapons arsenals
because weapons are cheaper to make and are more portable.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT covenant has been signed by 149 countries and ratified
by 13. The latest were Britain and France, the first nuclear
powers to ratify the ban on all nuclear weapons test explosions.
</P>
<P>
For the treaty to take force, 44 countries identified as having
a nuclear capability must ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Holum said polls indicate that only 13 percent of the American
public opposes a ban on nuclear weapons tests and that the
administration has the votes in the Senate for ratification if the
Foreign Relations Committee would act on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Without Senate ratification, it will be difficult for the U.S.
to keep insisting that Iraq cooperate with U.N. inspectors who are
looking for evidence of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
programs, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Malawi: Nacala Corridor Railway Rehabilitated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nacala Corridor, Malawi's
shortest rail route to and from the Indian Ocean port on the
Mozambican coast has been rehabilitated, according to a Zambian
News Agency report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 800-kilometer-long railway is now in good shape, cutting
freight time on the corridor from 10 hours before rehabilitation
to four at present, Malawi Railways' General Manager Enoch Limbe
told Pan-Africa News Agency Tuesday in Lilongwe, capital of
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Limbe urged the country's business community to fully utilize
the corridor, the "cheapest" yet for Malawi's external trade.
</P>
<P>
By using the Nacala port, said Limbe, Malawian consumers will
benefit through cheaper products on their shop shelves.
</P>
<P>
"Economists have proved that transport contributes to over 40
percent of production costs in Malawi," Limbe said, "but by using
the Nacala Corridor, traders and producers can reduce their
transportation costs by 25 percent to 30 percent."
</P>
<P>
Currently, Malawian businessmen prefer the southern Mozambique
port of Beira for their external trade. Beira, about 1000
kilometers south of Nacala and Malawi's traditional trade outlet
on the Indian Ocean, is the terminal of the 830 kilometer-long
single-line rail link from Salima on the central shore of lake
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's two external trade routes to Beira and Nacala faced
major disruption after guerrilla activities in Mozambique
increased in 1981 until the routes were closed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The two routes were rehabilitated in 1985, supported by a
group of international donors under the guidance of the Southern
African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The Nacala Corridor was not reopened until a cease-fire was
agreed along the line between the rebel guerilla and the
Mozambican government in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, traffic resumed slowly, owing to the disrepair of the
line and to the uncertain security situation.

However, the inflation rate was expected to climb up in April

DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has re-opened the troublesome Mwembechai Mosque in Dar es Salaam
and worshipers started to use it for daily prayers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mosque has been closed down since March 29 riot and has
been under maximum guard by the police and the Field Force Unit
(FFU).
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, warned
Tuesday that the government will not hesitate to take stern
measures against any worshipers to be involved in religious
riots.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the police will be deployed at the
mosque until the government feels satisfied that peace has been
fully restored in the Mosque area.
</P>
<P>
Ameir called on worshipers to co-operate with the trustees of
the mosque in running it peacefully and make sure that no more
religious riots take place.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, hundreds of rioters near the mosque burnt two
government vehicles, injured several people and looted shops.
During the riot, two people were killed, including a
three-year-old girl. The police and the FFU were forced to use
tear gas to disperse the mob.
</P>
<P>
The riot, the third that has happened in the Mosque area since
Mid-February, was reported to take place after the police banned
a religious meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minister maintained that the police will continue to hunt
Ponda Issa Ponda, the Secretary of the Committee for Moslems
Rights, who is believed to have masterminded the riots.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Producer Inflation Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's year-on-year
producer inflation fell to 2.5 percent in February from January's
3.2 percent, boosting new hope for a further interest rate cut in
the country, South Africa's national TV SABC said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The producer price index, a strong indicator of future
consumer price index, registered a negative growth of 0.3 percent
on the month-on-month basis.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said the 2.5 percent producer inflation rate,
which was better than market expectations, could lead to a
further interest rate cut in the near future. South Africa's
major banks lowered their interest rates by an average one
percentage point in March.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's year-on-year producer inflation scored a
27-year low in last December at 4 percent and it slipped further
to 3.2 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation of S. Leone Refugees Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The operation to repatriate Sierra
Leonean refugees from neighboring Guinea has come to a complete
halt three weeks since it started.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
which suspended the exercise, did not give any official reason
for the move however, according to a British Broadcasting
Corporation report monitored here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The report said the suspension may be partly attributed to
Sierra Leones who are making money out of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a UNHCR source as blaming that the tickets issued to
registered returnee refugees have been resorted to businessmen
and women who are making higher profits from them than from
border trade.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when the repatriation exercise will
resume.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have fled to
neighboring Guinea and Liberia since a coup overthrew the
legitimate government last May.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Donotes One Million U.S. Dollar to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has contributed
one million U.S. dollars to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) for its humanitarian programs, the UNHCR
said in a statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the donation, the largest South Africa had
made to the organization, was in response to a request made last
year by High Commissioner Sadako Ogata to South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money would be used to fund the Angolan
repatriation and reintegration program, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's Director for Southern African Operations Nicolas
Bwakiri said "this is a clear demonstration of South Africa's
commitment to solve the problem of refugees and find a long-term
solution.
</P>
<P>
"It is the earnest hope of the UNHCR that South Afirca's
contribution will be matched by other countries."
</P>
<P>
Bwakiri, who had just returned from Angola, said the peace
process in the country had gained considerable momentum in the
past month.
</P>
<P>
As a result of positive developments and increased stability
in Angola, the UNHCR planned to launch a 23 million U.S. dollars
appeal to fund the repatriation and reintegration of 240,000
Angolan refugees, who were in the neighboring countries of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Namibia and
Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The apeal was expected to be made in Geneva later this month.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1995, more than 135,000 Angolan refugees had
returned home.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, which had established offices in several centers
across Angola to assist returnees, had rehabilitated 333
kilometers of roads, built 23 bridges and 14 schools and three
municpal hospitals in returnee areas.
</P>
<P>
The organization also provided returnees with food and other
assistance, including seeds and tools, Bwakiri said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Contributes 1.3 Bln Yen to HIPC Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
contribute 1.3 billion yen, which is equivalent to 10 million U.S.
dollars to support the World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement from the World Bank here Tuesday,
the contribution will be used to help finance the African
Development Bank's share of debt relief under the HIPC debt
initiative, through its Policy and Human Resources Development
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Debt Initiative was proposed jointly by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, and approved in September
1996. It enables poor countries with good policy performance to
escape from unsustainable debt, and focus all their energies on
striving for sustainable development and reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Trust Fund, which is administered by the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessional lending
wing, will help participating multilateral creditors, particularly
the African Development Bank, provide debt relief to eligible
HIPCs on debt owed to them. The HIPC Trust Fund will either prepay
or purchase a portion of the debt owed to a multilateral creditor
and cancel such debt, or pay debt service as it comes due.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Japan, other bilateral donors include Canada,
Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland,
and Britain.

<HEADLINE> 8,500-Year-Old Canoe Unearthed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in Nigeria have
unearthed a canoe believed to be 8,500 years old, in Yobe State
in northern part of the country, the News Agency of Nigeria said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 8.4-meter canoe, however, was not excavated intact as some
of its parts got broken and had to be carried in pieces, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The canoe was discovered on May 4, 1987 by a herdsman named
Malam Ya'u Msua, in Dafuna, a village along the Komadugu Gana
River.
</P>
<P>
Two separate radio-carbon tests gave the dates of its
construction as 7,600 B.C. and 6,600 B.C., respectively, giving
it an age of between 8,000 and 8,500 years.
</P>
<P>
This makes the canoe the oldest in Africa and the second
oldest in the world, according to Nigerian experts.
</P>
<P>
The excavation work was done by two archaeologists and a
conservator from the National Commission for Museum and Monuments
and another archaeologist from the University of Maiduguri,
according to an earlier report.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report said it took the archaeologsts and 60
laborers two weeks to dig out the canoe from five meters below
the earth.
</P>
<P>
The work was started on March 23 originally and expected to
take only one week, but the report said it was made much harder
by the thousands of people who rushed to the site to have a
glimse of the canoe as it was being dug out.
</P>
<P>
The canoe is now being kept at a preservation house at
Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State.
</P>
<P>
A conference will be held this month in Damaturu with the
expected attendance of 45 archaelogists to mark the excavation of
the canoe, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Meets N.Irish Leaders to Salvage Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
spent Tuesday evening talking to party leaders involved in the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
He flew to Belfast Tuesday afternoon to try to rescue the
Northern Ireland peace process after two of the pro-British
Unionist parties, including the major Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
rejected a draft peace plan presented by Northern Ireland talks
chairman George Mitchell early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was optimistic about the peace process. "I am not
promising we can do it. I never promised that, but I do promise
that it is possible."
</P>
<P>
"I feel the hand of history on our shoulder in respect to this.
I really do. I just think we need to acknowledge that and respond
to it," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Blair and UUP leader David Trimble spent two hours going
through the disputed document line by line in an attempt to find
common ground.
</P>
<P>
The Unionists objections to the draft settlement document
centers on proposals for a north-south body -- Strand Tw in the
negotiations. They accused the Irish Government of being "too
greedy" in wanting to give this body executive powers.
</P>
<P>
After Blair's meeting with Trimble, Blair's spokesman told
reporters that "there is closer agreement on substance than people
might think."
</P>
<P>
"Trimble wants to be in there talking about it," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said it was important to reach agreement on two basic
principles: that Northern Ireland should remain British as long as
a majority of its people wanted that, and that there should be
recognition of the Irish nationalist identity and fair and equal
treatment for Roman Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army
(IRA), which wants to end British rule in Northern Ireland,
described the Ulster Unionists' rejection of the document as
"extremely disappointing".
</P>
<P>
With the peace process in critical point, Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern, who is co-sponsoring the talks with Blair, would
travel to Belfast early on Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Ross Expected to Take Another Trip to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross
will probably make a new trip to the Middle East to try again to
bridge gaps between Israel and the Palestinians, a U.S. senior
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross' likely new mission was made after U.S. President Bill
Clinton reviewed the situation in the region with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Ross during their 90-minute
discussions on Monday night, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Clinton, Albright and Ross "talked
about the difficulties we've been having in closing the gaps"
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was determined to keep trying to reopen the talks
between Israel and the Palestinians after being briefed by
Albright and Ross, and they were still "looking for ways to bring
the process to closure," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We're continuing to negotiate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross' latest shuttle diplomacy to the Middle East has again
failed to break the year-long deadlock between Israel and the
Palestinians, and Washington has expressed its frustration with
the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Ross has tried to arrange a deal whereby Israel would pull back
its troops from a reported 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return
for the Palestinians' new measures of security for Israel. But
Israel has rejected the proposals, saying it is a too high price
for its security.

<HEADLINE> Handling Capacity of Dar es Salaam Port to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Vessels will soon be able
to enter the Dar es Salaam port around the clock following the
dredging up of its entrance.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of the Tanzanian Harbors Authority (THA),
Samson Luhigo, told reporters Tuesday that the completion of the
dredging project will enable the port to handle 500 containers
daily, compared with 200 at present.
</P>
<P>
The project, costing 23 million U.S. Dollars, was undertaken
by Ham, a Dutch firm, since the middle of last year, Luhigo said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government will meet 60 percent of the cost while
the rest will be raised by the Tanzanian government, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister for Communication and Transport,
William Kusila, the dredging is one of the biggest projects
undertaken by THA and will enable bigger vessels -- including oil
tankers, to be anchored at the harbor.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to dredging the entrance, a vessel enters and leaves
the port only when the tide is favorable, " Luhigo said, adding
that a ship could finish off loading but failed to get out of the
harbor because of low tide.
</P>
<P>
Ham brought three dredgers, the sources said. One was meant
for soil investigation which started work in July last year while
the second one was used for cutting and crushing the hard
materials of the edges of the harbor entrance.
</P>
<P>
The third hopper dredger -- Geopopes 9 -- which arrived in
last December dredged the crushed materials and transported them
to a designated site in the sea, Luhigo said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the harbor said that Ham is negotiating with the
Tanzanian government to undertake a similar job at Mtwara and
Lindi ports.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Extend New Loans to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide new loans and
trade assurances to Indonesia to help it overcome its economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The aid package will include one billion U.S. dollars in loans
to secure Indonesia's foreign currency reserves and one billion
dollars to provide trade insurance, a senior official of Japan's
Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto informed Indonesian
President Suharto of Tokyo's readiness to offer the loans during a
London meeting of leaders from Asia and Europe last week.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also provide an equivalent of about 150 million
dollars in yen credit for Indonesia's structural adjustment, and
grant about 30 million dollars humanitarian support to the
Southeast Asian nation, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The loan announcement came after Indonesia had reached a new
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reform its
crisis-ridden economy.
</P>
<P>
The deal struck Wednesday on a new package of measures paved
the way for resumption of the 43 billion-dollar IMF bailout
package, which was suspended when Indonesia altered its economic
reform plans.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Arrives in Brazil to Assess Fire Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. mission fielded by
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has
arrived in Brasilia to assist the government in assessing damage
and needs resulting from the disastrous fire in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a release from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire has already burned through an area the size of El
Salvador, destroying savannah forests and threatening local
indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unprecedented fire for Brazil resulting from
unusually dry conditions and 100-kilometer-an-hour winds. Everyone
was caught off guard," said Walter Franco, U.N. resident
coordinator and UNDP resident representative in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The mission will probably be followed by a number of small
appeals to help provide fire-fighting equipment and helicopters,
emergency food aid and longer-term needs assessment. Mitigation
would focus first on human habitat areas, such as Indian reserves.

<HEADLINE> Fairness Should be Principle in Anti-Dumping Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- At the ninth Sino-U.S. Commercial
Law Seminar, a Chinese trade official urged that Chinese enterprises
should be treated equally with those of countries practicing a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yuqing, acting director general of the
Treaty and Law Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, there had been nearly 300 anti-dumping cases
overseas involving Chinese products by March of this year.
</P>
<P>
China has been pursuing the reform and opening-up policy for 20
years, he said, and its businesses could operate independently,
assume the responsibility for their own profits and losses, and
enjoy full authority in deciding their output, prices and raw
material sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's Renminbi has become convertible under the
current account, Zhang said. By the end of 1997, contractual
overseas investment in China was 520.4 billion U.S. dollars, and
the number of foreign-funded businesses in China was 300,000.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Zhang said, it is unfair to consider China a
non-market economy country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he hoped Chinese businesses could know the
appropriate price level before being accused of dumping.
</P>
<P>
"Like in every other law, fairness and justice should be the
basic principle to follow in international anti-dumping legal
practices," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to reduce its
oil export to join other countries in dealing with the worldwide
fall in oil prices, the Itar-Tass reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia plans to cut its oil export by 61,000 barrels and fix
the quantity of oil product export at 4,900 metric tons daily.
</P>
<P>
This move will bring a daily loss of 24 million U.S. dollars to
Russia while the imposed limits have no fixed term of termination,
according to Acting First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as the third largest oil exporter in the world, should
not distance from the rest of the world where oil prices are
falling down, Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was approved at a meeting of government officials
and representatives from major oil companies chaired by Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday Nemtsov met with visiting Iranian Petroleum
Minister Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh in Moscow to discuss a joint oil
policy to cope with the price crisis.

<HEADLINE> Sea Rescue Command Boats Commissioned at HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport Authority
(HKAA) on Wednesday put two marine rescue command boats into
commission for sea rescue and fire-fighting operations in the
waters surrounding the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek
Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two 35-meter vessels has a rescue capacity of 600
people, with onboard accommodation for up to 300 and sufficient
inflatable life rafts to hold 300 more.
</P>
<P>
The boats are of catamaran design and can operate in poor
weather or shallow water; they can withstand 60-knot (110km/h)
winds and five-meter waves, and have a draught of 1.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Each boat is equipped with hospital facilities and beds,
seating areas that can also accommodate stretcher cases, and a
helicopter winching platform for landing medical crews and
evacuating injured victims.
</P>
<P>
The boats will be moored at sea rescue berths at either end of
the airport platform.
</P>
<P>
The command boats will be manned by a trained nine-man crew
from the Airport Fire Contingent.
</P>
<P>
These include inflatable boats, life rafts and rescue ramps;
hydraulic cranes and lift platforms; and specialist detection
equipment such as sonar and underwater cameras.
</P>
<P>
At today's commissioning ceremony, HKAA Chairman Wong Po-yan
said: "With these boats we are now much better equipped to conduct
rescue and fire-fighting operations on the sea surrounding the
airport island."
</P>
<P>
"Our safety, of course, is guaranteed also by placing these
well-designed vessels in the capable hands of the highly
professional crew from the Airport Fire Services," Wong added.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is scheduled to be put into operation in July
this year.

Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa here Wednesday spoke
highly of the work of members of the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC), which held its last session today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the PLC's end-of-term dinner Wednesday evening, Tung
said that the enthusiasm, dedication, wisdom and commitment PLC
members have shown in the successful transition of Hong Kong and
the smooth operation of the SAR government will go down in history
forever.
</P>
<P>
In the current legislative session, the SAR government and the
PLC have faithfully performed their respective responsibilities
and rendered valuable services to Hong Kong people in strict
accordance with the Basic Law, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Since the PLC was set up, its members have scrutinized and
subsequently passed 63 bills, and considered 104 requests for
provisions, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
They have also raised 529 written and oral questions with the
Administration and moved 57 motion debates, he said.
</P>
<P>
PLC members have well performed their duties in the scrutiny of
bills, control of public expenditure as well as the monitoring of
the implementation of government policies, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the officials of the SAR government and PLC
members discharged their duties fully in the submission of and
debate over bills before they were being passed.
</P>
<P>
They have tried their utmost to work for the well-being of Hong
Kong people and a brighter future of Hong Kong, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Upon being selected as PLC members, PLC members set out with
the painstaking groundwork of the PLC and the work of law
enactment for the HKSAR under trying circumstances and tremendous
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Yet, PLC members always put the basic interests of our country
and Hong Kong as well as those of Hong Kong people in the first
place, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
They have not only accepted the historical challenge and
mission courageously, but also accomplished the task entrusted to
them by history with outstanding achievement, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to note that you have played a crucial role in
maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong",
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the SAR government, Tung extended his "heartfelt"
thanks to all the PLC members for their hard work and contribution
to the successful transition of Hong Kong and the smooth operation
of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The PLC completed its mission on Wednesday and the first
Legislative Council election will be held on May 24 this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Ends Historic Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) ended its two-day final meeting here
Wednesday afternoon, thus completely fulfilling its historic
mission.
</P>
<P>
During the afternoon session on Wednesday, the PLC adopted a
"Valedictory Motion" moved by Dr. Leong Che Hung following members
delivered speeches summing up the PLC work one after another.
</P>
<P>
The Motion said that in the short span of 16 months, PLC has
dealt with a total of 63 bills, 359 subsidiary legislations and 86
government resolutions. Many have been extensively amended by
members to reflect the best for the public. Of these, 18 items of
subsidiary legislation and 3 resolutions were repealed.
</P>
<P>
In response to the motion, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan
said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a major event in
China's modern history while the Provisional Legislative Council
will be a part of history of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
She said that the establishment of the PLC was aimed at
avoiding "legislative vacancy" at the beginning of the founding of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and ensuring
its normal operation as well.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she stressed that its historical merits are
indubitable.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that the SAR government has fully cooperated with
the PLC so as to implement the Article 64 of the Basic Law that
the HKSAR government must be accountable to the Legislative
Council of the region.
</P>
<P>
On the legislature election scheduled for May 24, Chan said
that the Basic Law has drawn up a blueprint for Hong Kong's
democratic development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with "the principle of gradual and orderly
progress" stipulated in the Basic Law, she said the number of
direct elections in geographical constituencies will increase
gradually and the ultimate aim is the election of all the members
of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.
</P>
<P>
Chan called on Hong Kong residents to actively cast their votes
in the May election so as to choose Legislative Council members
acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Rita Fan, president of the PLC,
described the work that the PLC members have done over the past 16
months as unprecedented and arduous.
</P>
<P>
She said: "our work is very heavy. We always prudently make our
decisions on every specific matter and every bill is based on
careful studies and consultations in depth."
</P>
<P>
Fan said that the Provisional legislative Council formulated
its rules of procedure and modes for operation through
discussions. This fully shows the spirit of the principles of "one
country, two systems" and a high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
According to law, she said: "our term of office will last until
 June 30. So we will continue to accept complaints from local
residents."

But Johansson's public backing for Germany's bid ahead of chief
2006 rivals England, after he had promised to remain neutral, has

England's bid to stage the World Cup last month received the

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Groups Call for Saving Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nine Israeli peace groups have
written a letter to the leaders of the United States and Britain,
urging them to take firm actions to save the deadlocked Mideast
peace process, Israel Radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter, to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for his hard-line policy in the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It also accused the Israeli Likud government of refusing to
make compromise in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The letter stressed that only firm actions taken by the U.N.,
the U.S. and the European countries could bring a just solution
to the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the letter included noted peace groups, such as
Peace Now Movement and Dor Shalom Organization. Some Rabbis and
human right activists also signed on the letter.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) have been stalled for months over the extent of
next Israeli troops pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to push forward the peace process, the U.S. has
reportedly presented a peace proposal to Israel and the PNA. It
calls on Israel to withdraw 13.1 percent from the West Bank in
return for fulfillment of the Palestinian commitment to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But nearly all Israeli cabinet ministers rejected the
percentage of the redeployment. Some of them insisted that any
redeployment by more than 9 percent will damage Israel's national
security interest.

<HEADLINE> UK Calls for Free Trade Harmless to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) - A British senior minister said here
Tuesday that further trade liberalization must not jeopardize
the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Beckett, Chairman of Board of Trade, told a group of
exporters that she supported initiatives of the European Union for
further trade liberalization in goods and services.
</P>
<P>
She added however that further trade liberalization must not
jeopardize the environment, consumer safety, labor standards or
the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am not seeking a crude free-for-all", she said, "We want to
pursue open markets without jeopardizing environmental
sustainability, consumer safety or decent minimum standards for
the workforce and without disadvantaging the developing world."
</P>
<P>
In addition, she also outlined initiatives aimed at helping
British exports by bringing 100 young overseas professionals a
year to Britain for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Wagstyl, industrial editor of the Financial Times,
however said Beckett had little to offer except sympathy for
exporters hit by the strong pound.
</P>
<P>
With sterling surging to a nine-year high last month, Treasury
officials admitted that they were unable to bring any respite to
exporters through a cheaper currency.
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke warned that the level of the
pound was damaging exports and that industry was facing recession.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest official statistics showed that export
volumes are still up by 6 percent than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said that she was "acutely conscious" that the strong
pound made life difficult for exporters and congratulated them on
holding up export volumes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia Faces Industrial Upheaval After Dock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia faced unprecedented
labor unrest after the Australian government-backed sacking late
Tuesday night of 1,400 maritime union workers of the nation's
second largest stevedoring company Patrick.
</P>
<P>
Australian Union leaders warned of a massive campaign against
the attack on the maritime union's 60-year-old monopoly on
dockside labor, threatening legal action and nationwide strikes by
transport workers.
</P>
<P>
The labor unions' anger was fueled by the report that
Australia's other major stevedore P and O said it was considering
following Patrick's lead.
</P>
<P>
Private security guards with attack dogs swept onto 15 of
Patrick's docks around Australia shortly before midnight Tuesday,
locking out Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) workers who had
staged sporadic strikes over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers around Australia walked off the job to
protest in support of the workers and the Victorian Trades Hall
Council in the state of Victoria announced plans for a statewide
general strike next month, said the Australian Associated Press
and Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV in its evening news
program.
</P>
<P>
Australian Council of Trade Union (ACTU) President Jennie
George said that the union movement would fight until the workers
got their jobs back in what she said was Australia's worst
industrial dispute for a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
At a picket line outside Fisherman Islands container terminal
in Brisbane Wednesday, Australia's third largest city, MUA
National Organizer Jim Tannock said the union was preparing for
"the greatest industrial dispute Australia has ever seen."
</P>
<P>
The powerful International Transport Workers Federation (ITF)
immediately announced plans to target Patrick and its shipping
clients worldwide in a move the Australian Shipowners Association
said could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came following the announcement of the mass sacking
by Australian Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith and the
company late Tuesday night, which was intended by the government
and Patrick to break the monopoly of MUA on waterfront to improve
work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Reith said the move, in which Maritime Union of Australia
members will be replaced by contracted labor, or non-union labor,
would help achieve a genuinely competitive waterfront.
</P>
<P>
"(This) will mean more jobs, a better international reputation
for Australia and ultimately a real chance for a lot of businesses
to grow in the way in which they've been denied for years by the
industrial thuggery most Australians have had more than enough
of," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government, which came to power in March, 1996,
has taken a number of measures to restrict the influence of trade
unions, which has been described as waterfront reforms.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that Australia was involved in only two
percent of total world trade, but the docks accounted for 25
percent of the world's waterfront strikes.
</P>
<P>
Its Workplace Relations Act came into effect in December 1996,
setting up a legal framework that threatens unions and workers
with massive penalties for industrial action outside a narrow
range of conditions.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1997, a memo from the Department of Workplace
Relations reportedly looked at tough options to break the Maritime
Union of Australia, including sacking the entire workforce.
</P>
<P>
Later that year, an attempt to replace MUA stevedoring workers
at Cairns in Australia's state of Queensland with non-union labor
failed after the union won support from the International
Transport Workers Federation (ITF).
</P>
<P>
In defending the government's action, Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer told the Australian government Wednesday
that "Australia's notorious reputation for an inefficient
waterfront is internationally known, internationally understood
and is in an international embarrassment for Australia."
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard described the mass
sacking of Patrick's 1,400 workers as "a defining moment in
Australian industrial history."
</P>
<P>
But former Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the confrontation
between the union, the company and the government as political and
an absolute tragedy for Australia.
</P>
<P>
"What this is about is trying to smash trade unionism in this
area," he said.

<HEADLINE> SAR CE Calls for More Efforts on Public Health, Disease Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said today that
the SAR government attaches great importance to local public
health and will spare no effort in preventing communicable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Department of Health (DH), the
chief executive noted that the spate of cholera cases that
occurred in early March this year has been brought under control,
with no new local and imported cholera cases reported since March
21.
</P>
<P>
But he was expressed concern over the increase in food-borne
infectious diseases in the first quarter of this year. DH
statistics showed 48 cholera cases, 97 bacillary dysentery cases
and 144 food poisoning outbreaks involving 523 persons during the
period.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the community must join hands in doing a
lot more in order to improve our environmental hygiene. We must
pay more attention to our personal and food hygiene," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong's dense population and Hong Kong
people's frequent contacts with other countries posed a great
challenge to local public health workers.
</P>
<P>
The local community should be involved and more should be done to
educate the public in personal, environmental and food hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The DH would launch a publicity campaign before summer targeted
at food-borne diseases and travelers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union monthly
unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage point down to 10.3 percent
in February, Eurostat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest jobless rate since 1993 when it was 10.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for the same month a year ago was 10.7
percent but it was 10.9 percent for February 1996, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 15 EU member states registered lower than average
jobless rates last February, with Luxembourg at the lowest 3.4
percent, followed by Austria at 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain's 20 percent was still the EU's highest rate. Next came
Finland with 12.5 percent and France with 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistical agency of the
15-nation union, estimated that there were 17.4 million unemployed
men and women in February.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been a headache for the European Union that
has called several high-level meetings on the issue, including a
summit meeting by heads of state and government of EU member
states to address the problem last November.

<HEADLINE> Food Supply Tight in E. Africa in 1998: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said Wednesday that the food supply situation
in East Africa would be "very tight in 1998" as a result of
excessive rains caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
In a report on food supply situation and crop prospects in
Sub-Saharan Africa issued here Wednesday, FAO noted that
increased food assistance would be needed in a number of East
African countries, especially Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1997 drought-reduced harvests in East Africa,
the unusually heavy and prolonged rains from last October to
February this year have aggravated an already precarious food
situation in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia, exceptionally heavy rains from mid-October to
January caused the worst floods in the past three decades with
about 2,000 people killed, 250,000 persons displaced and
infrastructure seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 aggregate cereal production is estimated at the
previous year's poor level of 287,000 tons and import
requirements for the 1997/98 marketing year from August to July
next year are estimated at 330,000 tons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Latest official estimates indicate that Kenya's 1997/98 maize
output to be at 2.4 million tons, slightly above the reduced
level of 1996/97, but below the average of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
FAO noted in the report that wheat were also affected by heavy
rains at harvest while the bean crop was sharply reduced due to
both adverse weather and lack of seeds in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The food supply situation is anticipated to be tight in the
months ahead and total cereal imports for the marketing year
1997/98 from October to September are forecast at 1.1 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
A Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission from FAO and the
World Food Program (WFP) which visited Ethiopia from November 2
to December 2 last year forecast a harvest of 9.1 million tons of
cereals and pulses for 1997/98 year in the country, one-quarter
below previous year's post-harvest estimation by the Ethiopian
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Following two years of self-sufficiency, Ethiopia's grain
import requirement in 1998 is estimated at 530,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In Southern Sudan, cereal production for 1997/98 year was
estimated by an FAO/WFP Mission to be down by 45 percent on the
previous year as a result of the exacerbation of the civil war in
January and February.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Housing Reform in Full Swing in China (1) By Xinhua Writers Li Jianmin and Xin Xin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China expects major breakthrough
in housing reform this year, which will be stimulated by the
issuance of detailed housing reform plans to be executed
between April and May.
</P>
<P>
At present, the housing Reform Office of the State Council, the
State Development and Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Construction are jointly drafting the housing reform plan which
centers on commercializing housing instead of renting
housing to residents as a welfare since the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The new Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stressed at a
press conference during the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress early last month that the country will make
housing sector a new growth point in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Chen, head of the Housing Reform Office of
the State Council, the commercialization of housing means
converting part of the welfare into housing funds which will be
contained in the wages of workers and staff.
</P>
<P>
He said that the system of subsidizing housing purchases will
be launched at the same time when housing allocation as a welfare
stops nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built affordable housing projects will be sold to
residents only, the official stressed. The workers and staff have
to purchase houses by themselves by using the housing subsidies,
public housing fund and loans.

<HEADLINE> Africa Should Look Inward for Trade: OAU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- African countries should
complement their market reforms with strategies aimed at
promoting intra-African trade, an official of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vijay Makhan, Assistant Secretary-General of the OAU, said
Africa's trade preferences to traditional markets were being
further eroded by the establishment of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting of ministers of trade of the OAU which
opened here that it had become imperative for Africa to pursue
intra-continental trade seriously bearing in mind the extreme
competition it would face on the international market for its
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU and the African Economic Community (AEC) were
urging African governments to redouble their efforts at
intra-regional trade by eliminating tariff and non-tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
He added what should be of political significance was the fact
that Africa was not represented at senior policy making level at
the WTO secretariat.
</P>
<P>
This matter, he said, should be given urgent consideration by
the director general of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
At the second WTO ministerial conference to be held in Geneva
next month, he said, Africa has for the first time made the
effort to develop its own "positive agenda" as a demonstration of
its determination not to be confined to the margins of the WTO.

measures to reform the financial system in a bid to establish and
improve the financial service for housing purchasing.
</P>
<P>
And all the country's state-owned commercial banks are asked to
be agencies with regard to public housing fund. The rules
governing individual housing mortgage loans will be revised, and
ceilings set on loans on the development of affordable and
commodity housing will be lifted, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mortgage loans for residents will be doubled this
year to reach the amount of 15 percent of the country's
newly-increased loans in total.
</P>
<P>
And the country will use credit and interest rate to boost
purchase of the already built houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai Xianglong, president of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, mortgage loans totalling between 100
billion and 150 billion yuan will be launched this year.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang said that when the
housing allocation is commercialized, the proportion of the public
housing fund will further rise to around 30 percent, which will
help further stimulate the commercialization of housing.
</P>
<P>
The senior official expects that after the commercialization of
housing, additional public housing fund totalling 300 billion yuan
will be added annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that development of housing markets has broad
prospects, which will play a strategic role in readjusting economy
and upgrading industrial sectors, and will guarantee the
sustainable and sound economic development of the country.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Enact Special Law for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday unveiled its
foreign investment policy package, which is designed to
drastically cut administrative red tapes and build free investment
zones.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will enact a special law to attract
foreign investors, said Vice Finance and Economy Minister Chung
Duck-koo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to finalize a revised draft bill on
Foreign Investment Promotion Law by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the government will restructure the Korea
Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) into a body which will
exclusively deal with attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
After restructuring, the KOTRA will make all-out efforts to
attract foreign investment by providing all services foreign
investors need, said Chung.
</P>
<P>
The government will also set aside a minimum of 100 billion won
(some 71 million U.S. dollars) to help provincial governments
attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
It will create task forces to improve systems and look for
potential foreign investors, both at home and abroad, within major
economic ministries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance and Economy will have a
special organ to revise laws and regulations on foreign investment
and take follow-up measures.
</P>
<P>
Free investment zones, which are to be created this year as
part of the package, will provide very favorable conditions,
especially in tax, to companies operating in the zones.
</P>
<P>
However, some observers said the most important thing for the
inflow of foreign investment is that South Koreans have to abandon
their hostility to foreign investors' merger and acquisition of
the nation's ailing financial institutions and companies.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Moslems Celebrate Eid-ul-Azha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Moslems on Wednesday
celebrated Eid-ul-Azha, their second biggest religious festival
after Eid-ul-Fitr.
</P>
<P>
Moslems account for 86 percent of the nation's 124.3 million
population.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the festival, the government declared a three-day
holiday starting from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the festival, President Shahabuddin Ahmed and
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued separate messages wishing the
people "Eid Mubarak" (Happy Eid).
</P>
<P>
In his message, President Shahabuddin said the observance of
the festival "intensifies the ties of equality and Islamic
brotherhood."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hasina called upon her countrymen to observe
self-restraint, take care of others and keep the environment neat
and clean.
</P>
<P>
Various congregations were held in the capital and elsewhere in
the country on Wednesday with large numbers of Moslems expressing
their devoutness.
</P>
<P>
National flags were hoisted atop public and private buildings,
and roads, traffic islands and main thoroughfares in Dhaka were
decorated with miniature flags and buntings inscribed with "Eid
Mubarak" both in Bengali and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
All national dailies brought out special supplements
highlighting the significance of the occasion, and Bangladesh
Radio and Bangladesh Television put on special programs.
</P>
<P>
Several days before the festival, the Dhaka city authority
opened eight special markets for Moslems to purchase sacrifice for
the festival. Large numbers of cattle, sheep and goats, which were
shipped into the metropolis from the rural areas, were traded in
the past few days.

<HEADLINE> Legal Measures Against Pseudo-sciences Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China should provide a more
organized and systematic legal framework for cracking down on
superstition and the pseudo-sciences that can be harmful to
society, a Chinese jurist said today.
</P>
<P>
The government should give support to a crackdown on
superstition and pseudo-sciences such as fortune-telling on the
basis of both legislation and law enforcement, and check the mass
media and non-governmental organizations for activities concerning
superstition and pseudo-sciences, Professor Jiang Ping, former
deputy-director of the Law Committee of the National People's
Congress, told a symposium on "science and law" here today.
</P>
<P>
He said superstition and the pseudo-sciences could do little
harm if they were only individual beliefs or activities. But they
could cause great harm to society if widely advocated through the
mass media and involved non-governmental organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Legal measures could help reduce and prevent the influence of
superstition and pseudo-sciences on the public, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Superstitious activities include fortune-telling and witchcraft
which are harmful to people should be punished in accordance with
the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang suggested that representatives of the legal and
scientific communities form an organization to protect the rights
of scientists, especially when they face a legal conflict with
advocates of superstition and the pseudo-sciences.
</P>
<P>
Superstitious activities are becoming rampant in some areas in
China, he said, and tricks of pseudo-sciences also are doing a lot
of harm to society.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, the fifth of its kind since 1995, is being
jointly sponsored by the China Association for Science and
Technology and the China Law Society.

<HEADLINE> China's Gold Output Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China produced 34.5 tons of gold in
the first quarter of this year, up 36.3 percent from the same
period in 1997, according to the government department in charge
of gold production.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 166.3 tons of gold in 1997, up 37.9 percent
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's gold production has maintained an upturn momentum
in recent years. However, increased output in the first quarter
of this year was due largely to a cut in gold purchasing prices by
China's central bank in February, which prompted some
gold-producing enterprises to sell gold before the price cut took
effect.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing price for per gram of gold is not 80.5 yuan (about
9.7 US dollars), down by nearly 10 yuan. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Private Sector Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on development of the
urban private economic sector was launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The 3-day seminar, sponsored by the Chinese Mayors Association,
the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and some other
organizations, is being attended by mayors and experts from more
than 40 Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's private economic sector has developed
rapidly in recent years, making an increasingly large proportion
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Shantou, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, currently has 57,000 individually-run and private
enterprises, which have a combined payroll of more than 400,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
The private enterprises last year accounted for 70 percent of
of Shantou's industrial output value of 54.79 billion yuan and 40
percent of its import and export volume of 6.77 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some seminar participants noted that the development of the
private sector is unbalanced between the east and west areas, with
the central and western parts quite less developed in terms of
private sector economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese private economy now enjoys unprecedented growth
opportunities and the central and western parts of China, when
compared with the east areas, are more in need of a
rapidly-growing private sector," said Cai Zhonggu, executive vice
mayor of Taiyuan, capital of northern Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
To develop the private sector, equal and orderly market
conditions must be created, the seminar participants agreed.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Parties Remain Divided on Election Law Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling and opposition
parties are unlikely to reach an agreement next week over the
revision of the election law to be applied in local elections in
June.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary leaders of the major parties -- the ruling
National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and United Liberal
Democrats (ULD), opposition Grand National Party (GNP) and New
Party for the People (NPP), have been negotiating unsuccessfully
to narrow their differences.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties were supposed to strike a deal over the
revision by holding a one-day session of the National Assembly, or
parliament, Wednesday but they agreed to discuss the revision next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A major controversial issue is whether or not to allow
political parties to nominate joint candidates beginning from the
June 4 local elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, which is trying to make a law allowing
joint candidacies, plans to forge a three-way alliance with the
small opposition NPP this time.
</P>
<P>
However, the major opposition GNP is opposed to the idea and
wants to legislate a law banning such practices.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which has 161 seats in the 299-member parliament,
fears that an alliance of the three parties will significantly
reduce its candidates' chances of winning the local polls, in
which mayors, provincial governors and heads of smaller
administrative units are to be elected.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, the ruling camp believes that its alliance
with NPP will increase its chances of success, particularly in
Yongnam region, where the GNP enjoys deep-rooted support.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties also differ over whether to elect or appoint
low-level local councillors, including county heads.
</P>
<P>
The ruling camp said that councillors should be elected in
accordance with the spirit of the local government system while
the GNP, which won a sweeping victory in by-elections last week,
argued that they should be appointed.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Land and
Resources, one of four new ministries set up by the Ninth National
People's Congress, opened for business today as a result of the
government institutional restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The new ministry was formed from the former Ministry of
Geological and Mineral Resources, State Bureau of Land
Administration, National Bureau of Oceanography and State Bureau
of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new ministry signals an important
change in the country's administration over land and resources,
which will be more centralized, according to newly appointed
minister Zhou Yongkang.
</P>
<P>
He said the functions of the new ministry will focus on
planning, administration, protection and rational utilization of
the country's land, mineral and marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the new ministry will play a important strategic role
in helping the country reach sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in land and mineral resources, but its per capita
ownership is less than half the world's average, said the new
minister.

<HEADLINE> Indian Union Surface Transport Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- India's Union Surface Transport
Minister R. Muthiah resigned here Wednesday in less than 20 days
after his swearing-in on March 19 due to corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
A city court in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in southern
India, framed charges against Muthiah and his whole family members
Tuesday after finding prima facie evidence against them in a case
pertaining to accumulation of disproportionate assets worth 4.57
million rupees (0.119 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Muthiah, former speaker of the Tamil Nadu Assembly, was a
nominee of Jayalalitha, leader of the All-India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which is one of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)-led coalition government allies.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that a few other ministers in the Vajpayee
cabinet have also been tainted with corruption cases and they are
expected to be exposed in future.
</P>
<P>
Muthiah refused to resign Tuesday after learning about the news
of framing charges against him from the city court. He blamed the
Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, for "foisting false
cases against him and his family." Under the direction of AIADMK
supremo Jayalalitha later Tuesday evening, however, he agreed to
resign on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Wednesday forwarded the
resignation letter to President K. R. Narayanan for acceptance.
The president is expected to accept Muthiah's resignation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders Continue Parley on Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu reconvened the so-called Kitchen Cabinet Wednesday to
continue discussing the second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the second in the past days held by the
Kitchen Cabinet, which also includes Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Cabinet held its first meeting to deliberate
the size of second redeployment and the conditions Israel will
demand the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fulfill before
it carries out the pullback.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said no agreement was reached at the Wednesday
meeting, and the ministers decided to meet for another session
before the Jewish holiday Passover begins Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The consultation within the Israeli leadership was held at a
time when the United States was considering a next step to push
forward the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special peace coordinator Dennis Ross, who concluded a
shuttle mission here on March 30 without achieving progress, is
expected to return to the region in two weeks in an attempt to
bridge the wide gap between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit, Ross failed to persuade both Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to accept the new
U.S. proposal on a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the U.S. plan, saying that any pullback more
than 9 percent will endanger its security.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly formulating a revised withdrawal plan,
which demands Israel to turn over 9 percent of the West Bank to
full Palestinian control and 3 percent more to Palestinian civil
control.
</P>
<P>
It remains doubtful whether Israel would accept the new
U.S. plan due to the strong opposition from the powerful rightist
camp within the Likud-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the U.S. from unilaterally publishing its peace
plan which Israel feared might put it in an awkward position,
Netanyahu's close adviser Yitzhak Molcho was sent to Washington to
meet U.S. officials to explain Israeli position and soften the
U.S. stance on the redeployment.

<HEADLINE> OAU Trade Ministers Focus on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The OAU Trade Ministers have an
obligation and responsibility to resolve the fundamental question
regarding the equitable integration of africa into the
international trading system.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the remarks Wednesday
while Opening a meeting of Trade Ministers of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) here.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is also current OAU chairman, said Africa had seen
its share of market trade declining from five percent in 1985 to
two percent in 1996 as the structure of exports had not changed
since it continued to be dominated by primary products.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true that developing countries have contributed
significantly to the growth of international trade since the
mid-80s, in reality this growth has tended to be concentrated in
certain countries and regions, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Much more disturbing, he said, was the fact that over the
decades OAU member countries had also been unable to take full
advantage of existing preferential schemes to expand and
diversify exports.
</P>
<P>
he noted that in a briskly globalizing world economy, Africa
could only be an active participant if it took quick coordinated
and collective action to improve its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
''Our challenge is therefore to devise strategies to improve
Africa's production efficiency through effective communications
networks, skills and infrastructural development, product
diversification, technology transfer and the adoption of
appropriate macro-economic policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 trade ministers and nigh-ranking trade officials from
the OAU states attended the two-day meeting, which is in
preparation for the second World Trade Organization (WTO)
ministerial conference to be held in general next month.
</P>
<P>
The participants will review the implementation of Singapore
ministerial declaration and future work at the WTO, consider the
future of the Lome convention, the United States initiative for
Africa and UNCTAD/UNDP regional program for capacity building in
trade and development for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva WTO ministerial conference would provide African
countries with the opportunity to review the implementation of
the Uruguay round results of 1994 when it was finally concluded,
to continue negotiations, and to identify new areas for inclusion
in the multilateral trade negotiations as appropriate.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China and Chile can enhance their
cooperation in the agricultural sector although they are
geographically apart from each other. .
</P>
<P>
Wan Baorui, China's vice minister of Agriculture, made the
remark in a meeting with Chilean minister of Agricultural Carlos
Mladinic today.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that agricultural cooperation between the two
countries has been growing smoothly since the establishment of
diplomatic ties. "More cooperative forms, such as the
establishment of pilot farms, can be adopted, and closer
attention should be paid to agriculture-related high-tech
projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mladinic expressed the belief that potential for cooperation
could be further tapped. He said a delegation led by a Chilean
vice minister of Agriculture will visit China later this year to
explore trade and investment opportunities. Chile will also attend
the World Horticultural Fair to be held in China next year.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Muslims Celebrate Traditional Corban Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Mosques in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were filled with jubilant Muslims
celebrating their traditional Corban Festival today.
</P>
<P>
Department stores, restaurants and parks also were
decorated. Residents of each ethnic group were given today
off. They visited relatives and friends and sent festival
greetings to one another.
</P>
<P>
In the mosque of Najiahu Village in Yongning County, thousands
of Hui Muslims who were wearing white hats and Western-style suits
drove cars and motorcycles here to chant the Koran.
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, only a few hundred Muslims gathered in this
mosque on the Corban Festival. Their annual income was less than
150 yuan (18 U.S. dollars) per capita.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old farmer Na Dianyou invited an "imam" to his home
to chant the Koran before he slaughtered a sheep, a traditional
activity for Corban. He then sent the mutton to neighbors and
friends.
</P>
<P>
Na Hongjun, son of Na Dianyou, said the 4,000 inhabitants of
Najiahu Village had become better off in recent years through
raising livestock and developing a transportation service industry.
</P>
<P>
Their average net income per capita reached 2,780 yuan last
year, enabling all villagers to have new houses and television
sets, he said, adding that some even had telephones in their homes
and bought cars or motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
The 470-year-old Najiahu mosque has been put under state
protection. The government has allocated funds dozens of times in
the past 40 years for its maintenance.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of material and cultural living standards,
Muslims' religious beliefs and customs are respected and protected
by law, said Ma Qizhi, acting chairman of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The region has 3,000 mosques and places for Islamic religious
activities, one for every 500 Islamic converts.

national budget for fiscal 1998, one week after the fiscal year
started last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which passed through the House of Representatives
(lower house) on March 20, was approved at a plenary session of
the House of Councillors (upper house) with the backing of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two non-cabinet
allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the New Party
Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1998 budget is the first compiled under Japan's
Fiscal Structural Reform Law and is only 0.4 percent larger than
the initial fiscal 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
Under the austere budget, general expenditures for policy
programs -- roughly the total budget minus debt-servicing costs
and tax grants to local governments -- fell by 1.3 percent from
the previous year, the first drop in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes a 7.8 percent cut in public works
spending, while guaranteeing 20 trillion yen (about 150.4 billion
dollars) for Deposit Insurance Corp. to rehabilitate Japan's
financial system.

<HEADLINE> National Survey Taking Look at Health of Chinese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- "Do you often feel fatigued, have
a headache or suffer insomnia?" "Is it because of excessive mental
work, nervousness or unsatisfied relations with other people?"
</P>
<P>
This isn't a question-and-answer session between a doctor and a
patient, but is part of a national survey to investigate the
sub-health state (SHS) of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"SHS is a kind of state between healthy and morbid states,"
said Professor Wang Yuxue, one of the organizers of the
survey. "The concept was initiated by Chinese scholars last year."
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind ever done in China, was
launched today in a full-page questionnaire in the "China Youth
Daily." More than 100 kinds of symptoms related to SHS were
listed such as depression, anxiety and illnesses of the tongue,
skin and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire also provided some factors that possibly
affect human health such as environment, bad habits, marriage,
family and career.
</P>
<P>
Wang blamed the incidence of SHS on physical and mental fatigue
caused by overwork, the aging process, trauma in the wake of
childbirth and surgery, and periodic low mental states.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-health state has been drawing more and more attention from
researchers in many countries, since it's a worldwide problem,"
said Wang, who is working at the Medical College of Qingdao
University in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
He estimated a "very astonishing" number of SHS sufferers in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Fast growth of an aging population in China will also help
create more sufferers of SHS," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A survey official at "China Youth Daily" expected at least
100,000 questionnaires to be returned. The Beijing-based newspaper
has more than eight million readers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese scientists are trying to find ways to cure SHS by
using traditional Chinese medicines, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Holds Talks with Tanzanian Counterpart (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin held
talks with visiting Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang first extended a warm welcome to Mkapa, saying that the
president can take the opportunity of this visit to look at the
changes in China within the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who arrived in Beijing this morning for a six-day state
visit, has visited China three times before, however, this is his
first visit as president.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa extended his congratulations to Jiang for his re-election
as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and president of the state.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Sino-Tanzanian friendship has been set up and
developed by the older generations of leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 30 years, there have been frequent exchanges of
visit between leaders of the two countries, mutual support in
both international affairs and domestic construction," said Jiang,
adding that the two countries have become "truly all-weather
friends," which sets a good example for cooperation between
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation and gratitude to his
counterpart for Tanzania's longtime support for China's
national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the friendship between the two countries and
their people is "sincere and forever." The chief goal of his visit
is to further develop the friendship and strengthen the
cooperation between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa reaffirmed that Tanzania will stick "unswervingly" to its
one-China policy. He said he hopes that the successful return of
Hong Kong will help accelerate the speed of China's national
reunification.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Continue Building Controversial Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government said
Wednesday that it will continue the controversial project of the
Seoul-Pusan High-speed Railway.
</P>
<P>
"We expect various problems while finishing the project but
what is clear is that we must build it," Acting Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil said after hearing the results of the Board of Audit and
Inspection's investigation of the project.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim said that the original project needs modification
due to the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis has been plaguing the nation since late
1997 because corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions forced the country to seek a hard conditions-tied
loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary
Fund last December.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suspended the project in January as some people
complained that it would cost too much when the nation is still in
economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction and Transportation is expected to
finalize a revised construction plan by July this year.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the project, 16 percent of which has been completed,
is expected to cost 22 trillion won (1.5 billion U.S. dollars),
five trillion more than the originally estimated cost of 17
trillion won.

<P>
The two presidents praised relations between the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) and the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania,
which were established 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the two parties have maintained frequent exchanges
and close cooperation, which have also promoted relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He assured Mkapa that the CPC will maintain and further develop
this kind of relationship between the two parties based on
independence, equality, mutual respect and non-interference.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Mkapa also exchanged views on promoting economic and
trade cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese president
said that both sides have searched for new and mutually beneficial
ways of cooperating in recent years with achievements toward that
end.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told Jiang that broadening economic and trade cooperation
with China is the second goal of his visit. Tanzania is also
undertaking economic reforms, he said, so the two countries now
have new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is willing to develop a mutually beneficial
partnership relation with China, said Mkapa, who welcomes more
Chinese enterprises to invest in his country.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents attended a signing ceremony
for an agreement between the Chinese and Tanzanian governments on
economic and technological cooperation, and an agreement on the
establishment of an honorary consulate by the United Republic of
Tanzania in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> UN Annual Report On Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China had a "soft landing" in its
economy in 1996 and 1997 after more than three years of
double-digit growth, with inflation moderate and growth only
slightly slower, according to the annual report of the UN Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It said that China's GDP increased 8.9 percent last year, the
highest in the world, although it was a bit lower than in previous
years, and that for an economy of thes size, maintaining more than
10 percent growth on average for several years is a remarkable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
This reflects high levels of savings and investment and
technological improvements in manufacturing and service, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Chinese government has been directing a substantial
amount of investment to infrastructure with a view to improving
the basis for continued growth.
</P>
<P>
China's agriculture has grown at 4.5 percent a year in
the '90s, higher than the rate of growth in the population, and
services have grown at around 8.5 percent. This will have a
beneficial effect on efficiency in the Chinese economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that foreign investment is likely to drop in China's
capital market, but China has improved its position in foreign
exchange reserves and has been, and continues to be, the largest
recipient of foreign direct investment in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
China is also expected, for the time being, to maintain low
inflation, and for the next two to three years, to keep the
reforms in a number of strategic directions at once, with priority
being given to state enterprises and the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will have to be paid to the interlocking
interest of banking institutions and state enterprises, it says.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Claims Success with New Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, the nation's
top foreign exchange bank, has formed its worldwide service
network as a result of its rapid but steady overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
The bank had set up 546 branches in 22 countries and
regions by the end of 1997. It reported stable, profitable
growth on the basis of nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars in deposits
and about 60 billion U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank also plans to branch out in such areas as the Hong
Kong-Macao region, East Asia, Latin America, North America and
Europe in to expand the existing service network.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the bank recently opened its first representative
office in Latin America in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The bank expects higher economic efficiency with its overseas
branches by making headway in corporate banking, retail services,
and investment banking services.
</P>
<P>
Specific measures spell out the process of active integration
of the overseas branches into the local economy by catering to
local conglomerates, establishment of a worldwide credit card
network, and further expansion of investment banking services in
major world capital markets in London and New York.

<HEADLINE> UN's Annual Survey On Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The trade slowdown and reduced
financial flow in the Asia-Pacific Region are two of the things
that have adversely affected the region and led some countries
into a serious crisis, according to the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific report.
</P>
<P>
The 51st annual ESCAP report, which appeared here this morning
at the UNDP, says that world economic growth remained strong from
1996 to 1997, averaging more than three percent, with some
disturbances in the stock and foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
It says Thailand, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea (ROK) are
the three countries affected most by the crisis and that China is
the least. The Japanese economy has "deeper problems" in its
economic and financial structures. This is worth paying attention
to because Japan, as a developed country, has an important
economic influence here, according to Prof. Wang Huijiong, of
China's State Council's Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the financial crisis in the region has
helped focus attention on two crucial areas: the need to establish
an appropriate exchange system and the need to overcome the
weaknesses of the domestic financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Countries should move gradually in opening their finances, and
governments in the region should set up a regulatory framework
that is implemented effectively, and governments have a crucial
role in putting proper regulatory bodies in place, it said, and
asked for greater regional cooperation in this.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to note that the region has made progress in human
resources development, particularly in health and education, but
that there is a wide disparity between and within countries, which
means that investment should be made in improving coverage and
quality.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan wrote a foreword to the report,
where he said that he is committed to ensuring that the UN system
remains a close partner of nations in the region as they continue
their hard work for stability and development.

<HEADLINE> World Health Organization Has Large Number of Centers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is cooperating with 68 medical research institutes, colleges
and local health departments in China, according to the Ministry
of Health.
</P>
<P>
These centers are part of WHO's global disease surveillance,
prevention and control network and do research in human
reproduction, traditional medicine, cancer, cardiovascular and
cerebral diseases, health education, emergency aid and other
fields, according to Qi Qingdong, who is in charge of foreign
cooperation at the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
WHO makes its choices mainly on the basis of the level of
research and status in its home country, Qi says.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, China's new Minister of Health, also spoke
highly of the centers' role in promoting cooperative ties between
the country and WHO.
</P>
<P>
"The centers promote Sino-foreign technological cooperation
while working with WHO. It is a window to display achievements in
this regard," Zhang said here Tuesday at a meeting to mark the
50th anniversary of WHO's establishment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang described other kinds of cooperation between China and
the organization as "fruitful," such as 100 million U.S. dollars
in technological aid provided by WHO since 1972.
</P>
<P>
"Also, China has made positive contributions to formulating and
implementing global health policies, research projects and
training programs of WHO," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the organization was initiated by China
and Brazil in 1946. The People's Republic of China has signed two
memorandums of understanding on technological cooperation in the
health sector with WHO since the country regained its seat in the
organization in 1972.

KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen out of the total 26
Ugandan insurance companies have appealed for an extension of the
deadline to pay up the minimum capital required by the Ministry
of Finance, The New Vision reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statute Insurance, a foreign insurance
company operating in Uganda must have a minimum capital of two
billion Uganda Shillings (some two million U.S. Dollars) by April
4, 1998 while a local insurance company must have a minimum
capital of 200 million Uganda Shillings (some 200,000 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 13 insurance companies demanded that Finance Ministry
extend the deadline to April 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Their failure to pay up the required amount of capital is due
to their clients' failure in fulfilling corresponding contracts,
among others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A source in Insurance Commission said they will listen to the
grievances of the affected companies after they have been
directed by finance minister.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi, in
a meeting today with a Japanese group that is here to examine the
investment environment in the city of Chongqing and in Guizhou
Province, said she appreciates their efforts in improving
Sino-Japanese economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
She told the group, which is led by Watari Akira, president of
Japan's Nichimen Corporation, that China and Japan have enjoyed
smooth development of political and economic relations in recent
years and that the Japanese have been active in investing in China
since the Chinese government gave priority to the development in
western and central parts of China.
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes the two countries can make a joint effort in
advancing bilateral economic and trade ties and discussed the work
of the newly-elected Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Watari, who is chairman of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade's Agricultural Cooperative
Committee, said that China's rapid economic growth provides
more opportunities for bilateral cooperation and that his
association hopes to increase bilateral economic and trade
cooperation focused on China's western and central areas.

<HEADLINE> Stopping Erosion on The Upper Reaches of The Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Local government efforts to stop
land erosion on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's
longest, have been having some success, according to Guo Houzhen,
a Water Resources Ministry engineer.
</P>
<P>
A total of 46,000 square kilometers of eroded areas have been
recovered, he said, as part of a project that concentrated on
improving farmland with small-scale water resources protection
projects on a million sq km of land that began in 1989. It has
developed almost 330,000 hectares of farmland, increasing grain
production by approximately 3.2 billion kg and helping five
million local farmers to become better-off.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the region's barren mountains have been
worked on as part of the project, increasing plant coverage to 41
percent and holding erosion down to 36 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, the amount of sand flowing into
the Three Gorges reservoir will be decreased by nearly 100 million
tons, one study has shown, and contribute a great deal to the
long-term effects of the Three Gorges Project.

MACAO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors in tour
groups to Macao dropped 32 percent in the first two months of
1998.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, the number of Macao residents traveling outside
Macao in tour groups grew 24 percent in the period. Their most
preferred destinations included China's mainland, Thailand and

<HEADLINE> Seven Million U.S. Children Suffer Hearing Loss, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More than seven million U.S.
children between 6 and 19 years of age suffer from hearing loss,
according to a study published Wednesday on The Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted among 6,166 children nationwide from 1988
to 1994, found that 14.9 percent of those examined had
low-frequency hearing loss of at least 16 decibels.
</P>
<P>
when applied to the general population, those figures mean more
than seven million children nationwide may suffer some hearing
loss, said researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Low-frequency hearing loss impacts most strongly on a person's
ability to understand human speech, while high-frequency hearing
impairment hinders detection of high-pitched sounds such as
whistles, alarms and telephone rings, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers noted that the hearing loss of most of the
children was not severe, and was limited to one ear only. "Severe
to profound" hearing loss was found among approximately 0.3
percent of those examined, they said.
</P>
<P>
Causes of hearing loss include impacted wax or swelling caused
by infection, insertion of foreign objects into the ear, loud
noise, certain medications, or serious illnesses like meningitis
and congenital syphilis, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers advised that standard school-based tests begin
to focus on a wider range of hearing frequencies, to improve the
detection of hearing loss and related learning problems among the
U.S. children at elementary, middle and high schools.

TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued rising in
Tokyo Wednesday with the key Nikkei index closing well above the
16,000 line on expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will soon announce a policy change from the current
fiscal austerity.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 397.90 points, or 2.49

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 32.45 points, or 2.68 percent to

Hashimoto is scheduled to outline Thursday details of the
forthcoming pump-priming package, including a revision of fiscal
laws to allow large-scale income tax cuts.
</P>

Though the contents of the package including an income tax cut
are expected to be little different from what has already been

<HEADLINE> HK's Provisional Legislature Holds Final Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC), the legislative arm of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), held its final plenary session
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the two-day sitting, the 60-member PLC will adjourn,
clearing the way for the first Legislative Council elections
scheduled for May 24.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday lawmakers passed through the Adaptation of Laws
(Interpretative Provisions) Bill with a big margin, along with
eight other bills.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the bill is to adapt the Interpretation and
General Clauses Ordinance (Cap.1) "in order to ensure conformity
with the Basic Law and with the status of Hong Kong as a Special
Administrative Region of China," acting Secretary for Justice Ian
Wingfield told the council.
</P>
<P>
Many definitions in Cap. 1 are adapted by the bill in order to
reflect the reunification, without changing their substance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, legislation that is expressed to be binding on
the "Crown" is to be construed as binding on the "State".
</P>
<P>
This is "in line with the objective of ensuring the
continuation of Hong Kong's legal system" and is not "an exercise
in law reform," the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The amendment lays the foundation for the adaptation of other
ordinances with colonial references, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by a vote of 46 to six. Eight legislators
were absent or abstained from the vote. The bill will take effect
once Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa signs it.
</P>
<P>
Also adopted at the final PLC meeting were Adaptation of Laws
(Courts and Tribunals) Bill, Legal Practitioners (Amendment) Bill
1998, Adaptation of Laws (Nationality Related Matters) Bill,
Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill 1998, among others.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, lawmaker Cheng Yiu-tong will move a motion to the
council, urging the SAR government to formulate Hong Kong's
long-term development strategies, while Henry Tang will move a
motion on attracting foreign investments in innovative industries.
</P>
<P>
Another lawmaker, Dr. C. H. Leong is expected to move a
valedictory motion, wishing the smooth formation of the first
Legislative Council to continue to serve the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
A farewell dinner is to be staged after the meeting concludes.

<HEADLINE> Australia Faces Industrial Upheaval After Dock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia faced unprecedented
industrial unrest after the Australian government-backed sacking
overnight of 1,400 workers, or the entire waterfront workforce of
the nation's second largest stevedore.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard described the mass
sacking of Patrick stevedore's 1,400 workers, which was announced
by his Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith late Tuesday
night, as "a defining moment in Australian industrial history."
</P>
<P>
"...the circumstances in which they (the sacked workers) now
find themselves are a direct result of their own irresponsible
conduct," the prime minister was quoted Wednesday by the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australian Union leaders warned of a massive campaign against
the attack on the maritime union's 60-year-old monopoly on
dockside labor as Australia's other major stevedore P and O said
it was considering following Patrick's lead.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers around Australia walked off the job to
protest in support of the workers and the Victorian Trades Hall
Council in the state of Victoria announced plans for a statewide
general strike next month, said AAP and Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) TV in its evening news program.
</P>
<P>
Australian Council of Trade Union (ACTU) President Jennie
George condemned the Patrick's actions as "fascist", promising the
union movement would fight until the workers got their jobs back
in what she said was Australia's worst industrial dispute for a
hundred years.
</P>
<P>
Private security guards with attack dogs swept onto 15 of
Patrick's docks around Australia shortly before midnight, locking
out Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) workers who had staged
sporadic strikes over the last three months, AAP and ABC reported.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chief Chris Corrigan said he regretted having to take
such extreme action against his workforce, but blamed the MUA for
trying to destroy his company.
</P>
<P>
"We're operating within the law ... these people (MUA members)
have withdrawn their labor, we have withdrawn our capital,"
Corrigan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The powerful International Transport Workers Federation (ITF)
immediately announced plans to target Patrick and its shipping
clients worldwide in a move the Australian Shipowners Association
said could not be ignored.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Police to Defuse Students' Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean police authorities
announced Wednesday that it will prevent a rally for the launching
of the 6th Federation of Korean University Councils, or
Hanchongnyon, Friday at Yeungnam University in the city of Taegu.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was seen as a tough reaction to the planned
launching of the 6th Hanchongnyon, which declares the current
South Korean government is "a puppet regime of U.S. imperialists."
</P>
<P>
The police said they will blockade all roads leading to the
rally site to prevent students from joining the gathering while
deploying riot police in the university to prevent any violence if
the rally takes place as planned.
</P>
<P>
Police will arrest all those who are not students of Yeungnam
University wanting to enter the university campus on charge of
"creating and joining an enemy-befitting body," an item carried in
the National Security Law.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Explains Proposed Amnesty for SLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's resistance group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, Wednesday denied there is any link
between Israeli security demands and its proposed amnesty to
members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The party's representative in the parliament, Al Haji Hasan,
said in an interview with the Voice of the People radio that the
pardon proposal was different from what Israel asked for as
preconditions for its withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded security arrangements with the Lebanese
government which include reintegration of the SLA into the
Lebanese regular army in the event of Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA has been helping Israeli forces control
south Lebanon and hated by the people as traitors. Its commander
Antoine Lahd has been sentenced to death for treason by a military
court in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which is spearheading a war to
evict Israeli troops, last Monday announced it was reviving a bill
in the parliament that would grant immunity from prosecution to
SLA members if they left the militia within a limited period of
time.
</P>
<P>
After Israel showed intention to quit Lebanon last month by
formally accepting the United Nations resolution 425 calling for
Israeli withdrawal, SLA members began to worry about their fate
with many seeking asylum in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said the grace will not be given to those who had
committed crimes on purpose to the Lebanese people and served
Israeli intelligence departments.
</P>
<P>
Most SLA members are believed to be either recruited by force
or joined the militia because of financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty proposal, first presented at the end of last year
when the debate in Israel over a possible pullout from Lebanon
intensified, was aimed at further weakening the morale of the SLA.
</P>
<P>
Hasan predicted that the proposal will win support from the
parliament and eventually be approved.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim to
protect its northern part cross-border guerrilla attacks. It has
since been bogged down in a war of attrition there with heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it wants to withdraw from south Lebanon in exchange
for the security arrangements of the Lebanese government. The
offer was flatly rejected by Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Doctors Succeed in Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian heart surgeons have reported
success in a complex operation on a 11-year-old boy, sealing the hole
in his heart, the Post Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surgeon at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in
Enugu, southern Nigeria, also performed a palliative operation to
ensure that blood flows properly to the lungs of the young patient.
</P>
<P>
The boy, from Zaria in the north, suffered from a congenital
disease called "tetralogy of fallt", a triple ailment -- a hole in the
heart, narrow ventricles and a narrowing of the heart chamber.
</P>
<P>
The defect in the heart of the young patient, according to Dr.
Vincent Okwulehe, one of the surgeons, showed in his retarded growth,
recurrent chest infection and blue baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
He said that the boy first came to his hospital in 1990 and that the
first palliative operation was done in the following year.
</P>
<P>
"We have just completed a total correction of the defect in his
heart," the doctor said, adding that the yound patient would soon be
discharged.
</P>
<P>
The boy is now convalescing at the Intensive Care Unit of the
hospital, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Largest Regional Travel Agency to Move Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA), the largest tourism agency in the region, has
decided to move its headquarters from San Francisco to Bangkok in
September.
</P>
<P>
the move, if materializes, will boost the Thai tourism industry
at an increasingly competitive market, a government source in
charge of tourism said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
the PATA move is also expected to give a major shot of
confidence to other regional and multinational companies weighing
locations for future headquarters, said the unidentified source.
</P>
<P>
some major international tourism organizations have already set
up their regional headquarters in Bangkok. They include the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the Transport,
Communications and Tourism Division of the U.N. Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
founded in 1952 in Hawaii, PATA has been based in San Francisco
for more than 40 years. It is one of the world's largest
private/public sector travel industries with a membership of 40
national governments, 76 airlines and cruise lines, and 2,200
travel and tourism-related businesses and organizations.
</P>
<P>
those kind of links can yield substantial benefits for
Thailand, whose tourism industry will be well-positioned to plug
into PATA's ample data and strategic resources.
</P>
<P>
one of the most significant resources will be the Strategic
Information Center, now based in Singapore but to be moved to
Bangkok. The center is PATA's industry monitoring watchdog and
plays a major role in gathering information on which PATA bases
its programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
Thailand won the bid on the basis of a professionally packaged
presentation by the tourism authority of Thailand. The main
component was an index that compared the costs of working and
living in Bangkok with those of seven other Southeast Asian
capitals.

PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Testifying Tuesday before the parliamentary commission in
charge of investigating the French policy toward Rwanda, Belgian
expert Filip Reyntjens said he has proof that the two missiles
which shot down the plane of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana
and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6, 1994, were
from the stocks of the French army.
</P>
<P>
-- The underground or black economy in Europe now represents 7
to 16 percent of the gross domestic product of the whole
continent, as compared with 5 percent in the 1970s, said a
recently released report by the European Commission entitled
"Communication on Undeclared Labor." Black economy in Europe now
employs 10 to 28 million people, or 7 to 19 percent of the total
jobs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Episcopal Committee of Migration of the Roman Catholic
Church of France has called on the government to regularize the
residence status of the paperless immigrants, especially for those
who are living separately from their families. The Interior
Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement rejected the demand, saying it
will help the extreme-right to rise further in France.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac Tuesday pleaded for a united
 Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking to Bosnian youths in Sarajevo,
Chirac defended the unity of a Bosnia which is multicultural,
democratic and fully integrated into the international

<HEADLINE> Labor Exports Drop in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua)-- More than 2,600 Vietnamese were sent
abroad to work under labor contracts in the first quarter of this
year, an 8 percent drop from the same period last year, an
official report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
lower demand for overseas workers in traditional markets,
increased labor exports by regional countries and a fierce
competitiveness in international labor markets are behind the drop
in labor export, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the current regional financial crisis has driven
some countries which normally need Vietnamese workers to reduce
their foreign labor forces. Complex administrative procedures
worsened the problem, it said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated number of 300,000 Vietnamese work in more than 30
countries including South Korea, Japan, Libya, the Czech Republic
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam expects an average export of 400,000 to 500,000 workers
per year after the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Accepts Pyongyang's Proposal to Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday accepted the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s proposal to hold a
vice-ministerial level meeting in Beijing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"On our part, there is no change in our belief that it is not
desirable to hold inter-Korean government-level talks in a third
country. But taking into consideration of your position, we have
decided to agree on your insistence to open the meeting in
Beijing," said Seoul through the hot line phone between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the DPRK suggested that the talks be held in
Beijing on April 11 to discuss issues related to food and
fertilizer assistance.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also told the DPRK that a five-member delegation
headed by Vice Unification Minister Chung Se-hyun will leave for
Beijing for the historical meeting, which is seen as a restoration
of official contacts between the two sides after nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
The other four members of the delegation are Cho Kun-shik,
President Kim Dae-jung's secretary for unification affairs, Kim
Dong-keun, a director of the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry and
Sohn In-kyo and Suh Young-kyo, directors from the Unification
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea asked the DPRK to notify Seoul of the names of its
delegation before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Through the hot line, Seoul provided an agenda to Pyongyang on
the forthcoming meeting over the ways to improve the inter-Korean
ties and issues of mutual concern, including the South's supply of
food and fertilizer to the North.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the South Korea Red Cross Society sent a letter to
its DPRK counterpart that it will ship 7,327 tons of relief
materials, which are mostly rice, flour and cooking oil, from
Inchon Port in the South to Nampo Port in the North on April 15-21.
</P>
<P>
South Korea reportedly will tie the fertilizer supply issue
with the reunion of inter-Korean separated families, exchange of
special envoys and implementation of the South-North Basic
Agreement signed in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Real GDP Growth of Nepal Down in 1997: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The real GDP growth of Nepal in
the
fiscal year of 1997 was estimated at 4.9 percent, down 1.2
percentage
over the previous year, said the Economic and Social Survey of
Asia and
the Pacific 1998 published Wednesday by a U.N. economic
commission.
</P>
<P>
Sectors other than manufacturing, electricity, gas and water
recorded
slower growth in 1997, while slower growth in tourism also reduced
growth
in the trade, restaurant and hotel services, leading to a growth
of only
5.5 percent in the service sector compared with 7.3 percent in
1996,
noted the survey published by the Bangkok-based Economic and
Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Value added from agriculture for Nepal increased by 3.3 percent
in
1997 as against 5.4 percent in 1996, the survey said, adding that
paddy
production increased owing to favorable weather conditions while
maize production declined.
</P>
<P>
High rates of growth in money supply in the early 1990s, mainly
owing to high budget deficits, were checked in later years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, money supply grew by 14.7 percent, lower than that of
previous year. And during the first nine months of 1997, growth in
money supply was limited to 7.9 percent as against 10.7 percent in
the same period of 1996, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1997 which ended on July 14, government
revenues grew faster than expenditure and reduction in budget
deficits was achieved.
</P>
<P>
Total government expenditure increased by 6.8 percent, compared
with a 14.6 percent increase in revenues, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite this optimistic fiscal situation, there
remained causes for concern, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
First, regular government expenditure increased substantially.
And secondly, the increased resources came largely from
non-budgetary and other receipts.
</P>
<P>
The new budget for fiscal year 1998 announced in July 1997
addressed some of these issues, and the inflation rate has been
hovering around 8 percent in recent times, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the gross national investment rate in Nepal has
remained of the order of 22-24 percent in recent years, and
economic reforms, which encouraged private sector activities, have
raised the share of the non-governmental sector in total capital
formation to two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
The savings-to-GDP ratio fell to about 11.0 percent in 1996 and
1997 from a peak of 14.7 percent in 1994, while the
savings-investment gap has been above 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
This highlighted the country's dependence on foreign savings to
finance its development, the survey noted, adding that vigorous
efforts are needed to mobilize domestic resources and attract
foreign commercial investments as the prospects for aid inflows
remain unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficits have been on the rise for Nepal, the survey
said. In 1997, exports grew by 13.9 percent, while imports went up
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's broad economic policy has been guided by the principles
of market-friendliness, and policies in this direction have been
supported by an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract foreign investors, the Foreign Investment
and Technology Act was amended. Under the amended act, the
Department of Industries could approve the setting up of
industries with fixed capital up to 500 million rupees (about 8
million U.S. dollars), and the department is obliged to inform the
investors of its decision within 30 days of receipt of the
application.
</P>
<P>
Income tax levied on the interest earnings on foreign loans
received by the foreign investors has been waived and taxes on
earnings through royalties and technical as well as managerial
services have been reduced to 15 percent, the survey noted.

<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid will inaugurate the First Arab Industrial
Exhibition, to be held in Damascus on June 22-25.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief will also attend the Eighth Conference on
Industrial Development in the Arab World, to be held in Damascus
under the auspices of Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud al-Zubi.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which coincides with the exhibition, will
evaluate the current status of the industrial sector in the Arab
world, chart future developments, create an atmosphere for
investment and encourage inter-Arab trade.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arab industry ministers will tackle global
economic changes in the industrial sector and their impacts, said
official sources at the Arab Organization for Industrial
Development and Mining, whose executive bureau sponsors the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The executive bureau will meet for three days in Rabat, capital
of Morocco, from April 21 to pore over working papers submitted by
the AL member states on the conference as well as the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the first of its kind since Arab countries
began the trial of establishing a greater Arab free trade zone and
is considered a good opportunity to display Arab commodities and
to serve inter-Arab cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The AL announced the implementation of the Arab free trade zone
from January 1, 1998 to further Arab economic integration and
finally herald in an Arab common market over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Tariff liberalization will allow customs among member states to
drop by 10 percent a year in the coming decade and taper off by
the end of 2007 when the Arab common market comes into being.
</P>
<P>
The accumulative Arab gross domestic product is no more than
529 billion dollars and inter-Arab trade accounts for merely 8
percent of Arabs' trade with the world.

LOS ANGELES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Internet and online
advertising spending in 1997 was triple the 1996 level, the
Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fourth quarter online advertising was valued at 335.3 million
dollars, a sharp increase over 227.1 million dollars in the third
quarter, the IAB said. Overall spending rose to 906.5 million
dollars in 1997 from 226.9 million dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"We really see that 1997 is a breakthrough year in Internet
advertising as the medium joined the ranks of traditional media,"
IAB Chairman Rich Lefurgy told reporters on a teleconference.
</P>
<P>
"We expect 1998 will be another breakthrough year," Lefurgy
said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer-related products were the most heavily advertised
category last year at 31 percent of the total online spending, the
IAB said. It was followed closely by computer products, 30
percent, with financial services, telecommunications and news

<HEADLINE> Israel Intends to Buy Tilting Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Following two weeks of trials,
Israel intends to buy the so-called titling trains which can
dramatically reduce journey times, local newspaper The Jerusalem
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israel Railways General Manager Amos Uzani
as saying that the final decision to issue a tender for the
supply of the trains, which can take bends at far higher speeds
than the current rolling rock, will be taken in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Israel Railways said it expects that at least
five international companies will bid to supply the trains, which
will cost about 3.5 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The tender is likely to allow for leasing in the early stages
while the long-term funding is arranged. This arrangement would
allow for a much quicker acquisition of the trains, according to a
statement from Israel Railways.
</P>
<P>
The tilting trains are intended for use on the lines between
four Israeli main cities - Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa and
Beersheba.
</P>
<P>
The trains will run at an average speed of 140 kilometers per
hour, which will reduce journey time by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uzani said in February that by the middle of next year there
will be 28 daily trains in each direction between Tel Aviv and
Beersheba. This compares to the current one train a day in both
directions and an additional train on Sundays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Israeli Finance Minister Ya'akov Neeman promised
to present fresh proposals for the funding of Israel Railways'
operations within six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Cops Accused of Violating Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian policemen have been
accused of seriously violating human rights, leading independent
newspaper The Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Lusaka Tuesday, Ngande Mwanajiti,
Executive Director of Inter-African Network for Human Rights and
Development (AFRONET), charged that Zambian police officers are
enemies of the very people whose lives they should protect.
</P>
<P>
Zambian policemen have failed to perform their duties and were
engaged in "barbaric and inhuman operations," said Mwanajiti.
</P>
<P>
The police anywhere in the world are supposed to be protectors
of the rights of the citizens, but in Zambia, said the AFRONET
official, "They have continually become enemies of the people and
are among the biggest violators of human rights."
</P>
<P>
In response to recent incidents in which the police have been
killing people under unclear circumstances, Mwanajiti said, "It
is inhumane for the police to kill ordinary citizens."
</P>
<P>
According to him, AFRONET is deeply concerned with the
policemen's "barbaric and inhumane operations" and condemns the
manner in which two policemen in two separate incidents shot dead
innocent people in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that the Zambian police Command control the
carrying of firearms and live ammunition by policemen.
</P>
<P>
Last week, police shot dead five suspected criminals in
Lusaka's industrial area. Later it was discovered that the dead
were genuine employees of a transport company hired by
businessmen who wanted to transport tyres from a plant to
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a reserve police officer killed a mini-bus
conductor in Lusaka after failing to pay a 500-Kwacha (about 30
U.S. Cents) charge for a ride.

<P>
KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese forestry personnel have
found a more-than-600-year-old camellia tree in southwest China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The tree is 10 meters high and 0.65 meters in diameter at the
bottom of its trunk and more than 50 square meters at the top. It
has been regarded as the "king of camellias" because of its age
and size.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Starving Inmates in Tanzania Get 3,000 Tons of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Starving inmates in
Tanzania's congested prisons have got 3,000 tons of food from the
government, The Guardian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohammed said
here Tuesday that the overcrowding of prisoners is a burden to
the government, but there is sufficient food to feed them.
</P>
<P>
" There is no reason why inmates should suffer from
malnutrition," the minister was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ameir said the delays in the hearing of the cases and the
financial problems facing the judiciary are the major reasons for
congestion in prisons.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations are continuing between the Ministry of Home
Affairs and the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to
ease the congestion of prisoners," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also refuted claims that many prisoners are dying
in the country's jails due to poor diet and health care.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that some prisoners entered jails already infected
with diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and cholera, which
ultimately lead to their deaths while in custody, he said, adding
that most prisons are well equipped with health centers.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997/98 budget speech, Ameir told the parliament that
Tanzania's prisons were built for 21,527 inmates but currently
twice as much are being held.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable growers in rural
Shanghai have adopted computer applications for production,
according to today's issue of Economic Information.
</P>
<P>
One greenhouse in the Pudong New Area has adopted computer
technology for using mineral wool for growing tomatoes, cucumbers
and various other vegetable plants attached to wire.
</P>
<P>
The computer system operates on a 24-hour basis to
automatically control the temperature, humidity and sunlight in
the greenhouse. Liquid fertilizer is automatically fed to plant
roots through a system of pipes.
</P>
<P>
Computer applications have enabled the facility to enjoy three

cucumber output of 300,000 kg quadrupling the figure for
conventional production, according to the paper.

<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer legend Pele on
Wednesday warned South Korea against exorbitant spending on new
stadiums for the soccer World Cup finals in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Pele said at a news conference, "The best way is not to spend
too much money. If you can renovate, maybe you can save a lot of
money."
</P>
<P>
He added the United States, which hosted the 1994 World Cup,
was a good example because it just improved existing stadiums
instead of building brand new ones.
</P>
<P>
However, Pele maintained that the stadiums must be up to the
FIFA standards for such a grand soccer fiesta.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said South Korea may have to scrap plans to
build 10 new stadiums in its co-hosting of the event with Japan
because of the present financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Terrorists Responsible for Killings in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Internal Minister Tom
Butime has blamed terrorists for the killings occurred in
central Kampala last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There have been five terrorists related incidents in the last
three weeks, linked to the same group that planted bombs at Nile
Grill and Speke Hotel," Butime was quoted by The New
Vision as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four people have been killed last Saturday in two separate
bomb attacks in Nile Grill and Speke Hotel in central Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists behind the killings last Saturday and other
five terrorists activities in the last three weeks in the city
are linked with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels in
western Uganda, Butime said.
</P>
<P>
The government has the list of the terrorists, but failed
to arrest them due to "the law on the statute books" which the
minister described as "very weak".
</P>
<P>
"After all terrorism is a new phenomenon in Uganda", he said,
adding that his ministry will advocate for a law that
specifically addresses terrorism.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 terrorists in the city, police sources
said. "We know their names and their homes," the source said.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists planned to disrupt recent visit by U.S.
President Bill Clinton to the country but failed due to the
pressure put on them by authorities, police sources claimed.

JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Siphiwe Nyanda, the first

Both Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki believe Nyanda is

Nyanda, 48, has been General Georg Meiring's understudy.
Meiring fell from grace after an alleged coup report that

<P>
Meiring, due to retire next year, announced his retirement on
Monday. Mandela has accepted Meiring's retirement request. Nyanda
is expected to replace the white general from June 1.

Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) had been the military wing of the

<HEADLINE> Minority Broadcast Ownership Encouraged in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Communications officials
Tuesday urged broadcasters to find ways to boost minority
broadcast ownership in television and radio industry.
</P>
<P>
"I challenge broadcasters to come to me over the next 60 days
with your best ideas to promote ownership, management and
employment for minorities and women within your industry," said
William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC), in an address to the FCC annual convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that minority broadcast ownership stood at 2.8
percent in 1997, down from 3.1 percent in 1996, while minority
population accounts for nearly 20 percent of the total U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
"I am committed to reversing that trend during my
chairmanship," Kennard promised, advocating the return of tax
certificates which gave tax breaks to owners of broadcast outlets
who sold to minorities.
</P>
<P>
Congress outlawed the practice after several major corporations
received multimillion-dollar breaks.
</P>
<P>
"We would be supportive of the tax certificate," said Eddie
Fritts, president of the NAB. "We may have to refine it a little
bit to make sure you don't have abuses."
</P>
<P>
Both Kennard and Fritts believe that the NAB is behind the
certificates which might need to be instituted without government
mandates. They urged the broadcasters to act voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Reach New Agreement on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government here
Wednesday approved a Supplementary Memorandum on the country's
economic reform program it signed the day with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) after a marathon negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen after the monthly cabinet meeting headed by
President Soeharto, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the Indonesian government
will seriously carry out the new agreement with the IMF in a bid
to restore public confidence to the country's economy and market.
</P>
<P>
Under the supplementary memorandum, the Indonesian government
will continue its tight monetary policy in order to stabilize the
value of the Indonesian rupiah (national currency) and curb the
increasing inflation.
</P>
<P>
To this purpose, the banks, including the central bank, Bank
Indonesia, will maintain high interest rates temporally.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the state budget which was announced in
January, both sides have agreed to revise the economic growth rate
for 1998/99 fiscal year (starting April 1) from original zero to
contract 4 percent, inflation rate from 20 percent to 17 percent
and oil prices from 17 U.S. dollars per barrel to 14.5 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The government will also increase subsidies for some
commodities and import cost. The budget deficit is projected to be
increased to about 3.5 percent which will be met by foreign
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the health of national banking system, the
government will continue its bank restructuring program. The
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) last Saturday has
frozen seven unsolved private banks and put seven others under its
supervision.
</P>
<P>
On the structural reform, President Soeharto at the meeting
asked cabinet minister to study and carry out the 50-point
agreement between Indonesia and the IMF signed on January 15.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Buddhists Doubt Authenticity of Third Buddha's Tooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Buddhist Association
(CBA) has questioned the authenticity of a relic purported to be a
third tooth from the remains of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
A Tibetan living buddha living in exile in India has donated
the relic to a temple in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The sutra of Sakyamuni's nirvana records that four teeth were
found with the remains of the founder of Buddhism, one of which
was consecrated by Sakra (Lord of the 33 Heavens) and the other by
a Rakshasa (demon or evil spirit in Hindu mythology), according to
a CBA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The two teeth remaining in the mortal world are currently
enshrined and worshiped in Sri Lanka and Beijing, said the
spokesman, adding that there are no records of one Sakyamuni's
tooth in Tibet and that generations of Dalai and Panchen lamas
have never mentioned the existence of such a tooth in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea where the third Buddha's tooth originates,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the record in the sutra on Sakyamuni's
death was verified by a monument to the Buddha which European
scholars discovered in Sakyamuni's birthplace in Nepal in 1898.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the association contends that verification
of a Buddha's tooth should depend on the contents of Buddhist
scriptures say, historical documents and material proof.
</P>
<P>
"The existing teeth enshrined in Sri Lanka and Beijing have
been long recognized as those of the Buddha, while the third tooth
fails to meet the aforementioned criteria," said the

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Reach New Agreement on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this regard, Ginandjar said, the government is making laws
for conducting fair competition among companies. "Good competition
will no only benefit firms but also consumers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week-long negotiation between the Indonesian
government officials and an IMF team which formally started on
March 19 here, the coordinating minister said both sides also
discussed the country's private sector foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The 74 billion U.S. dollars private sector foreign debt, out of
the country's total 137 billion dollars foreign debt, was blamed
as one of the main causes for the monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will involve in the settlement of the private
debt, he said. But the settlement will mainly depend on debtors
and creditors themselves through their negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement also emphasized the importance in helping
small and medium enterprises, cooperatives and poor groups in the
country which have been badly hit by the monetary crisis. The
government will help them through providing low interest credits,
Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will also assist
the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the rupiah has lost more than 70 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar. As a result, Indonesia has
been facing with spiraling inflation, growing unemployment and
other economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997, the IMF and Indonesia reached an agreement on
a 43 billion U.S. dollars bailout package to overcome Indonesia's
economic crisis. In Exchange, the Indonesian government promised
to conduct wide ranging economic, financial and trade reforms.
</P>
<P>
In December, the IMF disbursed the first tranche of the aid
package worth 3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
ON January 15, the two sides signed the second agreement on
speeding up the economic reforms in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fund delayed the second tranche of 3 billion
dollars early March this year because it was not satisfied with
the reforms that have been implemented by the Indonesia
government.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said with the signing of the supplementary memorandum
(the third Indonesia-IMF accord) and the implementation of the
reforms, the government hopes the IMF will soon provide its second
tranche of assistance and the Indonesia's economy will recover as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Levitation Monorail to Be Built in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A magnetic levitation monorail
will be built between Canberra and Sydney which could cut the
journey time by two thirds.
</P>
<P>
Transrapid Consortium Australia (TCA) Wednesday unveiled its
bid for the Sydney-Canberra Very-Fast-Train project with a promise
that it could eventually be extended to Brisbane, Melbourne and
Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
The train will move passengers from Sydney to Canberra at
speeds of up to 550 kilometers per hour, cutting the journey time
from about 3 hours to 59 minutes, a consortium bidding said.
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices on the service would be comparable to current
train and air ticket costs, with 55 to 120 Australian dollars (37
to 80 U.S. dollars) being typical prices.
</P>
<P>
The core of the service would be 59-minute non-stop journeys
with a 72-minute service stopping at Sydney Airport, Heathcote,
Wollongong, Moss Vale, Goulburn and Canberra, TCA project director
Phillip Sellars said.
</P>
<P>
The German-designed magnetic levitation train can carry from
500 to 1,500 passengers and would "float" 12 millimeters above a
single track at a cruising speed of around 400 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
The train, linking the capital and the biggest city, would be
built within five years with no costs from the public sector,
Sellars said.
</P>
<P>
The companies bidding for the project are Capital Rail, Coninan
Consortium, Inter Capital Express Ltd., Speedrail Group,
Talgo/Rail Services Australia, and Transrapid.
</P>
<P>
Bids close next Tuesday with a successful tenderer expected to
be announced by mid-year.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Kill 42 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 42 people, including
pregnant women and children, died in a boat fire in southern
Bayelsa State and a motor accident in western Ogun State Tuesday
when the Moslem holiday Sallah was celebrated.
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily Times Wednesday, 25 of them died in the
Bayelsa accident, when the boat, carrying about 200 passengers,
caught fire at take-off after developing an electrical problem.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the boat, reportedly with 50,250 tons of native
gin aboard, first showed signs of trouble when the ignition failed
as the operators tried to start it.
</P>
<P>
On a second attempt, the boat was said to have emitted thick
smoke just before a fire broke out, causing a stampede during
which some passengers jumped into the water and drowned, while
others sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 17 other persons, among them four children, were
travelling home for this year's Eid-El-Kabir when they died in a
midnight motor accident along the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy, which occurred only few kilometers from Abeokuta,
state capital of Ogun, involved a commercial bus and a tipper
lorry loaded with gravels.
</P>
<P>
Both vehicles reportedly collided because the visibility of the
bus driver was affected by the bright light of the tipper lorry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were reportedly burnt as the bus went up
in flames immediately on impact, trapping some of the passengers.
About seven sustained severe injuries and were on danger list at
the state hospital.
</P>
<P>
Upon the news of the accident, the report said, hundreds of
people expecting relatives and friends rushed to the scene only
to find that they had all been moved to the hospital.

<P>
ATHENS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A midnight rocket targeted on
a branch of the American Citibank in central Athens smashed the
building's glass window and damaged three nearby cars, Greek
police announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.36-inch rocket, which did not explode, was fired by
remote control just before midnight on Tuesday from a BMW private
car parked outside the bank on Drossopoulou street in the Kypseli
district, police said.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but police
believed that Greece's "November 17" terrorist organization was
behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the second of its kind since February 15, 1996
when the group fired an anti-tank rocket on the U.S. embassy in
the Greek capital, causing damage to walls of a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, five American businesses including car
dealerships and Mcdonalds fast food restaurants have been attacked
by leftist urban guerilla groups in Athens thought to be
protesting against Washington's policy toward Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Beijing Beer Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- In the first two months of the
year, Beijing exported 760,000 liters of beer, worth 250,000 US
dollars, according to Beijing Customs.
</P>
<P>
The two figures are a 5.5-fold and 5-fold increase,
respectively, over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began to export beer in the early 1990s. By 1997, it
had exported 6.08 million litres, worth 2 million US dollars,
increases of 23 percent and 25 percent respectively over the 1996
figures.
</P>
<P>
The beer mainly goes to neighboring countries like the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Mongolia, and to some
western countries like Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that one of the major reasons for the increase
in exports is its quality and the efforts local companies have
made to increase exports.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Medium-Range Missile Near Completion: Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- If nothing happens, Iran will be
able to test-launch its medium-range ballistic missile toward the
end of 1999, local daily The Jerusalem Post Wednesday quoted
Israeli sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held talks with a U.S. envoy to
discuss Israeli and U.S. assessments of Russian aid to Iran in
the missile program and its progress, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gallucci replaced Frank Wisner as U.S. President Bill
Clinton's special envoy to Russia on the missile issue early this
year. His visit here came as U.S. and Israeli experts agree that
Iran, with massive aid from Russian advisers and companies, is
approaching the completion of the development of the engine for
the Shihab 3 missile.
</P>
<P>
They said Israeli and U.S. representatives had agreed at the
semiannual strategic talks outside Washington on March 18 that
Tehran's program is reaching a critical stage and that Iran and
Russia could complete the missile's engine in the near future and
develop a prototype missile by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense analysts said the Pentagon agrees with the
Israeli assessment on the progress of the Iranian missile
program. But U.S. officials disagree with the Israelis that the
government of Russian President Boris Yeltsin is supporting the
Iranian effort.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli sources said that once Iran completes the
development of the engine, the missile project is assured of
eventual success. They said the engine has been the most
difficult stage of the Shihab 3 and after its completion, the
Iranians could complete the project themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Shihab 3 is meant to have a range of 1,300 kilometers and a
payload of 700 kilograms. The Israeli sources said the missile is
based on North Korea's No-Dung missile, but Russia took over from
Pyongyang in 1994 after failures in the program's development.
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere in the near future, this milestone (engine
completion) will be reached," a senior Israeli source said. "If
the Iranians have an engine, then they can make concessions on
other parts of the missile," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence and military sources said their main fear
is that any Iranian missile, regardless of its accuracy, would
embolden Tehran's allies, such as Syria or Islamic fundamentalist
groups, to launch an offensive against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Discoveries Indicate Gibbon Once Lived in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- New archeological discoveries
prove that the mountains in the Three Gorges area along the
Yangtze River provided a habitat for gibbon over 290 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Li, the famous Tang Dynasty poet who lived some 1,200 years
ago, wrote a poem about the cries of gibbon and monkeys heard in
mountains in the Three Gorges area. However, no gibbon have yet
been be found living in the area and academic circles dispute the
fact that they once lived in the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
However, a jaw bone representative of the mammal species was
discovered in a cave at 1,100 meters above sea level in Wushan
County in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Huang Wanbo, a researcher of the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said the jaw bone belonged to an older gibbon.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists from Oxford University recently determined that
the stratum containing the jaw bone can be traced back some 290
years ago and thus indicates that gibbon lived in the area prior
to that time
</P>
<P>
Huang said that human activity led to the disappearance of
gibbon in the Three Gorges area.

<HEADLINE> Iodine Supplements Cause Illness Among Chinese Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Medical workers in northwest
China's Gansu Province have determined that the illness that local
students were suffering from was caused by iodized calcium
nutrients, Beijing Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 430 students at a primary school in Lanzhou, capital of
Gansu, were sent to hospital for a check-up after taking the food
supplement. Seventy of them remained under close observation.
</P>
<P>
However, their lives were not in danger, according to Sun
Shuyan, the director of the community hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health banned the sale of certain iodized
products recently and the Ministry of Education circulated a
warning days ago about the possible dangers of iodized products.
</P>
<P>
The iodized pills were over-the-counter bought from a Guizhou
manufacturer, and scientists said that they could not be sure
about the quality until a thorough test is done.
</P>
<P>
China has plans to eliminate iodine-deficiency related diseases
by the year 2000, mainly by using iodized salt. But, the Health
Ministry has said, over-the-counter iodized calcium nutrients and
iodized foodstuff should not be given indiscriminately to
kindergartens and schools. In Lanzhou, they were given to 70,000
students and officials are recalling those that have not been used

<HEADLINE> Task Force Set up in Kenya to Cope With Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A special task force has been
established in Kenya to seek ways of easing the congestion at
Port Mombasa bordering the Indian Ocean, the Daily Nation
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lenny Mwangola, Managing Director of the Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA), was quoted as saying Tuesday that at the Container
Terminal, there were more than 9,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent
units) waiting to be taken into the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
The port also has 26,024 tons of conventional cargo in its
transit sheds and yards, including 11,419 tons of imported grains
for commercial and relief purposes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The KPA director attributed the congestion mainly to to the
damage caused by the El Nino rains to the country's road and
railway infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency in discharging and loading cargo at the port is
being adversely affected by the delays which transporters are
facing in getting the export or import cargo from the port to its
destination, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the state of the equipment at the port was
responsible for much of the delays and subsequent congestion,
saying equipment performance was on average operating at 60
percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
The congestion problem could only be resolved
once the road and railway infrastructure is repaired, he said.
</P>
<P>
An international shipping newspaper Lloyd's List said in a
recent report that there is a severe shortage of warehouse space
at Mombasa because of the inability to move shipments out of the
port quickly due to the poor state of Kenyan roads.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that while ships calling at Mombasa are
currently facing lengthy delays of up to 14 days, the situation
is likely to get worse when big maize shipments of around 650,000
tons arrive in the next two months.

<HEADLINE> China Taking Steps To Protect Tropical Rain Forest (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain
forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province,
will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from
247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the
rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden,
says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen,
stopping cold air from the north, while warm, moist air from the
Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain.
</P>
<P>
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and
valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction
elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a
subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna has at least 58 species of rare or endangered
plants, 15 percent of China's total number, and it is home to 102
species of mammals and 427 species of birds, a quarter and a third
of China's total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the area means protecting an important gene
storehouse, Han says.
</P>
<P>
The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land
in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, and after nearly four
decades it has grown to 247,000 ha with most of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to
study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare
plants to a special 90-ha area for protection.

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Arms Embargo on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security Council
has decided to extend the arms embargo on Sierra Leone until
fighting eases completely in the war-ravaged country, The
Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The council, alongside with the West Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), imposed economic sanctions and arms
embargo on Sierra Leone shortly after the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions have been lifted following the restoration
of the legitimate government ousted in the coup.
</P>
<P>
However, the council said Tuesday arms embargo would continue
to prevent arms from entering the country and escalating the
fighting in eastern Sierra Leone between the ECOWAS peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG and remnants of the junta forces and allied
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats were quoted as saying Tuesday that the war there
might take a longer period of time to conclude with the coup
leader Johnny Paul Koroma still operating from an undisclosed
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has captured most of the vital towns in Sierra Leone,
including the eastern diamond town of Bo and Makeni, a major town
in the north.

<P>
Wang Zhanqiang, the reserve's deputy-director, says that the
rain forest losses are the result of human activities and
coordinating human activities and nature is a tough problem.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic groups like the Dai, Yao, and Hani have lived in
Xishuangbanna for generations, and there are 114 villages still
within the nature reserve. Wang says that hunting is prohibited
there and that there is a designated area where farming is
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say most Asian elephants live in Xishuangbanna,
where their numbers have increased from 197 more than a decade ago
to about 250 today.
</P>
<P>
The elephants often damage villagers' crops in their search for
food. The governments of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous
Prefecture and Yunnan Province have set aside a large amount of
money to compensate farmers for their losses.
</P>
<P>
Some itinerant farmers still can be found at the edge of the
nature reserve, posing a threat to the rain forest. According to
Zhuang Yan, the head of the prefecture, local governments set
aside four million yuan (about 480,000 US dollars) last year to
remove 3,000 Yao and Hani people and help them find other farmland
and provide them with electricity.
</P>
<P>
The development of Xishuangbanna must be based on environmental
protection, Zhang says, and local governments give priority to
tourism but the rubber industry and other sources of pollution are
under strict control.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Water Shortage Hits Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- People living in Bangladesh's
capital city of Dhaka are suffering from a shortage of drinking
water, media reports Wednesday quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Daily demand for water in the city with a population of over 9
million is around 1.4 billion liters, and there is a shortfall of
640 million liters, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority supplies drinking water
to the city dwellers through a total of 97 deep tube wells and a
lone water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
A shortfall usually rises during the summer season when load
sheddings are more frequent than in the winter season.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the system loss of water is about 50 percent due to
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The daily demand for water in the city would rise to 1.8
billion liters a day by the year 2000, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of water in the city would be partially eased with
the completion of the World Bank-aided 175-million-U.S.-dollar
Sayedabad water treatment project, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Curbs Rice Exports to Ensure Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to slow down
rice exports in the coming months to ensure national food
security, it was reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made because of a prolonged drought that had
damaged large part of the rice fields in the country, the English
daily, Vietnam News, said.
</P>
<P>
The government asked all relevant bodies to control rice export
contracts, cutting down exports to the authorized level of 1.5
million tons during the second quarter of the year. The export for
this month will not exceed 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade will strictly control export prices,
reviewing rice price contracts and preventing the signing of
above-quota export contracts and the quotation of export prices
lower than officially set prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bumper harvest of a recent winter-spring crop in
the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta with about seven million tons of
paddy, the current summer-autumn rice crops national-wide have had
to contend with drought.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has worked with rice
exporters to adjust rice exports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported 1.2 million tons of rice in the first three
months this year. The government has originally expected to export
four million tons this year, but the continuing drought has
severely damaged central and southern rice fields.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-China Trade Volume Rises by 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growth rate of trade volume between the two countries has
developed steadily since 1994, surpassing by 15 percent for three
years in a row, Ma Zhihe, Chinese Economic and Commercial
Representative, told Xinhua Wednesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the trade volume can be attributed to the
political stability and economic reforms of Tanzania, which has
increased the confidence of Chinese businessmen in the market of
the east African country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that Tanzania has mainly imported
consumer goods and ready-made products from China.
</P>
<P>
China's brand-name products, such as Phoenix bicycles,
Butterfly sewing machines, Jiefang lorries, as well as small
tractors and medicine for malaria, are highly popular among
Tanzanian customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's exports to China, however, still need to be
diversified, he said, adding that most goods exported by Tanzania
were primary products, such as cotton, timber, tea, coffee, sisal
and cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the taste of Tanzanian customers varies a
lot, and the demand for mechanical and electrical products has
rapidly increased.
</P>
<P>
The official reminded businessmen of the risk in trading
currencies and suggested businessmen adopt a flexible policy in
receiving payment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Tanzania was placed as the 11th largest trade partner
with China in Africa, after South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Angola,
Morocco, Gabon, Togo, Sudan, Kenya and Libya, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He also said China plans to set up a center for investment,
development and trade in Tanzania to provide information to
businessmen back at home.

<HEADLINE> Senior Tibetan Official Criticizes Film "Seven Years in Tibet" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior Tibetan official Ngapoi
Ngawang Jigme has accused the makers of the Hollywood film "Seven
Years in Tibet" of sheer fabrication and a vicious personal attack.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by a Hong Kong newspaper, Ngapoi, vice-chairman of
the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that the film does not match
the facts except for some trivial events such as the Dalai Lama's
study of English.
</P>
<P>
The film was adapted from a book written by Austrian mountain
climber Heinrich Harrer.
</P>
<P>
Harrer was introduced to Ngapoi at a party held in a Lhasa park
in 1948, and he later visited Ngapoi's home once or twice, Ngapoi
said.
</P>
<P>
"We only talked about some trivial things when we met, nothing
in-depth, and we didn't talk about political issues," Ngapoi said,
adding that Harrer liked to play Mahjong.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the film, Ngapoi -- who acknowledged that
he had not read Harrer's book, but did see the film recently --
said that many scenes were "fabricated by movie-makers" and that
the historical facts are very different from the events in the
film.
</P>
<P>
For example, the film shows him sending Harrer a robe. "There
was not such a thing at all, I had never thought of sending a robe
to him," Ngapoi said. "Harrer and I didn't have that sort of
contacts and relations."
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi said he has not seen Harrer since 1951.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Ngapoi was commissioned by the Tibet local government
to serve as chief attendant of Qamdo, a key fortress for access to
Tibet. According to official rules of Tibet at that time,
officials and aristocrats of the Tibet local government had to
serve four years in Qamdo.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi refused the commission for he had served as an official
on grain affairs for four years in Qamdo in his 20s. In addition,
Ngapoi had taken charge of his clan as the eldest child after his
parents died.
</P>
<P>
At that time, People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops were
approaching Qamdo. He said he would like to hold peace talks with
the PLA.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Tibet local government insisted on his
serving as chief attendant of Qamdo and his working together with
his predecessor Lhalu Cewangdoje on defense affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I had to assume office according to that decision," he
said. "Things were rather bad when I arrived there, and it was
very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Lhalu had moved more than 3,000 Tibetan troops to the front,
and mobilized more than 10,000 militia.
</P>
<P>
Military grain and daily necessities had to be transported by
ordinary people. With very backward transport facilities, the
goods from various places had to be pooled first and then sent to
the front. The Tibetans were leading an extremely hard life and
complaints were heard everywhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, I was afraid there might by internal
turmoil, let alone fighting the PLA," Ngapoi said. "The situation
was rather serious."
</P>
<P>
"I intended to disband the militia, but it was mobilized by
Lhalu, and it was not good for me to disband. Therefore, I talked
Lhalu into going back to Lhasa. Lhalu had thought of leaving, so
he was rather pleased and left Qamdo soon," Ngapoi said.

<P>
Ngapoi said he filed a telegraph to Lhasa notifying them of
Lhalu's departure only to be informed that Lhalu must not leave
Qamdo. By that time, Lhalu was five days' ride by horse away from
Qamdo.
</P>
<P>
"I set about disbanding the militia and Qamdo was liberated,"
Ngapoi said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question whether many Tibetan soldiers wanted
to fight with the PLA and had made preparations for fighting,
Ngapoi said: "There was no such a thing; that was nonsense."
</P>
<P>
Following the peaceful liberation of Tibet, things proceeded in
accordance with the peace agreement, he said. In 1956, democratic
reforms in the areas inhabited by Tibetans in Qinghai, Gansu,
Yunnan and Sichuan provinces were opposed by some and rebellions
resulted. Some rebels fled to Tibet after the rebellions were put
down.
</P>
<P>
Asked about contact before the liberation of Tibet, Ngapoi said
he had no contacts with the PLA or the Communist Party before PLA
troops entered Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Through studies on the history of Tibet, I'm very clear that
Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's territory," he
said. "It has been under the jurisdiction of the central
governments of China for more than 700 years."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese revolution in 1911 overthrew the central government
of the Qing Dynasty, and the Kuomintang took over political
power. During those years, the management of Tibet was relaxed,
but Tibet never was independent. "I'm very clear about that,"
Ngapoi said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there were fewer than one million people in
Tibet at that time. Tibetan troops were neither well-trained nor
well-equipped.
</P>
<P>
"How (could they) fight with the PLA? How (could they) win
victory?" Ngapoi said. In this sense, he had been advocating peace
talks at meetings attended by Tibetan officials.
</P>
<P>
"That was not because I knew Communism, or I had some relations
with the PLA. I made considerations proceeding from the history
and realities of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his understanding of Communist policy on Tibet,
Ngapoi said some foreigners had spread rumors about the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, there
were rumors in Lhasa that Communists killed monks, burned
monasteries, looted properties, raped women and even practiced
cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
"For myself, I thought they were evident rumors from
foreigners," Ngapoi said.
</P>
<P>
However, many people believed those rumors and decided to go
into a life-or-death battle with the Communists. Ngapoi stuck to
his view of making peace.
</P>
<P>
"The 400 million Chinese in other parts of the country could
make a living after the Chinese Communist Party took over
political power, then why our less than one million Tibetans could
not live?" he recalled giving others admonitions.
</P>
<P>
"If the Communist Party was like what the rumors said, I think
the 400 million Chinese would not stand the bullying of the
Communist Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even up to now, Ngapoi has not joined the Chinese Communist
Party, but that does not affect his managing affairs related to
Tibet, he said.

<P>
Referring to the 70,000-word report that the 10th Panchen Lama
submitted to the central government in 1962, Ngapoi said the
Panchen Lama had consulted him and showed him the report before
submission.
</P>
<P>
He told the Panchen Lama to talk to the leaders directly,
instead of conveying his opinions in a written form, but the
Panchen Lama did not follow his advice, Ngapoi recalled.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Panchen Lama's report only covered a
few aspects of Tibet, and failed to present a general picture of
the situation of the region.
</P>
<P>
After the 1959 rebellion, democratic land reforms were
implemented in Tibet, and productivity developed smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the central governmental adopted a correct
policy toward Tibet," he said, adding that problems resulted from
poor understanding and implementation of policy by some local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Questioned about how many people died of hunger or in jail, he
said: "I'm very sure to say that no Tibetan was starved to death
at that time.
</P>
<P>
"I only heard some people died of hunger in Qinghai Province,
but I did not know the exact figure because I did not go there."
</P>
<P>
He said the Panchen Lama conducted an investigation in Qinghai
and became very angry after that. The Panchen Lama reported to the
southwest bureau of the Communist Party of China and began to
write his 70,000-word report on his way back to Beijing, Ngapoi
recalled.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Panchen Lama was criticized and jailed
for 15 years because of the 70,000-word report, he said the
Panchen Lama was severely criticized for his report and was
dismissed from the post of chairman of the Preparatory Committee
of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Then he was sent to Beijing and remained a member of the
Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee. He lived in
Beijing for a long time," Ngapoi added.
</P>
<P>
During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), some Red Guards
seized the Panchen Lama at his home in 1967 and held a public
meeting at the Central Institute for Nationalities to criticize
him.
</P>
<P>
After Premier Zhou Enlai heard of it, he asked his secretary,
Tong Xiaopeng, to take the Panchen Lama to a safe place and
protect him there, Ngapoi said.

<P>
Ngapoi responded to a question concerning the detention of
Qazha (Qazha Qamba Chilai, former director of the Democratic
Administration of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery) by noting that the
matter is related to confirmation of the reincarnated soul boys of
the Dalai and Panchen lamas.
</P>
<P>
Nagpoi said the Central Government of the Qing Dynasty adopted
the rule of drawing lots from the golden urn to confirm the
reincarnated soul boy for the Dalai Lama during the period of the
Eighth Dalai Lama. He added that the rule has been carried out
since the period of the Ninth Dalai Lama, with the names of
several candidates presented during lot-drawing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the reincarnated soul boy of the Dalai Lama could
be based on heavenly divinations conducted by the serving Panchen
Lama. In addition, confirmation of the reincarnated soul boy of
the Panchen Lama could be based on heavenly divination conducted by
the serving Dalai Lama. Several candidates were then selected,
according to Ngapoi.
</P>
<P>
"In the event of the deaths of both the Dalai Lama and Panchen
Lama, heavenly divination to confirm reincarnated soul boys could
be conducted by a prestigious living buddha," said Nagpoi, adding
that "related confirmation was merely related to selecting
candidates for reincarnated soul boys, and did not represent
official confirmation."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that official confirmation of a reincarnated
soul boy was accomplished during a lot-drawing ceremony conducted
in front of the statue of Sakyamuni in the Johkang Temple, as was
subject to final approval from the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the issue of the confirmation of the
reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen Lama, I suggested to the
Central Government that the Democratic Administration of the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery send a letter to the Dalai Lama and ask him to
select a candidate for the reincarnated soul boy," said Nagpoi.
</P>
<P>
"The candidate selected by the Dalai Lama can be included in the
ceremony for drawing lots from the golden urn."

<P>
Answering the question whether the Panchen Lama bore any
resentment because of his criticism in the early 1960s, Ngapoi
said he had never criticized the Panchen Lama on that issue, and
he did not even agree to replace him as chairman of the
Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to
a resolution adopted at the seventh meeting of the Preparatory
Committee in 1964.
</P>
<P>
"I clearly said that if he has made any mistake, he can be
criticized internally, but cannot be revoked from his post, and I
clearly expressed my opinion to the leaders at that time.
</P>
<P>
"We both became vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress later. I told him about it in front of
many people at a meeting. We have always maintained a good
relation."
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi said it was just a rumor that the Panchen Lama was
resentful of his criticism.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Panchen Lama did mistakenly speak out
sometimes, but that he pointed out his errors in their private
conversation afterwards, and the Panchen Lama sometimes admitted
his mistake.
</P>
<P>
"We have no contradiction with each other. He often told me to
figure out his mistakes, and so I did," Ngapoi said.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the Panchen Lama's role in
negotiations with the Dalai Lama, Ngapoi said the central
government has always held to only one condition of negotiation,
and that requires the Dalai Lama to stop advocating Tibetan
independence and all activities to separate from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The central government did not negotiate with the Dalai Lama,
he said, but made contacts with him through the Panchen Lama and
the Dalai Lama's relatives. The Dalai Lama suspended the contacts,
Ngapoi said, adding that this had nothing to do with the Panchen
Lama in his lifetime or after his death.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi said he had advised the central government to invite the
Dalai Lama to attend the Panchen Lama's memorial meeting in
Beijing in an appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
The central government accepted his suggestion and asked Zhao
Puchu, president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, to write an
invitation letter to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi said the Dalai Lama's brother, Gyalo Thonduo, who stayed
in Beijing at that time, also thought it was a good chance to
resume contacts with the Dalai Lama, and expressed his willingness
to send the letter to his brother in India.
</P>
<P>
But the Dalai Lama refused the invitation that his brother
sent, Ngapoi said.

<P>
However, according to Ngapoi, the Dalai Lama suddenly announced
that his candidate was indeed the reincarnated soul boy of the
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi stressed that the Dalai Lama's action was in direct
violation of the rule.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the Dalai Lama lived in exile abroad was
inconsequential and living at home would have made no difference,
He would still have lacked final say in the confirmation of the
reincarnated soul boy.
</P>
<P>
"The matter was a private act on the part of the Dalai Lama and
Qazha, and was carried out at the suggestion of the latter. It is
of course true, however, that the Dalai Lama had a special
interest in the matter," according to Ngapoi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the practice was entirely against tradition and
led to Qazha's detention.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi answered a question concerning the crime Qazha committed
by noting that it was an extremely serious mistake, and added that
simply sending a letter requesting that the Dalai Lama select a
candidate for the reincarnated soul boy would have presented no
problem. However, Qazha provided the actual name of the candidate
and requested that the Dalai Lama confirm the young man as the
reincarnated soul boy.
</P>
<P>
"Qazha's actions contravened the rules. While I'm unable to
quote the actual legal term for the crime, I can reiterate that it
was an extremely serious matter." said Ngapoi.
</P>
<P>
While answering to a question concerning the whereabouts of the
candidate the Dalai Lama selected as the reincarnated soul boy,
Ngapoi said the young man is currently studying at an undisclosed
location.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi responded to a question concerning contacts with the
Dalai Lama by noting that the Dalai suspended contacts with the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
"The great efforts I have devoted to contacts with the Dalai
Lama have proven to be fruitless."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the film "Seven Years in Tibet" is filled with
fabrications, adding, "If it is not the idea from Dalai Lama, how
can the film be shot. In such a situation, what can I talk with
Dalai Lama?"
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi expressed little concern about the film's vicious
attacks of him personally.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Mao's viewpoint that whatever the enemy opposes
is good. "We will support whatever the enemy opposes," said
Ngapoi, "and thus I'm not bothered by the slanderous remarks."
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi responsed to a question concerning what will happen to
the Tibetan people following the demise of the aging Dalai Lama by
noting that great changes have taken place in Tibet and the
the Tibetan people will continue to enjoy constantly improving
living standards.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host Animation Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A number of world famous
entertainment companies will present their latest animated films
in Beijing in Augest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Tuesday press conference, Zhang Zhimin, senior
manager for the China Great Wall International Exhibition Co. Ltd,
said Beijing will host China's first International Animation Art,
Technology and Production Fair between August 14-19.
</P>
<P>
Numerous productions will be screened during the week, said
Zhang, adding that the fair will provide a golden opportunity for
Chinese audience to view high quality animated films produced
both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The has aroused an extensive response from animation giants
throughout the world," said Zhang. "The World Animation
Celebration Expo in the U.S., as well as the Angouleme Festival in
France and a number of related famous organizations have clearly
indicated their full support for the fair."
</P>
<P>
Famous companies such as 20th Century Fox, Dream Works
Animation and Dargaut will participate in the fair which will

<HEADLINE> U.S. Broadcasters Urged to Bring Back Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman
and former Education Secretary William Bennett Tuesday urged
U.S. broadcasters to bring back their old code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Look beyond the bottom line and face the reality that too much
of what you are putting on the air is making our country more
violent and vulgar and weakening the common values that we depend
on to sustain us as a community," said Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat, at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Bennett, current conservative Republican commentator, also
supports the return of the conduct code.
</P>
<P>
"We are not calling for censorship but for the exercise of
judgement," Bennett said at the same news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We believe principally that we should use nongovernmental
means available to make the case that certain kinds of cultural
trash exists," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two men ran a video compilation of excerpts from "The Jerry
Springer Show" presented by USA Network which included wronged
girlfriends, cheating boyfriends, transsexual laments and
fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
"We see children murdering children in cold blood, we see
children giving birth to children, we see children contracting
sexually transmitted diseases in epidemic numbers, and children
communicating to us with shocking coarseness and vulgarity and
disrespect," Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
Both men asked for an honest conversation about the role that
the media plays in shaping the attitudes and behaviors of American
youth.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman from the National Association of Broadcasters
(NAB) said the trade group has no plans to bring back the code,
which was dropped in the 1970s after industry and government
challenges.

<P>
Tianjin, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Traveling by train between urban
areas in Beijing, the Chinese capital, and Tianjin is equally
convenient as catching a bus, according to a local railway
official.
</P>
<P>
Passengers can either purchase tickets after boarding the
train, or buy convenient monthly tickets for travel between the
two cities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Four passenger trains -- Y211/2, Y213/4, Y215/6 and Y217/8 --
have operated daily between the Tianjin Railway Station and
Beijing Western Railway Station since April 1.
</P>
<P>
Passengers can purchase tickets in three ways: at station
ticket windows, after passing through the so-called "green lanes"
and aboard. Return tickets can be purchased at the same time.
</P>
<P>
One-way ticket prices for the selected trains are cheaper than
single trip tickets and no additional charges are needed.
</P>
<P>
Monthly tickets have been reduced from 600 yuan (72.28
U.S. dollars) to only 400 yuan, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Telecast to Undergo Changes </HEADLINE>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Oscar telecast, which
stretched into early morning hours on the U.S. East Coast this
year, will undergo a number of changes beginning from next year.
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, which hands
out the annual film awards, said Tuesday that it has reached a new
agreement with ABC network under which next Oscar ceremonies will
move from traditional Monday to Sunday nights and start a half
hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The Oscar show is the most precious asset we have, and we made
this deal because we know that ABC understands our concerns," said
academy president Robert Rehme in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1999, the ceremony will air at 8:30 p.m. East Time
Sunday. The ABC will air a half hour pre-show at 8:00 p.m. to
capture the celebrities as they arrive for the event.
</P>
<P>
The moves are designed to draw a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
This year's ceremony began at the traditional 9 p.m. East Time
Monday and stretched for three hours and 47 minutes into Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Typically, viewership tends to drop off after a show passes the
midnight mark.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls For Settling Kosovo Crisis Within Yugoslavian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has strongly
denied any contacts with those involved in illegal arms dealing
and human trafficking to the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Such rumours are intended to provide an alibi for (Yugoslav)
President Sloboden Milosevic," said visiting Albanian Foreign
Minister Paskal Milo at a joint news conference held here Tuesday
with his Bulgarian counterpart Nadezhda Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the 2 million population in Kosovo, had received
financial support from some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Milo said Albania had taken all possible measures to prevent
criminal activity along its border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian foreign minister said both Albania and Bulgaria
shared a desire "to seek ways to prevent by political means an
expansion of the crisis in Kosovo and its escalation into a
military conflict".
</P>
<P>
Mihailova confirmed the concern of the southeast European
countries that an expansion of the crisis would set the region
back several years, and make their desire for integration into the
European Union (EU) hopeless.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that the Kosovo issue was a problem
not just of Serbia, but of all the Balkans. But the problem must
be solved within the framework of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Milo noted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Tuesday's refusal of the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo to negotiate with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, Milo
called it "well-founded and lawful." He attributed this refusal to
the Kosovo Albanians' resolve to talk with the Yugoslav and not
with the Serbian authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milo arrived here Monday for a two-day visit.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday called for the statesmen and young students from the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic to end their
war and get rid of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted the president as saying
that all ethnic groups in Bosnia should learn to live together
with one another in mutual-respect so as to realize national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chirac added that Europe shoulders the historical task of
making peace in Bosnia and turning the land from a focus of
east-west confrontation to a land of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The French president arrived in Sarajevo Monday night for his
first official visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he also met the Muslim, Croat and Serb members of the
Presidency of Bosnia and urged each of them to play his part in
respecting the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended the war in the
former Yugoslav Republic.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Paris later Tuesday, Chirac went to
Mostar to visit French soldiers serving in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Calls for Financial Policies to Readjust Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The use of financial policies to
readjust the economic structure has emerged as a prerequisite and
guarantee enabling China to achieve a sustained, rapid and healthy
economic development, according to a commentary in the Tuesday
edition of People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
While market competition can spark spontaneous readjustments in
the economic structure, the related adjustments quite often feature
blind approaches and retardation even in highly developed market
economies, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Overcoming innate shortfalls associated with the market and
preventing major economic fluctuations and the waste of resources
inevitably require the use of policy measures to readjust the
economy, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Major financial methods revolve around government expenditures
and taxation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points to the following special aspects and
functions of China's reliance on financial policies related to
economic readjustments:
</P>
<P>
-- the state-owned economy, which features a gigantic volume
and irrational structure, constitutes the dominant aspect of the
national economy;
</P>
<P>
-- China's market is immature in terms of development and
the role of resource distribution remains weak;
</P>
<P>
-- existing structural contradiction no longer centers on the
shortfalls of supplies as in previous years, but instead on deepened
contradictions resulting from problems which have accumulated over
recent decades.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the goal of economic readjustments not only addresses
shortfalls in terms of quantity, but also on improving the quality
of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Economic readjustments should also target programs to upgrade
the economic structure and improve economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, according to the commentary, China's
financial operations are turning for the better, but lingering
problems including the excessively low proportion of state
revenues in the gross domestic product (GDP) have resulted in
inadequate financial power, especially for the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The commentary calls for further improvements in tax
collection mechanisms, and the gradual removal of various
transitional preferential terms and regional taxation
policies.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch New Scheme for Overseas Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government will
launch a new welfare scheme to help expatriates employed overseas
following a 10 percent annual growth in their foreign exchange
earnings, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Labor Ministry sources were quoted by the paper as saying that
Labor Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne who paid a visit to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recently to look into the
welfare and working conditions of expatriates in West Asia, said
each employment agent in the region paid a licensing fee of 25
U.S. dollars annually to Sri Lankan missions in the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
The fund will not only be of benefit to the expatriates but
their families as well, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million Sri Lankans employed abroad last year
contributed 52 billion rupees (852.5 million U.S. dollars) to the
national income, 10 percent more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that there has been an increase in the number
of those working abroad in the past few years, which indicates a
clear growth in this sector.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export May Exceed 5.2b Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export target of the
current fiscal year (from July 1997 to June 1998) may exceed 5.2
billion U.S. dollars, Economic Times weekly reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed while answering a question at the parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
The export growth rate in this fiscal year would be 19 to 20
percent as against the target of 14 percent, the minister told the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Export in the last fiscal year stood at 4.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The volume of export had been increasing because of
diversification and special incentives given to exporters, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garments sector, the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner, accounted for 68 percent of the country's total
export, followed by jute and jute products and frozen food.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to withdraw all duties on the export
of computer software to boost export of non-traditional items and
earn more foreign exchange, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government is also planning to extend more
incentives to exporters, he added.

<HEADLINE> Students Welcome Courses on Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Students in Beijing
University (BU), one of China's most prestigious universities,
have warmly welcomed courses on Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the 317 students selected to attend the
courses earned high marks.
</P>
<P>
Five departments have included Deng Xiaoping Theory in their
curriculums since last summer, when the university introduced
related courses for four-year students.
</P>
<P>
Students have also studied the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) report which established Deng
Xiaoping Theory as the guideline for the Party and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Twelve scholars have presented guest lectures, including Wu
Shuqing, former BU president and a professor of economics.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the courses are designed to enhance the students'
understanding of the essence of building socialism and the basic
rules of socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
The guest lecturers have covered 12 topics of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, including the primary stage of socialism and policies of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic students have exhibited great interest in the
courses and lectures are always filled to capacity. "The lectures
have enabled us to understand Deng Xiaoping Theory and provided
approaches for solving real problems," said a student.
</P>
<P>
"I've found answers to many questions, and fully confident of
my country's future," said another student.

<HEADLINE> Business Heavyweights Join Fight to Limit Y2K-related Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer industry giant
Intel Corp. has joined a regional coalition that seeks to limit
lawsuits over the so-called "year 2000 computer bug."
</P>
<P>
The California Chamber of Commerce is among the coalition
supporting a state bill that would limit corporate lawsuit
liability over the problem, popularly known as the "Y2K bug."
</P>
<P>
Also joining, reportedly for the time being, will be
Hewlett-Packard, a California-based major computer manufacturer,
and other hardware and software trade associations.
</P>
<P>
Computer makers hope that limiting lawsuits with legislative
work now will save them from costly courtroom battles less than
two years away, when the clock ticks into year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bug is in computer language developed decades ago, which,
when the calendar flips to 2000, will lead un-updated mainframe
computers, often used by businesses, to miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, to solve the Y2K problem would cost 1.5
trillion U.S. dollars in the United States alone, not counting
legal costs, which could double the total.
</P>
<P>
The California bill requires companies to inform customers
about possible malfunctions, offer tips on how to make computer
programs bug-free and give free versions of corrective software.
</P>
<P>
While supporters are saying it is a fair and balanced approach,
the California Association of Consumer Attorneys is leading the
opposition arguing that the bill shields wealthy companies from
their responsibility to correct faulty computer programs.

<HEADLINE> Australia Develops Unique Weapon to Fight Skin Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An automated melanoma diagnosis
system, which could save many lives by enabling earlier detection
of skin cancers, has been developed in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), Australia's leading research and development
organization, said Wednesday the portable device, or the Skin
Polarprobe system, was developed by Polartechnics LTD in
conjunction with the Sydney Melanoma Unit and CSIRO.
</P>
<P>
Australia has the highest melanoma rate in the world and
melanoma is the country's third most common cancer, killing about
1,000 people a year, CSIRO said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The excessive sunshine and depletion of part of the ozone layer
over the continent are blamed for the high incidence.
</P>
<P>
"By using the Skin Polarprobe in their surgeries, medical
practitioners will be able to assess and identify suspect lesions
as melanomas more easily and quickly, saving vital time if
treatment is necessary," said Dr. Michael Hirshorn with
Polartechnics.
</P>
<P>
The Skin Polarprobe's hand-held high-resolution camera aids
physician diagnosis by acting as a microscope, magnifying the fine
morphological detail of a suspect lesion.
</P>
<P>
It then downloads the image into powerful real time computer
image analysis software developed by CSIRO.
</P>
<P>
The software first masks out hairs and identifies the lesion's
boundaries, then uses sophisticated algorithms to extract
diagnostic features such as color segmentation, lesion patterns
and geometry.
</P>
<P>
Leanne Bischof, a CSIRO's project leader, said "if the software
finds a match between the characteristics of the suspect lesion
and known melanomas, the physician can immediately recommend
appropriate treatment without time-consuming biopsies."
</P>
<P>
The software was part of the computer-aided diagnosis
technology demonstrated last month in Canberra by CSIRO experts,
who have developed software programmed to tell whether the suspect
lesions are malignant or benign.
</P>
<P>
The Skin Polarprobe system will be one of many Australian
exhibits in the research and development hall at Hannover Fair in
Germany scheduled for April 20-25, CSIRO said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Exports Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's exports reached 564
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter this year, up 14.5
percent against the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said Federal Statistics Bureau Director Miloran
Zirkovic on Tuesday, imports were worth 115.1 million dollars,
down 1.4 percent compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
That resulted in a quarterly trade deficit of 587 million
dollars, mainly due to the loss of the most-favored-nation status
at the European Union market, Zirkovic told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Among the over 100 trade partners Yugoslavia currently has
around the world, biggest traders are Russia, Italy, the Serbian
Republic of Yugoslavia, Macedonia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's exports are farm produce, medical equipment,
medicines, nonferrous metals, iron and steel, timber and textiles,
while imports are reprocessed materials for producing exports.

<HEADLINE> 150 Asian Banks Threatened by Bankruptcy: Thomson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bankruptcy is threatening about
150 banks in Asia which are still operating with state liquidity
injections.
</P>
<P>
More banks in Asia would fail with a near-term time bomb coming
from Malaysia with its real estate collapsing, and from the
Philippines by the year 2000 at the latest, said Philippe
Delhaise, President of Thomson Bankwatch Asia, a credit rating
agency.
</P>
<P>
Philippine banks can remain the best in southeast Asia because
of the cartel system which keeps interest rate high, said
Delhaise, quoted by Wednesday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that if the margins went down fast, their fate
would go down the road in the year 2000 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Thomson, which monitors 1,200 banks in 82 countries, found 150
banks in India, Indonesia, south Korea and others on the verge of
bankruptcy, said Delhaise.
</P>
<P>
He said almost half the assets of Indian banks are
non-performing, but they remain in operation because the state
injects liquidity.
</P>
<P>
However, Delhaise said, this does not necessarily mean that the
insolvent banks will fail, since that depends on public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial crisis in Asia has many reasons, but the
main reason is that Asia has a weak financial system.
</P>
<P>
Building a sound financial system will help solve the problems,
Delhaise said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Property Bad Credit to Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bad credit in Indonesia's property
sector this year is estimated at 28 trillion rupiah (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars), up considerably from around 6.9 trillion rupiah
(about 800 million dollars) before the start of the monetary
crisis in July 1997, a noted property analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The sharply-increased amount of bad credit was mainly caused by
the weakening of the rupiah, Panangian Simanungkalit was quoted as
saying by Wednesday's Jakarta Post daily.
</P>
<P>
This situation, he said, should prompt the government to roll
over some house ownership loans, as well as construction credits,
because bank interest rates today are around 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the rupiah has lost more than 70 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the country's
property sector has been badly hit and many developers were forced
to go out of their business.
</P>
<P>
A local property research agency said earlier that Indonesia's
ailing property sector has not shown any positive sign of recovery
and will continue to be sluggish until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency predicted that total investments in the property
sector this year would only reach 1.7 billion dollars, 50 percent
of its initial target.

BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan has offered to back
Bangkok's first subway project with better loan terms, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund will provide a loan
to the Thai government, via subway overseer the Metropolitan Rapid
Transit Authority (MRTA), with a 0.75 percent annual interest,
rather than the 2.75 percent originally suggested.
</P>
<P>
Repayment period has also been extended from 25 to 40 years and
the grace period from seven to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minster Bhichai Rattakul announced the news after
returning from his Japan trip Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai, together with Prime Minister's Office Minister Somboon
Rahong and MRTA Managing Director Prapat Chongsanguan, told the
Japanese that Thailand viewed the subway as essential.
</P>
<P>
Japan had earlier been confused over reports that Thailand
might suspend the subway project due to economic problems, Bhichai
said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will be informed of the loan terms and will decide
how much to borrow for the 20-kilometer subway route.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 100 billion baht (2.5 billion
U.S. dollars) and is due to begin operating in 2002.

<HEADLINE> China to Woo More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to encourage
the inflow of foreign capital to fuel its rapid economic
development, said an expert from the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
During the coming decade, the amount of foreign funds flowing
into China is expected to maintain an annual level of between 45
to 65 billion US dollars, said Zheng Jingping, deputy
director-general of the Department of Integrated Statistics of
National Economy under the bureau.
</P>
<P>
As a country ready for an economic take-off, China's paramount
need is capital, said Zheng, adding that foreign investors are
also eager to get in on the lucrative opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the 1997 financial turmoil in East and
Southeast Asia will not necessarily lead to a shrinking inflow of
foreign capital into China.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 29.3 percent drop in contractual investment, the
foreign direct investment flowing into China still rose to 45.3
billion US dollars, up 8.51 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, manufacturing and real estate industries
have absorbed respectively 58 percent and 26 percent of total
foreign contractual investment in China.
</P>
<P>
However, such industries as agriculture, energy and
transportation, which are highlighted in China's foreign
investment bidding program, only drew 1.5 percent, 7.2 percent and
1.9 percent respectively of such investment.
</P>
<P>
To use foreign capital more efficiently, Zheng brought up three
points to be given special attention:
</P>
<P>
First, the government should continue its policy of treating
foreign investors the same way it treats domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
Legislation dealing with foreign investment must be
strengthened, said Zheng, adding that a balance must be reached
between protecting domestic infant industries and opening the
domestic market to foreign capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime
Minister-Designate Radu Vasile Tuesday evening announced the
forming of his cabinet after negotiations with other parties in
the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet consists of one prime minister, two ministers
of state, 23 ministers and one secretary of state with the defense
ministry. The positions of ministers of state will be filled
concurrently by the defense minister and the justice minister.
</P>
<P>
All but five members of the previous government will be
retained, and nominations will be examined by the parliamentary
commissions in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Hailed both by the ruling coalition and the main opposition,
the forming of the new cabinet will meet no problems in the
parliament, analysts here said, believing it "will start working
wisely, sheltered by a more than comfortable parliamentary
majority."
</P>
<P>
Vasile has already made clear that his government is to attach
importance to agriculture, exports and development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, President Emil Constantinescu officially authorized
Radu Vasile, general secretary of the largest National Peasant's
Party in the coalition, to form a new cabinet following Victor
Ciorbea's government resigned on March 30 after failure to solve a
government crisis.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co will continue its

ranking official of the company.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted in today's China Daily as saying that
Boeing has very healthy manufacturing bases in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, major assemblies produced in China include 737
vertical fins, horizontal stabilizers, forward access doors and
747 trailing edge ribs, which are produced in Shanghai, Shenyang
and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In January, Aviation Industries of China, Boeing Corp and
Hexcel Corp announced that they would set up a joint venture in
Tianjin to co-produce composite parts for commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that the prospect for New-Generation
Boeing 737 sales in China was excellent.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a total market for approximatedly 1,900 Boeing
commercial jet aircraft sales in China worth 124 billion over the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
To back its customer service, Boeing is involved in a plan to
set up a technical training center in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Boeing also has stakes in an aircraft maintenance facility
located in Xiamen in east China's Fujian province.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Fail to Divide Azov Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia have failed to
agree on how to resolve a territorial dispute over the Azov Sea, a
Ukrainian official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Osavolyuk, a director responsible for territorial
division in the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, said the two countries
would set up a special commission to tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Ukrainian Commission for Territorial Division held
its first session in Moscow on April 1. Ukrainian negotiators
proposed to discuss the division of marine territories.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russians regard the Azov Sea as a common property
belonging to both countries, so it is not necessary to divide it up.
</P>
<P>
Osavolyuk said Ukraine should get most of the continental shelf
of the Azov Sea. Experts believe that the Azov Sea, with an area
of 39,000 square kilometers, has rich reserves of oil and natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia share a land border 2,500 kilometers long and
marine borders of 500 kilometers. The major disputes focus on the
division of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, which links the
Azov Sea and the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Okay Debt Relief Package for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have agreed to give Mozambique
nearly three billion U.S. dollars in debt-service relief.
</P>
<P>
The package, which was approved Tuesday, is part of a broader
effort, including other traditional debt relief mechanisms, to
reduce Mazambique's debt.
</P>
<P>
All of these efforts combined will reduce Mozambique's external
debt from 5.6 billion dollars in late 1996 to 1.1 billion dollars
in June 1999 when the package is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The assistance was provided under the Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) of 1996, which will help reduce the
external debt burden, free budgetary resources and allow
Mozambique to broaden the scope of its development effort.
</P>
<P>
This package is subject to confirmation by all Mozambique's
other creditors and continued implementation of its economic and
social reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the sixth country to benefit under the HIPC. The
other five countries are Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Guyana,
Bolivia and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damage Escalates in East Kalimantan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Fires have razed more than 180,000
hectares of forest since the beginning of this year in the
drought-stricken East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
Some 180,280 hectares in East Kalimantan have been devastated
by fires from January 1 to April this year, head of the provincial
Environmental Impact Control Agency Awang Faruk Ishak was quoted
as saying by the Observer daily on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fires had caused an estimated loss of 365.4 million U.S.
dollars, excluding losses related to the environment, health and
ecological change, Ishak said.
</P>
<P>
Fires continue to burn out of control in the province and
experts agree only heavy rain falls will put an end to the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
East Kalimantan has been gripped by a scorching drought since
the middle of last year, creating ideal conditions for the spread
of fires.
</P>
<P>
The region also abounds with peat, lignite and coal seams which
can smolder for long periods and catch fire easily in windy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The fires in the province have sent thick smoke over the
region, making thousands ill and leading to shortages of food and
water in some areas.
</P>
<P>
It has also raised fears of a repeat of last year's Southeast
Asian haze, when smoke from Indonesian fires blanketed much of the
region, causing widespread health problems and transport
disruption, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests were ravaged by
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia, causing a
loss of more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Borrowing Records Strong Growth in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers increased their
borrowing in February at the fastest pace in four months, the
Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide consumer debt outstanding grew at a 6.9 percent
annual rate to a seasonally adjusted 1.24 trillion U.S. dollars,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
That followed a moderate 4.5 percent growth rate in January and
was the strongest since October.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed the situation reflected consumers' optimism
about their financial prospects as well as mild weather linked to
the El Nino ocean current. It encouraged early sales of spring
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Besides, stimulated by mortgage rates edging toward near
four-year lows, strong home sales was accompanied by robust sales
of furniture and other big items for the home.
</P>
<P>
Revolving credit, which is primarily credit cards, rose at an
annual rate of 8.8 percent in February. That followed a 4.6
percent pace in January and also was the strongest in four months.
</P>
<P>
Auto lending continued to expand, but at a slower pace in
February, a 3.8 percent rate compared with 6.6 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of consumer debt grew at a 7.8 percent rate, the
strongest in six months. This catch-all category includes loans
for mobile homes, education, boats and vacations.

<HEADLINE> Serbia to Hold Referendum on Foreign Mediation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of the Republic of
Serbia in Yugoslavia on Tuesday adopted a resolution on the
holding of a referendum to decide whether to accept foreign
mediation in the current Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said that the referendum will
be held within Serbia from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sank into chaos since the ethnic Albanians calling for
independence from Serbia clashed with the local Serb police.
</P>
<P>
On March 27, the ethnic Albanians accepted a proposal from the
international Contact Group on former Yugoslavia on negotiations
between their leaders and the Serbian government, but insisted
that international mediators must be present.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Serbian authorities rejected any international
mediation or the internationalization of the Kosovo issue, arguing
that it is Serbia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to win popular support, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on April 2 sent a letter to the Serbian leaders,
proposing a referendum on foreign mediation in the Kosovo issue.

Over the first two months of this year, trade between Italy and
non-EU countries amounted to 1,019 billion lire against 3,584

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is trying to increase consumer spending to maintain its 10 percent
growth in GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
It saw a 0.3-percent drop in consumer sales last year and a
negative effect on economic growth. Its GDP stood at 730.8 billion
yuan last year. Economists say it would be difficult for it to
have 10 percent growth this year, economists say.
</P>
<P>
The major forces in the local economy are domestic and overseas
investment, consumer goods, and exports. Guangdong is China's
largest exporter, providing 40 percent of the country's total
exports last year. The financial turmoil in Southeast Asia,
however, are putting pressure on this export-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
The province is making a new effort to improve its investment
environment and plans to put more into construction of
infrastructure and housing and development of technology,
Vice-governor Tang Bingquan said.
</P>
<P>
It is also looking to housing, cars, computers and children's
education for new consumer spending after the home electrical
appliances have become saturated.

<P>
CITY OF PANAMA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. multinational
company says most of the Panamanian banana crop has been lost due
to a 48-day labor strike in Panama.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Chiriqui Land Company said that the company
expected to export 12 million boxes of bananas this year, but only
managed two million.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rest of the banana production, which
represents an annual income of 96 million U.S. dollars, has been
affected by the strike.
</P>
<P>
The growing and harvesting of the fruit is a process which has to
be checked very closely. However, the strike has obstructed the
normal work, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
If the strike, which began on February 12 continues, the firm
will be forced to close its facilities and to fire 4,611 workers,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Portfolio Investments Rise in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The cumulative net inflow of
portfolio investments in the Philippines from January to March
this year posted a seven-percent rise to 425 million U.S. dollars
from 398 million dollars a year ago, according to the Central Bank
of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, the central bank said foreign
investments in both government and listed securities, money market
instruments and bank deposits for the first quarter of the year
amounted to 425 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was based on reports submitted by selected banks
which account for majority of the local custodianship business.
</P>
<P>
Total portfolio investments for the week ending March 27
amounted to 297 million dollars, representing the biggest surge of
such investments for the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio investments are alternatively called "hot" or
"speculative money" chiefly because it flies out of the country at
the merest hint of trouble or to better returns elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, portfolio investments have been
steadily rising from a net inflow of 10.3 million in January to a
net inflow of 92.8 million in February to 214.7 million in March.
</P>
<P>
Economists said this development indicates investors now see
the Philippines as able to weather the financial turmoil better
than the others.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country recorded a net outflow of portfolio
investments of 1.4 billion dollars compared to a net inflow of 2.2
billion dollars in 1996 due mainly to the financial crisis which
started in July last year.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese will not buy VCD
(Video Compact Disc) players in the near future, a study by
Shanghai's Zero Point Investigation Company has found.
</P>
<P>
The study in China's ten large cities found that most VCD
buyers brand name, price and quality into consideration, and 78
percent of those questioned said they are willing to pay for more
expensive VCD players because of quality, and 78.4 percent thought
that a VCD is very fashionable.
</P>
<P>
People in the business predicted that in the future VCD players
will compete in quality, function, and name and that price will be

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Zealand Splits Power Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
announced the long-talked-about decision to split the state-owned
Electricity Corporation (ECNZ) in an effort to lower power prices.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Max Bradford and Finance Minister Bill Birch
announced Tuesday that the ECNZ will be split into three smaller
companies to create competition among them.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regime, retail businesses and line businesses of
power companies will also have to be separated.
</P>
<P>
The separation is intended to stop companies from erecting
barriers to competition and extracting monopoly profits through
artificially high line charges.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as the latest of a series of attempts to cut
the power bills of consumers by increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there has seen a fall in power
production costs but the power bills for households have been on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
At present, the wholesale power price averages at 4 N.Z. cents
(2.2 U.S. cents) a unit, while the average price for households is
between 11 N.Z. cents (6.05 U.S. cents) and 15 N.Z. cents (8.25
U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
But the split has stirred up speculation that the government
</P>
<P>
 is considering to sell the ECNZ to private interests.
</P>
<P>
In the coalition agreement signed between the National Party
and the New Zealand First party, the ECNZ is listed as a
strategic asset which cannot be privatized.
</P>
<P>
While assuring that the corporation will not be sold, Maxdford
and Birch left the door open to future sale of ECNZ by declining
to say whether the National Party would be bound to the commitment
in a future coalition.
</P>
<P>
"That would be a matter for the parties when they come to form
a future coalition agreement," Birch said.
</P>
<P>
The ECNZ has voiced opposition to the brake-up, with chief
executive Dave Frow predicting the split will slash off the
company's value and increase the chance of power failures.
</P>
<P>
But Birch indicated that the government is prepared for the
loss of ECNZ's book value and a decline in both dividends and tax.
</P>
<P>
Bradford said that the government's prime objective is an
efficient economy.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a value loss, it is a value loss because there are
monopoly rents in there somewhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
He quoted an industry analyst as saying that the power bills
for households could drop by 15 percent as a result of the latest
changes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, leader of the
New Zealand First which served a check of the sale of ECNZ, said
the split reduces the threat of privatization and will lower power
prices.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it won't be long-term privatized should New
Zealand First not be in government, but whilst we are here it's
saved," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Approves New Investment Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has approved the
Investment Priorities Plan (IPP) for 1998 which lists preferred
areas of economic activities eligible for government tax and
fiscal incentives, local newspaper Manila Bulletin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Acting Secretary Melito Salazar was quoted
as saying that the new investment plan drastically reduced the
number of priority areas to only 13 from 32 last year to make the
listing more focused.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is confident in attaining the targeted
investments of 700 billion pesos (18.2 billion U.S. dollars) set
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Salazar expects that 70 percent of the investments would come
from projects that would be registered at the Board of Investments
based on the new plan.
</P>
<P>
This year's IPP deleted five major industries -- processed
food, pulp and paper, cement, textile and packaging products.
</P>
<P>
But it included such new areas as the integrated motor vehicle
assembly and parts manufacturing, downstream petroleum, jewelry
for exports and agriculture.

LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British shot putter Paul Edwards,
bronze medallist at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, has been
suspended for life after failing a second drug test on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was punished at a hearing in Birmingham following his
positive test for testosterone in an out-of-competition test last
June.

The 39-year-old underwent the test at his own request, after
serving a four-year suspension for failing two drugs tests

<HEADLINE> Global Efforts to Prevent Maternal Deaths Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from six international
agencies Tuesday called on governments and people throughout the
world to make motherhood safer for millions of women.
</P>
<P>
In observing the World Health Day, leaders from the World Bank,
the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund,
the United Nations Children's Fund, the International Planned
Parenthood Federation and the Population Council gathered at the
headquarters of the World Bank to highlight what can and must be
done to improve maternal health around the world.
</P>
<P>
Among them were First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham
Clinton, wife of the Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Seri Datin
Paduka Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohd. Ali, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that every minute of every day, somewhere in
the world a woman dies during pregnancy or childbirth. The vast
majority of the near 600,000 annual deaths could be prevented with
surprisingly affordable measures.
</P>
<P>
They said less than two U.S. dollars per person a year in most
developing countries would stop most maternal deaths, save at
least 1.5 million infants and prevent millions of serious health
problems amongst women and children.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Agency Group called for actions in this aspect. It
urged international aid agencies to provide overseas assistance to
programs that promote maternal care as an essential component of
reproductive health services
</P>
<P>
It urged governments of developing countries to reduce maternal
mortality and morbidity by developing and implementing health,
nutrition and education programs.
</P>
<P>
It also called on corporations to encourage governments and
private organizations in the countries where they do business to
provide funds and develop programs that foster safe motherhood,
and to support safe motherhood among their employees and
customers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the group also urged women and men to demand and
seek quality prenatal and obstetric care to ensure that no woman
dies or suffers long-term complications from childbirth.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also stressed that safe matherhood is one of the
basic human rights and should be observed.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees More Mergers and Acquisitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian corporate merger and
acquisition activity was at a record pace in the first quarter of
1998, reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 279 deals worth 42 billion Canadian dollars (29.5
billion U.S.dollars) were unveiled in the past three months,
according to merchant bank Crosbie &AMP; Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
The value of takeovers and mergers was up 75 percent from the
24 billion Canadian dollars worth of deals recorded in the first
three months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The totals do not include the proposed 45 billion dollars'
merger of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, which has yet
to get approval from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
A high level of confidence, a low interest rate and low
internal company growth have led to industry consolidation,
fueling much of the consolidation activity, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Among sectors, utilities and oil and gas led the way. The
11-billion-dollar proposed merger of Calgary-based Nova Corp. and
Trans-Canada Pipelines Ltd. topped the list of the biggest deals
over the past three months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls Against Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell Tuesday
against most major currencies at seemingly encouraging news of
both Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, investors were talking up the possibility that the
government is about to unveil a serious fiscal stimulus package,
while economic data from Germany seemed to indicate that that
country might be recovering from its fiscal ills.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 133.35 yen,
down from 134.80 yen late Monday. The U.S. currency also was
changing hands at 1.8356 marks, down from 1.8403.
</P>
<P>
The dollar surged to a more than 6-year high against the yen
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the Nikkei Stock Average rose back on Monday and Tuesday,
the yen got some support and the dollar moved lower.
</P>
<P>
The mark got support from economic reports from Germany,
including a dip in the unemployment rate and increases in some
components of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.5235 Swiss francs, down from 1.5264; 6.1545 French francs, down
from 6.1630; 1,812.25 Italian lire, down from 1,815.50; and 1.4228
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4189.

<HEADLINE> Ross to Renew Efforts on New Mission in Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- United States Mideast peace
envoy Dennis Ross will renew efforts to break the stalemate in the
Mideast peace process in a new mission in two weeks, Israel Radio
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to begin the new round of shuttle mission between
Israel and the Palestinians after the one-week Jewish holiday of
Passover that starts later this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troubleshooter is expected to push for a revised
U.S. peace plan aimed at patching up differences between the two
sides in Israel's troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross held intensive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders
at the end of last month in a bid to sell a proposed U.S. plan on
the Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to win the acceptance of the two sides of the
plan, which reportedly calls on Israel to pull back its troops
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, met by
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the revised U.S. plan that Ross would carry
in his new mission would call on Israel to withdraw from 9 percent
of Area C now under Israeli control in the West Bank, plus 3
percent of the so-called Area C-minus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly defined that Area C-minus is the area
where Israel retains security control but the Palestinian National
Authority will have broader civilian control, especially the right
of issuing building permits.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating possible U.S. pressure, Israeli Kitchen Cabinet
comprising prime minister, ministers of foreign affairs, defense,
national infrastructure and industry and trade Tuesday discussed
the issue of troop pullback, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers maintained that Israel will not withdraw from
more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to deflect U.S. pressure, Yitzhak Molcho, close
adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left for
Washington Tuesday night to clarify Israel's position.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet consisting of 11 of the 18 ministers
will meet on Wednesday to discuss the troop withdrawal and
coordinate government position.

<HEADLINE> Duisenberg to Head European Central Bank, Newspaper Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A deal has reportedly been reached
between Bonn and Paris to allow the Dutch head of the European
Monetary Institute (EMI), Wim Duisenberg, to become the first
president of the future European central bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the German Sueddeutsche Zeitung
newspaper, France had agreed to drop the nomination of its own
central bank chief, Jean-Claude Trichet, for the top post of the
European central bank in exchange for an assurance that a French
national would take the job after the end of the full eight-year
term of Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it had also been agreed that a Frenchman would again
head the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) to succeed the former EBRD chief Jacques de
Larosiere, who quit the post at the end of last year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper said the deal had been reached by German,
French and Dutch leaders on the sidelines of the Second
Asia-Europe Meeting in London over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The French government however has denied the existence of such
a deal.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the office of French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin Tuesday evening described the German newspaper
report as "groundless".
</P>
<P>
The German government meanwhile declined to make any comment on
the alleged deal.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman of the German Finance Ministry just said that
Bonn wanted the dispute over the European central bank leadership
to be solved as soon as possible before the May summit of European
Union leaders which is due to make the final decision on which EU
states will be allowed to launch the planned single European
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over who will head the bank was ignited last
November when France proposed Trichet as a rival candidate to
compete with Duisenberg who has been favored by most other EU
states, including Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany has warned that a prolonged debate could endanger
confidence in the single currency.
