<HEADLINE> EU Steps Up Program to Foster Links With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- European companies have
until October to sign up for a program to improve links with
Japan, the European Commission (EC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Vulcanus Program, launched in June last year by Japan and
the EC, invites European companies to employ a top Japanese
university student for eight months for just 7,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of companies have taken advantage of the scheme since
its launch. Now, the EC wants to step up the program.
</P>
<P>
Any European Union-based company in the industrial sector can
apply to host junior or senior undergraduates or postgraduates
from top Japanese universities.
</P>
<P>
The 7,500-dollar fee is paid to the EU-Japan Center for
Industrial Cooperation, which is in charge of the program.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to foster closer relations between industrial
enterprises in EU countries and Japan, to improve mutual
understanding and encourage the globalization of the Japanese and
European economies.
</P>
<P>
The students are selected according to their academic record,
motivation and ability to adapt to new situations, and
according to companies' requirements.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Down 0.1 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Non-farm productivity in the
U.S. fell at an annual rate of 0.1 percent during the second
quarter of this year, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the decline was the first since it dropped
by a 1.1 percent in the final three months of 1995. Productivity
rose 1.8 percent from January through March. The rate was adjusted
for seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fourth-quarter drop, U.S. productivity rose 0.7
percent for all of 1995, up from 0.5 percent in 1994. But the gain
last year was less than one-third of the productivity growth rate
in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Productivity measures output per number of hours worked and is
considered a key to American's standard of living. Greater
efficiency means businesses can increase wages without raising
prices since workers are producing more with the same amount of
work.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that unit labor costs, typically two-thirds
of the cost of a product in the country, shot up 3.8 percent, more
than double the 1.5 percent gain in the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
Worker compensation, on the other hand, slipped 0.1 percent
after remaining unchanged during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Output jumped 4.2 percent during the second quarter, up from
2.7 percent in the first and the fastest pace since a 5 percent
rate in the third quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing productivity slowed during the April-June
quarter. It rose just 1.5 percent compared to a 5.6 percent jump
three months earlier for the smallest increase since the second
quarter of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Total business productivity, including farming, edged up 0.5
percent after increasing 2 percent earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts fear that the current tight labor market could lead to
increased wages that, without sufficient gains in productivity,
would be passed on to consumers as higher prices.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers will study the productivity
report with other recent data next week when they consider whether
to raise short-term interest rates to head off any spurt in
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Greece Refloats Turkish Flagship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek navy today refloated a
turkish frigate that ran aground inside Greek territorial waters
near the Aegean island of Kos last night, the Greek Navy General
Staff (NGS) announced.
</P>
<P>
The operation followed an agreement between the Greek and
Turkish navy general staffs.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that three tugboats were trying to
refloat the frigate "Yavuz", flagship of the turkish naval fleet
which ran aground in shallows in the Ammoglossa region, 400 yards
northeast of Kos. A Greek officer had boarded the frigate as
liaison and to coordinate the operation.
</P>
<P>
To monitor the situation, Greek Defense Minister Gerssimos
Arsenis flew back to Athens from holiday and talked early in the
morning by phone with Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos so as to coordinate the actions of the
two ministries.
</P>
<P>
The "Yavuz" was sailing in the straits between Kos and the
Asia minor coast, which has a width of 2.5 nautical miles at the
point the frigate ran aground. The captain opted to pass inside
Greek territorial waters under conditions of "safe passage", but
miscalculated the depth of the waters, which is 4 meters at that
spot where the ship ran aground.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis attributed the grounding to "faulty navigation".
</P>
<P>
"It appears to have been a mistake. We see no intent in this
event," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Experts Play Down Suspicion of Iran's link to Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials and security
experts have brushed off claims that Iran will soon be named as
the sponsor of the June 25 truck bombing in Saudi Arabia, the
Washington Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible on the basis of the evidence currently
available to draw any kind of sweeping conclusions as to who was
responsible," experts of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry hinted earlier this month
that Iran might be connected with the explosion at the air base,
near Dhahran, which killed 19 American troops, and he threatened
to take "strong action" once investigators in Saudi Arabia probing
into the explosion announced the findings of their searching. And
he said the results would come soon.
</P>
<P>
But the State Department contradicted his comment last week,
saying it was "not aware" of any progress in the bombing
investigation and the Saudis "have not come to any definitive
conclusions about who is responsible."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ma'ariv claimed that U.S. investigators had
identified the Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon as the
main suspect.
</P>
<P>
But analysts noted that such a finding was very convenient for
the new Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who is campaigning hard to demonize Iran in the eyes of the United
States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab diplomats suspect Netanyahu wants to stir up conflict
between Iran and the West to draw attention away from his
determination to freeze the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times revealed one of evidences that points
toward the possibility of Iran's involvement in the truck bombing.
</P>
<P>
It said a former Iranian intelligence officer told a
Farsi-language radio program in Los Angeles on the night of the
bombing that Iran had smuggled explosives into Saudi Arabia this
year.
</P>
<P>
It could serve as hypothesis, but could not lead directly to a
conclusion, observers say.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- France, the country with the U.N.
mandate of supervising a cease-fire between Eritrea and Yemen in
the Red Sea island of Habish, wants the U.N. secretary general to
intervene in the latest clashes on the island between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said
today that France "reserves its information to the U.N. secretary
general."
</P>
<P>
Troops of Eritrea and Yemen have clashed on the island recently
despite the commitment by the two countries to refrain from
military action until an arbitration is made on the sovereignty of
the island by the International Arbitration Tribune in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Both Eritrea and Yemen claim sovereignty over the island,
considered strategically important due to its position in the oil
transporting maritime thoroughfare of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that France can well carry out its
mission of supervision from a major military base it maintains in

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues as New Ceasefire Sought in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) - Fighting continued today in
Grozny despite a reported ceasefire reached Tuesday between
Russian troops and Chechen rebels, but local press reported new
contacts for a truce is underway.
</P>
<P>
Both sides blamed each other for violating ceasefire
first. Senior rebel commander Akhmed Zakayev said they were
observing a ceasefire. "We've had an order since 8 a.m. (0400 GMT)
to hold our fire and that is what we are doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels accused Russian troops of attacking a group of
refugees fleeing Chechnya's capital, saying many were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, a Russian general owed the failure of implementing the
oral agreement to the rebels' attack, saying that tensions still
remain in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Pulikovsky, acting commander of troops in
Chechnya, said "We have confirmed to each other that we would suspend
fire along the line of fighting to prevent people being killed,"
</P>
<P>
The commander told Itar-Tass Agency that three conditions were
agreed upon Tuesday when he met rebel chief-of-staff Aslan
Maskhadov -- holding fire whenever possible, not attacking
medical-aid vehicles and opening up humanitarian corridors to let
civilians leave safely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian news agencies said representatives of the
two sides had left their bases today for a new meeting to end more
than eight days of bitter conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian soldiers were killed and thousands of
refugees have been trying to flee Grozny since the rebels launched
their surprise attack in the city.
</P>
<P>
Zakayev said the operation was a desperate bid to pressure
Russian troops to end their intervention in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30,000 people have been killed since Moscow
sent troops in December, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Political Uncertainty Costs Jobs in Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian top officials have
complained that political uncertainty has led to a shortage of
investment in Canada's province of Quebec and its high
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
"I think all the experts agree that the level of political
uncertainty in Quebec is one of the determinants of the low level of
investments," Canadian Treasury Board President Marcel Masse told a
news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the city of Quebec with several other federal cabinet
ministers from the province, Masse was quoted by local media
reports as saying that the political uncertainty "eventually
produces losses of jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said the percentage of investments last year made in Canada
which came to Quebec was around 8.5 or 9 percent while the
population of Quebec makes up about one fourth of the population
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the uncertainty continues, I think that we have to
expect that investments in Quebec will be lower that they otherwise
would be," Masse said.
</P>
<P>
Endorsing Masse's view, Federal Intergovernmental Affairs
Minister Stephane Dion pointed out that "Any place in the world it
would be obvious that political uncertainty is not a help for
investment and the health of the economy, so it's the same here."
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada figures show that Quebec's jobless rate is now
12.4 percent. The province lost 35,000 jobs last month and 41,000 jobs
in June.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard has refused to recognize that the
political climate is a factor.

should be given to establishing a collective defense system and
prevent armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 in France Lack Social, Medical Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- About 500,000 people in France, or
1.5 percent of the French population 16-59 years old, lack social
and medical protection, said the Center of Research of Study and
Documentation in Economy and Health in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, polling 12,649 people 16-59 years old, also said
that 10.5 percent of the households in France are in "a socially
precarious situation" caused by unemployment, job insecurity,
lack of educational certificates, lack of social protection
coverage and insufficient incomes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people under social and economic hardships are
members of single parent families -- especially single mother
families, households with more than seven family members,
households of professionally unqualified workers, employees of
commercial stores, and personnel of the service sector, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"The social precariousness is the maximum for young adults,
followed by the group 45-49 years old," said the report, adding
that most of the poor are among the working class.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 9.2 percent of people in France have
health troubles, including being handicapped, suffering from
crippling diseases, and other physical and psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
The rate of the medical vulnerable -- people uncapable of
seeing a doctor -- is increasing at the same pace as the increase
of salaries, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that 10.9 percent of the unemployed and 12.3 percent
among professionally unqualified workers cannot afford to go to
hospital if they are ill.

ending his visits to India and the war-torn Afghanistan before
coming here.
</P>
<P>
Brown, head of Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South Asia,
said that during his visit in India, the Indian foreign secretary
had indicated that they were looking forward to resuming talks at
the foreign secretary's level.
</P>
<P>
"I hope India and Pakistan find new ways of working together
and cooperate even though there are serious issues which divide
them," said the senator.
</P>
<P>
It is the "sincere effort of the U.S." to encourage them to
develop closer relationship and look for areas where they can
agree, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
It is not for the U.S. to decide what the Kashmiri people or
India or Pakistan should do for the future of Kashmir, but it's
the task for the governments of the two countries to decide, said
the senator.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Afghanistan, Brown said that he met with
Taliban representatives in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
He said that the representatives had indicated that "they would
be willing to release the Russian captives in exchange for seven
Afghans held by the Russians."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senator was also taken to the Russian captives who, he
said, were in good health but were a little depressed.
</P>
<P>
"They asked me about the prospects of their release and I have
communicated the discussion with the captives to the officials of
the Russian embassy in Islamabad."
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, he said, he met with President Burhanuddin Rabbani
and his commander Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the initiatives by the Afghan government.
It is positive that they plan to expand the government and are
trying to reach out for the other factions and I am happy with the
truce reached with General Dostum."
</P>
<P>
Afghan government and its main rival in the north General
Rashid Dostum reached an agreement on ceasefire, which took effect
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Kabul, he went to Mazar-i-Sharif and had meeting
with General Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Brown said it was a "long long way from an agreement that will
bring peace to Afghanistan but what we are seeing is a sincere
effort to bring an end to the factional fighting."

<HEADLINE> Mandela Sends Birthday Greetings to Cuban Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today sent a happy birthday greeting to Cuban
president Fidel Castro, who turned 70 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, Mandela said for the government
and for himself personally, the occasion was a reminder of the
"selfless" efforts of the Cuban people under Castro's leadership
in support of the liberation of South Africa in particular and
southern Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
"Please be assured that you are in our thoughts as you
celebrate this important milestone in your life," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government had provided the African National Congress
(ANC) with "selfless support during its anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had also expressed, on several occasions, its gratitude
to Castro and the Cuban government and showed its solidarity with
Cuban people in the light of the decade-long economic embargo
imposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mandela also invited Castro, despite
pressure from some western countries, to pay a state visit to
South Africa later this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> France to Join Dismantling of U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- France will join the dismantling
of one of the largest military plutonium production site in the
United States, which will begin by October 1, said the COGEMA
(Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires) today.
</P>
<P>
"Some 20 of our engineers are already in Richmond (in
Washington State), the city nearest the site. The first meetings
with the 13,000 former staff of the site will begin," said Colette
Lewiner, president of SGN-Reseau Eurisys, an affiliate of COGEMA.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy has decided to dismantle and
clean up by 2,001 an area of 960 square kilometers in Hanford, 300
kilometers east of Seattle, where 73 tons of military plutonium
have been produced since 1944 to make nuclear bombs and nuclear
missiles for American troops.
</P>
<P>
The SGN will send 400 of its personnel to the site to
participate in the project with five American companies, estimated
at 5 billion U.S. dollars, by providing management and expertise
techniques and dismantling all alone the laboratory in the site.
</P>
<P>
The Hanford site is one of 25 nuclear production sites
belonging the the U.S. government, which is planning to dismantle
all of them with 230 billion dollars in 75 years.
</P>
<P>
The SGN has already joined the dismantling of the Chernobyl
nuclear center in Ukraine and the Sevmorpout ice-breaker fuel and
radiate reactors center of Russia.

<HEADLINE> UK's Healthy Nation Program Foiled by Heavy-Drinking, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavy-drinking women, school
children who smoke and the overweight of both sexes are ruining
Britain's drive to create a healthy nation.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 27 targets set by the Department of Health to
reduce premature death and avoidable sickness by promoting
sensible lifestyles look certain to be reached, according to an
official report.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office today reported limited progress in
achieving the aims of the Health of the Nation White Paper of
l992.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious strategy to reduce coronary heart disease,
strokes, cancer, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases and
accidents was introduced by Virginia Bottomley when she was health
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Teams from the National Health Service formulated "action
plans" to improve education, screening and preventive techniques.
Healthy targets were set to be reached by dates between 1994 and
2005.
</P>
<P>
But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the
comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior
is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women,
drinking by women and smoking by the young.
</P>
<P>
The British government set targets on obesity because it
increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease, strokes and
illnesses including diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The government wants only 8 percent of women and 6 percent of
men, aged 16 to 64, to be overweight by 2005: the same proportion
as in 1980. But instead figures since then have risen to 16
percent of women and 13 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol targets were set because too much drink raises the
blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke, and is blamed for
liver cirrhosis, cancers and road traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on
cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public
to change lifestyles, following government health education.

<HEADLINE> German Volkswagen Doubles Profit in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- German Volkswagenwerk AG, announced
today that its net profit was 282 million marks (188.94 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, more than double of
the 113 million marks (75.71 million dollars) profit in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company, the biggest car maker in Europe, said its sales in
the first half were 50.5 billion marks (33.84 billion dollars) as
compared to 44.5 billion marks (29.82 billion dollars) in the same
period of last year. Pre-tax profit increased to 891 million marks
(596.97 dollars) from 616 million marks (412.7 million dollars) in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company's board of directors attributed the profit rise to
the increase of car sales, in foreign markets especially.
</P>
<P>
Driven by growing demands, production in Portugal and Asia had
risen 11.7 percent to 2.04 million units since the beginning of
this year. At the same time, domestic production only climbed 1.2
percent, to nearly 830,000 units.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with production, sales in western Europe and the
United States rose 17.1 and 15.7 percent respectively while
domestic sales were only up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagenwerk AG registered 88.1 billion marks (59.03 billion
dollars) of sales last year. The company said higher sales were
expected this year.

<HEADLINE> French PM Denies Deflation, Reaffirms Aim of Joining EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today denied that the French economy is suffering from a deflation
and called on the nation to strictly follow the austerity budget
for 1997 to meet the criteria of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
After Juppe denied the rumored conflict over monetary policies
between the government and the central bank, the franc, which has
been falling against the mark in recent weeks, began to rise.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent fluctuation of franc as only "a
tempest in a cup", he said the government is carrying on a
"stable and constant" policy of maintaining a stable franc in
preparation for the EMU to come into force by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Juppe denied any conflict between the government and the Bank
of France, presided by Jean-Claude Trichet, over monetary policies
such as interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The franc kept falling against the German mark in the past few
weeks over rumors about the fate of Trichet, who was indirectly
blamed by President Jacques Chirac for failing to stop the
disastrous financial policy of the bank of Credit Lyonnais when he
served as Director of the Treasury in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of new strikes by public employees in protest
against lay-off plans set by the 1997 budget, and doubt over
French government's capability to cut public spending and reduce
deficit, further prompted speculators to sell the franc at market.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 0.2-0.3 percent fall in consumption prices in July
and the recent fluctuation of franc against German mark, French
economy as a whole is good, Juppe told the press here.
</P>
<P>
The French government adopted an austerity budget for 1997 by
freezing the spendings to the level of 1996, which was about 1,552
billion francs (310 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A public deficit of less than 3 percent of the Gross National
Product is required for accession to the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that it is in the interest of France to observe the
EU rules and join the monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Strives to Halt Spread of Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- An epidemic cholera in
northern Mongolia has so far killed six and infected 48 others
while another 853 have shown suspect symptoms since its outbreak,
Mongolian officials told Xinhua tonight.
</P>
<P>
Since the first cholera sufferer was found in remote Khoetol
county in northern Selenge province which borders Russia, the
epidemic has spread to Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator and some
areas near Khoetol.
</P>
<P>
To halt the spread and cure the infected, more than 600 medical
workers have been sent to infected areas by the special state
commission.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, the Mongolian government ordered government
officials in all levels and civil defence troops in the five
provinces of Central Aimak, Selenge, Bulgan, Darhan-Uul and Orhon
to be on the high alert. The governors were directed to take
precautions against the spread of cholera.
</P>
<P>
In Ulan Bator, the infected and those suspected are being
quarantined. The ambulances in the city's emergency center are on
standby 24 hours. The biggest open market in the city and some
vendor's stands have closed. Vehicles and pedestrians have denied
admission to main infected areas.
</P>
<P>
The special state commission has modified the domestic
transportation. International passenger trains via Mongolia will
not stop at any station to the north of Ulan Bator and airlines
special for tourists will not fly to the areas declared on the
alert.

<HEADLINE> Museum on Ho Chi Minh Trail to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A museum on the legendary
2,000-kilometer-long Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam war will
be built with the approval of Vietnam's defense ministry, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The museum is to be erected at a commune of Ha Tay province,
about 15 kilometers west of Hanoi, where most of the liberation
army units during the war were stationed before southward
operations along the Ho Chi Minh trail or Truong Son road.
</P>
<P>
The museum will serve as a center to study the history of the
Truong Son Army Unit and a tourist spot in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
As planned, the museum will have large-sized sections to house
paintings, reliefs and exhibits on the trail. It will also include
a huge model of the Truong Son Mountain and the trail.
</P>
<P>
The construction is due to begin in this October and will be
completed in late 1999 on the 40th anniversary of the Truong Son
Army Unit.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh trail was a strategic supply route between the
the rear area in the north and the front line in the south of
Vietnam during the anti-U.S.war which ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
It was first opened in early 1960 by a group of military
divisions known as Group 559 or the Truong Son Army Unit.
</P>
<P>
The trail runs zig-zag on both the eastern and western sides of
the Truong Son Mountain serving as a natural border between
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Organization Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, arrived here this
afternoon and held hour-long talks with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi on sanctions imposed on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The talks between President Moi and OAU chief were behind the
closed door.
</P>

Briefing reporters at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
before heading to meet President Moi at State House, Salim Ahmed
Salim reaffirmed the OAU decision not to recognize Burundi's

<P>
However, the OAU chief urged Buyoya to enter dialogue with the
other contending parties as a way of finding a solution to the
Burundi problem.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions were imposed on Burundi by regional
countries soon after Major Pierre Buyoya took power from Hutu
President Silvester Ntibantunganya in late July.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also asked the regional leaders to ensure that
humanitarian concerns expressed by the international community

<HEADLINE> Massacre Survivors Demand Compensation from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese survivors of the
1932 Pingdingshan Massacre filed a lawsuit against the Japanese
government today in Tokyo demanding compensation of 20 million yen
(about 200,000 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The three are Fang Surong, 68, from Kunming, Yunnan Province,
Mu Desheng, 71, and Yang Baoshan, 73, from Fushun, Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs have accused the then Japanese government of
violating international law by killing civilians in wartime. They
are demanding that the current government compensate them for
their suffering.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Chinese civilians were killed by the Japanese army
in one day in Pingdingshan in central Henan province in 1932.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese army invaded north east China in 1931 and from
there launched an invasion into other parts of China. The Japanese
were driven out of China in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The head of a team of Japanese lawyers acting for the Chinese
told reporters that the massacre is little known in Japan because
the government has been withholding facts regarding Japan's
wartime atrocities, including the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which
300,000 people were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said it is now time to prove the state's
responsibility for these atrocities through the courts.

TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two people died, two were missing
and 46 were injured after a powerful typhoon swept over the island
of Honshu this evening after crossing the southern island of
Kyushu, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon, the season's twelfth originating in the Pacific,
drenched Kyushu and Yamaguchi prefectures in western Japan with
heavy rains and caused waves up to nine meters as it packed winds
of up to 210 kilometers per hour, Kyodo News Agency said, quoting
the Meteorological Agency.
</P>

The storm caused havoc with transport in western Japan, forcing
the cancellation of 478 flights affecting some 72,700 passengers
and the suspension of 52 trains on the Sanyo Shinkansen line
between Hakata and Shin-Osaka, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon left some 300 houses flooded in Fukuoka, Nagasaki
and Kagoshima prefectures on Kyushu island, caused temporary power
cuts in 200,000 households and paralyzed 8,000 telephone lines, it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 organizations of
Chinese students, scholars, firms and other overseas Chinese today
denounced NBC's hostile comments against international athletes,
including Team China, at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
They also requested the U.S. TV company and its commentator to
publicly apologize for the comments.
</P>
<P>
In an ads published by The Washington Post today, the
organizations congratulated the Chinese team for its progress of
16 golds, 22 silvers and 12 bronzes at the Olympics held on July
19-August 4.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said, "NBC commentator Mr. Bob Costas'
hostile comments against many international athletes, including
Team China, had badly contaminated the spirit of the Olympics
and deeply offended countless viewers worldwide."
</P>
<P>
They asked the U.S. TV company and its commentator to give
their apologies for their unacceptable comments.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Costas and NBC should have the courage to publicly
apologize for their ignominious prejudice and inhospitality."
</P>
<P>
NBC, in its program on the opening ceremony for the Olympics,
commented on China that "there are problems with human rights,
copyright disputes, the threat posed to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
It also said in commenting on Chinese athletes that there were
"suspicious especially concerning their track athletes and their
female swimmers possibly using performance-enhancing drugs."
</P>
<P>
The comments ignited protests from overseas Chinese students,
scholars, and many other overseas Chinese in the United States and
the world over. Many of them wrote letters to NBC, criticizing the
TV company's action and demanded a public apology for the
comments.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Rejects Yemeni Accusation as Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government
today rejected Yemeni accusation of "violating the agreement of
principles signed between the two sides on May 21, 1996 by
engaging in illegal military movements" as "groundless".
</P>
<P>
A press release issued today by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry,
said "the government of Eritrea has consistently sought to
resolve its dispute with Yemen peacefully and through legal
means."
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean government also notes that substantial progress
has been made in the several sessions held so far in Paris to
negotiate an arbitration agreement", the release said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the release continued, "there is no conceivable
reason why the government of Eritrea would resort to illegal acts
of any sort to undermine the arbitration process that it has
earnestly pursued".
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that such accusations can only be
calculated to increase tension between the parties and to disrupt
the substantial progress already made.
</P>
<P>
The government of eritrea reiterated in the release its
commitment under the May 21 agreement to settle its dispute with
Yemen on territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation through
peaceful, legal means. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Meet Manuel over "Racist Remarks" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
would meet Finance Minister Trevor Manuel over alleged racist
remarks he made during a rugby match in Cape Town at the weekend,
presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Mankahlana said no
definite arrangement had been made although the president would
find time to hold "amicable discussion" with Manuel about his
behavior which had sparked a public row.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend rugby test at Newlands in Cape Town, the
South Africa's +Springbok+ was defeated by 18-29 by New Zealand's
+All Blacks+.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is a staunch supporter of the Springbok, while Manuel,
a colored, was reportedly to be vociferous in his support for the
All Blacks.
</P>
<P>
According to a Springbok fan who shared a VIP box with the
finance minister, Manuel was asked: +as a South African, why are
you not supporting the Springboks?+
</P>
<P>
Manuel replied that he was not a white South African and that
made the difference.
</P>
<P>
Manuel's remarks had been reportedly brought into question the
minister's commitment toward government's reconciliation policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana said: +President Mandela has no doubt of
Mr. Manuel's commitment to national reconciliation and
nation-building. His record as a fighter for freedom and
democracy speaks for itself.+
</P>
<P>
+Our understanding is that it (Manuel's support for the New
Zealanders) is a very personal gripe,+ said Mankahlana, adding
that the finance minister was a very good rugby player in his
youth, but he could not become a member of the Springbok because
of the apartheid.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition National Party (NP) and Democratic
Party (DP) labelled Manuel's remarks as racist and insensitive.
</P>
<P>
Manuel, as a public figure in the important position of
finance minister, was obliged to act extremely correctly at all
times, but his actions had been disloyal to the Springbok and the
country, NP spokesman Nick Koornhof said.
</P>
<P>
While DP spokesman Mike Ellis said Manuel had made the most
provocative and mindless comment of the year, saying this could
create the impression overseas that South Africa remains a
racist, divided country with all the conflict of the past still
rooted in place.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Deplores Clashes in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali "deplores the violent
clashes that took place in the United Nations buffer zone in
Cyprus last Sunday and again today," a U.N. spokeswoman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that the secretary-general was
greatly concerned at the excessive and indiscriminate use of
force, which had caused two men to be killed and many more to be
injured, including United Nations peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Security forces in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus opened
fire on Greek Cypriot protesters when the latter rushed Greek
Cypriot police lines and breached an area of the buffer zone in
eastern Cyprus after a nearby funeral of a Greek who was beaten to
death Sunday. One demonstrator was killed and several were injured
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
During the incident Sunday, a Greek youth named Tasos Isaac was
killed and more than 50 were wounded on both sides when hundreds
of Greek Cypriots pushed across the U.N.-policed zone.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations secretary-general appealed to the leaders of
the two communities in the island to calm tempers and to resolve
their differences through dialogue and negotiation, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu today held talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni on regional situation and bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
In his brief remarks before the talks, Bizimungu stressed the
ancient and natural links between Uganda and Rwanda which he said
can be exploited today to benefit the peoples of the two sister
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president arrived here this morning for a four-day
state visit to Uganda. He said his presence in Uganda with his
delegation has opened up a new platform that will help Rwanda to
learn from Uganda's experience in governance and management of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
As Rwanda has close links geographically and regionally with
east African countries, Bizimungu said he wants to exploit these
links for the benefit of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda has managed to bring down inflation from 55 to
15 percent in recent years and that the government is trying to
put into place other measures of economic management necessary
for further cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Museveni said the people of Rwanda and Uganda
have close cultural and geographical links which are easy to
exploit in modern times for the economic benefit of the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries together make up a wide market which
can be used to enhance economic development and advancement in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Since Rwanda and Uganda have now solved the question of
leadership, they can work together to tap the economic potential
abundant in the region, Museveni noted.
</P>
<P>
he expressed satisfaction with the good network of road and
telecommunication within Rwanda which he said can be used to
develop the region.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to expand the infrastructure between the two
countries if the two governments work together, he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda last week joined Tanzania and Kenya in imposing
economic sanctions against Burundi where a coup ousted the
legitimate government and installed a military regime.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda joined in the embargo later. So the two sides are
expected to discuss the situation in the central African state.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Opposition CUF Ready to Talk With Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- An official of the
opposition Civic United Front (CUF) today said that the CUF was
ready to hold talks with the rulling Revolutionary Party (CCM) to
end the political crisis in the isles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, CUF Secretary
General Shaban Khamis Mloo said the CUF believed that the CCM
would also agree to hold talks with the CUF.
</P>
<P>
He said the CUF made the decision after having discussed with
Commonwealth Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku, who adviced
the CUF to do so.
</P>
<P>
Mloo said, Anyaoku urged the rulling and opposition parties to
solve their differences amicably.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the situation in Zanzibar because it
implies that the multi-party democracy is not normal there. The
two parties should agree to iron out the differenceis together,"
said Anyaoku, who is here for an investigation tour of the
general elections held last October in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
"Because the first step has been reached by establishing that
there is a problem in Zanzibar, CUF believes that efforts by the
Commonwealth may succeed in tackling the problem in the Isles,"
Mloo said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Commonwealh for its efforts aimed at finding
solutions to differences existing between the opposition and the
ruling party in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Amour won the isles' presidency in last October prisidential
election with a slender margin. The CUF maintains that Amour
rigged the votes to win, a reason cited by the CUF for not
recognising him as Zanzibar President. enditem

<HEADLINE> Canada to Host Arctic Council Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
today that the eight Arctic states have agreed to a Declaration on
the Establishment of an Arctic Council, whose inauguration will be
held here on September 19.
</P>
<P>
The eight Arctic states are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The creation of an Arctic Council composed of the eight Arctic
states was proposed formally by the Canadian government in 1989,
although the concept dates back at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, officials of the eight Arctic countries began
extensive discussions regarding the structure, objectives and
programs of the proposed council.
</P>
<P>
At their last meeting here last week, the Arctic countries'
Senior Arctic Officials finalized the text of the Declaration on
the Establishment of the Arctic Council for ministerial approval.
</P>
<P>
The council will be established as a high-level permanent
intergovernmental forum to provide for cooperation, coordination
and interaction among the Arctic states, the Arctic indigenous
communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues,
such as environmental protection, economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"The council represents the culmination of many years' work to
create a high-level international forum dedicated to the broad
issues of concern to this vital region," said Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The council, which will operate on the basis of consensus of
its members, will meet at the ministerial level biennually,
according to a news release from the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
The Chair and Secretariat of the Council will rotate
concurrently every two years among the eight Arctic states,
beginning with Canada in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main activities of the council will focus on the existing
programs established under the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy and a new sustainable development program dealing with
economic, social and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
The September inauguration ceremony will feature the signing of
the Arctic Council Declaration, which has been negotiated over the
last year.

<HEADLINE> US Business Inventories Increase Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Business inventories in the
U.S. increased by 0.1 percent in June as sales slipped in the
month, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that business inventories totaled a
seasonally adjusted 997.5 billion dollars, up from 997 billion in
May when stockpiles shrank by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase of business inventories resulted from a decline in
business sales in the month, when the sales dropped by 0.5
percent, the first decline in five months.
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled 711.5 billion dollars in June, down from 715.1
billion a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say businesses are rebuilding inventories after
cutting back on stockpiles last winter because of an
overaccumulation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said the inventory-to-sales ratio in June rose to
1.40, from 1.39 a month earlier. That meant it would take 1.40
months to exhaust stockpiles at the June sales rate.
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. business inventories was due to a 0.2
percent gain at the retail level. Manufacturers and wholesalers
kept their inventories unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sales at the retail level fell 0.5 percent in June although the
government said Tuesday they managed a 0.1 percent advance in
July. Manufacturers' sales were off 1 percent in June but up 0.3
percent on the wholesale level.

<P>
During the talks, Wu said China urged maintenance of peace and
stability in the Balkan region and appreciates Yugoslavia's policy
of peace and independence.

Speaker of the Yugoslav parliament's Chamber of Republics Milos
Radulovic, in a separate talk with Wu today, said China's stance
towards the crisis in former Yugoslavia testified to the lasting
character of "friendship between the two countries which will
continue in the future."
</P>
<P>
"China always appreciated our contribution to establishing
peace and urged that efforts invested by our country be adequately
valued in international forums," Radulovic said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China would continue in the future to oppose in the
Security Council the implementation of economic sanctions against
Yugoslavia and to insist on observing the principles of equality
of all countries.
</P>
<P>
Radulovic announced that a Yugoslav inter-parliamentary
delegation would take part in the 96th conference of the

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Be "Island Within Europe": MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain is so out of touch with
the rest of Europe that the country faces isolation in Europe,
says a report of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
The British government has underestimated how much the other
European Union (EU) member states want stronger EU political
integration, the BBC television quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report on the Intergovernmental Conference issued a stark
warning that Germany and France are expected to join the single
European currency in 1999 despite Britain's strong reservation on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
A Committee source is quoted as saying earlier: "The Germans
and the French are determined to push ahead with the 1999
time-table of the European Monetary Union (EMU). We draw the
attention to the fact the legislation would have to be put before
Parliament in early 1997 if Britain wants to join the first wave
of the EMU."
</P>
<P>
The report, which was agreed unanimously by 11 Tory and Labor
members, aims to pressure the party leaders into taking a quick
decision on EMU before the general election, which is to be held
next May.
</P>
<P>
The MPs also highlighted strong pressure for the British
government to give up its opt-out policy from the Social Chapter
on workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The Committee stressed in the report that Britain can not rely
on its EU partners and must stand up for its national interest.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion is that we are on our own and optimistic
expectations that we can find alliances with the French and
Germans are erroneous," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Sets Federal Election Date for Nov. 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
signed today a decision under which elections for the lower house
of the Federal parliament, the Chamber of Citizens, will be held
on November 3.
</P>
<P>
The assemblies of Yugoslavia's two republics, Serbia and
Montenegro, are to elect the members of the Federal parliament's
Upper House, the Chamber of the Republics, within 30 days from the
Federal elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision signed by Lilic specifies that the election
campaign begins on August 15.
</P>
<P>
The last Federal elections in Yugoslavia were held on December
20, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said in a broadcast statement that he had set the Federal
elections for the same date on which elections for the Montenegro
legislature would be held, considering the solution to be most
rational in terms of the elections' cost and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had also taken into consideration the
weather conditions since it had been shown in the past that winter
weather prevented a significant percentage of voters from
exercising their rights.
</P>
<P>
"I was especially guided by the need to give enough time to all
parties and individuals...to present their election programs,"
Lilic added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: TAZARA Improves Services in Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao and Du Zhenfeng)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA) is making efforts to improve its services to
challenge stiff competition in transportation in the sub-region
of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 1,860-kilometer railway played a historic role in
frustrating the economic blocade against Zambia by racists and in
promoting economic development in the two countries as well as
boosting regional trade during a long period after it was put
into operation in 1976.
</P>
<P>
However, with the new political and economic developments in
southern Africa in recent years, TAZARA has been facing stiff
competition from other transport routes and the seaports of South
Africa and other countries to the south.
</P>
<P>
TAZARa provided to landlocked Zambia a vital transport route
to Tanzania's Dar Es Salaam port. Initially, it handled all
Zambia's freight. But the gradual re-opening of the southern
routes in the past decade, Zambia's dependency on Dar es Salaam
Port has reduced as a result Zambia's increased usage of the
ports to its south.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of Zambia's copper production in recent years has
also led to the drop in the volume of cargo handled by TAZARA,
which used to transport about 70 percent of Zambia's metal
exports.
</P>
<P>
In the past three or four years, the volume of cargo handled
by TAZARA is estimated to have decreased by nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge, the railway has taken a series of
measures. It has done away with quoting clients on the basis of
the already laid down tariffs and is preferring to negotiate
rates with customers.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA is offering clients a complete package from the source
to the port and vice-versa at negotiated rates.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA is also striving to shorten transit time of goods en
route to or from the harbor from as long as 10 days in the past
to four days.
</P>
<P>
Apart from passenger trains, TAZARA has earmarked business of
transportation of metals to the markets.
</P>
<P>
To monitor the progress of trains throughout the railway
system, TAZARA has installed a computerized rail tracker system
to enable the clients pinpoint the exact location of a particular
consignment at any given time.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that once the system is in full operation, the
clients can monitor the progress of their cargo by linking
directly to the TAZARA computer system.
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the improved services, the volume of cargo handled
by TAZARA is on the upswing. The latest statistics show that in
the past year it transported 640,000 tons of goods compared to
just a little more than 500,000 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any reason to be pessimistic. We are
exploring other markets in Zaire and Malawi apart from the
Zamiban one," TAZARA Deputy Management Director Emest Mulokozi
recently said.

<HEADLINE> Steady Increase Expected For Savings Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The control of inflation in
China has contributed heavily to steady growth in bank deposits,
which are expected to rise steadily for the rest of 1996, reports
Beijing's daily newspaper China Securities.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index in the January-June period rose only
7.1 percent over the same period last year, and the nation's
target of 10 percent is already within reach.
</P>
<P>
The state removed anti-inflation subsidies on long- and
mid-term deposits in April and reduced the interest rate in May,
but bank saving remained the main choice of urban and rural
residents in May.
</P>
<P>
The report said, however, that there are still a number of
factors which might trigger a decline in individual savings
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Incomes of residents, though still on the rise, have slowed
down. The success in curbing inflation may bring about further
cuts in the interest rate.

<HEADLINE> Solar Energy Heats up Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Schoolchildren in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been given a practical
lesson in solar energy.
</P>
<P>
For the pupils from Hexigten Banner, winter months meant
cancelled classes because the cold was too unbearable.
</P>
<P>
They have been rescued from the big freeze by the power of the
sun. Nearly 10,000 square meters of classrooms with solar energy
heating system have been built, saving students from the cold.
</P>
<P>
The banner has become a model area in the region in the
development of solar energy. It has vowed to install solar heaters
in all classrooms in the rural or pastoral areas within five years.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy has been widely applied in the life of farmers and
herdsmen in all parts of the region. So far, 4.42 million square
meters of residences for human beings and shelters for domestic
animals have been built, according to the regional new energy
office.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy is even used in the area 49 degrees north
latitude, it said.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has plenty of solar energy potential, with each
square meter of space receiving energy up to 1,779 kilowatt hours
annually, second only to Tibet in China.
</P>
<P>
Abag Banner has built nearly 4,200 square meters of houses
heated by solar energy since 1986. Temperatures are as low as 44.2
degrees below zero centigrade, but temperatures inside the
herdsmen's houses stand above 15 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that solar energy houses are undoubtedly the best
choice to help migrating herdsmen to settle down.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy is also used to raise domestic animals. Bairin
Right Banner has built 700,000 square meters of shelters for
domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
It is calculated that by introducing solar energy, income from
raising each cattle can increase 500 yuan (about 60 US dollars),
while income of raising each sheep or goat can increase 100 yuan.

URUMQI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese tourist, who suffered
from altitude stress on a snow-covered mountain in west China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is now recovering in a hospital
here from being in a coma for several days.
</P>
<P>
Noriko Sanada, a woman in her late forties, left the
region's capital city for a venture into the Tibetan highlands with
an international sports tour group on July 26.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, when she arrived at Shiquan River, which is 4,700
meters above sea level, Sanada was stricken by serious altitude
stress, which then caused cerebral oedema and renal
deficiency. She was sent to a small hospital in the area and
urgently needed to be treated in a more well-equipped hospital.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, a helicopter was sent from the Military Area
Command of Xinjiang with medical staff from the International SOS
Company on board to take the woman, then already in a coma, to Urumqi
General Army Hospital.
</P>
<P>
After three days of a difficult flight through hailstones, snow
and rain, the air crew yesterday successfully took the woman to
the hospital, which is more than 5,000 kilometers away. She was
brought out of danger after emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
Other members in the tour group are all in good health and will
continue their trip to Lhasa and Chengdu, capital cities of the

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Set Up Border Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed to
set up a border monitoring system to keep a better record of human
flow between the two countries, according to Nepali Foreign
Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, who just came back from a three-day official visit to
India Wednesday, said India has realized that it is necessary to
monitor the cross-border movement as problems have emerged in its
nearly 1,000-kilometer open border with Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Such problems include rampant trafficking in Nepali women to
India for prostitution and commodity smuggling to take advantage
of the price differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to India, Lohani met with Indian Prime
Minister Deve Gowda, Foreign Minister I. K. Gujral and other top
officials.
</P>
<P>
Lohani's visit focused on trade and economic issues, but he
also raised other issues such as the 1950 Nepal-India Friendship
Treaty and the problem of Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to Lohani, India has agreed to review the 1950 treaty
by holding bilateral dialogue at appropriate levels.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been asking India to review the 1950 treaty, which
Nepal considers to be outdated.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, the
Nepali foreign minister reiterated that India should take the
initiative to solve the problem because the refugees came to Nepal
via the Indian territory.

<HEADLINE> Czech Trade deficit With EU Rises Abruptly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's trade
deficit with the European Union (EU) has been rising quickly in
recent years, the Industry and Trade Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit soared abruptly to 63 billion korun (2.33 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, from 18 billion (670 million dollars) in
1994, said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The figure was only six billion korun (about 220 million
dollars) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was expected to continue to climb this year, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the deficit was mainly due to lack of
competitiveness of Czech products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic had become a major trade partner of the EU.
It was understood that 56 percent of its imports were from the EU
and 54 percent of its exports went the the 15-nation union in
1995.

BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province signed-up a record 20,000 mobile phone users last month.
</P>
<P>
And more than 63,000 people acquired beepers in July,
"People's Post and Telecommunications Journal" reports.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to the province issuing a series of new
measures to cut the price of communications products and upgrade
services for subscribers.

<P>
Both growth rates for users of mobile phones and beepers in
July rose more than 41 percent compared with monthly rate for the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to build Ho Chi Minh Trail Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A museum on the legendary
2000-kilometer-long Ho Chi Minh trail will be built with the
approval of Vietnam's Defense Ministry, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh trail or Truong Son road was known as a
strategic supply route between the north (the rear) and the south
(the front) during the 1954-75 Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
The trail, first opened in early 1960 by the Truong Son Army
unit, ensured sufficient manpower and logistic supplies from the
north to the south during the anti-U.S. war.
</P>
<P>
The trail runs zig-zag on both eastern and western sides of the
Truong Son mountain range which serves as a natural border between
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The museum will be erected at a commune of Ha Tay province,
about 15 kilometers west of Hanoi, where most of the liberation
army units were stationed before southward operations along the
trail.
</P>
<P>
The place will become a centre for studying history of the
Truong Son army unit and the trail as well as a tourist and
cultural destination of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The museum is planned to have large space for paintings,
reliefs and other exhibits, including a huge model of the Truong
Son mountain and the trail.
</P>
<P>
Work on construction of the museum is due to begin in October
this year and will be completed in late 1999 on the 40th
anniversary of the Truong Son army unit.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks Face Mounting Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's commercial banks are
facing mounting debts from overdue credit loan payments, totaling
2,112 billion dong (about 20 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of
July, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents a 29 percent rise, or 480 billion dong
(about 4.57 billion dollars), over last year, the English-language
"Vietnam News" newspaper quoted a state bank report as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the overdue payments are short-term credit
loans, and 7 percent are medium or long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
While the emergence of the credit fund system is seen as a
positive development in the banking system in line with economic
renovation, it is faltering because credit fund regulations are
not being followed in the granting of loans.
</P>
<P>
Many borrowers, who have neither business licenses nor
sufficient legal mortgage documents to qualify themselves for the
loans, are granted the loans, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are no supporting laws, particularly laws
covering bankruptcy procedures, for the system to work
efficiently, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said if debtors cannot pay back their credit loans,
there's no legal office responsible to sell confiscated real
estate or assets so the bank can recover its money.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the government to create a compatible legal
environment for business, and credit operations in particular,
involving a sub-law for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
There is also a need to tighten the enforcement of accounting
procedures to ensure that auditing procedures are efficiently
followed, the Vietnam News noted.
</P>
<P>
The lack of adequate relevant ownership and commercial laws
means debtors can declare themselves insolvent and escape repaying
their mounting debts, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Calls for Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam has called for peaceful and practical means to settle
the pending issues on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the call in his speech delivered here today at a
meeting marking the 51st anniversary of national liberation from
the colonial rule of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 to its
World War II defeat in 1945. Following Japan's defeat, the
peninsula was divided into South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
President Kim said that "peace and cooperation" were the
cardinal factors for improving relations between South Korea and
the DPRK and for achieving "unification and prosperity".
</P>
<P>
As a basic stance toward achieving peace and inter-Korean
economic cooperation, Kim said that "first of all" was the need
for stability in North Korea (DPRK)." He said: "It would be
undesirable for the difficulties North Korea is now confronted
with to develop into a situation affecting the stability there.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see North Korea isolated and we will not
seek a unilateral unification," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula issues should be "resolved through
peaceful and practical means in accordance with agreements reached
between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
On the food problem in the DPRK, Kim expressed readiness to
help the DPRK if Pyongyang accepted the proposal of four-party
peace talks on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by Kim and U.S. President Bill Clinton last
April, calls for a meeting involving South Korea, the DPRK, China
and the U.S. to establish a permanent peace regime on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the four-party talks agenda included the
establishment of a peace regime replacing the armistice agreement
that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War. Ways to establish military
trust and inter-Korean economic cooperation from the perspective
of easing tensions between the two sides on the Korean Peninsula
would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Turning to inter-Korean cooperation, Kim said that South Korea
was prepared to invest in the Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic and
Trade Zone in the DPRK, to supply needed materials to the DPRK
through expanded inter-Korean trade and to allow South Korean
tourists to visit the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Nominate Dole Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, United States, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Robert Dole,
former Senate Majority leader, today was nominated at the
Republican National Convention its presidential candidate for the
November election.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Kansan is one of the country's leading
political figures. Dole had been chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, member of the House of Representatives, chairman of the
Republican Party, a state legislator and a county attorney.
</P>
<P>
He was named chairman of the Republican National Committee in
1971.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Dole was elected Senate Majority leader and retired on
June 11, 1996, in order to campaign full-time. He was the
longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history.
</P>
<P>
Dole is noted for his ability in consensus-building and
attaching importance to deficit reduction and economic growth, as
well as his mastery of foreign affairs, according to Republican
National Convention sources.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Dole was a platoon leader in the 10th
Mountain Division in Italy. He was wounded on the battlefield in
1945 and twice decorated.
</P>
<P>
Dole has put forward his plan for tax-cuts and economic growth
as his campaign theme. The plan calls for, among other measures,
a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a balanced
budget by the year 2002, tax relief and fundamental tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
The plan says currently the economic growth is anemic, incomes
and wages are stagnant, and workers understandably feel more and
more anxious about the future.
</P>
<P>
It says growth must be the central goal of U.S. economic
policy. "Economic growth -- and the rising living standards and
prosperity it creates for all Americans -- should be the standard
by which all economic policies are judged."
</P>
<P>
Dole's plan has become the focus of the ongoing Republican
National Convention in southern California.
</P>
<P>
Dole is scheduled to make an acceptance speech for his
nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jack Kemp was nominated Republican vice-president
candidate. Kemp, 61, was former secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the Cabinet, Kemp had been a member
of the U.S. House of Representatives for 18 years. Kemp also
served for eight years in the Republican leadership as chairman of
the House Republican Leadership Conference.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Militarism Still Haunts Japan? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More than half a century has
passed since the end of World War II, but the ghost of militarism
still haunts Japan.
</P>
<P>
While Seisuke Okuno's words denying the Japanese government's
responsibility for the forceful recruitment of sex slaves from
other Asian countries during the war still echo in our ears,
Ryutaro Hashimoto, in the capacity of prime minister, paid homage
to the Yasukuni Shrine on July 29.
</P>
<P>
His visit to the Tokyo-based Shinto shrine, where memorial
services are held for Japan's war dead, including seven class-A
war criminals executed at the end of World War II, has triggered
strong indignation from other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for fear of threats from right-wing groups, an
exhibition of atrocities Japan committed during World War II was
forced to be cancelled in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
As August 15, the day marking Japan's defeat in the war,
arrives, an old farce to revive militarism in Japan is staged
again.
</P>
<P>
People just wonder why the spirit of militarism keeps haunting
Japan.
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, seven Japanese class-A war
criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, were
executed, but a large number of other key Japanese militarists
also held responsible for launching the war of aggression were
spared by the cold war policy of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, many war criminals were released from prison by
the U.S. or under U.S. mediation without making serious
introspection over their war crimes and without eliminating
thoughts of militarism from their minds.
</P>
<P>
With the support of financial groups and right-wing forces,
many of them returned to the political arena and grabbed important
posts in the government. Nobusuke Kishi, one of the top war
criminals, even became Japan's prime minister in 1957.
</P>
<P>
They clinched militarism, and produced negative impacts on the
Japanese society. As a result, Japan's role in World War II is
still a matter for debate in the country.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Germany, which was also a war-time fascist nation,
has adopted an unequivocal attitude toward the atrocities it
committed during the war, an attitude entirely different from that
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the then Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt in
front of a monument honoring the Jewish victims of the Warsaw
ghetto as an expression of remorse. His act won worldwide acclaim.
</P>
<P>
Germany adopted a policy of demilitarization and
de-Nazification after it surrendered in 1945.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, war criminals and those who collaborated with the
Nazi government have faced great pressure from the government and
society. Stories of investigating and punishing war criminals
still appear in newspapers from time to time.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the Germans have come to know the crimes committed
by the fascists and realized the severe consequences, from which
they draw lessons. As a result, the forces to revive Nazism have
declined, and those praising the fascist war of aggression can
hardly find a foothold in the country.
</P>
<P>
After Japan rose as an economic power, rightist thinking began
to overflow again and ethnic chauvinism gradually found its way
back.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few people in the Japanese government have been flexing
their country's economic muscle by boasting about its economic
achievements and advocating that Japan should naturally become a
political power with its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Alluring and seditious slogans like this made some Japanese
tend to turn a blind eye to Japan's history of aggression and as a
result, to the enormous atrocities the Japanese army inflicted on
the people of other Asian nations in World War II.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a handful of politicians in the Japanese
government have never stopped their efforts to cover Japan's war
crimes, through the revision of textbooks and speeches to the
media.
</P>
<P>
By emphasizing only the nuclear strikes Japan received in the
war, they mixed the cause and effect of the war and obscured the
demarcation line between victims and criminals.
</P>
<P>
These people harbor a strong sense of national superiority.
They are closer and closer to the belief that other Asian nations
are no match for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sense of "superpower" is swelling in the minds
of some ordinary Japanese. Phrases such as "economic power,"
"scientific and technological power," "security power" and "power
of public health" overfill Japanese publications.
</P>
<P>
All these have provided ground for the resurgence and spread of
militarism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be no easy thing for militarism to prevail in
Japan. The Asian people today, including the majority of
Japanese, are not the Asian people of World War II. If some
people dare to risk following in the footsteps of Hideki Tojo,
they are definitely doomed to failure.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has lost up to 1.384
billion tenges (roughly 21 million U.S. dollars) in government

<HEADLINE> Greece Furious Over Killing of Second Greek Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday condemned as
"criminal act" and "provocation" the killing of a second Greek
Cypriot by Turkish Cypriot forces in the buffer zone dividing the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The new criminal act by the occupying forces of Cyprus is an
unprecedented provocation," Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The way Turkish military forces face civilian demonstrators
shows they are common criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With rage and exasperation over this brutality we express the
condolences of all Greeks to the families of the young men."
</P>
<P>
The statement said Simitis would personally attend the second
victim's funeral in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Solomos Spyros Solomos, 26, was shot in the neck Wednesday as
he tried to tear down a Turkish flag on a sentry post along the
U.N.-patrolled green zone.
</P>
<P>
Two British U.N. peacekeepers were also wounded in the
shooting, and another nine people, including two Greek Cypriot
policemen, were injured.
</P>
<P>
The shooting happened when some 250 emotional Greek Cypriots
breached an area of the buffer zone to near the Turkish-Cypriot
zone after the funeral of Tasos Isaac, a young Greek Cypriot
beaten to death by Turkish Cypriot protesters during a
demonstration along the "Green Line" on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people were injured in Sunday's clashes after a
group of Greek Cypriot motorcyclists pushed across the line.
</P>
<P>
The bikers were heading towards the northern part of Cyprus,
which has been occupied by about 30,000 Turkish troops since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The troops were sent in after a coup in Nicosia by Cypriots
seeking alliance with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece has lodged strong international protests over the
killing with Ankara, Washington, the U.N. secretary-general, the
European Union and the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan expressed sorrow
over the violence but said on Wednesday during a visit to
Singapore it was the result of "Greek Cypriot instigation and
provocation" there.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government and the Turkish Cypriot leader urged
people to remain restrained to avoid further conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an Agean islet populated by 78 percent of Greeks, 18
percent of Turkish and 4 percent of other ethnic people, has long
been the source of tension between Turkey and Greece,
</P>
<P>
The Turkish and Greek communities constantly clash with each
other despite international efforts to unite them in a
federation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange Index Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The index of the Stock Exchange
of Thailand (SET) responded to the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force)
party's pullout from the government by falling 22.26 points, or 2
percent, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 1,088.08 on slim turnover of 3.09 billion
baht (123.44 million US dollars), with local investors as heavy
sellers.
</P>
<P>
With Palang Dharma's withdrawal, the credibility of Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's government has fallen to its lowest
level, Bangkok Post business reporters quote business people as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One of the business people interviewed said the government has
no more credibility among foreign investors and their confidence
in investing in Thailand has been greatly affected.
</P>
<P>
The financial community believes that economic stability is
more important than the survival of the Banharn government, urging
the prime minister to either resign or dissolve the House of
Representatives, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebel Suspects Rounded Up In Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Sri Lankan Tamil
rebel suspects, including 10 women, were rounded up by police in
Colombo Wednesday, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The police made their swoop on information that several
suspects from Jaffna peninsula had infiltrated into Colombo and
taken up residence in Wolfendhal street. The area was cordoned off
and searched.
</P>
<P>
Security in Colombo has been tightened following security
reports that several Tamil rebels, including suicide bombers, had
infiltrated into the city to target key installations and VIPs,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, following the arrest of a suspected suicide bomber
who tried to bribe his way past a police blockade, police were
able to locate rebel "safe houses" in Colombo and seize a large
quantity of arms and ammunition. Several suspects were also
arrested.
</P>
<P>
A train bomb installed by Tamil rebels, who have been fighting
a 13-year guerrilla war for a separate state in the north and east
of the country, exploded at a Colombo southern suburb last month,
killing at least 78 people and injuring over 500 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian Armed Forces fighter
jet crashed on takeoff today in fine weather at an Arctic airport
in the Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
The pilot ejected safely from the plane and suffered only a
twisted ankle, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The CF-18 fighter jet ran over the main fuel lines and burst
into flames at the Iqaluit airport some 2,000 kilometers north of
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft never took off," an officer was quoted as
saying. "It had the speed to take off, but it didn't leave the
ground and just went into the dirt off the runway."
</P>
<P>
The fighter jet was part of a squadron that is on a training
exercise in the Arctic region.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen CF-18s have crashed in the past 14 years since the
first of 138 jets was delivered to the Canadian military in 1982.

<HEADLINE> China Anti-Desertification Efforts to Be Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Remote-sensing and computers
technology have been brought in to help detect the spread of
desert in China.
</P>
<P>
With deserts and gobis covering an area of 1.49 million sq km,
the moving deserts constantly encroach on arable land in
northwest, north, and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Especially during the last half century, the desertification
process is increasing by an area of more than 1,000 sq km per
year, affecting a population of 50 million.
</P>
<P>
The desertification process used to be monitored by only human
observations. But northwest China's Gansu Province has introduced
the world's most advanced desert remote-sensing monitoring
equipment from the United States, which combines remote-sensing
technologies with the computer, to process satellite pictures and
various kinds of complicated geological information speedily.
</P>
<P>
The instrument was used to monitor the land and desert
transforming process in Minqin and other areas, with a monitoring
accuracy rate of above 80 percent, and it also provided reliable
data to the provincial government for working out the Qilian
Mountain ecological environment protection policy.

<P>
SARAJEVO, 14 August (Xinhua) -- The Mostar City Council today
elected Ivica Prskalo, a Croat, and Safet Orucevic, a Muslim,
major and deputy mayor of the ethnically-torn Bosnian city.
</P>
<P>
This is the first voting since the council, consisting of 16
Croat councillors and 21 representatives from the Muslim side,
overcame a crisis last week when the Croats, under pressure from
the United States and European countries, agreed to end their
boycott.
</P>
<P>
The Croat councillors also agreed on Muslim candidate Hamdija
Jahic's presidency of the city council.
</P>
<P>
The Croats had refused to sit in the council because of what
they called "irregularities" in the June 30 election, in which
their party HDZ was narrowly defeated by a Muslim-led coalition.

SHANTOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's largest eel exporter,
Chaozhou City in south China's Guangdong Province, exported 3,100
tons of roast eel in the first half of this year, an all time high.
</P>
<P>
The export was equivalent to the annual export of 1995, said a
local trade official.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the city is to gain 150 million US dollars

<P>
The Jinman Group sold 2,400 tons of live and roast eel to Japan

The structure around Aydingkol Lake covers a 13.8 square
kilometer proven oil-bearing area. Industrial oilstreams and good
oil signs are shown in the three wildcat wells in the structure of
north Aydingkol Lake, said Wu Tao, deputy director of the
Turpan-Hami Oil Exploration Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Yu-1 wildcat well met thick oil layers, which verified the 50
million tons of oil reserves in the structure. This was one of the
eight important discoveries of China's offshore oil exploitation
in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The oil exploration of the Aydingkol Lake structure started in
the autumn of 1994. Over the past year, experts discovered up to
40 meters thick oil sand in Aishen-1 well, pumped 20 cubic meters
crude oil daily in Yudong-1 well, and found 71-meter oil
signs. The discoveries indicate bright prospects for the north
Aydingkol Lake region.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Economic Measures Meet Various Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Tough economic measures
announced Monday night by the Argentine government sparked
immediate reactions, both favorable and critical, among different
social sectors.
</P>
<P>
The measures, aimed at reducing the hefty budget deficit,
include a lowering of customs duties on exports and an increase in
fuel taxes, public transportation and in advertising.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Justicialista Party and some economists believe that
the new measures will help solve the budget deficit and reactivate
the country's economy by creating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition parties, mainly the Union Civica Radical
and the Frente del Pais Solidario (FREPASO), fear that the
measures may increase unemployment and worsen the recession.
</P>
<P>
FREPASO is planning a series of non-violent protests against
the measures, its leader Carlos Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial officials praised the government's attempt to
resolve the budget deficit, but fear the measures may affect
production and exports. They point out that a budget deficit
cannot be curbed by increasing taxes, but by cutting public
spending and speeding production.
</P>
<P>
The strongest reactions come from trade unions. Gerardo
Martinez, leader of the General Labor Confederation, the biggest
in the country, rejected the measures today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of mechanical and chemical workers' unions said
that they would propose to the General Labor Confederation leaders
an intensification of the battle plan against the measures, with a
36-hour nationwide strike in the middle of September.

<HEADLINE> Plans Adopted to Prevent Desertification of Gran Chaco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay have adopted an initiative to
prevent the desertification of the Gran Chaco region, Argentine
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1-million-square-kilometer Gran Chaco region covers 50
percent of Argentina's territory, 30 percent of Paraguay's and 15
percent of Bolivia's.
</P>
<P>
The region, with sandy soil and a flat topography for most
part, has the biggest dry forest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted jointly by the representatives of the
three countries, was approved on Tuesday after two days of
discussions at a meeting on the Sustainable Development Program of
Gran Chaco in the northern Argentine city of Salta.
</P>
<P>
It includes initiatives concerning soil management, forests,
deforestation and the protection of cattle breeding and wildlife
in Gran Chaco.
</P>
<P>
It calls for closer coordination in the region to meet the
requirements of the inhabitants in all respects.
</P>
<P>
The document will be submitted to the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization, which organized the meeting jointly with Argentina's
Ministry of Natural Resources and Human Environment.

<HEADLINE> G-3 Agrees to Promote Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Government officials from
Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela have agreed to strengthen economic
relations among private enterprises of the three countries, to
give an impetus to a free trade agreement which took effect in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The countries, also known as the Group of Three (G-3), made the
commitment at a meeting of the tripartite administrative committee
in charge of the implementation of the agreement, which ended here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade ministers from the three South American countries
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Freddy Rojas Parra, foreign trade and development minister of
Colombia, told the meeting that the Colombian government will push
the cooperation "hammer and tongs" by encouraging its businessmen
to expand their investments in the other two countries,
particularly in small and medium-sized industries.
</P>
<P>
Though there had been only one session before this, he believed
the administrative committee, which was still in its initial
stage, would be able to produce positive results, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Trade and Industrial Development Minister, Herminio
Blanco, said that the G-3 has had a good cooperation in the past,
and the increasing investment and other economic figures went to
show that the tripartite body will be more valuable in the future.
</P>
<P>
Moris Ate-Meyer, foreign trade minister of Colombia, said he
shared the same opinions of his Mexican and Venezuelan
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Diverse topics, including investments, services, regulations
for the administrative committee and for the free trade agreement
itself as well as the date for the next session, have also been
discussed by the ministers.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Resume Civilian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israelis and Palestinians
Wednesday resumed talks on civilian issues for the first time
since Israeli new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators on a civilian committee from both sides said the
talks were held in a positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended the civilian talks after four suicide bombings
by Islamic militants in late February and early March. Further
delays were caused by Israel's May 29 election.
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's discussions were overshadowed by the overtone
of Israel's refusal to talk about the issue of settlement on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is the major concern of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu angered Palestinians earlier this month by lifting a
four-year freeze on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
His government drew further condemnation this week by
approving the placement of 298 mobile homes in settlements.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat said the Netanyahu government had adopted
irresponsible positions that "create an atmosphere of distrust and
lack of confidence in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Arafat described Natanyahu's plan to expand the settlements a
blatant violation of the autonomy accords, which leave the fate of
the settlements to negotiations on the final status of Israel's
occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel chief negotiator Major General Oren Shahor said he
turned down the request of the Palestinians to talk about the
settlements because it is not within the jurisdiction of the
civilian committee.
</P>
<P>
The civilian committee, one of the three Israel-Palestinian
committees set up under interim peace accords between the previous
Israel government and the Palestine Liberation Organization, deals
with the implementation of the autonomy agreedments in areas
unrelated to security.
</P>
<P>
The other two committees are the security committee dealing
with security policy issues and the steering committee dealing
with politics of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators at the meeting agreed to resume subcommittee talks
on topics such as the construction of a Palestinian airport,
Palestinian passports to border crossings and water resources.

<P>
BONN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The German government is to set
aside 2 billion Deutsch marks (1.36 billion U.S. dollars) over the
next three years to develop the country's information network.
</P>
<P>
A plan of action, passed in a cabinet meeting today, claimed
that familiarity with the knowledge of various professions was
critical to the quality development of the country's sciences and
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The document, code-named "Information as Feedstock for
Renovation", said an effective infrastructure for scientific and
technological information was conditional on acquaintance with
knowledge originating elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It said that knowledge in both printed and electronic forms was
the "capital" of the information-intensive society. Scientific
know-how doubled every five to seven years and there were more
than 20,000 titles of scientific and technological publications
for every working day.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities will use the government grant to develop
electronic and multimedia information services, as well as
securing intellectual properties rights and protection of on-line
data and off-line databank.
</P>
<P>
The money will also be used to improve hardware and software to
be used in the future networking system in Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Birth rate in the Slovak Republic
has plunged remarkably in the past 10 years, with 61,376 infants
born in 1995, a drop of 23 percent from the number of 80,150 in
1985, according to the Slovak Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
Up to March of this year, only 2,300 babies were born, the
bureau added.
</P>
<P>
If the trend of decline in birth rate could not be curbed, the
bureau noted, the population of the Slovak Republic will tumble 25
percent within 30 years and 50 percent within 90 years, to bring
adversary affect on the nation's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the population decline to heavy economic
burdens borne by young married couples and increasing popularity
of abortions.
</P>
<P>
Slovak women account for 51.3 percent of the population of
53,767,790 in 1995, most of whom in the child-bearing age group.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Suspends Operation Against Hostage-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 14 (Xinhua) - The NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR) today suspended an operation to protect its personnel
and other internationals from being taken hostages by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"Operation Fear Naught was suspended in the very early morning
hours on Wednesday," IFOR spokesman Major Tom Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
The operation, undergone since Monday, was triggered by the
refusal of the Serb military to an IFOR inspection of their
headquarters in Han Pijesak and subsequent IFOR contemplation of
using force to crack down on Serb resistance.
</P>
<P>
To prevent possible retaliation by Serbs, IFOR ordered an
evacuation of isolated NATO units in Bosnia's Serb republic to
secure bases and withdrawal of U.N. and other civilian agencies in
the Serb-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
But tension eased on Tuesday when Serbs allowed IFOR to inspect
Han Pijesak, where undeclared weapons are suspected to be stored.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led forces are still on a higher than normal state of
alert across Bosnia, even after Operation Fear Naught had been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The heightened state of alert was aimed at preventing any
possible terrorist attack, IFOR said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Studies Its Menu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed with new surveys showing
high rates of childhood anemia, obesity, and short stature,
nutritionists in Guangzhou are pushing for more attention to local
children's diets both at home and school.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the
teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20
percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily"
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that Guangzhou teenagers, shorter than the
average national height of the same age group, are about 10 to 15
centimeters shorter than Japanese teens.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Yukun, a nutrition expert of the Guangzhou Science and
Technology Association, blamed unbalanced and dull food eaten
every day for the malnutrition-based health problems.
</P>
<P>
Rice, the main Cantonese food, contains much less nutrition
than that found in corn, wheat, potatoes and many other staples
popular in north China.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, about 70 percent of the teenagers either have the
school lunch or buy lunch on the street nearby. And most school
cafeterias don't serve food containing the seven basic nutrients
students need every day, according to Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Many spoiled teenagers from one-child families eat only a
particular kind of food, such as meat or sweets, which might
easily lead them to develop obesity, diabetes or heart disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has given a go-ahead signal for the purchase of new aircraft for
presidential and other official flights after an air force plane
carrying eight cabinet members caught fire two days ago, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ramos said the purchase of the new
planes and helicopters will be made ahead of the passage of the
armed forces modernization program which is still pending in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He ordered Transportation and Communications Secretary Amado
Luis Lagdameo to coordinate with other agencies and source funds
for the new aircraft without having to go through Congress for
financing.
</P>
<P>
The president was fully convinced to make the decision after
eight of his cabinet members escaped death on Tuesday when a
22-year-old F-27 aircraft burst into flames while preparing for
take-off at the Villamor air base.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Air Force has several F-27s and a C-130 cargo
plane to fly cabinet secretaries and other officials. The
president himself is using an F-28 twin-engine jet plane which was
purchased by former First Lady Imelda Marcos during the 1970s.

CARACAS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of juvenile
pregnancies in Venezuela under the age of 15 rose to 20,000 in
1995, the highest among the Andean countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports by the National Program for the Prevention of Teenage
Pregnancies show that 24 percent of male teenagers and 35 percent
of female teenagers declared they had fathered or had a baby in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Two out of every three sexually-active women between the ages
of 15 and 24 had their first baby before they were 20, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics and Database show
that 524,387 births were registered in 1993, of which 100,118
babies were born to mothers under the age of 20. There were 3,866
high-risk births because the mothers were under the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
The increasing teenage pregnancy was seen as being due to a 25
percent school dropout rate among female children.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have warned about the juvenile pregnancy rate,
pointing out that the only effective way to prevent it is to
provide sexual education for teenagers.

<HEADLINE> Greece Refloats Turkish Flagship in Aegean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek navy today refloated a
Turkish frigate that ran aground inside Greek territorial waters
in the Aegean Sea on Tuesday, the Greek navy said.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation was carried out following agreements
between the Greek and Turkish navy general staffs.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Greek navy said that tugboats were used to
dislodge frigate Yavuz, the flagship of the Turkish naval fleet,
which rested in shallows at Ammoglossa, 400 yards northeast to the
Aegean island of Kos.
</P>
<P>
A Greek officer had boarded the frigate to coordinate the
rescue operation while Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis
returned to Athens from holiday to monitor the operation.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister was also in contact with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos so
as to coordinate activities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Yavuz was sailing in the straits between Kos and the Asia
Minor coast when it hit the shallows. The straits is 2.5 nautical
miles across at the place the frigate ran aground.
</P>
<P>
The Yavuz captain opted to pass by the Greek territorial waters
under conditions of "safe passage" but miscalculated the depth of
the waters, which is only four meters at the point the warship ran
aground.
</P>
<P>
The Greek defense minister attributed the incident to "faulty
navigation". "It appears to have been a mistake and we see no
intent in this event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have both been claiming sovereignty over a
rocky islet in the Aegean Sea. The Greeks call the islet Imia
while the Turks call it Kardak.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish naval and coastguard boats have been brushing
each other earlier in the year near the disputed islet.

<HEADLINE> Athens Bits to Host 2004 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek capital Athens
Wednesday submitted it's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games to the
International Olympic Committee at its headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Athens Olympic bid committee announced that an envelope
containing three separate volumes was handed to Jacqueline Baret,
the IOC's chief of candidacies for the 2004 games.
</P>
<P>
The first volume contained details and general information
about Athens and Greece; the second plans and photographs of the
venues for the 28 sports and the third, infrastructure of Athens
and the rest of the country, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Submitting the envelope was bid committee head Gianna
Angelopoulou-Daskalaki, a former conservative member of the Greek
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said Athens was the fourth city to submit it's
bid and that it was done one day before the deadline. Names of the
other three cities were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A record 11 cities are expected to submit bids and all made
brief pitches to IOC officials at their meetings before the
Atlanta Olympics. Besides Athens, they were: Buenos Aires,
Argentina; Cape Town, South Africa; Istanbul, Turkey; Lille,
France; Rio de Janeiro; Rome; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Seville,
Spain; Stockholm, Sweden, and St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
It's the third time Athens has submitted a bid to organize the
Games. Bids made to hold the 1988 and 1996 Games were rejected at
the time because Athens lacked infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
But Athens officials felt the games rightfully and morally
belonged here and 90 percent of the infrastructure was already in
place now, Angelopoulou-Daskalaki said at a press conference in
Athens last month .
</P>
<P>
If Athens is selected to hold the 2004 Games, the IOC is
expected to take a close look at how the World athletics
championships scheduled for the capital next August are conducted.
</P>
<P>
Greek officials were bitter after losing out to Atlanta to hold
this year's centennial Olympic Games and criticized Atlanta-based
Coca Cola and other giant American corporations for allegedly
influencing the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The modern Olympic Games were first held in Athens in 1896.
Greece had started a campaign in the mid 1980s to hold the Games
to mark their 100th anniversary. But the IOC, at its meeting in
Tokyo in 1988 to decide the venue for the 1996 Games, was not
swayed by Greek sentimentality and awarded them to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Saudi Businessman's Son Sponsors Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The son of a wealthy Saudi
Businessman is one of "the most significant" private financial
sponsors of Islamic extremist activities around the world, the
U.S. State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Department released a profile, which says Usama Bin
Ladin, son of a Saudi construction magnate, has been indirectly
linked to terrorist activities against Americans and U.S.
facilities, including the World Trade Center bombing in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said private
funding of terrorist activities is "a matter of very serious
concern to the United States".
</P>
<P>
The profile continues that by 1985, Bin Ladin had drawn on his
family wealth plus donations from sympathetic merchant families in
the Persian Gulf region to organize the Islamic Salvation
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
It says a network of foundation recruitment centers and
guest-houses in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has enlisted and
sheltered thousands of Arab recruits.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani investigators concluded that Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the
alleged mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, had once
resided at a guest-house in Peshawar, funded by Bin Ladin before
Yousef's apprehension last year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia revoked Bin Ladin's citizenship in February 1994
"for behavior that contradicts the kingdom's interests and risks
harming its relations with fraternal countries".
</P>
<P>
Ruyadh's decision to strip Bin Ladin of his citizenship
prompted him to form a London-based group called Reformation
committee.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the Clinton administration has taken a series of
measures, some in conjunction with other countries, to deter such
activities over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States doesn't have any information that
would confirm reports that private funding of terrorism has been
sanctioned, approved of or acquiesced by countries in the Gulf
region.

<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- European shares ended mixed
today, with British shares edged higher on Wall Street's rally in
its early trading and other European bourses closed nearly
unchanged with the approaching of a long holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
Of all the three European big share markets, only London's
Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares
staged a turnaround and posted modest gains as the market tracked
Wall Street's early performance and closed at a 16-week high.
</P>
<P>
Financial dealings in Paris today were undermined by an overall
lack of inspiration and quieter than usual with the approaching of
a four-day holiday in much of continental Europe as Thursday will
be Assumption Day.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed with little changes after shrugging off
overnight falls on Wall Street. Dealers in Frankfurt said that
underpinning the market were hopes of lower German interest rates.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed 6.9 points higher at 3,830.3.
The Paris CAC-40 index was down 1.05 at 1,979.52, while the
Frankfurt DAX-30 share index finished down 0.73 at 2,538.68.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test Ban Talks Set to Find No Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from 61 members of
the Geneva Conference on Disarmament admitted Wednesday that it is
impossible for them to strike a consensus on a proposed draft
treaty on nuclear test ban although talks will still go on until
next week.
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement made to the Conference's Ad Hoc Committee
on Nuclear Test Ban, India reiterated that it will not accept the
draft treaty put forward by the Dutch chairman of the
negotiations, Jaap Ramaker.
</P>
<P>
This statement, along with the national statements from other
Conference members, will be included in an ad hoc committee report
which negotiators are still drafting as a procedural step to
finish the negotiations at the committee level and refer the whole
issue to the higher forum -- Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the report-drafting is expected to be
finished within this week and the Conference will take up the
issue next week.
</P>
<P>
Ramaker told reporters on Wednesday that it is meaningless to
continue the negotiations because there is no hope for a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the objection from India should not cover
up the fact that his draft treaty is supported by a large majority
of the Conference members, including the five nuclear states.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Stephen Ledogar said that because of India's
veto, the Conference on Disarmament can not find the consensus
required for it to transfer the treaty to the UN General Assembly
for signature.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the draft treaty still exists. "It'll get
to New York and signed by the vast majority of the UN members," he
predicted when asked about the fate of the draft.
</P>
<P>
It is almost certain that a group of countries led by the
United States will eventually come up with a resolution to submit
the current draft directly to the UN General Assembly, bypassing
the procedural hindrance of the Geneva Conference.

<HEADLINE> NY Share Prices Edge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street edged
higher Wednesday as interest rates steadied in the bond market and
a strong earnings report from the computer sector helped lift
technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.60 to 5,666.88,
shrugging off an early-afternoon deficit of 17 points.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with volume totaling 343.44 million
shares as against 338.36 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.02 to 353.64, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.86 to 662.06.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.36 to 1,133.51, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.55 to 550.34.
</P>
<P>
The advance was led by Dell Computer, on news that the company
managed to increase its profits by 58 percent during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The news helped other big technology names on the Nasdaq.
Gateway 2000, Intel, and Microsoft all rose. Among computer makers
on the NYSE, Compaq and IBM advanced as Dow's strongest issues.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates improved slightly in the bond market after the

expected in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Too Many Young Companies Go Public, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Entering 1996, too many young
companies suddenly go public, gambling to get rich quickly -- or
lose their shirts, according to a report of the Wall Street
Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Increased competition is leading venture capitalists to invest
in start-ups earlier, making their investments riskier and giving
them an incentive to get out faster. The rush is making many
entrepreneurs rich in a hurry. But is it also taking some
companies to market long before they are ready, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, venture-capital firms nurtured young companies
for years before taking them public. But in the 12 months ended
May 31, venture capitalists took 19 companies public within a year
of first funding them, according to a research group in San
Francisco. That is triple the number a year earlier, and it
exceeds the total of the three previous years combined.
</P>
<P>
The pressure to rush stems from the industry's success in
getting investors high returns in recent years. Five years of
robust fundraising left the venture-capital industry with an
unprecedented 43.5 billion under management at the end of last
year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Recent uncertainty about the prospects of initial stock
offerings will delay some weaker deals, the paper said but "good
companies will still be able to get public money faster than
usual."
</P>
<P>
But rushing also increases the chances of major mistakes. Open
Environment Corp., a Boston provider of Internet software, went
public in April last year, five months after venture capitalists
first funded it. In October, management predicted that
third-quarter sales would be "less than originally anticipated."
The company's shares lost nearly half their value in a single day.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Plans Somali Refugee Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Wednesday said that it is
planning to repatriate 10,000 Somali refugees from Ethiopia before
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It added that this move will serve as a pilot project for a
full program next year aimed at bringing home 100,000 Somali
refugees, out of a total of some 275,000 in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, investigation is being conducted in the 10
potential returnee areas in northwest Somalia, where peace and
order has been restored since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 Somali refugees fled their country following
a civil war that led to the overthrow of the Siad Barre regime in
January 1991 and the subsequent famine. After spontaneous returns
beginning in 1992, there still are 275,000 of them in Ethiopia,
126,000 in Kenya, 20,000 in Djibouti and 5,000 in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, repatriation has been going on over the past several
years. However, outbreaks of violence in northwest Somalia, where
most of the Somali refugees in Ethiopia originated, have delayed
the repatriation from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that it has spent 13.8 million U.S. dollars on
rehabilitation and integration projects in northwest Somalia since
1992. A large part of the amount were spent in clearing mines,
particularly around Hargeisa, the country's second largest city.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO ended the state of high
alert for its troops in Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpske
today, but remains on high alert in the Muslim-Croat federation, a
NATO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Major Thomas Moyer told reporters the troops had returned to
their regular duties, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The state of high alert ended after a disagreement between the
Serb authority and the IFOR troops on the inspection of a Serb
military site had been resolved on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Serb troops blocked an IFOR team last Saturday in its
inspection of a Serb military site in Han Pijesak, 60 kilometers
northeastern of Sarajevo. After strong pressure from NATO, the
Serb authority agreed on Monday to allow the IFOR to make the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
IFOR ground force Commander Michael Walker has said the
inspection of the site, conducted on Tuesday, had been successful.
</P>
<P>
But NATO troops deployed in the Muslim-Croat federation have
been on high alert since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The state of alert had been introduced after American
intelligence had discovered a letter indicating a plan by Iranian
Islamic terrorists to attack a U.S. IFOR troop base in Bosnia.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Tanzania said that it will no longer bear the burden of
accommodating Burundi refugees.
</P>
<P>
Moving his ministry's 1996/97 budget estimates at the National
Assembly in Dodoma, Central Tanzania on Wednesday, Minister for
Defence and National Service Edgar Maokola-Majogo said that
Tanzania's capacity and patience for receiving Burundi refugees
had reached the end.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to tell Burundians and the international
community that Tanzania's capacity to shelter refugees is
exhausted and our patience is overstretched," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the influx of refugees from Burundi had led to
environmental degradation and social problems in Kigoma and
Kagera regions.
</P>
<P>
Maokola-Majogo said that the exercise of blocking refugees
from entering the country is so expensive that it also
constitutes a burden to the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Devoted to Improving Public Transit System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Buses have become 'kings of the
road' in Fuzhou, in east China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
City officials were forced to act when local people were driven
to despair by the poor quality public transport service.
</P>
<P>
Recently when Lin Kaiyi sat in a brand-new No.25 bus, she
couldn't help but feel relaxed and pleased, because she was spared
another five-km-long bike ride to her mother's home under the
scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
Like Ms Lin, her fellow residents in Fuzhou, are well aware
that the city government's efforts to improve Fuzhou's public
transit system have paid off, as evidenced by more new, and
better-equipped buses, and more bus routes.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, Fuzhou initiated six new bus routes, and
put in use 62 new buses, both figures the biggest ever in the city.
</P>
<P>
A city with more than a million permanent residents, and a
floating population of 400,000, as well as a fast growing economy,
Fuzhou has been troubled with a poor capacity public transport
system, which caused many complaints from residents, as well as
investors.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, city authorities formulated a
development plan for public transport, in which buses will have
priority, and taxis, tricycles and bicycle traffic will be
limited.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the city government said that Fuzhou plans to double
the number of buses in service from the present 400 to about 800
in the coming two years, with an investment of 100 million
yuan. The city is also expected to open 24 new routes and build
four passenger traffic hub stations in the city.

counterpart at the Masna crossing point on the Syrian-Lebanese
border.
</P>
<P>
Shara's visit to Beirut came at a time when Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was harping on his "Lebanon First"
proposal, which offers a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli forces
from south Lebanon in exchange for a stop of guerrilla attacks
on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon have announced their refusal of the
"Lebanon First" plan and their adherence to a coordination and
inseparability of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in the peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister had toured Arab states in North
Africa at the weekend where he delivered messages to their
leaders from Assad.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Rabat Tuesday that the Arabs had a
unified position towards the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Netanyahu's refusal to withdraw from
the Golan Heights, Shara said: "Israel can not ignore the unified
Arab position which requires the return of all occupied
territories by Israel, including the Golan Heights."

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Conveys Message to Hrawi from Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara said here today that he conveyed a message to Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Shara paid a prompt visit to the Lebanese capital and had a
meeting with Hrawi in the presence of Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held jointly with Boueiz at the end of
the one-hour meeting, the Syrian minister said that "the message
is related to contacts which have been made by Syria with some
other Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
"I conveyed to the (Lebanese) president that the Arab stand is
still solid and the Arab position is important, especially during
the election year" in the United States, Shara said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Arab states to stick to a united position in
order to force the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to give up its "intransigent position."
</P>
<P>
The united Arab position will oblige the Israeli government to
review its intransigent position and take a right position in
order to push the peace process forward based on the Madrid
Conference formula, the international resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, said the Syrian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Shara's visit came after his tour to some Arab countries in
North Africa in the last few days where he delivered messages to
Algerian President Liamine Zeroural and Moroccan King Hassan II,
as well as a recent series of meetings between al-Assad and
several other Arab heads of state.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's so-called "Lebanon First" proposal, the Syrian
official underlined that it was aimed at "derailing the peace
process from its correct track."
</P>
<P>
Under the "Lebanon First" proposal put forward by Netanyahu's
government, Israel would withdraw its troops from south Lebanon in
exchange for a disarmament of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah
guerrillas and a Syrian-guaranteed mechanism to safeguard the
security on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Shara said if Israel was serious in achieving peace why it did
not resume the negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
"If Netanyahu wants to withdraw from Lebanon, he does not need
the agreement from anyone and no body will prevent him from doing
so," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Israeli proposal was aimed at imposing
conditions like those in the May 17 agreement negotiated between
Lebanon and Israel in 1983 and refused by the Lebanese government
to sign at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal of his recent tour in Arab countries was to
"activate resolutions of the recent pan-Arab summit in Cairo and
to implement what had been agreed upon, especially in light of
Israel's radical position and its refusal of principles of the
1991 Madrid peace conference."
</P>
<P>
"If Israel insists on these proposals, the peace process will
remain frozen because the aim of the new Israeli policies is to
frustrate the peace process," the Syrian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lebanese Foreign Minister Boueiz noted
that the Israeli "Lebanon First" proposal was a subject
circulating in the press circles rather than a "clear political
suggestion."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Lebanese government had received a "clear
project" on the "Lebanon First" proposal from Israel.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel wants to implement U.N. Resolution 425 without
limitations and conditions, that will be welcomed," he said. "But
if it wants conditions for the withdrawal, the fate of this
proposal is to collapse just as the May 17 agreement collapsed."
</P>
<P>
He described the Israeli "Lebanon first" as merely a
"propagandist and psychological maneuver."

15.6 million U.S. dollars to finance the North African country's
family planning projects.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the grant was signed here today between the two

</P>
<P>
Egypt, the most populous Arab state with 60 million people, has

The population problem is regarded as a major obstacle to the
economic development and improvement of the people's living
standards in the country, where about 96 percent of the land is
desert.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker, who signed the
agreement for the American side, said after the signing ceremony
that the average number of children per family in Egypt has
reduced to 3.6 and more people are using contraceptives thanks to
the family planning program.

the peace process stalled for six months is finally back on

territories and other economic topics. The two sides agreed to
reactivate the West Bank and Gaza Sub-Committee to deal with
civilian affairs on the territories.
</P>
<P>
The delegations would visit on Thursday the Palestinian
airport in Dehaniya, Gaza Strip, which is one of the major
disputes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority, regarding the airport as a
symbol of its sovereignty, continued the construction without
Israel's inspections. The building of runways has been completed,
but Israel insists on full security control and inspection of all
flights.
</P>
<P>
Both sides described the atmosphere of today's meeting as
"positive", despite the exchange of accusations over the alleged
violations of the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I think the atmosphere was a good atmosphere. We discussed a
few technical issues in a pragmatic way. I think we have to
continue," said Israeli delegation head Oren Shahor said after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added there were still a lot of work that had to be done,
and the technical details would be worked out by professionals
late on.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis raised the security issue, charging the
Palestinians for illegal buildings, non-payment of debts to
Israeli hospitals and providing illegal residence for visiting
overseas Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian delegation warned the Israelis
against lifting a ban on settlement construction. Palestinian
chief negotiator Jamil Tarifi said he asked Shahor to convey a
message to the Israeli government to halt the "dangerous"
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
"We told them that, if it's like 'no peace without security',
we said:'no peace with settlement activities'," said
Tarifi.

JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today sent a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, urging
him to intervene to stop Jewish settlement expansion in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Arafat said the Israeli policy on expanding the
construction of settlements will "create an atmosphere of distrust
and lack of confidence in the peace process," according to reports
reaching here from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy were "a blatant violation of the self-rule
accords, under which the fate of the 144 settlements is to be
discussed in negotiations on the final status of the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in the letter he would appreciate "whatever good
word you can use to ensure that Israel adheres to the peace
process and its fulfillment."
</P>
<P>
Also today, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on civilian
affairs resumed talks, signaling the peace process stalled for six
months is finally back on track.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, the Palestinian delegation warned the
Israelis against lifting a ban on settlement
construction. Palestinian chief negotiator Jamil Tarifi said he
asked his Israeli counterpart Oren Shahor to convey a message to
the Israeli government to halt the "dangerous" settlement
activities.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Expresses Concern over Incident in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish acting Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller this evening expressed sorrow over
the death of a Greek Cypriot protester and the injury of some
people including United Nations peacekeepers in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said in a written statement that Turkey is expecting a
decisive attitude from the United Nations and all parties
concerning the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
She repeated that the "provocative acts" of the Greek Cypriots
will not help make a legal and permanent settlement to the Cyprus
problem and will not help make an atmosphere of confidence that
Turkey has desired for.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops today shot dead the Greek Cypriot protester as
he tried to bring down the Turkish flag on the edge of the
northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death Sunday in
clashes between the Greek Cypriots protesting the Turkish
occupation of northern Cyprus and the Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cypriot and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire on anyone
crossing the Green Line in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since the Turkish
troops landed on the island in 1974 in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup by supporter of union with Greece. The Turkish
Cypriots under the support of the Turkish troops seized the
northern one-third of Cyprus.

<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official said today
that Turkey, along with other members of the Conference on
Disarmament, was aiming to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which would prohibit nuclear explosions, as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Foregin Ministry Deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan told
reporters that the draft agreement was the result of two years of
intensive negotiations and represented a complex set of
international balances.
</P>
<P>
To reopen discussions on the draft could harm these sensitive
interests, Nurkan said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey wants to submit the draft to the United Nations as a
part of its policy, he said, adding that Turkey considers that
this target is also a duty for the members of the Conference on
Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The pact will become law only after ratified by 44 key states
which possess nuclear power reactors, including India. But India
says that the ban infringes upon its sovereign right to decide on its
own foreign policy and may veto the treaty.

<HEADLINE> 139 Billion Dollars Needed for OAPEC's Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab oil-producing
countries will need to invest over 139 billion U.S. dollars by the
year 2010 to expand their energy sector to meet expected growth in
world demand, according to a study by the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC).
</P>
<P>
The study singles out the areas which are most likely to be
expanded as oil and gas exploration, existing field development,
the improvement of transport facilities for crude oil, gas and
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Independent estimates have shown that three OAPEC member
countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will need to spend more than 50 billion U.S. dollars by the year
2000 to expand their crude oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has approved plans to develop its giant desert
Shaybah oil field to produce around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd)
and maintain the kingdom's aggregate output capacity at 10
million bpd by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the UAE both intend to raise capacity to over 3
million bpd from around 2.5 million bpd at present, while Iraq
said recently that it needs almost 30 billion dollars to nearly
double its production capacity to 6 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
To secure technology and funds for projects to boost their
output capacity, the OAPEC oil producers are poised to readmit
foreign partners they ousted three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has said it was considering re-opening its oil
industry to foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has retained foreign partners from Japan, France
and Britain which currently possess 40 percent shares in its
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
However, some countries involved warned that long-term
expansion plans could falter if crude prices remained low and
industrialized nations pressed ahead with proposals to impose
more energy taxes, which could stifle demand growth.
</P>
<P>
Many of the OAPEC states have been hard hit by low crude prices
resulting in budget deficits and overseas reserves being drained
by renewed withdrawals to finance growing development needs, the
study said.

The Israeli government decided earlier this month to lift
restrictions on Jewish settlement building in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. The restrictions had been imposed by the previous

Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, particularly the Palestinians, have condemned the
decision as an obstacle to the resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
As the first actual decision on settlements since the lifting
of the restrictions, the Israeli Defense Ministry said Monday that
Israel would place 298 mobile homes in Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip for public and educational use ahead of
the school year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Turkey Sign Memo on Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Turkish delegation
signed here today with the Iraqi side a joint memorandum on
cross-border trade to boost bilateral trade which has been
suspended since the U.N. imposed trade sanctions on Iraq six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The joint memo was signed by Turkish Justice Minister Shevket
Kazan who heads the delegation and Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rasheed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kazan said that during his
meetings with Iraqi officials, they discussed a previous project
on establishing a pipeline through Turkey with a capacity of 10
billion cubic meters of gas each year.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention when the project will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister said that Turkey will push ahead on its
demand for the U.N. to allow it to resume trade relation with Iraq
just like Jordan to compensate its huge economic and financial
losses which stand at 27 billion U.S. dollars due to the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that either the U.N. permits the resumption of
Turkey's trade with Iraq or the Security Council compensates
Turkey's losses resulted from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
During their stay here, the Turkish delegation has met all
high-level Iraqi officials including President Saddam Hussein,
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan, Deputy Premier Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The series of meetings between the two sides dealt with means
of resuming bilateral ties to the level before the Gulf Crisis in
1990 in all fields and revitalizing trade exchange in accordance
with the Iraq-UN oil-for-food deal signed in May.

<HEADLINE> India, Nepal to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- India and Nepal have agreed to
remove all restrictions on Nepal's export to India and narrow the
widening trade gap which is heavily in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to India Tuesday and Wednesday, Nepalese
Foreign Minister Prakash Lohani held talks with Indian leaders on
furthering bilateral relations, including enhancing economic
cooperation, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
Under the present trade arrangement between the two countries,
all goods manufactured in Nepal are required to have at least 50
percent of raw materials either produced indigenously or imported
from India.
</P>
<P>
With the removal of the restriction, Nepal could import raw
materials from anywhere, but must process and manufacture goods
locally.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-95, Nepal exported goods worth three billion Nepali
rupees (59.5 million US dollars) to India against imports worth 20
billion Nepali rupees (396.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nepal wants to invest 9 billion Indian rupees (268.65 million
US dollars) in the Indian market. At the same time, Nepal also
wants Indian businessmen to invest in a big way, and the Indian
side has agreed to liberalize rules governing investment by Indian
businessmen in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese foreign minister also proposing formulating an
"open sky" policy and allowing private airlines to operate between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to examine the possibility of
port development along the rivers of the two countries to
facilitate passenger and freight transportation.

SANAA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemen today denied reports that

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks US Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has sent a letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton, asking him to put pressure on Israel to advance the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, which was sent Wednesday, Arafat complained
about Israeli plans for settlement expansion, its failure to
redeploy troops in the West Bank town of Hebron and its delay in
opening a safe passage between Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hinted in the letter at the possibility of summoning the
Arab world to pressure Israel if the U.S. fails to take charge. He
said that the Arab summit convened in Cairo on June 22-23 "gave a
second chance to Israel to continue with the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We look to you to make Israel comply with the peace process
and its obligations ... to achieve a lasting and just peace
between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in an interview with an Israeli TV reporter earlier
this week, said that he would resort to international arbitration
if Israel reneged on all or part of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. Congress is soon to debate allocating aid to the
PNA, Arafat's move could be seen as a preemptive strike against
the Israel's threat to ask the Congress to veto the aid if the PNA
does not close down three offices operating in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
Wednesday that the U.S. government still regarded the
construction of settlements as an obstacle to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously our position remains unchanged. We think settlements
are complicating and unhelpful to the peace process," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Israel took the first step toward fully
resuming the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as the Joint
Committee on Civilian Affairs held the first meeting in six
months.
</P>
<P>
However, the crucial talks on Israeli troops redeployment from
Hebron and the final-status talks remain deadlocked. The Israeli
government has made clear that it would revise the Hebron
redeployment plan as agreed upon in the Oslo accords, a move
strongly opposed by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Traffic Accident in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed in a
traffic accident on the Beirut-Damascus highway Wednesday
afternoon, a tragedy described by a local newspaper today as "the
last one of a series of massacres committed by killing trucks."
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a Mecerdez cargo truck knocked down
a taxi of Mecerdez limousine and a Dodge pickup at a cross road
in the town of Aley half way up Lebanon Mountain, the Beirut
conservative daily An-Nahar reported.
</P>
<P>
Five persons in the limousine, including four army servicemen,
the driver of the pickup and a woman walking on the roadside were
all killed while the truck driver and two others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Loaded with tons of sugar, the truck descending the mountain
along the highway in a horrible speed ran into the taxi and the
pickup climbing up from the opposite direction at 2:30
p.m. (11:30 GMT) and knocked them into a garage.
</P>
<P>
Policemen of the interior security forces and ambulances
arrived immediately at the venue but it took them several hours to
evacuate the dead and wounded because of the traffic jams created
by the incident in both directions of the road.
</P>
<P>
Several cars inside the garage or parked on the roadside were
badly damaged, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Investigations were not concluded, and police sources said that
the accident was probably caused by a failure of the truck's
brakes.
</P>
<P>
Local residents blame truck drivers, most of them are of
foreign nationalities, for frequent accidents on the international
highway.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a truck with Saudi plate driven by a
Pakistani ran into a school bus, killing seven pupils and their
teacher.

KUWAIT CITY, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary indications
showed that the growth of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product
(GDP) for the year 1996 was anticipated to reach 6.2 percent
compared with 4.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Finance and Economy Ibrahim Al-Assaf said
Wednesday in a press release, which was obtained here today, that
positive outcome had surfaced as a result of the successful
policies adopted by the Saudi government during the past few years
that centered on government expenditure cuts and support for the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out the great improvement in the Saudi
balance of payments as another indication of the good performance
of the Saudi economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the deficit in the first six months of 1996 decreased
to 500 million U.S. dollars compared with 17.3 billion in 1993,
10.5 billion in 1994 and 8.1 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the improvement to the increase in oil exports
and the continuous growth in non-oil exports.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalist Andre
Agassi was defaulted from a second-round match Wednesday after
hitting a ball out of the stadium and cursing the umpire at the
$1.04 million RCA Championships.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Agassi was leading Canadian Daniel Nestor 6-1
2-3 at the time of the incident, but lost the match on the
decision of ATP Tour Supervisor Mark Darby.
</P>
<P>
After Agassi had lost his serve in the fifth game of the
second set, he hit the ball angrily over the umpire's chair and
out of the stadium, and umpire Dana Loconto gave the sixth-ranked
Agassi a warning for ball abuse.
</P>
<P>
Then Agassi cursed the umpire, and Laconto called Darby to the
court. Darby's verdict was to default Agassi.
</P>
<P>
ATP officials met for nearly 30 minutes before upholding the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The crowd booed, hissed and threw objects including water
bottles onto the court when the umpire called the match in
Nestor's favour. Laconto and Darby left the court to jeers from
the crowd.

<P>
HARBIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Number One Heavy Machinery
Group Company in Harbin has successfully built the country's first
300-megawatt nuclear reactor vessel.
</P>
<P>
The reactor vessel, 215 tons in weight, 10.7 meters in
height, and with a diameter of 3.6 meters, has just passed
ministry-level appraisal. It was manufactured for a Pakistan
project at the factory in the capital city of northeast China's
Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear reactor vessels are core equipment in nuclear plants,
and should run 40 years continuously under high temperature,
pressure and radiation. Material and technology both have to reach
high levels, and quality must be high for the vessels.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of the 300-megawatt nuclear reactor has laid
the foundation for making still larger power nuclear equipment in
the future.

<HEADLINE> National Anthem Reprinted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China has re-printed its
national anthem in a bid to trigger a new round of love of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that at a time shortly before Hong Kong's
return to the motherland, the reprinting and circulation of the
national anthem will help citizens arouse their patriotic feelings
in the new historical period.
</P>
<P>
A recent sample survey showed that it is quite common for some
young people to be unable to sing the national anthem, and even
among a number of senior citizens, the words of the national
anthem are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews at a joint venture in East China's Fujian
Province, nine of the applicants failed because they were unable
to sing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
It is a "pity" that in the nation-wide drive for building
China's socialist culture and ideology, some people are unable to
sing the national anthem, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is difficult for citizens to get printed copies
of the national anthem, they said.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Republic of China National Anthem" reprinted by
the Guangzhou Publishing House, has both staff and numbered
musical notations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tightens Economic Ban on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Tanzania has stepped up measures aimed at intensifying trade
sanctions against Burundi by plugging possible loopholes, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma District Commissioners' office has ordered that all
vessels except registered ships have been banned from carrying
Zaire bound cargo on Lake Tanganyika out of Kigoma port with
effect from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
An official at Kigoma Port told reporters that ban would be in
force until the trade sanctions imposed early this month were
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The official said that it was difficult to monitor dhows
sailing out of Kigoma port, adding that it was feared the vessels
might end up delivering goods to Burundi while pretending to be
sailing to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the dhows, each of them having a capacity
to carry between 30 and 50 tonnes of cargo, will spend between
eight and 12 hours to move from Kigoma to the ports in Zaire and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, ships from Zaire would be needed to pick up
their goods, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, By yesterday, Kigoma port
has a total of 9,460 tonnes of cargo, in addition to 94
containers, bound for Zaire and Burundi. Out of the 9,460
tonnes, 5,203 were for Burundi, 4,044 for Zaire, 200 for Rwanda
and 13 for the World Food Programme.

<HEADLINE> Gansu's Deputy-Governor Confident on Poverty-Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (xinhua) -- Yuan Xiaosu, deputy-governor of
northwest China's Gansu province has expressed his confidence in
eliminating poverty in the province by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have found out the reason of poverty and the measures to
solve it," said Yuan. "As long as we put these measures into real
effect, there is no question for us to take off the hat of
poverty."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 4.9 million, or a quarter of farmers,
live under the poverty line in Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
He attributed poverty mainly to the hostile natural conditions
in the province, especially to scarce water resources.
</P>
<P>
The average rainfall in the province is 300 mm per year, and
the per capita occupation water resources is 1,300 cubic meters or
one half of the country's average.
</P>
<P>
"The first and the most important task is to solve the problem
of water," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuan noted that the province has constructed, and is
constructing a batch of water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
"They will play an important role in irrigating farm land in
the next few years."
</P>
<P>
The construction of water conservancy projects has been listed
as a priority in the province's investment scheme. In the 1980s,
the local government's annual investment in water conservancy
stood at 500 million yuan, and in the 1990s, the amount reached
700 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Retailer to Open Supermarket Chain in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese retailer will open a
chain of supermarkets in Thailand, with its first store set to
open September 26 in a Bangkok suburb, Kyodo News Service quoted a
company spokesman as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seiyu Ltd., the second Japanese retailer only after Jusco Co.,
plans to set up 20 stores -- eight operated directly by Seiyu and
the remainder as franchises -- by the year 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Seiyu will move into Thailand to cater to a growing number of
middle-class consumers.
</P>
<P>
The company set up Bang Chang Seiyu Co. in March 1995, of which
51 percent is held by the Thai group Bang Chang. Seiyu plans to
become the majority shareholder when it invests an additional 200
million baht (about 800 million yen) to the initial capital
investment of 100 million baht, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The first store, Seiyu Sukhaphipan 3, will be located in a
suburb 15 kilometers northeast of central Bangkok, and will have a
2,260-square-meter supermarket and 12 tenant stores, including
restaurants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seiyu will invest a total of 45 million baht in the store and

<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Liang Tinggui, 51, never thought
that he could become a man of wealth in his middle age.
</P>
<P>
Now he and his wife, son, daughter-in-law and a grandson live
in a three-room house, with a new set of furniture and appliances
such as color TV, washing machine and cassette player. Cow, pigs
and chickens lived harmoniously among flowers and grass in the
backyard of more than 100 square meters. He also has a tractor and
four cows to help with the farming.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Liang had nothing but a dilapidated cottage and
his annual income was no more than 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his wellbeing to the efforts made by the central
government and the help of World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
During the 1985-1989 period, Liang received 400 kilograms of
grain aid from the United States' World Food Program. Under the
organization of the local government, he attended the activities
to improve farming conditions.
</P>
<P>
Liang is not the only person to experienced "wellbeing". More
than 23,000 farmers in six poor counties in northwest China's
Qinghai province have benefited from the project, which was aided
by 20.89 million US dollars-worth food from the WFP and 24.28
million US dollars of fund from the central government.
</P>
<P>
"Though the food aid compromises only a small proportion of the
assistance China is receiving, it is the major source of grant
assistance that focuses directly on poverty alleviation," said Li
Xiaofen, deputy-director of the department of
international-cooperation under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We have made every effort to ensure that we made full use of
every single dollar," she added.

<P>
WFP was the first, and has been the major food aid donor to
China since 1979. Latest statistics show that by the end of 1996,
WFP has delivered almost 2.82 million tons of food aid to China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the WFP food-aid projects have achieved
remarkable economic, social and ecological benefits, noted the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment study on 41 projects made by the
ministry last year, the grain output increased by 150 percent,
with 80 percent of the poor population escaping poverty in the
project areas.
</P>
<P>
In late July members of the WFP Executive Board paid a visit to
WFP projects, both finished and in preparation, in northwestern
Gansu and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
After investigation, Jutta Burghardt from Germany, one of the
largest donors to the WFP, said that she attributed the success
first to China's investment in massive infrastructure in the
project, which is the precondition of the success of the project.
</P>
<P>
The second and the most important, she said, is that the
Chinese government "is truly caring about the wellbeing of the
people."
</P>
<P>
"I would not stop assisting to China." she continued, noting
that the visit let her know more about poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I've see a lot of poverty in other countries. Poverty is not a
new thing to me. But hunger in Hualong county in Qinghai province,
to that extent has shocked me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hualong Hui Autonomous County, as a state-set poor county, has
applied for food aid to the WFP. Approximately 85 percent of the
150,300 farmers in the county face rations for two to four months
each year.
</P>
<P>
Maurizio Gnocchi, country director for WFP in China, noted that
China is one of the most successful countries implementing the WFP
projects. He said that the WFP will continue its coordination with
China in its poverty-alleviating task.

"Improved irrigation conditions will make our province a new
grain base in the country," Yuan said, "and we can develop other
industries only after we have enough to eat."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the province will bring more waste land under
cultivation, adding that the Hexi Corridor has a large potential
for further reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 38 percent of the land in the Hexi
Corridor has been developed. The land suitable for farming which
can be reclaimed in the near future reaches five million mu
(330,000 ha).
</P>
<P>
The use of up-to-date farming technologies will also help the
poor farmers to produce more grain.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, The province will transform more sloping
land into terraces, and spread the use of plastic sheet to raise
the output of grain.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the province will spare no efforts in producing
more agricultural means of production. By the year 2000, the
province will have seven plants producing pesticides and four
producing chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, China's central government will also provide
more money to help the province to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Yuan also spoke highly of the cooperation with international
organizations in poverty alleviation. So far, the province has
received 61 million US dollars of food aid from the United
Nation's World Food Program.

stage to show human being's potentials," when addressing the Third
Paralympic Congress here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deng, co-host speaker of the second general session of the
congress, told representives from over 50 countries and regions
that sports is the way for disabled people to demonstrate their
ability for achieving success out of physical and mental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Deng, a wheel-chair user and the principal leader of the
disability movement in China, said that sports activities and
competition for people with disabilites in China have helped them
to overcome barriers to become more confident and self-dependent
in society.
</P>
<P>
"The Paralympics is not only meant to demonstrate the sports
talents of people with disabilities," Deng said on the eve of the
opening of the 10th Paralympics, "but also the best and most
effective way to raise concern and support to the equality and
parcipation of people with disabilities."
</P>
<P>
He cited China's rapid progress in sports for disabled people
and the Sixth Far East and South Pacific Paralympics (FESPIC) held
in Beijing as examples of the roles sports can play in the life of
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Deng said since 1980 four national sports games of disabled
people have been held in China, in addition to 18 individual
sports championships for them.
</P>
<P>
"Such sports events have become more and more influential and
vigorous," he said. "Their significance is far beyond sports
itself but rather a powerful promotion to the equality and
participation of disabled people as well as the progress of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
"The paralympic spirit and its social impact has been turned
into a strong confidence of the whole nation, which contributes to
the modernization drive of China."
</P>
<P>
In September, 1994, over 2,000 disabled athletes and officials
from 42 countries and regions participated in the FESPIC Games in
Beijing that saw the fall of 98 world records. A team of disabled
athlete speakers toured the country during and following the
Games, telling people living across the nation their stories of
success.
</P>
<P>
"Their stories have aroused from the society further concern
and understanding to disability, encouraged more people to cherish
life, love life and to educate them with humanitairianism," Deng
sai.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, people with disabilities have created for
themselves, through sports, a better social environment for long
term development." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Third Paralympic Congress, opened on August 12, will close
on August 16, a day after the opening ceremony for the
Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Medical College
Wednesday was closed indefinitely only nine days after its
reopening following violent clashes between two rival student
groups, sources for the college said.
</P>
<P>
Students vacated their dormitories on Wednesday afternoon to
avert further trouble on the campus after three students were
injured critically in the rival attacks at the college hostel.
</P>
<P>
The college was reopened on August 5 after it was closed for 26
days during which there was a string of clashes between the
student wings of the ruling Awami League and the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the college said it would be difficult to
remove terrorism from the campus until the country's traditional
student politics could be stopped.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Resist U.S. Domination over Moslems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri has vowed to take stance against
U.S. domination over the Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri stressed that it is a top principle of Iran to
reject economic, political and cultural domination of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Iranian ambassadors and other heads of the
diplomatic missions abroad Wednesday, he said that "all the
problems created for and pressures exerted on Islamic Iran today
was due to the fact that Iranian officials were not willing to be
dominated by foreigners led by the United States."
</P>
<P>
"If the United States intends to dominate Moslem countries,
Iran would condemn it and take stance against it," the 53-year-
old speaker was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He described those who favor or believe in negotiations with the
United States as "naive," saying that negotiations with the United
States would solve nothing.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the strong-worded statement by the
leading hardliner in the country is obviously pointing to
moderate President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his liberal camp, which
intends to solve the problem between the two countries through
negotiations and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
But, the Tehran government headed by the 61-year-old president
has been under constant and tremendous pressure from the
extremists and hardliners against his efforts to negotiate with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, who is regarded as a leading candidate for the
presidential elections scheduled for August 1997, said that
"Iranian officials will never back down from their stands."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is "aggressive" by nature and trying
to harm the prestige of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The dignity or prestige of countries by no means depends on
such parameters as the gross domestic product, per capita income
or power, but rather on the degree of the influence they wield in
the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that establishment of an economic balance between
the developed and developing states, emphasis on human rights
and opposition to terrorism were among Iran's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iranian officials believed that regional security
should be preserved by regional states themselves. He stressed
the unity among Moslems and expansion of ties with Moslem
countries as a priority.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Consults with Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced that an
Iranian government official had consulted with Libyan Leader
Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli on important regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported today that the two sides
also reviewed bilateral relations and other issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between Gaddafi and Mohammad Kazem
Khansari, Director General of Iran's Foreign Ministry for Middle
East and North Africa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no detail about the concrete topic
dealt with between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that this is part of the
Iranian efforts against the pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
They said that U.S. sanctions against Iran and Libya and the
cooperation between Tehran and Tripoli would be on the top
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The two countries might form some kind of strategic relations
or common front against the sanctions imposed by U.S. President
Bill Clinton on August 5, which will punish non-American
companies investing more than 40 million U.S. dollars in oil and gas
sectors of the two countries.

The report said that Gaddafi had offered his best regards to
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and praised Iran's right and

Rafsanjani.

During the meeting, the Iranian official expressed regret over
the pressure exerted on Libya because of the U.S.-imposed economic
sanctions and expressed the hope that Libya would go ahead with its
development programs.

LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Record A-level pass rates to be announced later today will
trigger an unprecedented scramble for places at leading
universities and increase pressure on the government to reform the
examinations system.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The fall in Britain's unemployment total gathered pace last
month. With average earnings also rising unexpectedly quickly in
the year to June, this appears to limit the scope for another cut
in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A warning that Britain faced an imminent clash with the rest
of Europe over the development of the European Union was delivered
to Prime Minister John Major by a group of MPs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- A fifth one-day strike by postal workers on Wednesday
brought mail deliveries to a standstill as new figures showed a
huge increase in the number of working days lost in Britain to
industrial action. The dispute has contributed to figures which
show 228,000 days were lost in June, the highest monthly figure
since March 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor will launch a fresh onslaught later today against the
privatized water industry, attacking bosses' "moonlight"
directorships and the senior positions among Britain's most senior
civil servants at the time of water privatization.

<HEADLINE> Air India to Offer Unutilized Routes on Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- India's Civil Aviation
Minister C. M. Ibrahim has said that Air India (AI)'s unutilized
routes would be offered on commercial lease to bilateral partners
in a bid to revive the flagging national carrier.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview to the local English newspaper The
Times of India, which was published today, the minister said that
there could be revenue sharing between AI and other international
airlines at the ratio 40:60.
</P>
<P>
"The move will at once boost AI's fortunes as there will be 40
percent more revenues coming to the airline," he said.
</P>
<P>
Informal talks between AI and international airlines have shown
that there will be willing takers for such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the national carrier fails to utilize these routes
because it has only 26 aircraft, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, bilateral talks on important routes such as Chicago,
Singapore, London and East European destinations have got stuck
owing to AI's lack of capacity.

<HEADLINE> ANC Official Calls for Solution of Economic Disparity Between Communities in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The biggest challenge
facing South Africa is to get enough capital for disadvantaged
communities to take up significant equity stakes in the country's
economy, outgoing African National Congress Secretary-General
Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
political freedom will not bring stability and growth if the
gross economic disparity created by apartheid is not tackled,
said local daily "The Citizen" today quoting Ramaphosa, who is
also deputy Executive Chairman of New Africa Investment Limited.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at a two-day black economic empowerment
conference in Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said black businesses
should cooperate if they are to claim meaningful participation in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa said that big financial institutions still refused
to lend money to blacks because of possible risk.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he stressed that new sources of funding
"should be found that do not utilise the same lending criteria as
traditional lenders", saying the private sector should be
encouraged to promote and fund black economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ramaphosa also called for the establishment of
a "deliberate" economic development program to fully complete
South Africa's transformation process.
</P>
<P>
He said the first step in economically empowering
disadvantaged people is to ensure that they become meaningful
participants in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The next site of struggle for emancipation in South Africa is
economic. Now, black economic empowerment must be top on our
agendas," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Japan Marks 51st Anniversary of Defeat in Second World War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, Augest 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan today marked the 51st
anniversary of the nation's defeat in the World War II as Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto expressed "deep remorse" for its war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"That war (of aggression staged by Japan) caused tremendous
pain and sorrow to people in many countries, particularly to those
in Asian nations," Hashimoto said in a speech at the
government-sponsored annual ceremony for commemorating the
memorial day at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan hall.
</P>
<P>
"I humbly admit to this fact and would like to offer heartfelt
condolences to them with deep remorse," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister attempted to defuse outrage among
Asian nations, which suffered bitterly under Japanese militarist
heels, by skipping a visit to a shrine glorifying Japanese war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto visited the Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine last month,
setting off widespread anger in its Asian neighboring countries
because he was the second incumbent post-war prime minister to pay
homage to war criminals, following Yasuhiro Nakasone who did so in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito and empress Michiko led today's official
ceremony in the indoor arena where some 7,000 people observed a
minute of silence at noon and prayed for the souls of the 3.1
million Japanese who died during the war.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back at history here, I pray from the bottom of my
heart that the ravages of war will never be repeated," Akihito
said in a brief speech.
</P>
<P>
House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi also gave a
memorial address. He said, "We should strive for world peace and
must deepen trustful relationship with people of other nations
through further international cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"In particular," Doi said, "further efforts are needed to reach
real reconciliation with Asian people."
</P>
<P>
She made similar remarks at the ceremony last year, alluding to
the fact that Japan has not reached real reconciliation with the
rest of Asian nations because it has yet to apologize for Japanese
aggression against Asian countries in the second world war.

<HEADLINE> Nmibia's Debt to S.Africa Written off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has written off
Namibia's 1.4 billion Namibian Dollars(about 325 million U.S.Dollars)
pre-independence debt, said a source obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Windhoek on wednesday, Namibian Finance
Minister Helmut Angula said outstanding issues preventing South
Africa from writing off the debt had been settled following a meeting
between himself and his South African counterpart Trevor Manuel in
pretoria last week.
</P>
<P>
Angula said both sides agreed at the meeting to sign a bi-lateral
agreement on writing off the debt, which was run up by South African
administrations in then South West Africa, prior to independence in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Technical teams from the two countries' finance ministries were
working on the text of the proposed agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Once signed, legislation would be tabled in the South African
parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said the debt would be
cancelled during a visit to Namibia in August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Regulate Private Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Council of
Ministers approved on Wednesday a draft law to regulate the
country's private banking sector, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new law, drafted by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC),
was aimed at complementing the law adopted in 1994 to regulate the
central bank, a senior NBC official was quoted by "The Cambodia
Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sok, director of the NBC's Economic Research Department,
said that the draft law has set the minimum amount of capital
necessary for private banks and contained strict punishment for
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
At least one local bank has been closed for failing to maintain
cash reserves of 5 million U.S. dollars or more, according to the
director.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which will be debated and finalized by the
National Assembly (parliament), is seen as vital for Cambodia to
attract more investment and develop its market economy, the
newspaper said.

ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces killed
22 rebels of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the
armed clashes in southeastern Turkey, a statement from the
governor's office of the emergency rule region said today.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease Kills 1 Every 10 Minutes in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Heart attack and stroke remain
the biggest cause of premature death among Australians, claiming
one person's life every 10 minutes, a new report warns.
</P>
<P>
The National Heart Foundation said in its latest report that
2.3 million Australians have cardiovascular disease and about half
of them will die of it.
</P>
<P>
"The Heart and Stroke Facts" report available here today said
that in 1994, cardiovascular disease caused 54,886 deaths, or 43.3
percent of all deaths in Australia -- equivalent to one every 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of men and one third of women are overweight, one
third to one half of Australians aged under 70 have high
cholesterol and one fourth of adults still smoke.
</P>
<P>
The foundation's medical Vice President Andrew Tonkin said
despite impressive gains in curbing heart and blood vessel disease
risk factors over the past years, some "lifestyle" issues were not
being addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Australians if anything have gained weight, possibly because
we are eating more fast foods -- and this is a growing problem
among young people," Tonkin said.
</P>
<P>
"Fast foods are a nutritional nightmare, being high in
saturated fat, high in salt and low in fiber."

<HEADLINE> Japan at Crossroad: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- People commemorating the 51st
anniversary of V-J Day, they will be watching for Japan's choice
between two options: encouraging pro-militarist activities or
settling accounts with the militarist faction and fighting its
legacy, according to a commentary in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one years ago today, Japan's unconditional surrender
marked the end of World War II, and proved that fascist aggression
was doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Though some senior Japanese Government officials have made open
apologies to victimized nations in Asia for the misery caused by
Japanese aggression in the Second World War, the commentary
warned, people have to be on alert for the possible revival of
militarism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Those shallow apologies, which are made under international
pressure and outnumbered by pro-military remarks in Japan, can not
cover up the distortions of past events, such as continuous
attempts made to eliminate information describing Japanese wartime
aggression from Japanese school textbooks and preposterous remarks
by some cabinet members denying Japanese aggression during World
War II, it said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto's recent visit to the
Yasukuni Shrine disregarded strong protests from the victimized
nations, and set an example leading to militarist revival in
Japan, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
All these events have "cast a shadow over Japan's relations
with its neighboring countries, and posed a challenge to the
stability of Asia and the world," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace-loving people have no option but to be alert to such
undercurrents in Japan, and bravely face the challenge of guarding
their hard-earned stability and dignity," it said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, as an island country lacking in natural resources,
Japan's development depends on trade and co-operation with other
countries, which should be based on mutual understanding and trust
with other nations, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
"Only when Japan acknowledges historical facts, thoroughly
examines its war crimes, and makes sincere apologies to war
victims, will it be fully accepted by other Asian nations," the
commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economic Slowdown to Last Up to 9 Months: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Trade
and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong said today that an economic slowdown
will last up to nine months due to a sluggish market in the
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a function for launching the Nanyang Business
Report Series, the minister said, "I think we have to brace
ourselves for a slowdown for anything from three months to nine
months."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the economic slowdown should not hamper
the regionalization drive of Singapore companies whose profits
were expected to dip in line with the country's weaker economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said that Singapore, among the largest investors in ASEAN
(Association of the Southeast Asian Nations), China and Indochina
could also counteract business cycles by investing in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Singapore's investment abroad totaled 36 billion
Singapore dollars (about 25.35 billion US dollars at current
exchange rate) in 1994, almost double that in 1991. During that
period, the number of overseas subsidiaries set up by Singaporean
companies had also doubled to more than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
"As Singapore advances towards becoming a developed country, we
have to increasingly seek out new source of growth to overcome our
inherent constraints of a small domestic market and lack of
natural resources," he said.

<HEADLINE> Oman to Open Commercial Office in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sultanate of Oman plans to
open a commercial office in China in the near future, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Ittihad," an Arabic newspaper of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), quoted Sheikh Salem Ben Hilal al Khalili, Chairman of
Oman's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as saying that the
chamber is seeking to promote economic relations between the UAE
and China.
</P>
<P>
"The trade relations between Oman and China are old, as Oman
was a gateway to the Silk Route that linked Asia and Europe together
in the old ages," al Khalili explained.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the distinguished Sino-Omani relations, the volume of
trade exchange between the two countries is too small and
incompatible with the strength of the Sino-Omani relation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Oman's non-oil exports to China do not exceed one percent of
Oman's total non-oil exports, and Oman's imports from China
account for no more than nine percent of Oman's total imports,"
al Khalili illustrated.
</P>
<P>
The Oman Chamber of Commerce and Trade will seek, by opening
such an office in China, to boost the Sino-Omani economic
relations, especially to facilitate business links between the two
sides. he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Oman-China balance of trade does
constantly incline to tip in favor of China in view of the
scantiness of Oman exports to China, so there is considerable
need to redress this balance by promoting these exports through
mutual cooperation between the governments and chambers of
commerce of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Khalili said he would visit China within three months to come
with the aim of completing the proceedings required for opening
the office in China.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks US Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has sent a letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton, asking him to put pressure on Israel to advance the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, which was sent Wednesday, Arafat complained
about Israeli plans for settlement expansion, its failure to
redeploy troops in the West Bank town of Hebron and its delay in
opening a safe passage between Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hinted in the letter at the possibility of summoning the
Arab world to pressure Israel if the U.S. fails to take charge. He
said that the Arab summit convened in Cairo on June 22-23 "gave a
second chance to Israel to continue with the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We look to you to make Israel comply with the peace process
and its obligations ... to achieve a lasting and just peace
between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in an interview with an Israeli TV reporter earlier
this week, said that he would resort to international arbitration
if Israel reneged on all or part of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. Congress is soon to debate allocating aid to the
PNA, Arafat's move could be seen as a preemptive strike against
the Israel's threat to ask the Congress to veto the aid if the PNA
does not close down three offices operating in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
Wednesday that the U.S. government still regarded the
construction of settlements as an obstacle to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously our position remains unchanged. We think settlements
are complicating and unhelpful to the peace process," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Israel took the first step toward fully
resuming the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as the Joint
Committee on Civilian Affairs held the first meeting in six
months.
</P>
<P>
However, the crucial talks on Israeli troops redeployment from
Hebron and the final-status talks remain deadlocked. The Israeli
government has made clear that it would revise the Hebron
redeployment plan as agreed upon in the Oslo accords, a move
strongly opposed by the Palestinians.

<P>
FREETOWN, Augest 15 (Xinhua)--Seirra Leonean Vice-President
Joe Demby left here early Thursday leading a team of ministers
and senior government officials to the interior for an on the
spot assessment of the resettlement program for returning war
ravaged civilians and rebel combatants who have surrendered to
government in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Demby is the most senior government official so far to meet
released civilians and former rebels. Political observers said
the visit to the north, south and east is a move to convince
rebels who want to surrender that they will not be harmed or
prosecuted for their role in the five year long war that has left
over 20,000 people mainly civilians.
</P>
<P>
His first stop is in Makeni in the north where official
sources said that up to 200 Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebels are lurking in the bush waiting to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Demby, in an interview before his departure, said that up to
this Wednesday, '' a total of 1,305 people have either been
released by the RUF or voluntarily returned to join their
families in areas in the country that are free of hostilities.''
</P>
<P>
''Government welcomes the gesture by the RUF as a
demonstration of their commitment to end the war quickly and
relieve our people of thae agony they have endure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the rebels ''to maintain the commitment by continuing
to facilitate the process of reuniting families and loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
''We are ready to receive all returnees and provide them with
food, shelter and security and assist them to reintegrate into
their communities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Demby said former combatants will be given the amnesty
announced by the government and provided with all benefits
offered to returnees.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Traffic Accident in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed in a
traffic accident on the Beirut-Damascus highway Wednesday
afternoon, a tragedy described by a local newspaper today as "the
last one of a series of massacres committed by killing trucks."
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a Mecerdez cargo truck knocked down
a taxi of Mecerdez limousine and a Dodge pickup at a cross road
in the town of Aley half way up Lebanon Mountain, the Beirut
conservative daily An-Nahar reported.
</P>
<P>
Five persons in the limousine, including four army servicemen,
the driver of the pickup and a woman walking on the roadside were
all killed while the truck driver and two others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Loaded with tons of sugar, the truck descending the mountain
along the highway in a horrible speed ran into the taxi and the
pickup climbing up from the opposite direction at 2:30
p.m. (11:30 GMT) and knocked them into a garage.
</P>
<P>
Policemen of the interior security forces and ambulances
arrived immediately at the venue but it took them several hours to
evacuate the dead and wounded because of the traffic jams created
by the incident in both directions of the road.
</P>
<P>
Several cars inside the garage or parked on the roadside were
badly damaged, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Investigations were not concluded, and police sources said that
the accident was probably caused by a failure of the truck's
brakes.
</P>
<P>
Local residents blame truck drivers, most of them are of
foreign nationalities, for frequent accidents on the international
highway.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a truck with Saudi plate driven by a
Pakistani ran into a school bus, killing seven pupils and their
teacher.

<HEADLINE> China Indignant At Japanese Ministers' Visit to Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its
indignation on the visits by some Japanese cabinet ministers to
the Yasukuni Shrine, where the remains of leading Japanese
militarists are worshiped.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang voiced the
indignation when he was asked to comment on this year's visits by
some Japanese cabinet ministers to the shrine, as some ministers
did in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Yasukuni Shrine is a place where the remains of Tojo Hideki and
other leading Japanese militarists are worshiped, Shen said, and
the visits by the Japanese cabinet ministers have "again seriously
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people who suffered from the
aggression by the Japanese militarism."
</P>
<P>
"We express our indignation over this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that to correctly understand and
treat that period of japanese history constitutes an important
part of the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations. It is also
an important condition for the Sino-Japanese friendship to develop
from generation to generation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Japanese side would earnestly introspect the
history of aggression and take the road of peace so as to win
trust from the peoples of Asian countries," Shen said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Officials Worship Military War Dead at Yasukuni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Six Japanese cabinet members
visited Yasukuni Shrine today to mourn Japan's military war dead,
including war criminals, enshrined there, on the 51st anniversary
of Japan's defeat in World War II.
</P>
<P>
They are all from Prime Minister Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic
Party which, together with the Social Democratic Party and the
Pioneer Party Sakigake, comprises Japan's tripartite ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Shumpei Tsukahara and
Transport Minister Yoshiyuki Kamei signed their names only in the
visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
While the rest of them, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Minister Ichizo Ohara, Home Affairs Minister Hiroyuki Kurata,
Defense Agency chief Hideo Usui and Science and Technology Agency
chief Hidenao Nakagawa, wrote their cabinet titles in the book,
indicating that they were visiting the shrine in their official
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Yasukuni, next to the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo,
enshrines some 2.4 million Japanese military personnel and
officials who died in Japan's wars of expansion and aggression in
the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead honored there were 14 class-A war criminals of
World War II, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and
others executed by the Far East Military Tribunal in Tokyo at the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
The Shrine, which was a bastion of the
militarist-government-sponsored Shintoism during the war, is and
has always been a political institution more than a religious one.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members' visits to the shrine have been criticized by
Asian neighboring countries and have been controversial at home
since Japan's postwar constitution stipulates separation of
religion and the state.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto became the first incumbent Japanese Prime
Minister to visit the shrine since Yasuhiro Nakasone did so in
1985, triggering protests from such neighboring nations as China,
the Democratic People Republic of Korea and South Korea, which
suffered bitterly under the militarist heels of the Japanese
empire.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Ritsuko Nagao and Hokkaido-Okinawa Development
Agency chief Saburo Okabe went to the shrine on August 7 and
Monday, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Against Liberian Warlords Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of Nine on Liberia
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMAS)
currently meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, is considering sanctions
against any factional leader in Liberia that fails to respect the
peace agreement from now on.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi, the current
chairman of the committee, last night listed some five sanctions
when he declared the meeting open.
</P>
<P>
He asked the committee to consider travel and residence
restrictions for the recalcitrant warlords, freezing of business
activities in member countries and exclusion from the planned
election in Liberia, strict observance of the United Nations
resolution of 1992 on arms embargo and lastly, the implementation
of the recent Organisation of African Unity decision made in
Yaounde, Cameroun, with regards to trial for human rights
violation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, the crux of the challenge before the
committee in its peace efforts for Liberia is to help create and
sustain the necessary framework and environment that would bring
to early fruition the desire of the Liberian people.
</P>
<P>
Other issues Ikimi asked the committee to examine include:
</P>
<P>
-- How best to ensure the commitment and faithful
implementation of the Abuja peace accord by all parties to the
Liberian conflict;
</P>
<P>
-- Examing how best to strenthen the west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG so that it can effectively discharge its
peacekeeping responsibilities;
</P>
<P>
-- How to ensure that the international community fulfils its
pledge to support the ECOWAS through logistics and financial
assistance.

LANZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Women's unions in northwest
China's Gansu Province have helped 110,000 farmer's families get
out of poverty over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the unions set up 48,000 centers that provide
60,000 classes to help eliminate illiteracy among poverty-stricken
women.
</P>
<P>
They have also set up 25 "Spring Bud" girls' classes which

their education.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 female farm technicians have played an important
role in the province's agricultural development after having
received a variety of training programs held by the women's
unions. The training programs have also helped more than a million
women laborers from the countryside find work in cities.

<P>
In addition, the unions called on women who understand farming
techniques and governmental officials to help poor families know
more about science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Central Bank Chief Calls for Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Kuwaiti
Central Bank Sheikh Salem Abdel Aziz Al-Sabah has called for new
measures to encourage private investment in local enterprises and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kuwaiti monthly al-Nour (Light)
magazine, which will be published Saturday, the governor asserted
the necessity to modify the policies on employment, pricing, and
taxes and fees imposed on foreign companies operating in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures were necessary to encourage foreign
firms to invest in local ventures.
</P>
<P>
So far, the public sector has dominated all of the country's
economic activities. But the government has devised an economic
strategy to encourage privatization and diversify sources of
income to lessen dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
Some provisions of the companies law have been recently
modified to attract foreign investments in the sectors of banks
and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government has sold stakes in state firms worth up
to more than one billion U.S. dollars, spearheading privatization
among the Gulf Arab states, although major challenges lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1994, government stakes in 13 companies have been
sold to some 30,000 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
However, privatization of wholly government-owned institutions
has yet to begin. There are limits as to how far privatization
in Kuwait is likely to go.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector, the engine of the Kuwaiti economy with a
turnout of two million barrels of oil a day, is set to remain
firmly in government hands although investors could be allowed to play
some role in distribution.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Residents Enjoy Rich Night Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Shops and restaurants in a
Chinese city have been urged to stay open later in a bid to inject
night life into the sleepy community.
</P>
<P>
Now night life is becoming increasingly richer and diverse in
Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. (Beijing Time), every evening the city center streets
are crowded, with shops still doing business, restaurants serving
late suppers and people chatting.
</P>
<P>
Main streets in the city, such as Renmin (People's) Road and
Zhongshan (Dr. Sun Yat-sen) Road are particularly busy with the
hustle and bustle of nightlife.
</P>
<P>
At the sight of this, a tourist from the southern part of China
says, "At long last Dalian has a real night life."
</P>
<P>
As a popular tourism city, Dalian receives more than 13 million
Chinese visitors and 100,000 foreign tourists a year. It has more
than 5,000 foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But in the 100-year-old port city, stores and entertainment
places used to close early.
</P>
<P>
Some local citizens and foreign business people complained that
without a rich and colorful night life, Dalian could not attract
more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
So the Dalian city government required all stores, shops and
restaurants, especially those in the city center, to extend their
business hours to at least 22:00.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dalian Public Bus Company also extended their
service hours until late at night.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak-Turkish Bilateral Ties to Be Enhanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLSMABAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and its Muslim
neighbor of Turkey believed that both countries should give top
priority to strengthen the bilateral economic and commercial
relations.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the major common understandings reached by the
leaders of the two countries during a three-day official visit to
Pakistan this week by Turkish Prime Minister Necmittin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, accompanied by ministers of defense, environment and
energy with an entourage of 255 members, arrived here on Monday
after his visit to Iran. He is the first Islamic prime minister to
visit Pakistan in Turkey's 73-year secular history.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who assumed his prime ministership in June this year,
held wide-ranging talks on bilateral, regional and international
issues with the Pakistani leaders during his stay here.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Tuesday between Erbakan and his Pakistani
counterpart Benazir Bhutto, the two leaders decided to give top
priority to further develop the economic and trade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to form a joint investment council to boost
the bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Bhutto and Erbakan expressed their satisfaction over the
continuous high level contacts between the two countries and
stressed the need for exchange of parliamentary and businessmen
delegations to strengthen political and commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan believed that the economic and commercial relations
between Turkey and Pakistan must reach the exemplary level of
their political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers had in-depth discussions on the
regional and international issues of common concern, and found
"remarkable similarities" on many of the issues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Afghan issue in her speech at the state
banquet in honor of Erbakan, Benazir said that turmoil in
Pakistan's neighbor had been a cause of deep concern and Pakistan
believed a solution of the problem had to emerge from the Afghans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that afghan leaders would have recourse to
intra-Afghan dialogue and agree to the establishment of a
broad-based government based on ground realities," she said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sculptures Improving Shanghai's Commercial Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- It used to be difficult to find
outstanding works of art in a city like Shanghai, with its dense
buildings, but a new stainless steel sculpture of birds with wings
outstretched in the city center is a good example of coordinating
art and environment and developing a Shanghai style.
</P>
<P>
One local resident cited Shanghai as a commercial city, saying
that "sculptures like 'Sea-gulls' help us enjoy the fragrance of
culture and art, and it is a nice touch in urban construction."
</P>
<P>
At the late 1980s, there were only a few major works of this
sort in Shanghai, but now, according to the Shanghai Urban
Sculpture Commission, there are more than 500 sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Sculptures went through an era of diversification during the
past ten years. According to professor Zhang Yonghao, director of
the commission, sculpture art in Shanghai is developing quickly.
</P>
<P>
Artists have produced a number of eminent sculptures, such as a
memorial statue by late Chen Yi, former mayor of the city, and the
decorative sculpture "Day and Night" at the Shanghai Railway
Station.
</P>
<P>
In addition to natural materials such as wood, marble, granite,
and bronze, modern materials such as stainless steel have been
also used to demonstrate advantages of the country's leading
industrial city and economic center.
</P>
<P>
Sculpture is an integral part of city culture and
beautification, and that of Shanghai, after a low period of time,
is heading for a new glory. Prof. Zhang says that the sculptures
have artistic harmony with their surroundings, but have broken
traditional rules in artistic creation, providing new ideas.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has been paying greater attention to
the importance of sculptures in the municipality's beautification
project.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlod Calls for Power Reconstitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Roosevelt Johnson, one of the
warring faction leaders in Liberia, has called for a
reconstitution of the country's six-man council of state as one
of the preconditions for the last peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Major-general Johnson, the leader of Ulimo-J, said Wednesday
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, there should be a chairperson and
vice chairperson of the reconstituted council of state to be
elected by the full council, or from nomination by armed factions
on the council.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is not a member of the council, the interim government
of liberia. He has been in Accra, capital of Ghana, in the wake
of the April 6 fighting in the Liberian capital of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Abuja on Monday before the opening of the
meeting of the ECOWAS committee of nine on Liberia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of Johnson's statement are also stated as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Ulimo-J and Ulimo-K shall split equally or "50-50" the
ministries and agencies allocated to Ulimo, consistent with the
Cotonou accord formula.
</P>
<P>
-- Because of the critical functions performed by the
ministries of foreign and internal affairs, information and the
Liberian broadcasting service, no one faction or organization
should be allocated more than one position each.
</P>
<P>
The faction leader urged for the repatriation/ resettlement of
Liberian refugees, free movement of persons and complete and
comprehensive disarmament before elections are held in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson accused some ECOWAS member countries of fuelling the
crisis in Liberia, saying "during the six years of the Liberia
conflict, some ECOWAS member states have openly supported the
NPFL and its recent ally Ulimo-K against Liberia, a fellow member
of ECOWAS".
</P>
<P>
"We are further aware that some officials of these ECOWAS
states desire and derive enormous political and economic benefits
from the continuation of the dealy conflict," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"These benefits explain the reluctance or refusal of these
officials to advocate for or support the effort for an end to the
crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, members of the Liberia Council of State, including
leaders of the major three warring factions in the country,
signed in Abuja a statement reaffirming that they would strictly
follow the Abuja peace accord inked last August for the
restoration of peace in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, Johnson's statement just contains some amendments to
"specified provisions of the august 19, 1995 abuja agreement",
local analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Outlines Challenges Faced by Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today outlined three basic challenges faced by
Asia in achieving what he referred to as an Asian renaissance.
</P>
<P>
The challenges are domestic reform and revolution, regional
friendship and prosperity, and contributing to a better, more just
and more productive new world order.
</P>
<P>
"Asia has done well so far but there is no time for euphoria...
We must understand that we have only just begun," he said while
opening the 1996 regional conference of Harvard Clubs of Asia
here.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the domestic challenge is perhaps by far the
most important, Mahathir said for Asia to grow and prosper it must
accept and manage reform and revolution in individual Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Asian countries must now lay the foundations for
equally tremendous economic results for the future after having
done remarkably well in the past.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the second challenge, Mahathir said Asia needs to
escape the mind-set dictated in other continents, many of whom
might not have a similar interest in Asian peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said now is the most opportune time to launch the East Asian
peace "when tensions are at their ebb, when nations are relaxed,
when peace is already there".
</P>
<P>
He said East Asia must be strongly wedded to the principle of
"open regionalism" and if they cooperate on issues of trade, it
would result in reducing the barriers not only between them but
with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
On the third challenge, he said Asia must rise and make a
greater contribution to the global commonwealth of man. "In order
to do this, Asia must put its own house in order," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asia must empower itself, must be worthy of leadership and must
rise to the challenge of contribution, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Methods To Help the Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A new method the Chinese
government is using to assist poor people in rural areas is to
send large numbers of specialists and technicians from cities to
underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
In the Dabie mountainous area, which covers part of Anhui
Province in eastern China, and parts of Hubei and Henan provinces
in central China, they have had made successes in teaching farmers
to plant mulberry trees, breed silkworms, and process silk.
</P>
<P>
Planting mulberry trees and breeding silkworms were a
traditional undertaking in the Dabie area, but local farmers
lacked a scientific background in silkworm breeding and
processing, and as a result, production was only done on a small
scale for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The central government has now designated 21 counties in the
area as priority poor counties for this. With the help of
technicians from cities, farmers have also learned to prevent and
control mulberry tree diseases and pests, and mulberry tree
planting and silkworm breeding have grown quickly in the area,
thanks to the technicians' help.
</P>
<P>
As in the case of many poor areas, Dabie is rich in natural
resources, but did not know how to develop them, so new research
efforts have been made to develop local resources. An example is
a large-scale hi-tech silkworm breeding industry known as the
"Dabie mode of assisting poor people".
</P>
<P>
In 1986, incomes were 260 yuan, but by 1995, they had risen to
1,097 yuan; in 1986 there were 5.6 million people below the
poverty line, but by 1995 that had dropped significantly to 1.2
million; while 1986's revenues of 1.5 billion yuan had climbed
dramatically to 5.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, over 100 specialists have been to the
area to help the local poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the State Science and Technology Commission, Anhui,
Hubei, and Henan provinces have launched 80 pilot projects, and
allocated more than 300 million yuan to help the poor.

Over the past decade, Anhui has undertaken nearly 200
aid-the-poor projects and spent 47 million yuan building mulberry
and fruit tree orchards, and tea plantations, benefitting 75
percent of poor families.
</P>
<P>
In Henan, some companies such as the Huaying Industry Company
and the Sanhe Group, for example, have helped thousands of duck
farmers by providing technical services and then buying their
products. Last year, the companies had a turnover of 300 million
yuan and paid 20 million yuan in taxes to the government. The duck
farmers, in turn, earned an average of 8,000 yuan per family.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,0000 rural families are now raising ducks and
other domestic animals, with the help of 960 service
companies. Eight poor counties in Henan have built more than 30
major industrial project with total output value exceeding three

<HEADLINE> Hainan Improves Medical Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Government officials in Hainan
Province, who used to spend little on medical services, now have
to pay 30 to 40 percent of hospital expenses as a result of
provincial medical reforms.
</P>
<P>
China's youngest province has had some progress in reforming
its medical care system, starting last July, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are aimed at eliminating medical malpractice that
occurred in the old public health care system, and reducing waste
in medical resources and providing medicare for all employees,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, medical insurance will take eleven
percent of an employee's monthly salary, and the employer will pay
ten percent and the employee one percent.
</P>
<P>
Five percent of that amount, recorded in an individual account
book, will be set aside for outpatient services, with the rest,
part of a "help-each-other" account, going to regular patient
services.
</P>
<P>
Those covered by the insurance will have treatment for 184
kinds of diseases, with 751 kinds of Western medicine and 384
kinds of Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The new system, which took effect last September, has been
declared a success, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
By last March, the number of people at the outpatient clinic at
Haikou People's Hospital, the province's largest, dropped
significantly, and outpatient service costs dropped by 63.57
percent. The number of regular patients and the cost of caring for
them went down by 66.67 percent and 63.97 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, 96,434 people from 1,427 government
departments and enterprises, 31,154 of whom are in the capital
city of Haikou, had obtained medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
While the move is welcomed by old state-run enterprises with
heavy health care burdens and non-state-run enterprises which
formerly weren't covered by medical insurance, the reforms are not
liked by cadres and workers who have been under the auspices of
public health service in the era of the planned economy, because
they now have to share part of the medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and workers from state-run enterprises
used to spend little on medical services, but now have to pay 30
to 40 percent of the total cost if they want to use a hospital's
services.

<HEADLINE> Soybean to Offer More Protein to Chinese Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Foodstuffs made from soybeans
will be used to add protein into the daily diets of children who
live in China's underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, a cup of soybean milk or some other
kind of soybean food will be provided every day to students in
control groups in 22 selected primary and middle schools in China.
</P>
<P>
The nutrition program, called the National Soybean Action Plan,
was initiated last year by experts with the State Food and
Nutrition Counseling Committee, who were concerned about
malnutrition of children in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Certain physical conditions of those students, such as their
height, weight and hemoglobin levels, will be recorded for 18
months. After that, researchers will compare statistics between
the schoolchildren in the study and youngsters who do not eat any
food made from soybeans.
</P>
<P>
This effort is a prelude to a national campaign to spread the
use of soybean-enriched food, and improve the physical conditions
of youngsters who live in China's economically backward areas,
said Jiang Jianpin, an official for the program.
</P>
<P>
A national survey shows that the amount of protein taken in by
rural children aged 6-12 is lower on average than that of their
urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Partially because of this, the average height and weight of
rural children are also lower than that of children in the city,
the survey report claims.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition caused by a lack of protein and calories is also
blamed on the high rate of anemia, rickets and developmental
retardation, according to the survey statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Because they lack money to buy meat, milk and other
protein-rich food, many people in poor areas can't get enough
protein from daily meals," a nutritionist said. "Eating soybean
food is a both cheap and effective way to do this."
</P>
<P>
Five groups of nutrition experts will work with the selected
schools to educate students and teachers about daily nutrition,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The study results will be introduced to schools in about 100
cities and counties across the country in the next several years,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mt. Merapi Continues to Spew Fumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Mountain Merapi in central Java,
1,200 kilometers east of Jakarta, continued to spew thick fumes
and lava, threatening the upper regions of Bebeng, Krasak and
Boyong rivers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of Yogjakarta's Volcanology
Directorate, said today that people living near the volcano,
particularly in its southwestern region, have already been alerted
for possible evacuation, Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yogjakarta with a population of 1 million is only 30 kilometers
north of the Merapi volcano.
</P>
<P>
"I keep on reminding the people living at the declared danger
zone to stay alert," he said, adding that lava has been flowing
toward the rivers of the volcano's southwestern slope.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that in the past 12 hours, Merapi emitted at
least 49 times big volcanic debris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suramto, one of the staff from the Kaliurang
monitoring post, said that continuous thundering sounds can be
heard from Merapi while non-stop emission of lava can also be
observed.
</P>
<P>
The 2,962-meter high Merapi volcano, one of the most active
volcanoes in Indonesia, last erupted in 1993, forcing over 6,000
people to leave their houses and killing over 60 others, mainly
from burns inflicted by clouds of heat.
</P>
<P>
There are 127 volcanoes classified as active in Indonesia which
has a total of 500 volcanoes.

<HEADLINE> Acting Turkish PM to Fly to Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Acting Turkish Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller announced that she would fly to
northern Cyprus later today to discuss the new Cyprus incident
occurred Wednesday with Turkish Cypriot leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the announcement today in Ceyhan town of Adana
province, southern Turkey. She said, " Why we are going to
Cyprus? I'm saying openly. If they dare to pull down our flag, we
will break their hand."
</P>
<P>
She added that "we want peace. But peace needs conditions."
</P>
<P>
Ciller also made a written statement Wednesday, saying that
the "provocative acts" of the Greek Cypriots will not help make a
legal and permanent settlement to the Cyprus problem and will not
help make an atmosphere of confidence that Turkey has desired
for.
</P>
<P>
She said, "These provocations should be stopped. That is a
wrong path. It is impossible to reach anywhere with those
activities."
</P>
<P>
State Minister Abdullah Gul, who is accompanying Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan visiting Singapore, said Wednesday, "No
country in the world would accept the pulling down of its
flag. The incident (in Cyprus) is a grave instigation."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
demonstrator as he tried to bring down the Turkish flag on the
edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death Sunday in
clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish troops
in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern Cyprus
and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire on anyone
crossing the Green Line dividing Cyprus into Turkish Cypriot north
and Greek Cypriot south.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since the Turkish
troops landed on the island in 1974 in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup by supporter of union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin announced his new cabinet today, on the orders of
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president had to form a new government after his
re-election on July 3 but has kept many of the ministers from his
previous cabinet, although there has been some re-shuffling of
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The make-up of the new cabinet indicates that Yeltsin is likely
to continue his government's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
A number of key ministers keep their posts including Defense
Minister Igor Rodinov, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin has brought in several newcomers, including
Vladimir Potanin, head of the large private bank Unexim who will
be in charge of macroeconomic policy. He joins
the government as one of three first deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The other two first deputy prime ministers are Alexei
Bolshakov, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's deputy in the former
cabinet, and Viktor Ilyushin, formerly Yeltsin's top aide.
</P>
<P>
Bolshakov, who will deputize for Chernomyrdin in his absence,
will be in charge of industrial policy and Ilyushin will be
responsible for social problems.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who was re-appointed prime minister by Yeltsin
after his swearing in as president on August 9, also named
seven deputy prime ministers - Vladimir Babichev, Oleg Davydov,
Alexander Livshits, Alexander Zaveryukha, Vitaly Ignatenko, Oleg
Lobov and Valery Serov.
</P>
<P>
Babichev is also head of government administration, Davydov
takes on foreign trade and Livshits takes on the job of finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
But a number of ministerial posts are still vacant.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The public transport authorities in Paris have
banned the poor from selling their news pamphlets on the capital's
subway trains and stations. The ban was imposed to give passengers
peace and quiet and stop them being pestered.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time since 1992, Sarajevo airport re-started
commercial flights today. An Air Bosnia plane flying from Istanbul
to the Croat city of Split was due to land at Sarajevo airport
this morning to bring in the first group of passengers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France's budgetary deficit fell by 1.5 billion francs (300
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1996 comparing with
the same period of last year. Tax revenue increased 6.4 percent in
the first half, lower than the government's target of 7.6 percent
for 1996 but higher than the 5.5 percent registered by the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
-- The turnover of France's major insurance companies rose
considerably in the first quarter of 1996. Experts are worried
that this increase will jeopardize the government's favorable tax
policy for life insurance.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Republican Party is creating an illusion to secure
the support of moderate voters. The Republicans have put on a big
media show to cover up dissatisfaction within the party with Bob
Dole's electoral platform. President Bill Clinton has criticized
the convention for its hypocrisy.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges to Stop Capital Market Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said today that his government would guarantee
state-issued bonds and do whatever necessary to ensure their
stability, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after holding urgent consultations with
Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Bank of Israel Governor Yacov
Frenkel on the current capital market crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that Bank of Israel will, in coordination with
the Finance Ministry, prepare an economic security net.
</P>
<P>
At the Tel Aviv stock exchange this morning, sale orders of
bonds totalled half a billion shekels (about 166 million
U.S. dollars), a third of what was registered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The record-high sale orders of 1.4 billion shekels (466 million
dollars) reflected withdrawals of nearly 3 billion shekels (1
billion dollars) requested from the provident funds for September.
</P>
<P>
Capital market analysts blamed the deterioration in the bond
market on the provident funds' recently registered negative
yields. Since the start of the year the funds have registered
negative real yields of 1.5 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
One analyst said Minister Meridor's saying on Monday that the
"capital market is sick" caused even more panic.
</P>
<P>
"The public has lost its confidence in the capital
market. People feel that if they do not exit the market now, they
are likely to lose all their money," said one trader.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Knesset (parliament) approved an amendment to
enable the government to increase it sales of Treasury bills, so
as to finance the Bank of Israel's purchase of bonds.
</P>
<P>
The amendment is part of the Treasury and Bank of Israel's
efforts to provide a safety net for the bond market. However, the
Knesset limited the amount of T-Bills the government may sell,
reducing investors' confidence in the effect the security net can
have in stopping the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The public's abandonment of the funds is widely attributed to
the availability of relatively attractive short-term saving plans,
which offer returns ostensibly higher than the provident funds.
</P>
<P>
According to Treasury figures, more than 800 million shekels
(266 million dollars) were deposited into various short-and
medium-term saving plans in July, compared with withdrawals of 943
million shekels (314 million dollars) from the provident funds.
</P>
<P>
Provident funds, for decades Israel's most popular long-term
savings instrument, are bank-managed plans with 90 percent of
deposits in bonds and the remainder in shares. The money may be
redeemed at any time at the cost of a 35 percent tax, and at no
cost if withdrawn 15 years after the plan is opened.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said Wednesday that the
root of the provident-fund crisis was at the Bank of Israel's
tight-money policy, which has raised short-term interest rates to
a level that makes long-term investment unattractive.
</P>
<P>
This was echoed by Ya'acov Sheinin, General Manager of the
Firm Economic Models. "The Israel's economy is now paying the
price of the attempt to bring down inflation at any price,"
Sheinin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that trying to subdue inflation by raising interest
rates and manipulating the exchange rate had failed, and that
there had to be a devaluation of over 10 percent, coupled with a
reduction in interest rates.

<HEADLINE> SSA Enjoys Fast Growth In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Since it began business in China
in 1990, System Software Associates (SSA) has seen the number of
its customers expanding to more than 500 major and medium-sized
Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Jim Ye, general manager of SSA (China) Co., Ltd., said at a
press conference today that SSA reached a sales volume of about
ten million US dollars last year, ten times the figure reported in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Roger Covey, chairman of the SSA board of directors, discussed
SSA's latest product, BPCS Client/Server Version 6.0, at the press
conference, saying SSA spent 280 million US dollars in a two-year
period to develop the software product.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with our business development in China," said
Covey, who founded the company in 1981. He added that SSA's growth
in China has been quicker than it was in Europe, but is almost on
par with its expansion in the United States,
</P>
<P>
Covey, who can speak some Chinese, said he has a deep interest
in the Chinese culture. He founded the Tang Research Foundation in
1991 in Chicago, and even briefly stopped working for SSA to
devote his time to studying China's Tang dynasty.
</P>
<P>
He said that his understanding of Chinese culture contributes
to his company doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
"Many American companies come to China and do business the
American way, instead of the Chinese way," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that many American businessmen have to go to a third
party, such as a business consultant, to come to a better
understanding of their relations with the Chinese staff.
</P>
<P>
He said he understands his Chinese subordinates easily and
there is no cultural barrier between them.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, representatives of the first
customer of the BPCS Client/Server Version 6.0, the Bohai Aluminum
Industries Ltd. (BAIL), signed a contract with Covey. The Bohai
company is a joint venture between the China International Trust
and Investment Corporation (CITIC) and Reynolds Metals from the
US, the world's third largest aluminum producer.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Party Concerned over Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Palang Dharma (virtue
force) Party (PDP) said it pulled out of the government Wednesday
because key government leaders had failed to clarify scandals
involving them.
</P>
<P>
The scandals had further lessened the public's trust in the
government, said PDP deputy leader Chaiwat Sinsuwong last night.
</P>
<P>
PDP's handwritten resignation letter said the current
circumstances "are neither convenient nor beneficial for Palang
Dharma to continue its government duty."
</P>
<P>
Chaiwat cited two of the scandals plaguing the government.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Justice Minister Chalerm Yubamrung alleged that
three private business groups had each paid 750 million baht (30
million US dollars) to unidentified government leaders as
kickbacks to win the bidding to set up new commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Rakesh Saxena, a former adviser to the
financially-troubled Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC), claimed he
contributed 300 million baht (12 million US dollars) to Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's Chart Thai (Thai nation) party
during the general elections last year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has denied the two allegations and ordered
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, the PDP's pullout was timed with an opposition plan to
launch a censure debate next month, with the prime minister as the
only target.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal would make PDP avoid a dilemma whether to vote
for or against the prime minister in the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned scandals would be only two of several
topics to be raised by the opposition in parliament against
Banharn.
</P>
<P>
The opposition believes that the Banharn government has been
badly tarnished by corruption allegations, poor performance,
unclear economic policies, and intra-government and intra-party
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Following PDP's pullout, the coalition government is left with
six parties, which control a total of 209 seats in the 391-member
lower house, only 13 seats more than the minimum number a
government needs.
</P>
<P>
The Nation newspaper said today that the prime minister has
clearly lost control and some of his coalition partners do not
respect him. The options for his government have narrowed down to
a house dissolution or a coalition reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"The ship is sinking and there is no one else to blame but the
captain," said the Nation in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who is leader of
the second largest opposition party, the Chart Pattana (national
development) party, said, "The government is falling by itself....
The best way out for Banharn is to resign and the worst way is to
dissolve the house."
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader, former prime minister Chuan Leekpai said,
"It is hard to predict whether the government will resign or
dissolve the house, because each government has its own level of
political conscience."

<HEADLINE> Eight Members of Moslem Brotherhood Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Supreme Military Court
today convicted eight members of the Moslem Brotherhood for
attempting to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Seven of them were sentenced to three years in prison, while
the other one was given a one-year suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
Five other defendants on trial were acquited.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the 13 men, which began last June, was held at a
military base some 40 kilometers east of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Moslem Brotherhood, the largest Islamic
fundamentalist group in Egypt, has been tolerated by the
government for years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Trading of Fresh Highway B Shares Brisk at Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Securities
Exchange saw a brisk trading of a highway B share listed here
today.
</P>
<P>
The trading of the Guangdong Highway B Share for the whole day
stood at 4.582 million shares, or 3.39 percent of the total 135
million shares, and closed at 4.4 yuan a share, 24.3 percent
higher than the issuance price.
</P>
<P>
The share, issued by the Highway Development Co., Ltd. of
Guangdong Province, is the first highway stock on the Chinese
inland area's B share market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the number of motor vehicles in the
province has been growing at an annual rate of 25 percent, much
higher than the national average. Three highways run by the
company is expected to report 208 million yuan in after-tax
profits this year, an increase of 75 percent over that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Thus it is quite natural for overseas investors to be
optimistic about the future of the company, a securities analyzer
said.
</P>
<P>
Several listed companies on the Hong Kong stock market dealing
mainly in highway shares from the inland areas have registered a
market profit rate of over 20 times, according to securities
analyzers. And the market profit rate for the Guangdong B share is
less than ten times, so there is much room for it to go up, they
predicted.
</P>
<P>
There are two securities exchanges in China. The other one is
in Shanghai.

COLOMBO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's intelligence

south India in order to deceive the international community that
the refugees in Kilinochchi were without food, official sources
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the facts were quite to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had plundered 40 truckloads of food sent by the

<HEADLINE> Moldova Refuses to Sign Peace Memorandum With Rebel Dnestr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Mircea
Snegur has refused to sign a Russian-brokered peace memorandum to
settle a conflict between Moldova and its eastern breakaway region
of Dnestr, Romanian media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Snegur was quoted by the newspaper Adevarul (Truth) as saying
that the memorandum, due to be signed later this month, didn't set
out the status of Dnestr as being an integral part of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, signing such a memorandum would violate Moldova's
territorial integrity, set a dangerous example for Europe and
plunge Dnestr, Moldova's industrial hub, into deeper unrest, said
Snegur.
</P>
<P>
Snegur said he is expecting to hold talks with rebel Dnestr
leaders over how to define the region's political status while
ensuring the integrity of Moldova's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Dnestr region declared independence in 1990 before the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Dnestr's mostly Russian-speaking
Slav population feared they would be sidelined should there be a
merger between Moldova, where there is an ethnic Romanian
majority, and Romania. Much of Moldova belonged to Romania before
it was annexed by Moscow in 1940.
</P>
<P>
After Moldovan independence in 1991, war broke out between
Dnestr troops and Moldovan forces who wanted to bring the region
back into Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops were deployed in 1992 to stop ethnic clashes
which had left hundreds dead before the self-proclaimed Dnestr
Republic negotiated an uneasy peace with the Moldovan government.
</P>
<P>
Trying to polish his pre-election image as a peacemaker,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin brokered a memorandum on the
principles for a settlement of the Dnestr conflict during his
reelection campaign,
</P>
<P>
Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe acted as mediators in the talks.

MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian
Development Bank today approved a loan of 45 million US dollars to
help more girls in Pakistan to complete quality primary education
and prepare for secondary schooling and eventual employment.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the money will be used to finance "The Second
Girls Primary School Sector Project" which will help set up some
1,000 community model schools in 25 percent of all rural villages
and strengthen the capacity to support existing schools.
</P>
<P>
The bank approved its first initiative in girls primary
education in Pakistan with a loan of 35.3 million US dollars in
1989.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new project, about 7,500 girls who
previously lacked access to schooling are expected to be enrolled
annually in the first or second grade, about 120,000 girls who
would have dropped out after the second grade because of a
shortage of classrooms will be able to continue schooling.
</P>
<P>
Annually, some 35,000 girls who have left school will be able
to enter the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
The project will also continue to promote the Pakistan
government to increase educational opportunities for girls,
especially in rural areas, promote literacy, and improve the
status of women.

<HEADLINE> Seven Drug-runners Executed in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven convicted drug dealers,
including four from Hong Kong, were executed here today for
trafficking 598.85 kilograms of heroin, the largest amount of the
drug confiscated since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court today pronounced
ten people guilty of heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Those executed today in Shenzhen were Wang Shijian, Wu
Shichang, Guo Weiqiang, and Hong Kong residents Huang Tiansun,
Yang Xiaoji, Li Guoquan and Chen Hongzai.
</P>
<P>
Three others also found guilty of the drug trafficking were Lai
Fuyong, who was sentenced to death but given a two-year reprieve;
Lu Jianbang, who was sentenced to life in prison; and Zhu
Binsheng, who received a seven-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a businessman from Fujian Province, along with Hong Kong
residents Huang and Yang, began dealing in drugs with overseas
traffickers in early 1996. On March 16, the group met in
Guangzhou, where 70 cases of drugs, each containing 700 grams
of heroin, were transferred to Huang.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wang and Lai bought more heroin worth 28.3
million yuan, and transported it to Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> U.S. D'amato Bill Not Acceptable, Germany FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel has described a new U.S. law imposing sanctions on foreign
companies investing in Iran and Libya as unacceptable and said it
could upset German-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Bild-Zeitung newspaper today quoted Kinkel as saying
Germany cannot accept legislation by another country dictating
what country it can trade with. Kinkel stressed that if
Washington insists on implementing the bill, also known as the
D'Amato Bill, European countries will have to consider retaliatory
measures.
</P>
<P>
The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act was signed into law by
U.S. President Bill Clinton last week. The law threatens sanctions
against foreign companies who invest more than 40 million
U.S. dollars a year in the oil and gas industries in Iran and
Libya. The U.S. wants to penalize the two countries, which it
believes sponsor international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the bill has brought "slight disharmony" to
German-U.S. relations. He also expressed the hope that American
sanctions would not develop into a trade war between Europe and
the U.S..

<HEADLINE> E-mail Case Ends in Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A highly-publicized fraud case
involving E-mail is coming to an end, with both sides agreeing to
mediation.
</P>
<P>
In April, Xue Yange, a female graduate student at Beijing
University, was admitted to the University of Michigan via E-mail,
and was offered an 18,000 US dollar scholarship.
</P>
<P>
But Xue's enrollment was refused, also through E-mail, by
someone using her name.
</P>
<P>
Xue suspected her roommate, Zhang Nan, and she took legal
action against Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The Haidian Moderate People's Court opened a court session on
July 9, but due to the complexity of this case, the court asked
for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to Xue's legal representative, during a court
mediation on August 13, Zhang confessed and told the court how she
sent the E-mail refusal to the Michigan school.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to accept the court's mediation. As
compensation, the defendant will pay Xue 12,000 Yuan (about 1,500
US dollars) for both material and spiritual losses, and will make
a public apology.
</P>
<P>
Judge Sun Weimin confirmed the outcome of the mediation this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Xue's legal representative said that the University of Michigan
has decided to re-enroll Xue and give her a scholarship of about
20,000 US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Greek Cypriots Responsible for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan said today that the Greek Cypriots should be responsible
for the sad incident which took place in Cyprus Wednesday,
according to a report reaching here from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who is now visiting Singapore, said, "Turkey and Greece
are both neighboring countries. But, unfortunately, we have seen
the provocations for every incident from our neighbor. It is clear
that the results of the provocations are the possibilities of the
incidents. So, the Greek Cypriots must be responsible for all the
incidents which have occurred."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan is now on his first foreign trip since coming to power
in June, which already took him to Iran and Pakistan. He is
scheduled to visit Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On the visit to northern Cyprus later today by acting Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, Erbakan said that for
this point Turkey always works together with northern Cyprus and
Ciller will investigate the incident there.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said today in Ceyhan town of Adana province, southern
Turkey, "Why we are going to Cyprus? I'm saying openly. If they
dare to pull down our flag, we will break their hand."
</P>
<P>
She added that " we want peace. But peace needs conditions."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
protester as he tried to bring down the Turkish flag on the edge
of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The sad development occurred after the funeral of another
Greek Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death Sunday
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
following a coup backed by Athens in the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in the northern
part of the island in 1983. But their self-declared republic is
only recognized by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot government is
internationally recognized.

SHANGHAI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A top French bank official
announced here today that his bank will set up branches in
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
Erik Lescar, vice-president of the Banque Francaise du Commerce
Exterieur, said that he has sent an official application to the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 overseas financial organizations, including some
world-famous banks, insurance and security companies, have
officially applied to open branches in Shanghai in recent years,
according to an official from the Shanghai Branch of the People's
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur is one of the most
active international banks of commerce, providing funds for large
projects, export credit and world trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it invested money through its Hong Kong office to
finance construction of China's first nuclear power station. In
1994, it opened its office in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Lescar said his bank has noticed the ever-increasing expansion
of Shanghai's opening up, and the fierce competition between
overseas banks that want to set up branches there.
</P>
<P>
He said his bank's loans to China amount to more than two
billion US dollars, indicating that China's economy and financial
market have great potential.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China is working to turn the
80th Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair into a first-class
international exhibition, a senior trade official said in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The fair, which opens October 15, is jointly sponsored by
various Chinese economic and trade enterprises, and is organized
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
and south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong said at a news
conference here today that the fair's accumulated export
transactions have reached 190 billion US dollars and it has
recorded attendance of 1.6 million since it was inaugurated in
1957.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Fair, the largest of its kind in China, has
evolved into a comprehensive, multifunctional and international
trade fair, enjoying the highest level of recognition and best
records of export dealings, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The fair has been praised by the international trade and
economic community as the "bridge of trade and tie of friendship."
</P>
<P>
Exhibition area at the fair totals 160,000 square meters, with
more than 5,500 display booths. Nearly 3,000 enterprises show more
than 100,000 types of goods.

<P>
Liu said that preparations for the upcoming fair are in full
swing.

<HEADLINE> China Agrees To Submission of Draft Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China has agreed to forward the
disputed draft of a global nuclear test ban treaty to the
Conference on Disarmament (CD), China's ambassador to the
disarmament talks Sha Zukang said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not entirely satisfied with the treaty text as
it fails to fully reflect the legitimate claims of many developing
countries including China, the ambassador said in a statement on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the conference's ad hoc committee which has
been drafting the treaty, Sha said that since the committee failed
to reach a consensus, an ad hoc committee report should be
attached to the draft text to be sent to the Conference.
</P>
<P>
A compromise formula proposed on Wednesday by the
U.S. delegation to clear up opposition to the draft Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was rejected by India.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have been working on the CTBT since 1994 and are
trying to finalize the treaty by mid-August so that the 61-nation
Conference on Disarmament can submit the treaty for signature at
the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador repeated China's long-standing support
for the complete prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons as
well as the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of achieving a comprehensive ban on nuclear
weapons test explosions," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
"China firmly believes that the conclusion of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will contribute to nuclear disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
However, Sha pointed out that China is not entirely satisfied
with the text, repeating China's stand on the restricted use of
national technical means for verifying the treaty.
</P>
<P>
China has rejected Western-inspired clauses allowing national
means such as satellite data and news reports to be used as a
basis for launching on-site inspection requests. It wants only
data from the treaty's network of seismic monitoring stations used.
</P>
<P>
On on-site inspection (OSI), Sha said that this should be
approved by a two-thirds majority of the 51 members of the
Executive Council of the future treaty organization, in order to
prevent the abuse of inspections of potential treaty violations.
</P>
<P>
China had earlier accepted the option of approving OSI requests
by 30 votes out of the 51 members (59 percent). But Sha said that
this compromise was solely to facilitate an early conclusion of
the treaty.
