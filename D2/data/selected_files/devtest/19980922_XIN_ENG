<HEADLINE> Global Economic Crisis Calls for Global Solution: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian downturn has
triggered a worldwide economic crisis and all parts of the
international system need to come together to find global
solutions to this truly global crisis, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Annan was delivering a speech at the
opening of the two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly. Speakers from 181 countries, including 26 heads
of state and 19 prime ministers, are expected to take the floor to
voice their views on a wide range of matters of international
concern.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian downturn has triggered a worldwide economic crisis,
with devastating social consequences," he said. "Some of the most
successful economies have been plunged into recession, at a speed
which has taken the whole international community by surprise."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, which broke out in July 1997 in
Thailand, has spread to Russia, and even the markets of North
America and Europe are not immune.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, it is the most vulnerable groups which are the
hardest hit," Annan said. "The countries whose economies had taken
only the first faltering steps on the road of recovery are the
ones that now find themselves in greatest jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
The solution to the current economic turmoil worldwide lies in
the global efforts, rather than the talks by the Group of Seven
industrialized countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get together to find the answers, but who should
sit at the table? The day is past when the seven major
industrialized powers could or should take on the task alone," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Nor can this crisis be left only to finance ministers and
central bankers, although their contribution is essential," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"All parts of the international system need to come together,
to find global solutions to this truly global crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the issues this crisis raises are not just financial or
economic -- or social or political for that matter: they are all
of those things at once, he said, adding that "they must be
addressed on all those fronts."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which is the global institution par
excellence, has "an inescapable duty to respond," he said, voicing
his hope to see the U.N. participation in discussions on the new
world "financial architecture," such as those suggested by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Held into Long-term Effects of Heading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A investigation into the
long-term effects of heading has been by carried by the English
Professional Footballers' Association, the PFA said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the results won't be available for several years,
studies in both America and Scandinavia show heading the ball
over a lengthy period of time throughout a player's career
increases the risk of brain damage and may result in illnesses
such as senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
These tests, though, have been conducted from a retrospective
viewpoint, with former players and managers employed to help with
the research, leading the PFA to take a more forward-thinking
approach.
</P>
<P>
PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said: "We have become more
involved in this subject because there have been a number of
universities and medical people looking for funds to research
this properly.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Global Action Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called for global action in an anti-terrorism
campaign because individual action by U.N. member states cannot
provide a solution.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is a global menace, which clearly calls for global
action," he said. "Individual actions by member states, whether
aimed at state of non-state actor, cannot in themselves provide a
solution. We must meet this threat together."
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly, Annan said that a dramatic increase in attacks
on U.N. and associated personnel "prompts us to reflect on the
conditions in which we send civilian staff into war zones where,
too often, combatants seem less and less willing to respect their
neutral status."
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned networks of terrorism and drug trafficking and
the August 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds
of Africans in assaults on two American embassies. Washington took
a unilateral step to retaliate with missile attacks on alleged
terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We had perhaps the most frightening glimpse yet of this
uncivil society a few weeks ago, with the terrorist bombings in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam," he said. "What shocks us about
terrorism is its indiscriminate character. Unhappily we have also
to be concerned about violence that is more precisely targeted."
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say, also, that the perpetrators of these attacks
are almost never brought to justice," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Calls for Action on Financial Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Monday that an inactive
attitude toward the impact of the Asian financial crisis can have
a high cost.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he said the measures
adopted by world economic powers to tackle the impact of the
crisis "still fall short of what is needed."
</P>
<P>
"The events of the past few months have revealed a serious lag
between growing financial interdependence and the modest
effectiveness of existing international mechanisms for dialogue
and coordination," Lampreia said.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia, the first speaker at the general debate of the 53rd
session of the General Assembly, said the world cannot depend only
on the willingness, capacity and interest of a select number of
countries to mobilize and lead international efforts to deal with
global economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil will continue to fight for a more balanced allocation
of the benefits of economic interdependence, without distortions
such as those resulting from protectionist policies of developed
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the current context of global economic turbulence, we must
demand from the developed nations greater coherence between
free-trade rhetoric and their unfair trade practices," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Main Opposition Wins in District Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) Monday
emerged the winner again in the polls held last Friday in the 11
districts of the mid-western development region.
</P>
<P>
Results published by the Election Commission show that the
CPN-UML bagged five posts of chairman in Dailekh, Surkhet, Mugu,
Jumla and Dolpa in addition to seven posts of vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
The party won the posts of both chairman and vice chairman in
Dailekh, Surkhet, Mugu and Dolpa.
</P>
<P>
Besides, its 43 candidates were elected members of the district
development committees (DDC) in all the 11 districts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a senior party official said his party won all the
nine posts of member in Dolpa district. But the Election
Commission said the party obtained only four.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 chairmen and 11 vice chairmen along with 116
members were elected for the DDCs in Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla,
Kalikot, Dang, Piuthan, Banke, Bardiya, Dailekh and Surkhet.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) was the runner-up with four
chairman posts in Dang, Banke, Bardiya and Humla and one vice
chairman post.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of its candidates were elected members in some
districts.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which
broke away from the CPN-UML in March this year and joined the
government in late August, did not win a single key post.
</P>
<P>
It lost even in Bardiya district, the constituency of its
General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam where the NC and the CPN-UML
formed an alliance.
</P>
<P>
Political parties formed alliance with one another in the
elections considered crucial for them in the general elections due
to be held before November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Polls were not held last year in these districts because
elections for village development committees (VDC) there were not
completed due to violence by the ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Polls were held last year respectively for VDCs and
municipalities in May and DDCs in July in 56 of the 75 districts
in Nepal, in which the CPN-UML won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
But most of the mayors, deputy mayors, DDC chairmen, vice
chairmen and members elected at that time have joined the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
As the CPN-ML and the splinter group of the National Democratic
Party (RPP) led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand
are yet to be recognized by the Election Commission as national
parties, their candidates contested the elections as independents.
</P>
<P>
An independent backed by RPP (Chand) was elected vice chairman
in Banke district, while the other RPP faction led by former prime
minister Surya Bahadur Thapa won one seat of chairman and one seat
of vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said the polls were conducted
peacefully in all the 11 districts.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Statistics on Africa Depressing, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that the AIDS statistics on Africa are extremely
depressing when opening an international conference
on AIDS here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said over two thirds (or 21 million men, women and
children) of people living with AIDS around the world are in
sub-Sahara Africa. The cumulative number of AIDS orphans in the
continent was 7.8 million at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Sahara African countries account for 83 percent of AIDS
deaths in the world, 87 percent of the children living with AIDS
and 80 percent of women suffering the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that unprotected sex accounted for
most of the 3.4 million new HIV infections among adults in
sub-Sahara Africa in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a cure, emphasis should be placed on safe
sexual behavior and increased health education to reduce the
menace of the virus. He called for observance of protected sex
and no pre-marital sex.
</P>
<P>
The top killer in Africa can be overcome in the long run if
the political will exists to make it happen, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been awarded a World Health Organization award for
its remarkable achievements made in checking the spread of
HIV/AIDS. The infection rate in rural areas has dropped from over
30 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Now some estimates say one tenth of Uganda's 20 million
population are HIV-positive and some 500,000 people have died of
AIDS since the first case was reported in the country in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Concerned Over War in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Russian leaders
voiced concern Monday over the escalating civil war in Afghanistan,
terming it a threat to regional security.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and
visiting Chairman of Russian State Duma Gennady Seleznyov voiced
their concern during their talks Monday, the Iranian official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who arrived here Sunday night for an official
visit, said the ongoing Afghan crisis will endanger the security
of the region and increase drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been bogged down in civil war since 1996 when
the Taliban militia ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance led by
Rabbani have escalated with the step-up of the Taliban's moves to
expand its controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said the current situation in Afghanistan is a tragic
issue for all the humanity and it is regretful that the Taliban
is plundering, murdering, committing genocide and destroying
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the catastrophe is the fact that all indecent
acts are being carried out under the banner of Islam, he said,
criticizing the Taliban for creating unrest in the region and
expanding smuggle of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Nouri noted that the only way to save Afghanistan is to form a
broad-based government made up of all groups, without foreign
intervention.
</P>
<P>
The speaker also said cooperation between Iran and Russia would
be important for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Caspian Sea, Seleznyov said the littoral
states, namely Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia and
Azerbaijan, should employ more rational methods for exploitation
of the sea's resources.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that the Caspian region should remain as a
non-military zone and Iran believes all the countries concerned
can reach consensus on the determination of the Caspian legal
regime.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Tehran-Moscow relations as "satisfactory," Nouri
said that the ties were growing and the two countries should
utilize their potential to deepen and expand mutual political and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also called for joint Tehran-Moscow efforts to thwart
"enemies' expansionist goals" in the region, apparently referring
to the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nouri condemned Israel's expansionist moves to Judaize
Jerusalem and change its demographic structure. He urged the
international community to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel approved a plan on June 21 to extend Jerusalem municipal
authority to eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which
violated the spirit of its signed agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Terming Israel as a symbol of state terrorism, he said that
Iran is among the first victims of terrorism and believes that all
countries should uproot any form of terrorism through
coordination.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Cabinet Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Monday reshuffled the cabinet, with Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister Enock Kavindele sacked.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement, President Frederick Chiluba's
assistant for press and public relations, Richard Sakala said
that Chiluba has made the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
David Mpamba, former information and broadcasting services
minister, replaced Kavindele as new commerce, trade and industry
minister.
</P>
<P>
David Saviye, former deputy minister in the Vice-President's
Office, has been appointed as new transport and communications
minister.
</P>
<P>
Katele Kalumba has been moved from Tourism Ministry to Home
Affairs Ministry taking over from Peter Machungwa, who has been
named as new minister of labor and social security.
</P>
<P>
Newstead Zimba, former labor and social security minister, has
been appointed as new minister of information and broadcasting
services.
</P>
<P>
Former transport and communications minister Anoshi Chipawa
has been transferred to the tourism ministry.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the dropping of Kavindele has anything to do with his
stand on tax rebate for Coca Cola Company, Sakala only said the
government is addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele warned Sunday that about 19,000 jobs will be lost
and Zambia's economy distorted greatly if the country's Finance
Ministry does not reduce excise duty quickly on soft drinks to
avert an impending closure of Zambia Bottlers, the manufacturer
of Coca Cola products in the country.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that his ministry has informed the
Finance Ministry that the current 25 percent excise duty on
carbonated drinks is not viable and recommended that it be
reduced to five percent.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the government promised to reduce duty on
Coca Cola for Zambia Bottlers.
</P>
<P>
But the government has not honored its promise to date forcing
the company to increase the price of its products from 500 Kwacha
(about 0.25 U.S. Dollars) to 900 Kwacha (some 0.45 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increased price has invitably slumped the demand for the
products while retailers in some border areas have started
importing soft drinks from neighboring countries.

the U.S. efforts, under the U.N. sponsorship, to push forward the
Israeli-Palestinian preace process, Sobeih told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official expressed the hope that the proposed
summit would lead to positive concrete results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent tour of the U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the region failed to achieve any headway and
that the pessimism is still prevailing the Palestinian circles.
</P>
<P>
Ross' 12th mission to the Middle East failed to lead to a
breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process stalled
since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has put forward a proposal calling for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal in the next stage of troop redeployment in the
West Bank. The PNA has accepted, but Israel has not.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative is very clear and indivisible whole, Sobeih
said, pointing out that the Palestinian side accepts it provided
no changes could be introduced to it by the U.S. or Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the plan does not meet the provisions of the
U.N. resolutions and the signed agreements, said Sobeih.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding that 3 percent of the proposed land be
turned into nature reserve where Israel retains full security
control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sobeih said that Arafat will underscore in his
address to the U.N. General Assembly session a number of questions
concerning the destabilized situation in the region due to the
Israeli uncompromising policies.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly session will serve as an opportunity for
addressing the international community and urging it to bring
pressures on Israel, he said.

KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti army officer
Monday denied local reports that Kuwait is massing troops along
the Iraqi borders, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ahmad Al-Rahmani, head of Moral Guidance and Public
Relations Department in the Kuwaiti army, said that "Kuwait is not
sending additional troops to the borders or raising the state of
readiness of the already existing forces on the northern borders."

Al-Rahmani said that since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the
Kuwaiti army has been always ready to deal with any possible
actions by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such news of sensitive nature should only be
taken from official sources "considering that security of the

UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Nelson Mandela Monday described the war against poverty
as a "life and death matter (which) can no longer be ignored."
</P>
<P>
"The imperative to act on this urgent, life and death matter
can no longer be ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, also chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, said that
"poverty has been and is the condition of the daily existence of
even larger numbers of ordinary working people."
</P>
<P>
In a world affected by the Asian crisis, "the challenge of
poverty across the globe has been brought into sharp focus by the
fact of the destructive `fast movements of currents' of wealth
from one part of the world to the other."
</P>
<P>
"Put starkly, we have a situation in which the further
accumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the
improvement of the quality of life of all humanity, is generating
poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace," he said.

On efforts to end conflicts in Africa, he said, "As Africans,

<HEADLINE> Ireland Supports Cyprus' EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ireland supports Cyprus
application for European Union (EU) membership and would offer
its assistance to resolve the island's political problem,
visiting Irish Defense Minister Michael Smith said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his Cypriot
counterpart Yiannakis Omirou, Smith said he discussed with Omirou
various issues of mutual concern, such as Cyprus' application
for accession to the EU, which "the Irish government supports."
</P>
<P>
"We are a small country ourselves, we remember the time when
we were applying for membership and received support from
different parts of Europe... and we gladly give that support to
your government in its effort to join the EU," the Irish defense
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the developments in Northern Ireland and the peace
process were also discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our experiences would be gladly available to your government
and to the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that his current visit takes place on the occasion
of the 40th anniversary of his country's participation in
U.N. contingents, noting that Irish troops have been in about 30
countries during the period.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Omirou said he presented to Smith the Cypriot
government's views on the need for a political settlement on the
island, because the Cyprus problem remains a destabilizing factor
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Omirou said he also outlined his government's views on the
country's right to upgrade its defense, stressing, however,
Cyprus' commitment to demilitarization of the island under the
relevant proposals made by President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union
with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Nine men were arrested in
connection with the Omagh bombing early Monday morning, police on
both sides of the Irish border said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said six people had been arrested in the
province, and the rest three were detained in connection with the
theft of a maroon-colored car used for the bomb attack on 15
August in which 29 people were killed and more than 200 injured.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were carried out by the police force of both sides
of the border at about 5 am Monday and the suspects were flown to
barracks in Armagh, where questioning was taking place, according
to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
An Irish police spokesman said the men they detained were being
questioned about the theft of the car used in the bombing. It was
stolen in Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan, a few days before the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"A number of arrests have been made in connection with serious
crime in the Tyrone area," a Northern Irish spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The "Real IRA," a dissident group of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), claimed responsibility for the bomb which exploded in the
town's main street. But it called a "complete cessation" of
violence two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Reform Essential for Better U.N. Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Reform of the United
Nations "is essential if we are to play our full part in the new
era," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is an ongoing process, and I shall continue working on
ways to improve our performance," he said at the opening of the
two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Annan hammered out U.N. reform programs, described as a process
of "quiet revolution," shortly after he took office in January
1997. However, the U.N. capacities were limited due to financial
stringency caused by failure of few countries to pay their back
dues.
</P>
<P>
"But the single greatest impediment to good performance is the
financial straitjacket within we are obliged to operate," he said.
"Financial stringency is a feature of today's world: it has helped
concentrate our minds on giving you better value for your money.
But without money there can be no value. Stringency is one thing:
a starvation diet quite another."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief once again appealed to "those few member states
who have fallen seriously behind with their contributions, to
follow the good example set by others." "There can be no
substitute for full and timely payment of what is due," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said last week that by September
15, the outstanding contributions reached 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars, of which 1.6 billion U.S. dollars are owed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a non-profit world body, fully relies on
contributions from member states to finance its operations.

BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Those who take interest in
the single currency due out soon were offered from Monday onward
Internet access to free information on the euro.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European community, is
responsible for this euro-related information program and the euro
data will be updated on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European economy and finance
commissioner, told the press that the publication of key euro
indicators on the Internet is an important initiative and the data
provided will prove useful for the economic management in the euro
zone as well as in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said, "The euro indicators will provide member
states, the European Central Bank, national central banks,
financial markets, enterprises, the media and the public with the
latest Economic and Monetary Union statistics essential for
decision-making."
</P>
<P>
He added that the statistics would be updated at noon every
day, a significant improvement on Eurostat's service.
</P>
<P>
The indicators, accessible at
http:\\europa.eu.int/eurostat.html, will include national accounts
statistics, monetary and financial indicators, external trade,
balance of payments, prices, industry, labor market, public
finance and short-term qualitative surveys.
</P>
<P>
The single currency and employment were among the top three
topics for which more information is desired by the respondents to
a recent EU questionnaire. The other top topic is the rights for
being a European citizen.

<HEADLINE> EU Deplores Failure of Working Time Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it was disappointed by the failure of the negotiations
to reach agreement on working time.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock and Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn said in a joint statement that a great
opportunity had been missed.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Transport Workers Unions in the European
Union and the International Road Union met here Monday in a
desperate effort to reach agreement on working hours for the
mobile sector of the EU's road transport.
</P>
<P>
But the two organizations, representing the truck, coach and
taxi drivers and employers respectively, failed to agree with each
other.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, said that it would have to table its own proposals
on working time if there is no agreement on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested that the two organizations meet again
on September 30 to make a final attempt at reaching agreement.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers set forth in 1993 a
regulation concerning working time for all sectors except for road
transport. The commission suggested last year to extend the
working time regulation to all non-mobile workers in the road
transport sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission provided those directly involved in road
transport with an opportunity to reach agreement for themselves,
commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the officials added, had wished that the social
partners of labor and management could jointly find acceptable
solutions for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, that kept on and off for several months, led
to two strike-triggered road blockades by French hauliers that had
seriously hampered the trade within the European Union.

WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two small planes crashed
in South Carolina and California respectively Sunday, killing all
six people aboard, said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A twin-engine Piper Aerostar crashed near Myrtle Beach, South
Carolina, Sunday afternoon in an emergency landing. But the pilot
managed to avoid restaurants, homes and businesses.

The plane was heading to York, Pennsylvania, where the four
victims lived.

Engine trouble was found after it had taken off from Grand
Strand Airport and the pilot called in a distress signal and tried
to turn around to go back to the airport.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, another twin-engine plane crashed in northern
Los Angeles County, California, killing both people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 310 went down in a residential neighborhood of Santa

<HEADLINE> Global Economic Crisis Calls for Global Solution: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian downturn has
triggered a worldwide economic crisis and all parts of the
international system need to come together to find global
solutions to this truly global crisis, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Annan was delivering a speech at the
opening of the two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly. Speakers from 181 countries, including 26 heads
of state and 19 prime ministers, are expected to take the floor to
voice their views on a wide range of matters of international
concern.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian downturn has triggered a worldwide economic crisis,
with devastating social consequences," he said. "Some of the most
successful economies have been plunged into recession, at a speed
which has taken the whole international community by surprise."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, which broke out in July 1997 in
Thailand, has spread to Russia, and even the markets of North
America and Europe are not immune.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, it is the most vulnerable groups which are the
hardest hit," Annan said. "The countries whose economies had taken
only the first faltering steps on the road of recovery are the
ones that now find themselves in greatest jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
The solution to the current economic turmoil worldwide lies in
the global efforts, rather than the talks by the Group of Seven
industrialized countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get together to find the answers, but who should
sit at the table? The day is past when the seven major
industrialized powers could or should take on the task alone," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Nor can this crisis be left only to finance ministers and
central bankers, although their contribution is essential," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"All parts of the international system need to come together,
to find global solutions to this truly global crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the issues this crisis raises are not just financial or
economic -- or social or political for that matter: they are all
of those things at once, he said, adding that "they must be
addressed on all those fronts."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which is the global institution par
excellence, has "an inescapable duty to respond," he said, voicing
his hope to see the U.N. participation in discussions on the new
world "financial architecture," such as those suggested by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Global Action Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called for global action in an anti-terrorism
campaign because individual action by U.N. member states cannot
provide a solution.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is a global menace, which clearly calls for global
action," he said. "Individual actions by member states, whether
aimed at state of non-state actor, cannot in themselves provide a
solution. We must meet this threat together."
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly, Annan said that a dramatic increase in attacks
on U.N. and associated personnel "prompts us to reflect on the
conditions in which we send civilian staff into war zones where,
too often, combatants seem less and less willing to respect their
neutral status."
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned networks of terrorism and drug trafficking and
the August 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds
of Africans in assaults on two American embassies. Washington took
a unilateral step to retaliate with missile attacks on alleged
terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We had perhaps the most frightening glimpse yet of this
uncivil society a few weeks ago, with the terrorist bombings in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam," he said. "What shocks us about
terrorism is its indiscriminate character. Unhappily we have also
to be concerned about violence that is more precisely targeted."
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say, also, that the perpetrators of these attacks
are almost never brought to justice," Annan added.

UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Monday that an inactive
attitude toward the impact of the Asian financial crisis can have
a high cost.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he said the measures
adopted by world economic powers to tackle the impact of the
crisis "still fall short of what is needed."
</P>
<P>
"The events of the past few months have revealed a serious lag
between growing financial interdependence and the modest
effectiveness of existing international mechanisms for dialogue
and coordination," Lampreia said.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia, the first speaker at the general debate of the 53rd
session of the General Assembly, said the world cannot depend only
on the willingness, capacity and interest of a select number of
countries to mobilize and lead international efforts to deal with
global economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil will continue to fight for a more balanced allocation
of the benefits of economic interdependence, without distortions
such as those resulting from protectionist policies of developed
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the current context of global economic turbulence, we must
demand from the developed nations greater coherence between
free-trade rhetoric and their unfair trade practices," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Calls for Peaceful Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov Monday called for a peaceful protest
against wage arrears all over the country scheduled for October 7,
the Interfax news agency reported from Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The communist leader said that it would not be in the interests
of Russia's left-wing groups if confusion were to break out during
a nationwide protest campaign.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is attending a Council of Europe Parliamentary
Assembly session which opened in Strasbourg Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov told reporters that the Communist party leadership had
advised campaign organizers to pay special attention to safety
precautions and make close contact with the Interior Ministry and
other law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if participants of the campaign are not
provoked, everything will be fine. "It will be a well-organized
and mass-scale protest action," Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied that demands for dismissing the government
would be made during the protest campaign.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Russia, Zyuganov said that he is
satisfied that crisis had been avoided and an experienced person,
who is well known in Europe and can conduct dialogue with
different forces, came to head the government.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Times cited Andrei Issayev, secretary of the Russian
Federation of Trade Unions, as reporting earlier that up to 36
million people will take to the streets all over Russia on October
7.
</P>
<P>
The union estimated that total wage arrears are more than 76
billion rubles. That would have equaled more than 12 billion U.S.
dollars at the rate of 6.2 rubles to the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Meets U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Angola,
Danald Steinberg, at a meeting with Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos Monday, said that the U.S. has decided to invest 350
million U.S. Dollars in the Angolan petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Steinberg conveyed to the Angolan president a
letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton. But the ambassador,
declining to disclose the contents of the letter, only said that
he and President Dos Santos had exchanged views on the Angolan
peace process and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has decided to offer Angola new
assistance, investing 350 million Dollars into Angola's petroleum
sector, said Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will increase its assistance in
such fields as the removal of land mines and the restoration of
agriculture in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president and the U.S. ambassador also held talks
about other issues concerning trade and economy, including the
possibility of a new loan agreement between the Angolan
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Angola, Steinberg said that "the
peace process has fallen into a difficult stalemate."
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the U.S. Embassy here last Friday
called on the Angolan government and the opposition National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to hold dialog
within the framework of the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol in a bid
to ward off a war.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the U.S. government condemned the UNITA for
its delay in the process and had voted for the resolution
recently passed by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. said that the series of measures taken by
the Angolan government "may backfire."
</P>
<P>
In order to break the ice, the Angolan government took some
major steps since early September. It first suspended some UNITA
members as ministers or deputy ministers in the government of the
national unity and as the members of parliament in the People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Angolan government acknowledged the breakaway UNITA
Renovation Committee as the only dialogist in the peace talks and
asked the international community to accept its status.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government declared that it stopped any contact
with UNITA President Jonas Savimbi, denouncing him as "the chief
war criminal."
</P>
<P>
President Dos Santos and the U.S. Ambassador also discussed
the latest developments in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and ways to restore peace and stability in that country.

<HEADLINE> Czech Backs Peaceful Solution to Cyprus Problem: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Czech official said
Monday that Prague supported a peaceful solution to the Cyprus
problem based on a U.N. bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zantovsky, head of a Czech Senate delegation which is
on a four-day visit to Cyprus, made the remarks after his meeting
with Cypriot House Speaker and acting President Spyros Kyprianou and
acting Foreign Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou.
</P>
<P>
Zantovsky told reporters that the Czech Republic "does not
recognize the use of force in international relations and illegal
occupation of territory."
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we had our own sad experience with such matters,
so we are just like Cyprus a small country and we do feel
solidarity with other small nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway republic
in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the
Mediterranean island through a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Zantovsky noted that it is in the interest of the two countries
to exchange information and to help each other in the course of
the European Union (EU) accession.
</P>
<P>
The EU began accession talks with Cyprus in March and removed
Turkey from its immediate membership list, which have courted
protest from Turkish Cypriots and deadlocked the peace talks as a
result.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kyprianou said that "we will try our best to see
that the close cooperation between the two countries becomes even
closer."
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou stressed that "the Czech Republic was and
remains by the side of Cyprus and it is one of the countries on
which we lay our hopes in efforts for EU accession and just
resolution of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Cyprus, the seven-member Czech delegation
will discuss with other government officials on the two countries'
EU accession course and recent developments in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> 45,000 Ethiopians Die of TB Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- About 45,000 people die
of Tuberculosis (TB) annually in Ethiopia and the disease has
become the number one killer in the country, a senior TB expert
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual review meeting of the National TB and
Leprosy Control Program, Takele Geressu said there are 90,000 new
detected TB cases in the country and the prevalence of TB is
estimated now to be ranging between 90,000 and 100,000 throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Takele as saying that as TB
kills the fittest, the disease mostly attacks people at their
most productive age, between 15 and 49.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, a Directly-Observed Treatment Short
Course (DOTS) has been launched in seven regions of the country
in order to prevent and control the TB epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Although the program has planned to curb 80-85 percent of TB
patients in the regions where DOTS was launched, he said, only 70
percent has been cured because of lack of follow-up on the parts
of the TB patients.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Alemnesh Wolde, head of the National
TB and Leprosy Control Program, said that shortage of anti-TB
medicinal drugs and health professionals in most of the regions
is one of the major problems encountered in the fight against the
disease.

KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti army officer
Monday denied local reports that Kuwait is massing troops along
the Iraqi borders, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ahmad Al-Rahmani, head of Moral Guidance and Public
Relations Department in the Kuwaiti army, said that "Kuwait is not
sending additional troops to the borders or raising the state of
readiness of the already existing forces on the northern borders."
</P>
<P>
Local Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam Monday quoted a senior
defense officer as saying that additional troops have joined the
units already stationed along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders. It
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rahmani said that since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the
Kuwaiti army has been always ready to deal with any possible
actions by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such news of sensitive nature should only be
taken from official sources "considering that security of the
homeland is an aim sought by all."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Expects Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian permanent envoy to
the Arab League Mohammed Sobeih said on Monday that the U.S. is
preparing for a tripartite summit on the Mideast peace process
among leaders of the U.S., Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, among U.S. President Bill Clinton, PNA President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the
fringe of the 53rd U.N. General Assembly session, will be part of
the U.S. efforts, under the U.N. sponsorship, to push forward the
Israeli-Palestinian preace process, Sobeih told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official expressed the hope that the proposed
summit would lead to positive concrete results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent tour of the U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the region failed to achieve any headway and
that the pessimism is still prevailing the Palestinian circles.
</P>
<P>
Ross' 12th mission to the Middle East failed to lead to a
breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process stalled
since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has put forward a proposal calling for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal in the next stage of troop redeployment in the
West Bank. The PNA has accepted, but Israel has not.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative is very clear and indivisible whole, Sobeih
said, pointing out that the Palestinian side accepts it provided
no changes could be introduced to it by the U.S. or Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the plan does not meet the provisions of the
U.N. resolutions and the signed agreements, said Sobeih.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding that 3 percent of the proposed land be
turned into nature reserve where Israel retains full security
control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sobeih said that Arafat will underscore in his
address to the U.N. General Assembly session a number of questions
concerning the destabilized situation in the region due to the
Israeli uncompromising policies.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly session will serve as an opportunity for
addressing the international community and urging it to bring
pressures on Israel, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Supports Cyprus' EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ireland supports Cyprus
application for European Union (EU) membership and would offer
its assistance to resolve the island's political problem,
visiting Irish Defense Minister Michael Smith said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his Cypriot
counterpart Yiannakis Omirou, Smith said he discussed with Omirou
various issues of mutual concern, such as Cyprus' application
for accession to the EU, which "the Irish government supports."
</P>
<P>
"We are a small country ourselves, we remember the time when
we were applying for membership and received support from
different parts of Europe... and we gladly give that support to
your government in its effort to join the EU," the Irish defense
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the developments in Northern Ireland and the peace
process were also discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our experiences would be gladly available to your government
and to the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that his current visit takes place on the occasion
of the 40th anniversary of his country's participation in
U.N. contingents, noting that Irish troops have been in about 30
countries during the period.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Omirou said he presented to Smith the Cypriot
government's views on the need for a political settlement on the
island, because the Cyprus problem remains a destabilizing factor
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Omirou said he also outlined his government's views on the
country's right to upgrade its defense, stressing, however,
Cyprus' commitment to demilitarization of the island under the
relevant proposals made by President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union
with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
Monday called on the country's computer experts to take a lead in
sensitizing the public about the impending threat of computers'
failure to work after December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda when
launching the National Library Week at the University of Zambia
in the capital city, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said that librarians, information technology
professionals and computer experts must discover and list what
the threats and needs of Zambia may be regarding the impending
computer collapse by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He urged the professionals to put together, in simple
languages, what people can expect and how they may prepare
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda wondered why there was little being said about the
problem in the country's media. He attributed the silence on the
matter to little information available on the subject.
</P>
<P>
On the library system, the minister said it was saddening to
note that Zambia, despite being one of the first countries to
attain political independence in the continent, had no national
library system.
</P>
<P>
He noted his ministry is doing everything possible to promote
the development of libraries in the country.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Kazakhstan to Develop Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Romania
and Kazakhstan Monday insisted on the importance of developing
commercial exchanges between their countries by the Euro-Asian
shipping corridor "the Modern Silk Road" program in the future.
</P>
<P>
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in Romania
Sunday evening on a two-day official visit at the invitation of
his Romanian counterpart, Emil Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first of its kind since the two countries
established diplomatic ties in 1992, is aimed at promoting
bilateral political relations and trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the official talks, the two presidents approached
various issues of bilateral cooperation between the two countries,
mainly on the Modern Silk Road project, which establishes the oil
transport route from Caucasus to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu said, "There is the political will for
cooperation as well as the required legal framework which are to
be further developed."
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said he had accepted Nazarbayev's invitation to

<HEADLINE> Clinton Grand Jury Testimony Aired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Television stations in the
United States Monday broadcast the four-hour videotape of
President Bill Clinton's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky affair
before a grand jury on August 17.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee
simultaneously released the videotape along with some 3,200 pages
of Lewinsky case evidence, including Lewinsky's account of her
encounters with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton gave the testimony from the Map Room of the White House
by video link to a court house last month.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who dominate the House of Representatives, say the
American people have the right to see the tape, to judge for
themselves whether Clinton lied to the grand jury. Many Democrats
say their real motive is to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Clinton said, "It's an embarrassing and
personally painful thing."
</P>
<P>
The videotape of Clinton's testimony began playing unedited on
some televisions across America shortly before 9:30 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry called the videotape
release "rank partisanship" and said most of the materials being
made public were irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
The tape portrayed Clinton as sometimes angry at prosecutors'
questions and other times expressing bitterness at how the Paula
Jones lawsuit precipitated Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
criminal investigation of the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
A two-volume set of evidence was delivered to lawmakers this
morning, then made public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president was at the United Nations in New York.
His speech on combating terrorism got a standing ovation -- "the
warmest and most enthusiastic reception" he has received in six
U.N. speeches, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He said
Clinton didn't watch the video.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the videotape showed Clinton refusing to discuss
intimate details of his relationship "despite repeated efforts by
Mr. Starr and his prosecutors to browbeat and badger him into
doing so."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said, "That the president's conduct does not rise to
the level of an impeachable offense should now be clear to
everyone."
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said it was
"unfortunate" that Republicans insisted on releasing the tape. As
for its impact, he said, "how damaging is not something anybody
can assess right now."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, campaigning in South Carolina,
kept quiet about the matter. Asked what the president should do,
Gingrich was quoted by news reports as saying, "I don't want to
get into that."

<HEADLINE> Belgium Lifts Third-Degree Flood Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Belgium on Monday lifted the
third-degree warning of natural disaster for its last community
and started compensating for flood-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
The Nethe river valley was the last community in the country to
lift the warning that had been issued Monday last week when the
water level in most rivers in northeastern Belgium rose to surpass
the flood levels of 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Finance Minister Herman van Rompuy told the press
Monday that a total of 1.2 billion Belgian francs (34.2 million
U.S. dollars) would be available from the country's disaster
relief funds to compensate for the damages sustained by the people
in the 167 communities, or a third of the communities of the
country, that had been submerged by flood waters that were waist
deep in some places.
</P>
<P>
The water levels in the rivers Ambleve, Vesdre, Hoegne, Demer
and Meuse rose quickly after days of torrential rains in the
northeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains, that started late last month and kept on and
off for most of the past two and a half weeks, were attributed to
the unusually warmer waters in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
When currents of cold-air masses run into hot-air masses rising
above the North Sea, they combine and produce rainfalls.
</P>
<P>
Third-degree warnings are given in case of natural catastrophe
by Belgium's provincial authorities that are then entitled to
demand military and specialized assistance if need arise.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ghana Environmental
Resources Management Project started in 1991 as the vehicle for
the implementation of the a National Environmental Action Plan
has born fruits, the Pan African News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has developed and implemented a 10-year environmental
education strategy while 105 district assemblies have been
assisted to prepare their local environmental action plans, the
Pan African News Agency quoted Executive Director of Ghanaian
Environmental Protection Agency Peter Acquah as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project has made a breakthrough as far as land information
system is concerned, said Acquah at a seminar in Accra last week.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a nationwide water quality monitoring is being
conducted in order to develop a stream-water quality standard for
major water bodies in the country, said Acquah.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these achievements, he said, "our main concern is
how to sustain what has been accomplished so far and how best to
address the key emerging environmental problems in the country."
</P>
<P>
The national environmental action plan includes the
development and support of a program to combat soil degradation
and erosion and to prevent further destruction of the fragile
resources in the coastal zone.
</P>
<P>
Ghana lost an estimated four percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) or 41.7 billion Cedis (about 18.5 million U.S.
Dollars) in 1988 as a result of environmental degradation, said
Acquah.
</P>
<P>
The official said that losses resulting from the
activities of agriculture, forestry, industry and mining sectors
"imposed a strong case for taking effective action to reduce
them."

DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye Monday appealed to the international
community to support the efforts made by regional leaders to
bring peace in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with former French President Valery Giscard
D'estaing in Dar es Salaam, Sumaye appealed to the international
community to extend material support to the countries in the
region which have been shouldering the burden of refugees from
the war-torn countries for a long period.
</P>
<P>
The refugee burden hinders the political and socio-economic
development in those countries and has negative impact on their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said that the restoration of peace is in the interest
of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as well
as those in the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the DRC has forced thousands of refugees in
the country to flee to Tanzania, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tanzania, together with other Great Lakes
countries, is trying to end the strife in the DRC through peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 5,000 refugees from the DRC have flowed into
Tanzania since the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms on August 2 to
fight against the government troops loyal to DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are accommodated at the Nyarugusu refugee camp
in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The government troops loyal
to President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) Monday attacked Kavumu airport in the rebel-held eastern
town of Bukavu, said a report reaching here from Kinshasa,
capital of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Congolese government statement as saying
that the attack, which destroyed a rebel transport plane and four
jeeps, was one of the significant advances toward the major
rebel-held towns by Kabila's army backed by the Angolan,
Zimbabwean and Namibian troops.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in the operation at Kavumu, which was
preceded by the attacks against nearby town of Goma last week,
many rebels had been killed.
</P>
<P>
The operation was part of the government army's strategy to
hit towns still in the hands of the rebels who are determined to
topple Kabila, said the report quoting informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The government troops and their allies have encircled the main
rebel-held cities, such as Kisangani and Kalemie, and they will
strike when the final offensive starts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
All the four rounds of regional peace talks have failed to
produce a cease-fire in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> New Proof Shows the Blind Hear Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have
produced new evidence supporting the popular belief that blind
people hear better than people who can see, according to a report
from the latest issue of Nature.
</P>
<P>
Franco Lepore and colleagues at the University of Montreal
compared eight blind people, three partially blind people and 36
people with normal vision. The blind people could locate the
origin of sounds as well as the sighted people, but did better
than the sighted people when one ear was plugged--the tougher of
the tasks, because people typically use slight differences in the
way sounds reach each ear to pinpoint the origin.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said their findings resolve a long-standing
controversy in that they provide behavioral evidence totally blind
individuals have better auditory ability than sighted people,
allowing them to compensate for their loss of vision.
</P>
<P>
But however as for how blind people's hearing might become
superior remains unknown, although there is evidence suggesting
that their brains reorganize to apply brain power that would
normally be used fro vision to hearing.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall but off Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets finished
off their worst levels for the day as investors took heart from a
mild rebound on Wall Street after early declines.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was able to cut an early 175 point deficit to a 100 point
loss where it held steady during the Clinton videotape. But the FTSE
100 still closed at a new low for the year, down 65.3 at 4990.3.
</P>
<P>
The index had traded much lower earlier in the session on worries
about Asian market falls and after a profits warning from music
giant EMI.
</P>
<P>
The wait for the release of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
testimony to the Congressional Grand Jury kept the market uneasy all
day. Fears that his administration could be dragged down added
political uncertainty to already fragile markets.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 has fallen below the 5000 level twice since the
start of the year, once in January and again on September 11.
</P>
<P>
The drop had enough momentum to take the index briefly below 4900
before support was triggered.
</P>
<P>
Both the weakest point in the session, 4899.6, and the close were
the lowest since the first week of December 1997. However, London
shares managed to outperform other European markets.
</P>
<P>
The German DAX and the Paris CAC indices registered falls of
nearly 6 percent before levelling off to a 3.5 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that while the Footise lagged continental
markets on their rapid rise in the first half of the year, it was
also lagging the declines.
</P>
<P>
Signs of a slowing UK economy have been a brake on the upside,
but the market's cautious attitude also meant that there was less
froth in the FTSE once global markets were shaken out.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax regained the 4400 level having
dropped to a session low of 4347.65. The index finished 184.24 lower
on the day at 4439.13.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also worried about the fall of the U.S. dollar
against the German mark. Export-sensitive car stocks were down
sharply.
</P>
<P>
Analists also said the OneWorld global airline alliance would be a
formidable contender to the existing Star Alliance that includes
Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares also pulled off the day's worst levels as
the Dow Jones stabilized. The CAC-40 finished 122.57 lower at
3342.65.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said on Monday that high-level international
collaborative effort is the only way to tackle the complex
economic problems now facing the world.
</P>
<P>
"We face many challenges, but none more immediate than the
contagion of recession spreading from those countries currently in
difficulty to affect the wider world economy," he told the 53rd
U.N. General Assembly which started annual debate this morning.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that new mechanisms set up to deal with the
problems as "the absence of proper financial structures and
disciplines in individual countries will be punished by the
markets sooner or later".
</P>
<P>
According to Blair, such mechanisms should provide:
</P>
<P>
-- rules to encourage greater transparency in international and
national financial dealings;
</P>
<P>
-- better supervision and regulation of financial operators;
</P>
<P>
-- adequate resources for the international financial
institutions to deal with short-term liquidity problems;
</P>
<P>
-- structural reform programs for countries in difficulty which
take proper account of the social effects of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain, the current chairman of the G8, will play its
full part in ensuring the necessary fresh look at the
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the European Union has been committed to zero
tariffs for the least developed countries by the year 2000, and he
urged all developed nations to follow suit.

Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) taking place on October 8-9 in
London.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the dialogue between the Commonwealth and
the military regime of General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who will
meet Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku Wednesday on
his way to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the Pan
African News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995 after
the then government of General Sani Abacha executed author Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth then established the CMAG to monitor the
development of human rights in Nigeria and to make
recommendations to the Commonwealth as to wether or not and when
to restore Nigeria's membership.
</P>
<P>
Past dialogue between Nigeria and the CMAG has proved
fruitless, while Nigeria has been refused opportunities to defend
itself at several CMAG meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth had threatened to expel Nigeria for good if
its human rights record has no major improvement by 1996 but had
delayed from taking actions for several times.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and the Commonwealth has improved
since Abubakar took office in June, as the new leader's
reconciliation effort and commitment to democratization have
received wide applaud in the West.
</P>
<P>
"The Commonwealth has been impressed with the actions taken
so far by the authorities in Nigeria to ensure a speedy and
workable transition to a credible democracy," Anyaoku was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Commonwealth delegation visited Nigeria last week, during
which it offered to help the country's new Independent Electoral
Commission to conduct various elections under the Abubakar's new
transiton to civil rule program that will end on May 29, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Prices Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) --Kenya's Tea prices remained
firm on thin supply at the latest weekly export auction at the
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, said a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Quantities are normally low this time of the year. Because of
this, we expect prices to continue quite firm," said the report
quoting Richard Surrey, Chief of the Tea Brokers Association.
</P>
<P>
"Quality was also about maintained," he said, adding that
there was strong and improved demand at the auction last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Britain remained the main buyers. Purchases were
also made by Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and other Middle East countries.
Somalia bought lower grade teas.
</P>
<P>
Surrey said that traders from Iran and Pakistan who dealt with
Afghanistan found it difficult to operate because of the
political crisis there. Some had scaled down their purchases but
that had not unduly upset the market.
</P>
<P>
The Russian financial crisis had not affected Kenyan tea
sales because traditionally there were minimal purchases of
Kenyan tea by Russian traders, he added.
</P>
<P>
Premium grades Brighter Pekoes One (BP1s) rose by 5-20 U.S.
cents following quality. It gained more on selected BP1 lines.
Mediums were steady to 10 cents higher. Lower mediums and
plainer grades rose by five to 20 cents.

<HEADLINE> UK's BA Announces Formation of Biggest Airline Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British Airways has announced
the creation of the biggest airline network in the world.
</P>
<P>
BA and its US partner American Airlines (AA) are forming
alliances with airlines around the world, including Qantas of
Australia, Canadian Airlines International and Cathay Pacific of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the alliance has prompted criticism from competitors
that they will be squeezed out with passengers paying more with
lower service standards.
</P>
<P>
Together the new network, "Oneworld", will become a dominant
force in the global airline industry.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific is set to land a place in the new global network.
Six other airlines, Japan Airlines, Iberia of Spain, Maersk Air of
Denmark, GB Airways of Britain, Finn Air and American West, are
expected to be involved in the partnership.
</P>
<P>
The five main partners will serve around 800 destinations and fly
more than 160 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
Customers will only have to purchase one ticket to use different
airline networks to get to destinations across the world. The
airlines will also be able to co-ordinate their schedules to create
"seamless" travel for passengers.
</P>
<P>
The creation of such a dominant industry force could pose a
serious threat to smaller airlines, unable to compete effectively
with the new network, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The creation of this large alliance, with many more airlines, may
find opposition among competition regulators and lengthen the
investigation into an even tighter alliance already proposed by BA
and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, was quoted by BBC as
saying that the alliance deals are effectively mergers and will not
be in the interest of the airline consumer.
</P>
<P>
"Cathay Pacific and British Airways control 83 percent of the
Hong Kong-London route. Qantas, Cathay and BA are getting together
and that means there will be no competition on the Australian
route," he said. "If there is no competition they can set fares as
they wish, cut staff, cut costs, it is certainly not in the
consumer's interests."
</P>
<P>
Thus, he called on governments to make sure airlines had to
compete or there will end up being no competition in the aviation
market.
</P>
<P>
However, BA chief executive Bob Ayling promised that Oneworld
would be competitive on ticket prices, saying that "as in the case
of BA and AA, we have antitrust immunity not to compete."
</P>
<P>
"Our customers have told us they want airlines to work together
to raise standards of service across the world. Oneworld will do
just that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is part of the rapid consolidation of the airline
industry, analysts observed. BA has already established links with
Air Liberte of France and Deutsche BA of Germany.
</P>
<P>
BA's move is a bid to take on the Star Alliance, a consortium of
airlines set up 18 months ago by United Airlines of the United
States and Lufthansa of Germany.
</P>
<P>
However the new alliance may take some time to come to fruition.
AA and BA announced their own proposed alliance in 1996 but they
have yet to win final regulatory approval from UK and U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mandelson, the UK Trade Secretary, is not expected to make
a decision on whether to sanction the tie up between BA and AA
before November, according to a BBC report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wants to See 2001 as "Year of Dialogue Among  Civilizations" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday
proposed the United Nations designate the year 2001 as the "Year
of Dialogue Among Civilizations," with the earnest hope that
through such a dialogue, the realization of universal justice and
liberty may be initiated.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came as Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was
delivering a speech at the two-week general debate of the 53rd
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue would be a first step to face the changing world,
he said, expressing his hope that the United Nations would take
necessary measures to respond to this evolving global climate.
</P>
<P>
"Among the worthiest achievements of this century is the
acceptance of the necessity and significance of dialogue and
rejection of force, promotion of understanding in culture,
economic and political fields, and strengthening of the foundation
of liberty, justice and human rights," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the Iranian president discussed the crisis
between his country and Afghanistan with Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
With some 200,000 Iranian troops massed on the Afghan border
after the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the armed faction
of Taliban supporters, Khatami was using his visit to the United
Nations to appeal for international pressure to restrain the
militia Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly began a general debate on Monday, Khatami
was among speakers from 181 countries to take the floor on a wide
range of matters of international concern.

<HEADLINE> East African Bourse Expected to Emerge by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is expecting an East
Africa bourse to be launched by 2000 with three trading floors in
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, a Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) report
for 1997 said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jimnah Mbaru, Chief of the NSE, said in the annual report that
a unified regional stock exchange can help integrate and
harmonize the three economies, raise access to a greater pool of
resources and ease cross-border listing of securities.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors will also be attracted by a large capital
market," said Mbaru.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's bourse is the largest in east Africa. Uganda's has
opened with only a bond traded, and equity trading is now
forecast to start next January. Tanzania's bourse has two listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan bourse officials believe that the year 2000 deadline
for the regional stock exchange will be met. But some analysts
said the time appears too short in view of the fact that the three
countries have to harmonize certain financial laws first.
</P>
<P>
So far, foreign investment in stocks is still banned in
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Send 300,000 Tons of Wheat to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States
announced Monday it will contribute another 300,000 metric tons of
wheat this year to combat famine in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"Chronic food production shortfalls have resulted in widespread
malnutrition in the DPRK, and this year's harvest is again
expected to fall far short of production targets," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. assistance would be targeted at the most
vulnerable civilians, including children in nurseries, schools and
orphanages, pregnant or nursing women, handicapped people and
hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
It would also go to food-for-work program to rehabilitate
agricultural land damaged by deforestation or natural disaster, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new contribution adds to 200,000 metric tons the United
States has already contributed in response to an appeal in January
by the U.N. World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The aid will be in three roughly equal tranches through the
remainder of this year. The final shipment of the previous
200,000-metric ton contribution is due to arrive in DPRK this
month.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Opinion polls conducted
after U.S. television showed President Bill Clinton's grand jury
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal showed Tuesday that
the airing was less damaging than his critics had predicted.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today showed that 66
percent of respondents still approved of the job Clinton is doing,
six points higher than the figure Sunday, the day before the
broadcast. The approval figure on the previous Sunday was 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
The same percentage rejected impeachment, but 39 percent
thought Clinton should resign, the poll showed. USA Today said 81
percent of respondents believed Clinton definitely or probably
lied under oath to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
In an NBC News poll, only 28 percent of respondents believed
the president was telling the truth but 57 percent did not believe
the president should resign.
</P>
<P>
An ABC News poll showed that 70 percent believed Clinton was
right to refuse to talk about the sexual details of his
relationship with Lewinsky and 59 percent thought prosecutors were
wrong to ask detailed, probing, explicit questions.

<P>
The ABC poll showed Clinton's job approval holding steady at

OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that
the Canadian International Development Agency will provide 150,000
Canadian dollars (97,500 U.S. dollars) to flood victims in
southern Mexico.

</P>
<P>
The Canadian assistance, to be managed by the Pan American

<HEADLINE> IS, ICTs to Provide More Jobs in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Information Society (IS)
and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are expected
to provide Europe with more jobs, a senior European Commission
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by European Employment Commissioner
Padraig Flynn at an information technology conference in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Information Society, the commissioner told conference
participants, is now the biggest industry in Europe and is growing
3 percent faster than the rest of the economy and is contributing
toward 15 percent of the overall economic growth in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The IS and ICTs created more than 300,000 jobs between 1995 and
1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Information Technology Observatory estimated that
Europe will need between 1.5 million and 2 million new information
technology professionals in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner pointed to the fact that some European
Union member states had been cutting back on technical places in
universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said: "We can and must do even better on making the link
between Information and Communication Technologies and the skills
the IS job requires and job creation."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the 1998 national employment action
plans showed that EU member states were still not taking enough
account of Information Society issues.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference participants that the commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation union, will have to look at the
issue while reviewing and strengthening the employment process
for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Troops in Lesotho to Help Find Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and
Botswana's military intervention in Lesotho was to help find a
lasting political solution, not to enforce a military solution to
a political issue, South African Acting President Mangosuthu
Buthelezi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the intervention is to restore stability as
quickly as possible and to withdraw from the Kingdom of Lesotho
as soon as this has been achieved," Buthelezi said in a special
address to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the Southern African Development Community (SADC) had
made it clear that member states could not tolerate coups d'etat
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We need to stress that the intervention by the SADC forces is
not intended to force the Lesotho parties to negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to Lesotho's problems is the sovereign right of
the people of Lesotho to resolve in the manner that they choose."
</P>
<P>
He said he had been told that the parties in the conflict were
committed to ongoing negotiations, and had agreed to meet each
other on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said it was important that the multiparty talks
should take place in an appropriate environment underpinned by
stability which ordinarily should be established by the Lesotho
Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said repeatedly that the intervention was a SADC
operation, not South Africa's, and that it followed the failure
of SADC efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said he had authorized the troop deployment in his capacity
as acting president.
</P>
<P>
He had consulted SADC parties responsible for guaranteeing
Lesotho's democracy, although he had not been able to speak
directly with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who was
unavailable, and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, who had
left for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He had also consulted President Nelson Mandela, who is in
Washington, and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 soldiers from South Africa and Botswana entered
Lesotho early Tuesday morning to try to restore order in
Lesotho's capital of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
At least three South African soldiers have been killed and 11
injured in clashes with Lesotho troops siding with opposition
party supporters.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho was plunged into anarchy when opposition protesters
forced stayaways and hijacked government vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They claim that the May 23 general election was rigged in
favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy and demand
fresh polls.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia: Major Parties Agree to Talk About New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of
Cambodia's three rival parties agreed Tuesday in the northern town
of Siem Reap to hold talks on the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders also agreed at their meeting that the new
National Assembly, or parliament, would convene on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Former senior co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh met
government leader Hun Sen, the co-premier who ousted him in July
last year. It was their first meeting since the incident.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the party leaders, including former finance
minister Sam Rainsy, now the head of a party bearing his name,
lined up with King Norodom Sihanouk who presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen did not speak to reporters but senior member of his
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and minister without portfolio Sok
An said the atmosphere at the four-hour meeting was good.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between the leaders of the three parties seem to
be much better than before," Sok An told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The King said very clearly that all parties have to
participate in the National Assembly, but it's the right of the
parties to join or not to join the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representing his FUNCINPEC party, Ranariddh said: "It was a
very good summit. We've said that all parties...will start
negotiations about the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
"I think definitely we have made progress instead of
stalemate," he said. "In spite of remaining problems, we have
agreed to go forward...but we still have a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, whose parties came second and third
in the July election, rejected Hun Sen's election victory, saying
the CPP won through fraud and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
They mounted more than three weeks of protests against the
election results but called off the demonstrations and agreed to
talks last week, after coming under mounting pressure from the
King and the international community.
</P>
<P>
They also dropped a threat to boycott parliament after clashes
between their supporters and police caused the death of two
protesters.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's CPP does not have the two-thirds of parliamentary
seats necessary to form a government alone. Hun Sen has offered to
bring both opposition parties, which control all remaining seats,
into a coalition but he has made clear he does not need Sam
Rainsy's party.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said Hun Sen presented the meeting with three
scenarios. The CPP could form a coalition with the FUNCINPEC
party, or it could amend the constitution to do away with the
two-thirds rule and govern alone, or it could simply extend the
life of the current government, the prince said.

MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
Congress agreed Tuesday night to exert all efforts to save
Philippine Airlines (PAL) domestic routes regardless of the
results of a referendum among PAL employees.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesperson Jerry Barican told reporters that one
option eyed by President Joseph Estrada and lawmakers is a 1.5

to bankroll the airline's operations for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
The bridge financing plan, if approved, will come from
government financing institutions that are investors in PAL, with
these institutions getting first crack at PAL payments after three
months.
</P>
<P>
"(Our) principal agreement is that the domestic lines of PAL
are far important to the economy to be allowed not to continue,"
Barican told reporters after a meeting between Estrada and
congressional leaders.

Barican said the participants at the meeting also agreed to
meet again at noon Wednesday to discuss the government's next move
following the results of the PAL referendum.
</P>
<P>
PAL union members voted Tuesday on whether to agree on an offer
from the PAL management to save the airlines from its current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the offer, the trade union will get 20 percent of PAL
shares in exchange for a 10-year suspension of its collective
bargaining agreement, with every employee receiving 60,000 shares
worth 300,000 pesos (6,976 dollars).
</P>
<P>
PAL management scheduled the closure of the airlines for
midnight Wednesday after the union refused to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
Economists here warned that the impending shutdown of PAL, the
country's national flag carrier, is expected to considerably
affect the Philippine economy since the country is composed of
more than 7,000 islands and PAL is vital to local transportation.

<HEADLINE> Naturally Preserved Body Mystifies Chinese Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The body of an elderly
Chinese woman who passed away six years ago at the age of 87
remains in a natural state of preservation in the home of her
children.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 people, including a number of famous medical
experts, scientists and scholars, have visited the home to view
the body of Zhou Fengchen, who was born on November 2, 1905, in
Xianghe County, north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, China's leading daily newspaper, had
covered the story extensively.
</P>
<P>
The natural state of preservation of the body of Zhou Fengchen
continues to pose a mystifying question for modern science. Zhou
lived in Huzhuangzi Village of Xianghe County, located some 52 km
from Beijing, the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's heart stopped beating at 22:45 on the evening of
November 24. 1992, and 15 minutes later she was pronounced dead by
a Beijing doctor.
</P>
<P>
"My grandmother's body remained in a normal state for about
five days, with the elasticity of the muscles remaining for even
longer," said Yang Xueqiang, the woman's oldest grandson.
</P>
<P>
"Fluids and gases oozed from the body for about a month before
the metamorphosis ended. The body has since remained in a state of
natural preservation," said Yang, an officer in the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that all changes occurred under natural
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The woman's body is now housed in a dwelling typically found in
the north China countryside. The body has not been embalmed and no
special protective measures have been introduced.
</P>
<P>
However, a glass shroud protects the body from dust. A delicate
fragrance can be detected when the shroud is removed and the body
is free of odors associated with decomposition.

Body muscles have shriveled and hardened, while the hands and
feet have retained their natural skin color and are in excellent
condition. The luster of the woman's natural white hair remains,
and an oily substance slowly surfaces from the woman's bronzed
forehead.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jing, former director of the management office of the
Chairman Mao Memorial Hall who has made significant contributions
to maintaining the body of Mao Zedong, commented that the
mysterious phenomenon resemble mummification.
</P>
<P>
However, many experts stress the body has not been mummified.
</P>
<P>
"Mummies emit an easily detectable odor, quite unlike the
woman's body," said Lu Jinchuan, a famous scholar on traditional
Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1997, a group of experts conducted an extensive
examination of the body and the findings were published in May
this year. The paper points out that the natural preservation of
bodies subject to natural temperatures and humidity is quite rare.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the paper, Li Shen and Zhang Ruijun, both
members of the team, pointed out that the causes of irregular
patterns on an electrocardiogram have not as yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
The story has attracted extensive attention and two related
seminars have been held in Xianghe and Beijing respectively over
the past six years. Nonetheless, the mystery remains
unanswered.

<HEADLINE> First Employment Bank in Bangladesh Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Employment Bank, the first
of its kind in Bangladesh, went into operation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the bank open at the Osmany Memorial Hall, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed her belief that the bank would
help create employment opportunities and integrate the youth force
into the country's economic development activities.
</P>
<P>
The bank would open up new opportunities for eradicating
poverty and helping build a happy and prosperous society, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for proper care and supervision to
help achieve the objective of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the bank was to help unemployed, educated
youths, but it would simultaneously extend loans to those who do
not have formal education but have skills to make a project
viable, officials said.
</P>
<P>
With an initial paid-up capital of 1 billion taka (about 21.28
million U.S. dollars), the bank would be able to give loans to
unemployed youths.
</P>
<P>
A loan of up to 50,000 taka (about 1,064 dollars) would not
require any guarantor, but all the borrowers would have to deposit
their academic certificates with the bank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the paid-up capital, the government would provide 750
million taka (about 15.96 million dollars) with the rest coming
from local and foreign financial institutions, they said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Gasoline Price Fourth Highest Among OECD Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea ranked the fourth
highest in terms of gasoline prices among the 16 non-oil producing
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
According to a survey on the OECD's non-producing countries
issued by the South Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry and
Energy Tuesday, average gasoline prices in South Korea hit 1,224
won (0.915 U.S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
France ranked first with gasoline prices reaching 1.01 U.S.
dollars per liter, followed by Italy with 0.97 U.S. dollar and
Sweden with 0.968 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's gasoline price is 0.129 U.S. dollar higher than
the average price of 0.786 U.S. dollar per liter among the OECD
non-oil producing countries, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the high gasoline price to the
competition among domestic oil refiners.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, South Korea have raised the gasoline
prices several times due to won devaluation and other reasons.
Last Friday, the nation hiked the prices in a response to the rise
in traffic and basic taxes on fuel oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Chaos in Lesotho as Foreign Troops Intervene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Looting and incidents
of arson and mob violence are taking place in the Lesotho capital
of Maseru as a combined force of South African and Botswanan
troops try to restore order in the city, South African Radio
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maseru residents are reported to be reacting angrily to the
intervention by the combined task force.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic gunfire is still being heard, and the city is covered
in a pall of smoke after several government buildings in the city
center have been apparently set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The houses of Foreign Minister Tom Thabane and Deputy Prime
Minister Kelebone Maope have been burnt down, Thabane told the
radio.
</P>
<P>
"A coup has really taken place."
</P>
<P>
Thabane said the government is in hiding, adding that he and
his colleagues are safe.
</P>
<P>
There is now an anti-South African sentiment in Lesotho, the
radio said. Mobs of youths are reported to be attacking vehicles
with south African registration numbers. South African
journalists have to use vehicles without registration plates.
</P>
<P>
The radio said South Africa's high commissioner in Maseru has
returned to South Africa under military guard.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force spokeswoman, Laverne
Machine, confirmed that three South African soldiers have been
killed in the fighting. Eleven others were believed to be
injured.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe told the radio that the
decision to send troops to Lesotho was made by the Southern
African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
South African acting President Mangosuthu Buthelezi gave the
nod to send contingents to Lesotho with consultation to President
Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Both Mandela and Mbeki are abroad.
</P>
<P>
The 800-strong troops of South Africa and Botswana Tuesday
morning stormed the royal palace in Maseru, where a number of
opposition supporters are reported to have taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
The palace is now under the control of the foreign troops
and the palace gates have been re-opened and some of the
opposition supporters, who had taken refuge in the palace, left
the building.
</P>
<P>
The task force troops have now turned their attention to the
city center where looters are reported to be causing havoc, said
the radio.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The annual meeting of the
Pacific Rim Forum was held today in Shanghai, China's largest
trade and financial center, at a time when growing concern about
the negative impact of financial crisis in Southeast Asia is
sweeping the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 well-known political and economic figures from 18
countries and regions attended today's meeting, including former
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and Supachai Panitch Pakdi,
Thai deputy Prime Minister and Commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
Participants exchanged views on strategies for multinational
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region, trade and investment
opportunities in China, economic globalization and lessons to be
learned from the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Vice Mayor Chen Liangyu said that China will continue
to seek foreign investment and will participate in globalization
of the world economy, while at the same time improving its ability
to resist economic instability resulting from financial turmoil in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese government has adopted effective measures
to counter the effects of the crisis, including increasing
investment, encouraging domestic demand and steadfastly
maintaining the stability of the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Shanghai's export volume grew by 10.4 percent
over the past eight months, with the city's gross domestic product
up by 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that Shanghai's GDP is expected to end

<HEADLINE> East China's Buddhist Sacred Mountain Developing Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nowadays, Jiuhua Mountains, one
of China's four sacred mountains for Chinese Buddhists, looks like
a huge construction site, with many hotels and shops being built.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have invested heavily in the Buddhist place,
in east China's Anhui Province, in an effort to turn it into a
major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a 60-million-yuan-worth, 22.4-km-long
highway to link Jiuhua Mountains with neighboring Huangshan
Mountains, and a 26-million-yuan-worth cable-way, which will be
the first on-track cable-way in China.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, preparations for erecting a 99-m-tall bronze
statue of the Buddha are underway, which would cost some 400
million yuan. "The statue would be a symbol of Jiuhua Mountains,"
says Huang Yi, director of the Jiuhua Mountains Scenic Zone
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds will come from the sales of entry tickets and
donations from pilgrims, the official says. In 1997, the scenic
zone earned some 240 million yuan from tourists and related
industries, while the temples received at least 50 million yuan in
cash from pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Both religious and tourist activities have boomed in the
Jiuhua Mountains Scenic Zone, since it was opened up to tourists
in 1979. The number of tourists and pilgrims it receives has been
rising year by year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, 1.3 million people including 18,000 foreign
nationals visited the religious and scenic place, which is one of
the 44 national scenic reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiuhua Mountains has been a Buddhist sacred site for 1,500
years, says Master Shi Shengming of the Baijingtai
Temple. According to historical records, Buddhist monks first
arrived in the area as early as in the year 401,
</P>
<P>
Buddhism boomed in the area during the Ming and Qing dynasties
(1368-1911), when there were over 300 Buddhist temples and more
than 4,000 Buddhist monks and nuns.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are nine temples under state protection and 30
under provincial protection, and many valuable religious relics
are kept in these temples, including some Buddhist sutras. One
scripture was written by a monk in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
with his blood.
</P>
<P>
There are four bodies of monks that have remained intact for
many years like mummies after they died.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Credit Card Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China will give more emphasis
to the credit card business, which is expected to give a boost to
the Chinese economy by allowing individual credit, stimulating
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
This view is universally agreed on by card experts and
officials who were present today at an international seminar on
the credit card industry, and who have asked the state to develop
the card business as an independent industry and to develop credit
cards rather than the debit cards that have mainly been used so
far, so that Chinese use the cards more as electronic wallets.
</P>
<P>
Credit cards, which allow overdrafts, are still rare in China
and this has posed difficulties for the nation's card
market. China needs to introduce more credit cards, which could
solve the problem of deflation and give the economy a boost by
encouraging buying on credit and installment buying, according to
Wu Jinglian, a prominent economist.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that the card market is huge because more Chinese
need to buy goods in installments these days. Expensive goods like
houses and cars also mean a need for credit.
</P>
<P>
The credit card is the best way for banks to provide individual
credit and it is only with such services that the card business
can develop as an independent industry, Wu says.

<HEADLINE> China's Credit Card Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The credit card business has always been regarded as
subordinate to traditional banking services and not an independent
one. The government introduced cards to encourage the use of
electronic money, which is more convenient, and commercial banks
wanted to attract more deposits through the use of debit cards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China had issued 90 million cards that were
responsible for more than 1.6 trillion yuan in business annually.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese card market faces problems of slow growth
in the number of cards issued every year because it is not an
independent industry, according to Zhang Weidong, general manger
of Bank of China's retail banking department.
</P>
<P>
In addition, commercial banks' card business is in disarray and
each bank has hundreds of branch banks that are authorized to
issue their own cards. The poorly-managed card business has wasted
a great deal of hardware and the electronic network.
</P>
<P>
"We can not even figure out whether our bank's card business is
making a profit or a loss," Zhang comments.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 BOC branches have the right to issue cards, but
that figure may shrink to 200 this year as the bank tries to
improve the card business, which badly needs to be separated from
the banking business, with a unified and strengthened management,
says Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the card business needs to be developed
as an independent industry, rather than as a type of banking
business, according to card experts and officials at the seminar.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Empress Michiko
has canceled her planned visit to India on the government's advice
in view of India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the Japanese empress had
planned to take part in an international congress on "peace
through children's books" to be held on September 21 in New Delhi,
capital of India. She was invited back in March 1995 by the
organizers of Indian Committee of the International Board on Books
for Young People.
</P>
<P>
Japan felt strongly about India's nuclear tests conducted in
May this year and imposed economic sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly
Monday night, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi again
criticized the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. "India and
Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear tests in May to our deepest
regrets posing formidable challenges to the nuclear

<HEADLINE> Australian Parties Launch Policy Blitz, Polls Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) --Australia's Liberal and Labor
parties Tuesday launched a policy blitz on the environment, family
policy, education, justice and primary industries with the latest
opinion polls showing the October 3 election still on a
knife-edge.
</P>
<P>
With opinion polls showing the two major parties neck and neck,
preference votes, including those from the Democrats and Greens,
will be important to the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
Labor has announced a 95.6 million Australian dollars (55.92
million U.S. dollars) environment package. The opposition party
has also pledged to oppose the damming of West Australia's Fitzroy
River and prohibit the handover of Kakadu and Uluru national parks
to the Northern Territory Government.
</P>
<P>
Labor unveiled its campaign pitch to win back women and young
families by announcing a boost to childcare funding as the
centerpiece of its 390 million Australian dollars (228.15 million
U.S. dollars) family policy.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, on the other hand, announced 90 million
Australian dollars (52.65 million U.S. dollars) for the
environment, to be funded from its proposed further 16 percent
sale of Telstra, the public telecommunication company. The policy
is to target urban problems, including air quality, polluted urban
waterways, waste and chemicals management.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard Tuesday touched upon the foreign
policy in his campaign by announcing the creation of a prime
ministerial task force on reforming the world's financial
institutions and planning to use November's APEC meeting to help
lift the region out if its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would urge APEC leaders to be committed to the
so-called Basle core principles for effective banking supervision,
in a bid to strengthen Asian banking systems to prevent another
Asian financial meltdown from occurring.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Center for Independent Studies in Sydney, he
said the upcoming APEC leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur is an
important opportunity to pursue the goal of open markets and to
renew opportunities to reform.
</P>
<P>
Howard also revealed that he would set up a prime ministerial
task force of government and private sector representatives to
provide advice on reforming the world's financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region needed to ensure their
voices were heard more clearly in the International Monetary Fund
and in talks on the future of the world's financial institutions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also welcomed calls from U.S. President Bill Clinton for
an international response to the world financial crisis, saying
the proposals deserved full support from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
But he called on Japan to get its economic house in order and
to develop more responsive decision-making structures as a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
The Australian's Newspoll Tuesday showed Labor still ahead of
the coalition by one point, despite a one-point drop in support
over the past week.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loess Plateau Project (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Qiuming, deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Finance
Bureau, says that by the end of June the project had covered more
than 60,000 ha., or 63 percent of the planned area, with terraced
land, sediment control dams, and land-stabilizing trees, shrubs,
orchards and pasture.
</P>
<P>
He says that Shanxi had used more than 345 million yuan
including 215 million yuan in World Bank loans and that the
project has added 1.1 mu of terraced land for each person in the
project area, and 0.4 mu of orchards and 1 mu of forest.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion in project areas has been brought under control,
with agricultural production conditions improved and grain yields
increasing sharply.
</P>
<P>
In the project area, the sediment flow into the Yellow River is
expected to be cut by more than five million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Voegele, the World Bank official in charge of the
project, said that the project is successful, its quality is
excellent, and he is satisfied with the work of local officials
and is pleased to see that this has happened so fast. Nobody
thought a few years ago that the success would be so visible and
so fast, he says.
</P>
<P>
Because of the success of the first phase, the World Bank and
Shanxi provincial government will assess the second phase. The
total watershed rehabilitation area covered by the two projects
will account for more than 11 percent of the province's total soil
erosion, he says.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Rapid Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China has experienced a rapid
economic growth over the past 20 years, according to an official
release from the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
China is now seventh in the world in terms of economic
strength, according to the release, which added that the gross
domestic product has reached 7.47 trillion yuan, with an annual
growth rate of 9.8 percent for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997 China's agricultural output
reached 2.47 trillion yuan, nearly four times that of 1978's
figure, while that of industry reaching 11.2 trillion yuan, 14
times greater than the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
In the 1981-1997 period, investments in fixed assets totalled
14 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the investment structure was improved with
the construction of a group of key infrastructural projects such
as the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station and the Beijing-Kowloon
railway.
</P>
<P>
Along with economic development, a "buyer's market" is taking
shape in China, said the release, noting that in 1997 retail sales
in the country reached 2.,72 trillion yuan, some 20 times that of
1978.
</P>
<P>
China now has trade relations with more than 200 countries and
regions, and has used 348.3 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds
in the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loess Plateau Rehabilitation Project In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A great change has taken
place in a short a period of time thanks to a World Bank Loess
Plateau watershed rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shan, a 43-year-old farmer in the village of Zijinshan,
Pianguan County, is among the first farmers on the Loess Plateau
to benefit. In 1994, Wang used a World Bank loan of some 3,000
yuan to build 17 mu (about 1.14 ha.) of terraced land, increasing
per mu grain yield from 75 kg. to more than 250 kg.
</P>
<P>
"The yield of the original land was very low and we had to rely
on the weather for food," he explains, "When there was a drought,
we didn't have enough to eat."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Shanxi used 37 million U.S. dollars in soft loans from
the World Bank, along with a Chinese government investment of 200
million yuan for the watershed rehabilitation project on 5,052
sq.km. of land in 67 townships in 8 counties, where 376,000 people
live.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi and the World Bank have designated two objectives for
the project: environmental protection and poverty alleviation,
reducing the sediment flow into the Yellow River and increasing
agricultural production and farmers' incomes.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Minister: I Differ With President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Dismissed Zambian Minister of
Commerce, Trade and Industry Enoch Kavindele has said he differed
with president Frederick Chiluba on the issue of reducing duty on
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Tuesday quoted him as saying here Monday
that at a meeting in June this year he explained to Chiluba the
importance of reducing duty because many jobs would be lost if
Zambia bottlers closed down due to losses.
</P>
<P>
He said he also told Chiluba that many companies depend on the
Coca Cola company for business.
</P>
<P>
"On June 11, 1998 President Chiluba called us to State House
over the same matter and I explained to the president the
importance of reducing duty. I said that too many jobs would be
lost and that many companies like Kapiri Glass Company depended
on Zambia Bottlers," said the former minister, who was sacked
Monday in a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he will remain an ordinary member of the
ruling party and have no intentions of joining other parties.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele repeated Sunday his warning that about 19,000 jobs
will be lost and Zambia's economy will be distorted greatly if
the country's Finance Ministry does not reduce excise duty
quickly on soft drinks to avert an impending closure of Zambia
Bottlers, the manufacturer of Coca Cola products in the country.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that his ministry has informed the
Finance Ministry that the current 25 percent excise duty on
carbonated drinks is not viable and recommended that it be
reduced to five percent.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the government promised to reduce duty on
Coca Cola for Zambia Bottlers but has not honored its promise to
date. The company however has almost doubled the price of its
product from 500 Kwacha (0.25 U.S.Dollar) to 900 Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The price increase has invitably slumped the demand for the
products while retailers in some border areas have started
importing soft drinks from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Last week the company suspended its production and threatened
to pull out of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
But the country's finance minister branded the company as a
blackmailer which has for a long time been evading tax.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Corruption Scandal Puts Thai Coalition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua -- A corruption scandal involving
Health Ministry officials has put Thailand's coalition government
at crossroads where it has to decide whether to bring in new
partners to ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana submitted his resignation last
week, and was followed by his deputy Thirawat Siriwansan who
stepped down Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two men, belonging to the Social Action Party (SAP),
resigned over a full-blown scandal involving the Health Ministry
accused of re-selling over-priced pharmaceutical products worth
millions of dollars at the market.
</P>
<P>
Official investigation over the alleged irregularities is still
in progress, and that means the SAP will be in an even worse
situation. Not only were the two cabinet members disgraced by the
outrage, but two other SAP MPs who serve as their advisers are
expected to face legal troubles of their own if more evidence is
uncovered about wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of Rakkiat and Thirawat, the SAP is at a
low ebb of its standing in the coalition and does not have much
bargaining power left now despite some word of personal support
from Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai who said the other day that the
tainted officials did not mean the SAP was a bad lot.
</P>
<P>
The SAP's disgrace also weakens the already fragile coalition
led by Chuan's Democratic Party. Chuan reportedly is lobbying
support for bringing in the Social Development Party (SDP) into
the coalition to ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the Democrats and the SDP were said to be on
the verge of striking a partnership deal, with the latter
reportedly softening its cabinet quota demands.
</P>
<P>
Bringing in the SDP, with some 51 votes in the 393-member
Parliament, would mean that the government commanded a very
comfortable majority in the House and there might be fewer scary
scenarios about sharp shortfalls of votes when crucial bills are
presented to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats' allies, in a bid to protect their
ministerial seats, are united in blocking the entry of the SDP,
thus rendering a cabinet reshuffle impossible at present. A
government official said the SDP has to wait a little longer
before it can enter the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The allies, fearing that Chuan could dump any of them and turn
to the SDP, assured Chuan of unwavering support and discipline at
future crucial House meetings. "We'd like to give you our
encouragement and our pledge to see to it that all votes are
accounted for," a source quoted Agricultural Minister Pongpol
Adireksarn as saying. Such commitment was echoed by other cabinet
members.
</P>
<P>
In return, Chuan accepted the allies' suggestion that it is not
the best time to bring in the SDP at present. He also decided to
keep the scandal-tainted SAP in the coalition at all costs, even
the party had a much less favorable cabinet quota.
</P>
<P>
Chuan denied being pressured by the allies to reject the SDP.
"It has been my principle that a consensus among the partners is
needed before such a big change," Chuan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said courting the SDP, with its long-standing
reputation as a prima donna and unsubstantiated claims of
excellence in economic management, and mollifying the present
partners could mean double jeopardy for the Chuan coalition.
</P>
<P>
Chuan knows he has to continue his balancing act -- pacifying
nervous allies while keeping the SDP hopeful over the possibility
of joining the ruling bloc in the future, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Rules on Family Planning for Transient Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's State Family Planning
Commission (SFPC) today published a revised version of its
Regulations on Family Planning for the Transient Population, whose
purpose is to reduce the number of unregistered births and control
population growth.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will take effect January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of transient people in China reached 100 million by
1997, more than 3 times the 1982 figure. The increase has put
great pressure on family planning in both urban and rural areas,
says Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of SFPC, who explains
that "transient population" refers to people who leave the place
where they are registered as permanent residents to work or start
families elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Governments of areas where transient people reside have the
major responsibility for family planning, which includes checking
marriage and family status, providing contraceptives and birth
control services, and dealing with those who have violated family
planning regulations, according to the revised regulations.
</P>
<P>
People involved in forging or selling family planning
certificates or gaining such certificates fraudulently will be
dealt with by family planning departments above the county level
and may be fined up to 1,000 yuan (120 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Anyone found providing fake certificates of marriage or family
status will have to return to their hometown to apply for a proper
certificate and may be fined.
</P>
<P>
Units or individuals who employ transient people are
responsible for their family planning and should have an
inspection by local government and neighborhood committee. Owners
of houses where transient people live have to help promote family
planning.
</P>
<P>
Some of the regulations are meant to protect the rights of
transient people. One regulation says that birth control fees for
married transient people will be paid by the organizations they
are working for or by the local government of the area where they
have registered as permanent residents.

<HEADLINE> Tension Rises in North, East Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA,Sept 22 (Xinhua) -- Jose Joao Manuel "Jota",
spokesman for the general staff of the Angolan armed forces, said
here Tuesday that the military situation in the northern and
eastern part of the country is "rather tense."
</P>
<P>
In Uige and Malange provinces in the north and Lunda-Norte and
Lunda-Sul Provinces in the east, forces loyal to Jonas Savimbi,
chairman of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), have beefed up their military operations, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the officer added, the government troops are still in
firm control of the situation and are ready for mopping-up in
certain areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fernando Jose Canga, deputy governor of Uige
Province, noted Monday that unidentified international airplanes
continued landing in the airport in Maquela do Zombo City, north
of the province, about 40 km from the border of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), to provide food and weapons for UNITA
forces stationed there.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, UNITA forces occupied Damba and Maquela do
Zombo, two cities in north Uige, with the assistance of
Banyamulenge rebels from the DRC, and attacked heavily areas
around the two cities, killing and wounding several dozens of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
On September 16, UNITA forces ambushed a U.N. food convoy,
wounding three peacekeeping soldiers (one already dead), with the
rest ten still missing.
</P>
<P>
They also destroyed nine trucks and robbed the goods onboard.

<HEADLINE> China Goes All Out to Ensure Safety of Nuke Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China has effectively
guaranteed the safety of nuclear power plants as the country's
nuclear industry is moving into a hective year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official in charge of nuclear industry,
China is busy carrying out its nuclear power projects this
year. However, first of all, China has ensured the safe and stable
operation of the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country has continued to undertake a number of
nuclear construction projects this year, namely, Qinshan 2,
Qinshan 3, Ling'ao and Lianyungang nuclear power projects.
</P>
<P>
The official has urged all nuclear departments to have a
greater sense of responsibility, improve management systems, and
enhance the safety of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the relevant parties have set up a joint meeting system
and a regular coordination meeting system to exclusively research
the construction of nuclear power projects, and solve problems
jointly and quickly.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country's two functioning
nuclear power plants, Qinshan and Daya Bay, have maintained stable
and safe operation. And both of the plants have been refueled and
overhauled for a second time. So far, the two plants have
generated nearly 15 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have found that the amount of waste discharged by
Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants meet government-set
standards and have passed
safety checks conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
They posed no harm to the surrounding environment and have
helped to build a good image for China's nuclear power industry,
he stressed.

<P>
ABU DHABI -- Figures released by Dubai customs office showed
the United Arab Emirates imported 29.57 tonnes of gold in August,

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's information industry
wants to shake up its research and development institutes to make
them more market oriented.
</P>
<P>
The new Ministry of the Information Industry (MII) has taken
over more than 70 research and development institutes that used to

</P>
<P>
An official of the former Ministry of Electronics Industry
says that, in the past, research institutes relied on the
government for funding and their main job was projects that the
government assigned, but in recent years, the government has
adopted new policies to encourage them to link research and
development more closely to commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
Now over half of their operating funds come from the
marketplace. Zhou said that the academy wants to get away from
government sponsorship.

<P>
ANKARA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 87 kilograms of
hashish has been seized in an operation against drug trafficking
in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement issued Tuesday by Turkish police
as saying that police teams had confiscated the hashish in bags in
their operation in the city of Malatya. However, it did not
disclose when the drugs were caught.
</P>
<P>
Nine Turks were detained in connection with the drugs, said
the agency.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Turkish police have seized 10.5
kilograms of hashish and arrested two suspected drug traffickers
in Bolu, about 200 kilometers west of Ankara, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is on a transit route of drugs to Europe from the border
areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996, Turkish police seized
4.4 tonnes of heroin, which accounted for 40 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda's Strenuous Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, one of the few
countries in the world which suffer most from HIV/AIDS, has
fought a strenuous battle against the pandemic over the past
decade and reaped a lot from its efforts in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of more than 500,000 Ugandans
have died of AIDS, ever since the first case was made public in
1982 in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an estiM;ted one-tenth of its 20 million population
are said to be HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has so far borne the brunt of this scourge, which
constitutes one of the most serious health and socio-economic
problems. It is one of the leading causes of death among adults
and children under five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the HIV/AIDS surveillance report, 53,306
cumulative AIDS cases had been reported and recorded by the end
of 1997. Of these, 49,432 were adults and the rest 3,874 were
almost children below 12 years of age. Owing to under-reporting,
the true figure is projected five to eight times higher.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rampant spread of AIDS, the overall mean
age of adult AIDS cases was 32.5 years and that of paediatric
AIDS was 2.7 years. It is reported that one million Ugandan
children have been orphaned due to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Babies and children are the innocent victims of this terminal
disease. The infant mortality rate of infants born to
HIV-positive mothers is 163 per 1,000 live births while that for
infants born to non-HIV positive mothers is 34.
</P>
<P>
The HIV-positive children or those born of HIV-positive
mothers face deprivation, stigmatization and discrimination. They
are most likely to drop out of school and most vulnerable to
sexual abuse and harassment.
</P>
<P>
This hindrance to socio-economic development was timely
recognized by the Ugandan government which has taken a series of
effective measures to curb the growth of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The struggle against HIV/AIDS in Uganda can be categorized in
three phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was during the early 1980s. Government and
public response to the new disease was initially ad hoc and slow.
In this phase, the communities, especially families and clans,
together with the non-governmental organizations and the
religious sector spontaneously took responsibility of the
response by providing care and support to the infected.
</P>
<P>
It took some four years before the country was officially and
categorically told of the dangers of the epidemic. This means
that action to address the epidemic in a systematic way was
similarly delayed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda's Strenuous Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second phase was in the latter half of 1980s. The
Ministry of Health took official charge of coordinating the
national response through the AIDS Control Program.
</P>
<P>
Within four years, the government made strides in
epidemiology, significantly reducing infection through blood
transfusion and laying a solid foundation for Uganda's now quite
effective Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
intervention which has created more than 90 percent of public
awareness about the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The IEC program also attracted international community to
assist Uganda through supporting and supplementing the activities
of the program.
</P>
<P>
From then on started the third phase. In 1990, a National Task
Force on AIDS was set up, which reviews the country's approach
and coordinates nationwide efforts.
</P>
<P>
Major international agencies operating in the country were
actively involved in the exercise, the culmination of which is
the establishment of Uganda AIDS Commission and the formation and
development of the National Multisectoral Strategy.
</P>
<P>
With enhancement of public awareness and establishment of more
clinics across the country, HIV prevalence trends have declined
in urban areas from the highest rate of 30 percent to an average
high of 15 percent. In some rural areas, the rate has plummeted
from 43 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, people have begun to undertake voluntary testing and
counseling. Basic and clinical research has also recorded a
great breakthrough. HIV vaccine and drug development have also
achieved a lot. Uganda was recently chosen as one of the few
pilot countries for AIDS drug trials.
</P>
<P>
These achievements cannot guarantee that the prospect of
curbing this disease in Uganda is bright and rosy. It still has
a long way to go and has many challenges to face. Inadequate
funding, difficulty in ensuring positive behavior change and
sensitization programs are all severe hindrances to further
achievement.
</P>
<P>
However, as President Yoweri Museveni said at an AIDS
conference Monday morning, Uganda, together with many other
sub-Sahara countries which suffer from this disease, will
continue its battle against AIDS, the leading cause of death for
young Africans.

<HEADLINE> French Ambassador Comments On Jospin's Upcoming China Visit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- France's Ambassador to China
Pierre Morel told Xinhua today that Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's' visit to China will bring French-Chinese relations to a
new stage in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Jospin is expected to visit China September 24-26 at the
invitation of Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Morel said that the joint communique issued by the Chinese and
French governments in 1994 solved a number of difficulties in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
When President Jacques Chirac visited China in May 1997 and
signed a joint declaration on a comprehensive Sino-French
partnership for the 21st century with Jiang Zemin, the title
itself spoke of its contents.
</P>
<P>
France's dialogues with China are quite positive on
constructing a truly multipolarized world together, he says, and
there are daily exchanges in different levels. Jospin's upcoming
visit and Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to France last April reflect
the sound relations between France and China, he said, including
reinforced economic and trade ties, unprecedentedly rich cultural
exchanges, and frequent, and frequent effective political
dialogues.

</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he believes that exchanges between Europe
and China will continue to grow and that Europe is an economic
giant and a center of technical innovation. Europe is ready to
serve the development of a more harmonious world, and no doubt,
China can get a lot of experience from Europe, and find many
opportunities for cooperation there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Morel assumed his position in November 1996. He said, the
French and Chinese people have known each other a long time and
cherish a special feeling for each other. It is exciting for him
to devote his efforts to the formation of a long-term bilateral
partnership that is really effective, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Falls Victim to Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar edged
lower Tuesday, continuing this week's trend of quiet, range-bound
local trade.
</P>
<P>
The local unit ended a little weaker at 58.43 U.S. cents from
58.67 here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank foreign exchange dealer Will Richardson said the
week had been very quiet for the Australian dollar with the focus
on offshore events.
</P>
<P>
He said the local currency was failing to make an impact during
trading in sessions.
</P>
<P>
The currency spent the session in a range of 58.30 U.S. cents
to 58.50.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the fact that the Australian dollar had failed
to break through on the topside a couple of times on the day
indicated the risks for the currency were on the downside.
</P>
<P>
"It is really dependent on the U.S. dollar," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese come out with an agreement on the banking
reform package and the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate goes
to 130 yen then Aussie will reach 60.00 U.S cents again."
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the local currency was trading at 78.69
Japanese yen from 78.10 and 0.9889 German marks from 0.9880
previously.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan to Enter Crucial Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will
begin critical rounds of talks on a new fishery pact in Tokyo
Wednesday, the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Japan Tuesday, Yun Byung-se, deputy director
general of the ministry's Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau, said
South Korea and Japan could narrow their differences on most
contentious issues to work out a draft fishery accord which will
replace the 1965 fishing accord.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that South Korean Minister of Maritime Affairs
and Fisheries Kim Sun-kil is scheduled to meet with his Japanese
counterpart Shoichi Nakagawa Wednesday for the joint-fishing area
issue. The ministry used to say that the issue of where to
establish a joint fishing area should be decided at
ministerial-level negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, South Korea and Japan have been
working for for an early settlement of the fishery issues as they
set October 7 this year when President Kim Dae-jung pays a state
visit to Japan as the deadline for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the past talks, South Korea and Japan have been at odds on
where to set up the new joint fishing area in waters between them.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has tried to keep Korean fishing vessels away from
its coast rich in maritime resources, reportedly insists that the
joint fishing area does not extend beyond the longitude of 135
degrees east while South Korea demands the area be extended as far
as the longitude of 136 degrees east.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1965 fisheries pact, South Korean and Japanese
fishing boats are allowed to operate in all waters, except for the
12-mile exclusive fishing zones off each other's coasts.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Rapid Economic Development Over Past 20 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China has registered rapid
economic growth over the past 20 years, according to an official
release from the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
China is now listed No. 7 in terms of economic strength in the
world, said the release, adding that the gross domestic product
reached 7,477.2 billion yuan, registering an annual growth rate of
9.8 percent for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997, China's agriculture output reached
2,470.9 billion yuan, 3.4 times that of 1978's figure, while that
of industries reaching 11.2 trillion yuan, 14 times that of
1978's figure.
</P>
<P>
In the 1981-1997 period, the investment in fixed assets
totalled 14 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investment structure was improved with a batch
of key infrastructural projects being constructed during
the period, such as the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station and the

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1997, China's foreign trade volume was 325.1 billion
U.S. dollars, increasing from 20.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The living standards of the Chinese people are improving as
their incomes rise, said the release.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the per capita disposable income for urban residents
in the country reached 5,160 yuan, registering an annual growth
rate of 6.2 percent for the past 20 years, while the per capita
net income for people in rural areas came to 2,090 yuan, growing
8.1 percent each year.

<P>
MACAO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a new customs
building will begin next week on a patch of reclaimed land between
the Macao peninsula and Macao's Taipa Island, the Macao Daily News

</P>
<P>
Costing 98 million patacas (about 12.25 million U.S. dollars),
the building will be situated on the Macao side of the "Lotus

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Lose $80M to Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may lose 71 billion
Naira (about 80 million U.S. Dollars) in export earnings this
year due to the lingering Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted a report by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) as saying
that the loss from the Asian crisis may lower Nigeria's gross
domestic product (GDP) by 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report titled "Trade Implications of the East Asian
Crisis: Impact on Markets for Primary Commodities," identifies
Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Cameroun, Gabon, Egypt and other
African countries as vulnerable to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's fate is indicative of the experience of developing
countries that are largely dependent on export of primary
commodities, such as gold, wood, oil, cotton, sugar, palm oil,
cocoa and coffee.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Asian countries are not only
importing fewer commodities, but also producing at cheaper costs
and dumping more products on African countries.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a general fall in prices of primary
products, due to depressed demand. For example, petroleum prices
have declined sharply and the impact on petroleum exporting
countries is particularly strong, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report said, Asian crisis will lead to less
investment from Asia and reduce the competitivity of African
products, therefore, threatening Africa's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not bad news for Africa, the newspaper said,
adding that machinery made in Asia for processing farm products
will become cheaper and this is an advantage of the crisis for
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called for the establishment of an African-Asian
forum to explore possible opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fire Destroys S. Somali District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fire has devastated
the southern Somalia's Sablale district, 235 km south of the
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received through the VHF radios, Monday's
fire has destroyed more than 80 percent of the town's residential
areas, leaving behind only 30 houses out of the nearly 1,500
ones.
</P>
<P>
The fire has also destroyed all of the main food stores, shops
and the market of the town. The people of Sablale have just
returned to the town after seven months of exodus to the nearby
villages following heavy floods that besieged the town from every
corner during the disastrous floods early in the year, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is not known. However, people from the
town attributed the fire that gushed into their houses to the
wildly grown grass that caught fire and took over all of the
residential areas. The grass had grown to more than a meter high
during the absence of the people after the floods.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Ali Rage, the district commissioner, said the
population of the town has moved to the nearby village of Muddul
Barawe, 30 west of Sablale for safety.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great misfortune, there has been no reports of
casualties caused by the fire other than a man called Mukhtar Ali
Unka who remained missing since the fire started.
</P>
<P>
"We believe he is dead by now lying under the rubble of the
fire," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Ali Rage noted that the town now remains to have the
same name but without its numerous houses.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can say it drew to the size of a small village rather
than a district," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moallim Biyana, an owner of a small house in Sablale, said he
has moved his family to Muddul Barawe village now, but without
any food. He said he has been trying to recover from the last
year's floods. "Neither floods nor fire leave anything for the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner had appealed to the world community
and the international non-governmental organizations to give a
helping hand especially to the women and children who just fled
without any food, shelter or medicine.
</P>
<P>
"The water would let the people at least to take with them
some of their food and clothes, but the fire does not give any
chance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Union Cabinet Recommends Imposing President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP)-led Union Cabinet in an over-two-hour meeting here Tuesday
decided to recommend to the president to dismiss the present Rabri
Devi government in eastern India's Bihar state and impose
president's rule over it.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet also recommended keeping the State Assembly in
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet after a long discussion accepted the report by
State Governor Sundar Singh Bhandari who had recommended
imposition of president's rule in the state.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation for dismissal of the Bihar state government
came a day after the Rabri government won a vote of confidence in
the State Assembly.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the Union Cabinet made the recommendation, Union
Home Minister L. K. Advani said, "It was not just the law and
order situation. The state seems to have withered away in Bihar."
</P>
<P>
The present Bihar government, which is ruled by an opposition
party, Tuesday called a state-wide strike Wednesday in protest
against the center's recommendation to impose president's rule in
the state. The decision was taken after the state cabinet held an
emergency meeting to review the situation arising out of the Union
Cabinet's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
State ministers said the strike was called to protest against
the discriminatory, unconstitutional and draconian action of the
Union Cabinet. It is a murder of democracy and politically
motivated move.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties such as Congress and Communist Party of
India, are opposed to the imposition of president's rule in Bihar.
Even some of BJP partners have also shared oppositions' view over
the issue. Some opposition parties even said that the law and
order situation in the BJP- ruled Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra
states is worse than Bihar, and president's rule should have been
first imposed in these two states.
</P>
<P>
Union Law Minister M. Thambidurai, who comes from one of BJP's
partners, demanded the dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government of
southern India when the Union Cabinet Tuesday took up the issue of
imposition of president's rule in Bihar.
</P>
<P>
The president is reportedly to have told the BJP government
delegation which called on him here Tuesday that he would go
through the governor's report and consult other opposition parties
before taking a decision on the cabinet recommendation.
</P>
<P>
More political unrest is expected to follow in the country if
president's rule is imposed on Bihar, one of the biggest and
poorest states in India, diplomatic circles here said.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Worsening air pollution
has continued to ravage traffic-congested, skyscraper-packed urban
areas in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) Tuesday recorded
"very high" air pollution index of 167 on the roadside in Causeway
Bay, a bustling business district on the Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
The figure indicated deteriorating roadside air quality from
that of Monday and Sunday, when the pollution index was measured
between 135 and 138.
</P>
<P>
Pang Sik-wing, Principal Environment Protection Officer, blamed
a high level of nitrogen dioxide for the poor roadside air
quality.
</P>
<P>
"The moderate northerly wind has brought a background ozone
level to Hong Kong. The ozone enhanced the oxidation of nitric
oxide emitted from diesel vehicles into nitrogen dioxide, which
could not disperse quickly among high-rise buildings," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of vehicles in Hong Kong still use diesel, the
main local air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
The general air pollution index sampled in different parts of
Hong Kong was also "high", ranging between 74 and 86, according to
EPD. Visibility was poor despite the sunny weather because of
photochemical reactions. The department advised people with heart
and respiratory illnesses to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution is likely to stay for a few days as similar
weather conditions will last for some time, according to the
officer.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Head Leaves for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Jurin Laksanawisit, chairman
of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), left for China Tuesday
at the head of an 18-strong delegation to build travel and
sporting relations with a country that is rapidly becoming one of
Thailand's major tourist source-markets, a TAT press release said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long visit, Jurin will meet with senior
officials of the China National Tourism Administration and lead a
series of table-top shows between Thai sellers and Chinese buyers
in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou from September 22 to 28.
</P>
<P>
The TAT is focusing on China as one of its top markets for
1998/99. Jurin will be informing the Chinese travel trade of a
number of measures taken by the two governments to remove barriers
to travel, such as offering visa on arrival facilities.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people from the southwestern province of Yunnan can now
visit up to nine provinces in northern Thailand with only a
special entry document to obtain visa-on-arrival at border
checkpoints in promoting Greater Mekong Sub-region and
intra-regional travel.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 54 direct flights a week linking China
with Thailand by Thai Airways International and five Chinese
airlines.
</P>
<P>
This means there is no shortage of seat capacity which will
provide a strong foundation for continued growth in visitors from
China to Thailand, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China was Thailand's sixth largest market overall and
for the first six months of this year, it is ranked as the third
largest market in Asia. Since 1992, visitor arrivals from China
have more than tripled and are continuing this healthy trend, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Jurin, as minister in charge of sports, will also seek to
generate interest among the Chinese sports community to send an
extra-large delegation to participate in the 13th Asian Games to
be held in Bangkok between December 6 and 20.

<HEADLINE> Australian Commodity Export Incomes Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian commodity export
earnings for the financial year of 1998-1999 would be slightly
lower than the previous year, Australia's official chief commodity
forecaster said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total commodity export receipts were expected to reach 66.5
billion Australian dollars (38.57 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998-1999, down 530 million Australian dollars (307 million U.S.
dollars), or 0.8 percent, from the previous year's tally, the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE)
said in its latest snapshot of the nation's commodity outlook.
</P>
<P>
However, higher farm production spurred on by rain and the
prospect of even more competitive exports from a further drop in
the Australian dollar make the latest predictions almost 2 billion
Australian dollars (1.16 billion U.S. dollars) more optimistic
than ABARE's previous quarterly estimate of 64.5 billion
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals a mixed bag in which some commodities are
faring better than others amidst the worsening world economy and
warns the Asian crisis could still deepen.
</P>
<P>
The mineral resources sector, where export earnings are tipped
to rise 1.5 percent to 41.9 billion Australian dollars (24.3
billion U.S. dollars), remains a strong performer.
</P>
<P>
"Although world prices of most minerals are forecast to be flat
or down, an assumed 15 percent fall in the Australian dollar means
that prices received by local exporters will be higher," ABARE
Executive Director Brian Fisher said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Dairy exports are expected to surge past 2 billion Australian
dollars, thanks to a lower Australian dollar expected to average
58 U.S. cents over 1998-1999, and the outlook for cotton and beef
is also brighter.
</P>
<P>
Australia's farm sector overall is expected to contribute about
22 billion Australian dollars (12.76 billion U.S. dollars) to
total export revenue, down four percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Large world stocks and increasing competition should offset the
benefits of a lower Australian dollar for wheat growers, leading
to a drop of 25 Australian dollars in wheat production profit to
170 Australian dollars per ton over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau slashed its eastern market wool indicator forecast
to an average 560 Australian cents a kilogram clean from its
previous estimate of 655 Australian cents, citing weak demand and
strong competition from cheaper, synthetic fibers.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the stability of the Chinese currency is important
for Australian commodity producers as China is one of the leading
customers of some Australian commodities, such as iron ore and
wool.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a weaker Chinese currency could hit
Australia's exports of wool, cotton and some minerals by making
them more expensive for China to import as well as indirectly
hurting Australian exporters through lower world prices.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged time and again that it would not devalue its
currency.

Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim in front of the
courthouse here and the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil near here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
on September 2 and a day later was expelled from the ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) of which he was deputy
president for "low morals." He was arrested by police at his house
here on Sunday night after leading an alleged illegal rally and
procession which later erupted into rioting. Police used water
cannon and fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
In Ghazali's statement, the public are advised not to join and
to stay away from illegal assemblies organized by "irresponsible
elements."
</P>
<P>
Ghazali said public cooperation would greatly help the police
maintain law and order and ease traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the federal capital is quite normal Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China Reducing Amount Of Logging In Lesser Hinggan Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Yichun City in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province has started protecting forest
resources by reducing timber cutting in a forest farm in the
Lesser Hinggan Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The four-million-hectare Yichun forest farm has a forest
coverage of 72 percent and is a major production base of Korean
pines. Forest resources and timber reserves there have been
shrinking rapidly in the past years because of excessive cutting.
</P>
<P>
The forest farm will cut timber production by 30 percent in the
next 2 years, with the annual timber output being cut from 2.26
million cubic meters to 1.59 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the forest farm's 16 organizations will completely stop
logging and shift to growing trees and doing other business and
the remaining 6 will limit timber production.
</P>
<P>
The farm will close 500,000 hectares of mountainous areas for
afforestation and authorities have changed cutting operations,
banning the use of machines in logging zones to protect the growth
of young trees.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Gas Reserve 10th Largest in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's natural gas reserve
stood at 124 trillion standard cubic feet, or 3.4 trillion
standard cubic meters as at the end of 1997, which is the 10th
largest in the world, the Nigerian Tribune said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Dalhatu Bayero, managing director of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as making the
disclosure at a seminar entitled "Nigerian gas, from waste to
resources" in capital Abuja Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official also put Nigeria's crude oil reserve at 25
billion barrels, with a production ratio of about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Bayero said the country's gas reserve may increase to 300
trillion standard cubic feet or 8.41 trillion standard cubic
meters as exploration continues.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the NNPC have put in place 1,800 kilometers
of gas pipeline network with a daily designed delivery capacity
of 2.5 billion standard cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
Through the pipelines, natural gas are currently delivered to
Lagos, Kogi and Akwa Ibom states from gas fields in the Niger
Delta basin, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, regretted that the absence of a
national gas policy, inadequate pricing and shortage of fund are
preventing Nigeria from a better utilization of its gas
resources.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 80 percent of the gas produced in
association with crude oil are currently being flared in Nigeria,
compared with less than 20 percent in other major oil-producing
countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iran and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The official called for a deregulation of the energy market to
encourage private investment and a national gas policy to define
the roles of producers, end-users and the government.
</P>
<P>
In this end, he disclosed that the government has already
approved the construction of a 350 megawatts power plant in the
Rivers State by the Mobile Production Nigeria Corporation, which
will be powered by natural gas produced by Mobile and NNPC's oil
fields.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Horticultural Sector to Reap $52M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is expected to reap
about 104 billion Kwacha or 52 million U.S. Dollars from its
horticultural sector this season.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted Mable Mandela, chief
executive of Zambia Export Growers Association (ZEGA) who made
the projection, as saying that the country's horticultural sector
was expected to expand by an estimated one third over last
season's earnings of 40 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Volume of exports over the 1997/98 export season were 5,500
tons which earned us about 40 million U.S. Dollars, recording a
35 percent increase on the previous year," Mandela said in an
interview at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
She added that the volume is expected to rise further as
hectarage has been expanded to over 30 percent for the current
1998/99 export season.
</P>
<P>
The horticultural sector ranks as one of the major foreign
exchange earners in Zambia and is also generating a lot of
employment in the country, with over 8,000 people employed in the
sector, according to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
She noted that more and more indigenous people including women
are entering the sector, most of whom are taking advantage of
ZEGA's open door policy especially in the area of providing
information pertaining to the industry, which is rated the third
biggest exporter in Africa, after Kenya and Zimbabwe.

SINGAPORE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices went up on the
Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as the benchmark Straits Times
Index (STI) gained 13.73 points to end at 896 .32 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 143.99 million units worth 167.99
million Singapore dollars (about 96.98 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers outnumbered losers by 165 to 50 with 205 counters
unchanged.

companies with a big number of employees would definitely benefit
in terms of labor cost savings.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also attributed today's rise to gains of regional
markets which were buoyed up.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that traders were picking up values after the

LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Stock Exchange
(NSE) has suspended trading in shares of 32 companies who has
failed to pay their listing fee, according to media reports
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the suspension order was passed to the securities
dealers at Monday's trading session, at the end of a three-week
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
About 70 companies were warned three weeks ago to pay their
listing fee or face sanctions, while the 32 suspended firms have
apparently failed to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Among the suspended is the Nigeria Cement Company Plc, which
is the oldest quoted company at the NSC, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the suspension may lead to the de-listing
of some of the 32 firms who have been dormant and non performing
for some time.
</P>
<P>
Up to the first half of 1997, there were 183 listed firms at
the NSE, with a total capitalization of about 4.6 billion U.S.

TIANJIN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese port city of Tianjin
has 1,232 community doctors, forming a community medical care
network that provides residents with disease prevention, health
care, recuperation, psychological and health education services.
</P>
<P>
One resident, Su Henian, and his wife used to go hospital for
blood pressure problems, but now whenever they have problems, they
just dial a phone number, and a doctor comes over.
</P>
<P>
The doctor who saves the old couple from having to deal with
traffic problems has been doing this for 5 years.
</P>
<P>
The diseases the city residents suffer from have changed from
contagious disease to chronic disease and problems of old age,
says Huang Jinhu, director of the municipal health bureau's
community service department.
</P>
<P>
"These patients don't need to be hospitalized, and the best way
is to arrange home-based medical care for them," he says. More
than 36,000 patients receive treatment at home.
</P>
<P>
Health awareness has also increased in recent years, with
emphasis shifting to health care and health consultation. As many
as 923,713 households have established files on health care.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up 1,185 healthcare service sites since 1993,

<HEADLINE> More S. African Soldiers Wounded in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 South
African soldiers were wounded since South African troops crossed
into Lesotho Tuesday morning to help restore stability in the
mountain kingdom, the South African National Defense Force said.
</P>
<P>
Six of those injured were taken to hospitals in South Africa,
and others did not need hospitalization and were remaining in
Lesotho, South African National Defense Force (SANDF) spokesman
Louis Kirstein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
None of the soldiers was seriously injured. Some were hit by
shrapnel, while others suffered light wounds, Kirstein said.
</P>
<P>
Laverne Machine, another SANDF spokeswoman, said contrary to
earlier reports, 200 troops from Botswana had not yet arrived in
Lesotho, but were expected to join the 600 South African soldiers
soon.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said earlier that the Botswana peace-keeping
troops, escorted by South African police, were on their way to
Maseru, the capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
South African armored personnel carriers, attack helicopters
and mortar units have been involved in peace-keeping mission,
Machine said.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports quoted military spokesman Ben van Zyl as
saying that rebel Lesotho soldiers were at 10.30 a.m. still
shooting at South African peace-keeping troops.
</P>
<P>
"There are skirmishes taking place at military bases outside
Maseru, with rebel Lesotho soldiers shooting at our people."
However, Van Zyl said, the center of Maseru had largely been
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
He said some looting broke out in some places, but the
peace-keeping troops had brought the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
He said it was difficult to tell how long it would take to
restore stability in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Adri Cronje, spokeswoman for the South African Foreign Affairs
Department said in Pretoria that government buildings, including
Royal Palace and the High court in Maseru had apparently been set
alight.
</P>
<P>
In addition, shops in the city were looted and vehicles with
South African registration plates were stoned.
Cronje said no more information was immediately available.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean LG Electronics
announced Tuesday that it has developed a new 50-inch plasma
display panel (PDP) television.
</P>
<P>
The 50-inch thin but high-resolution screen is as large as four
25-inch wide-screen TV sets put together. Users can even put the
TV on the wall and turn their living room into a theater.
</P>
<P>
The new TV is fit for digital TV broadcasting and can also
handle computer signals and users can connect their audio, video
and digital versatile disk players directly to the new TV system,
said the company.
</P>
<P>
The LG PDP system is based on new technology allowing it to cut
production costs by 30 percent. It will display the new system at
Asia Display'98' exhibition scheduled for September 28 in Seoul,
said a LG spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It is the first South Korean TV manufacturer to develop such a
large PDP TV. Globally, a few Japanese companies, including NEC
and Pioneer, are spearheading the new technology, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The global market for the PDP systems is expected to reach 2.5
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000 and 10 billion dollars by
2005.
</P>
<P>
LG plans to invest 900 billion won (some 700 million dollars)
by 2005 to build a plant with annual production capacity of 1.2
million units in bid to to grab 12 percent of the global market.

troops of soldiers to come and butcher innocent Lesotho (people)
who are fighting for their democratic rights," she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association (SAPA), about 600
South African soldiers crossed the border at about 5:00 a.m.
(0300 GMT) to help restore order in the tiny mountain kingdom.
About 200 Botswanan troops are on their way to Maseru, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force spokesperson Laverne
Machine said the troops would withdraw as soon as the mission had
been completed.
</P>
<P>
She said the military intervention was being undertaken at the
request of the Lesotho government, under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
Opposition supporters, who camped outside the royal palace
since early August, have paralyzed the government by blocking
civil servants from going to work and hijacking government
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They are protesting against the results of the May 23 general
elections, which they claim were rigged in favor of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The intervention followed fruitless efforts by South African
mediators over the weekend to bring the government and opponents
together in talks after the release of a three-nation commission
report looking into opposition allegations of electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
The report compiled by legal experts from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe said there were irregularities in the May
election, but failed to say for sure whether it was rigged.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Explains Why His Former Deputy Was Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday police were forced to detain his
former deputy Anwar Ibrahim under the Internal Security Act (ISA)
when he instigated violence.
</P>
<P>
Despite his detention under the ISA, Anwar would still be
charged in court when police had enough evidence, Mahathir told a
news conference at his office here Tuesday afternoon where he
explained why Anwar was detained.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and the following day was expelled from
the ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) of which he
was the deputy president for "low morals", was arrested by police
at his house here Sunday night after leading an alleged illegal
rally and procession which later erupted into rioting.
</P>
<P>
It was not the intention of the police to arrest Anwar under
the ISA, Mahathir who is also home minister said, adding police
had intended to arrest and charge Anwar Ibrahim in court.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said police arrested Anwar under the ISA due to his
violent behavior, believing it is their intention to charge Anwar
"in the right manner".
</P>
<P>
Anwar was alleged to be involved in several sexual offenses and
was implicated in other charges.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Anwar delivered an inflammatory speech at an
"illegal" gathering at Masjid Negara (National Mosque) here,
instigating his supporters to riot.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he had not expected Anwar to go that extent. Even
the police did not believe that there would be violence and had
been preparing to make an ordinary arrest with proper charges, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The police had to act," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 132 people, including 17 foreigners, were detained
here during the past two days for involvement in illegal assembly
and rioting by supporters of the former deputy prime minister,
according to police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said at the press conference the situation in the
country is "very much stable and there is no need for anybody to
worry".
</P>
<P>
He denied that the government was planning to declare a state
of emergency, saying "There is no need for it."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists: Potassium, Magnesium Lower Stroke Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Food rich in potassium
and magnesium may help reduce the risk of stroke especially in
people with high blood pressure, a study said.
</P>
<P>
The study, published Tuesday in Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association, was conducted by a group of scientists
of Harvard School of Public Health between 1986 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Ascherio, leading author of the study, said he and his
colleagues looked at 43,738 men aged 40-75 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Over the next eight years, more than 300 of those men had
strokes, and those with the highest potassium consumption were 38
percent less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest
intake.
</P>
<P>
He also said that men with the highest intake of magnesium (452
milligrams per day) had 30 percent lower stroke risk than those
who consumed the lowest level (243 milligrams per day).
</P>
<P>
Both potassium and magnesium are found in high concentrations
in fruit and vegetables, such as bananas, tomatoes, spinach and
oranges.
</P>
<P>
A big potassium intake means a lot of vegetables by American
standard -- about nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day,
compared with four a day in the group that ate the least.
</P>
<P>
Though those who were taking potassium supplements had a 60
percent lower risk of stroke compared to men with high blood
pressure who were not taking the supplements, Ascherio warned,
potassium supplements should not be taken without a doctor's
supervision because high levels can be harmful especially for
people with kidney problems.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar to Average 58 US Cents in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's official chief
commodity forecaster Tuesday further downgraded its forecast for
the Australian dollar and said that the nation's export earnings
would drop slightly in the 1998-1999 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics'
(ABARE) latest quarterly commodity report forecast an average
level for the dollar of about 58 U.S. cents over the financial
year of 1998-1999, down six cents from its previous estimate of 64
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar depreciated markedly during mid-July and
late August, plunging to a record low of 55.95 U.S. cents on
August 27, due to concerns about the deteriorating outlook for
Asia and instability in emerging markets including Russia and
South America.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended its trading on the local market at
58 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 58 U.S. cent level was about 15 percent lower than the
average of 68 U.S. cents in the financial year of 1997-1998 and 26
percent less than the 1996-1997 average of 78 U.S. cents, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Australian dollar has helped offset the
impact of low commodity prices in the world market on Australian
commodity exporters, as most of the commodities are set in U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yet a weaker Russian currency is expected to make Russian
commodities more competitive than the Australian ones, taking away
part of Australia's share of world market.
</P>
<P>
Short-term export performance is expected to be weak and export
earnings forecast is to drop 0.8 percent to 66.5 billion
Australian dollars (38.57 billion U.S. dollars) in the 1998-1999
financial year, which ends on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"But domestic demand, especially private consumption
expenditure, is assumed to remain firm," the report said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said the nation's economic growth is assumed to average
at 2.75 percent in 1998-1999, the same as the government's revised
official forecast released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
World economic growth is expected to fall from 4.1 percent in
1997 to 2.1 percent this year, and although economic activity in
some East and Southeast Asian countries should stabilize next
year, the situation remains volatile and there is a significant
probability that the conditions could worsen, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Houses Among World's Cheapest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Premium residential
property in the South African metropolis of Johannesburg is
ranked among the cheapest in the world, according to a survey by
an international property consultant company.
</P>
<P>
In its "Lifestyles Around the World" survey report, Knight
Frank International said prices of up-market property in
Johannesburg, the biggest commercial center in southern Africa,
had fallen about 10 percent over the past year, Business Day
paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons are the prospect of political uncertainty
after South African President Nelson Mandela retires next year
and the high level of crimes in the city.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which examined not only the costs of buying and
renting homes but also the essential "must haves" for high-flying
executives, found prices to be about 130,000 U.S. Dollars in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
It also found that while city residents worldwide preferred
diverse international holiday destinations, South Africans chose
to head for internal destinations such as Cape Town and game
reserves.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Lackluster property market in Johannesburg,
prices of houses in London had continued to rise by between 10
percent and 15 percent over the past year.
</P>
<P>
London, Hong Kong and New York were the most expensive cities
in which to live, with a spacious apartment in New York's Upper
West Side costing about 2.5 million Dollars, up 30 percent on a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Freehold houses in London, ranging between 800,000 and 2.5
million Dollars, were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Despite prices falling by about 35 percent in the past year,
Hong Kong remained one of the world's most expensive cities, with
an apartment on the south side of the city costing upwards of 2.2
million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Promises to Hand Out Any Secret Money If Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto will produce a letter authorizing the Attorney General's
Office to withdraw money from his secret bank accounts if it finds
evidence of their existence, Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto said anybody who finds these bank accounts, here or
abroad, or has any information about them, should report to the
Attorney General's Office... he is ready to come to the Attorney
General's office any time, if anybody finds these bank accounts
and that he will provide us a letter of authority to withdraw the
money," Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
He said Soeharto made the statement to him and Coordinating
Minister for Development Supervision Hartarto Sastrosoeharto at
the former president's residence here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto and Ghalib met with Soeharto to clarify the former
president's recent statement that he does not have a single cent
kept in overseas bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President B.J. Habibie set up two teams to directly
examine Soeharto over his statement. A team led by Ghalib
comprising the chief of the Indonesian Police and head of the
state audit body, and another team led by Hartarto and Ghalib will
focus on probing Soeharto's alleged overseas wealth.
</P>
<P>
American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who
stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a
fortune of 4 billion U.S. dollars. But Soeharto swore that he did
not have any deposits abroad in a statement broadcast by his own
daughter's television station on September 6.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto reiterated this to us on Monday night," the attorney
general said, adding that the former president expressed his
readiness to be investigated over his alleged wealth hidden in
bank accounts here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting, the former president has shown his
cooperation and he was very helpful," Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto told reporters that Soeharto is ready to give Habibie
a list of his personal wealth acquired until this year.
</P>
<P>
"About his wealth abroad, the former president said he does not
have any savings, company stakes or bonds abroad. He also admitted
that he was never a client of any bank abroad," Hartarto said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time an official probe was launched on
Soeharto, who was in power for 32 years until the country's worst
political and economic crisis in decades forced him to step down.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that the fact that
U.S. President Bill Clinton is currently faced with difficulties
will not affect Sino-U.S. relations, "because it is the internal
affair of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at today's regular press conference in
response to a question raised by a reporter on the Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, Chinese President Jiang Zemin recently wrote
to Clinton and expressed his belief that the common grounds
reached by the two sides during the exchange of visits by them
will be turned into reality, so as to push Sino-U.S. relations
forward to the goal of establishing constructive strategic
partnership .
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations is
the common desire of the people of China and the United States and
conforms to the fundamental interests of both countries, and is
also the consensus of both the Democratic Party and the Republican
Party of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The successful exchange of visits between the two countries'
presidents has elevated Sino-U.S. relationship to a new stage
of development, Zhu said, adding that China appreciates Clinton's
active contribution to improving Sino-US relations.

his secret affair with a White House trainee, Clinton now can wait

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

The Guardian:
</P>

broadcast of the president's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>

Americans finally had the chance Monday to judge for themselves
the evidence of their president's conduct as the videotape of his

</P>
<P>
Breast-fed since birth, Jiujiu weighs 49 kilograms, much
heavier than other weanlings.
</P>
<P>
Prolonging the breast-feeding period is one of the new eugenic
measures for raising pandas.
</P>
<P>
Panda cubs used to be weaned after three months so their
mothers could continue to mate and breed in the next year. But
research shows that many weanlings stop growing at two or three
years old. Experts now believe that early weaning is one of the
major factors for the poor health of the cubs.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the center cooperated with the Atlanta
Zoo in the U.S. to begin the eugenic project for giant pandas last
year.
</P>
<P>
Scientists established the family trees of giant pandas by
means of DNA tests. This effort helped avoid inbreeding in a group
of pandas and resulted in healthier cubs.
</P>
<P>
Mother pandas are now kept with their cubs for more than one
year so the little pandas can get better care.
</P>
<P>
Senior zoologist Yu Jianqiu said these eugenic measures will
reduce the breeding of pandas, but breast-feeding can provide
better nutrition and immunity for the cubs. And cubs will learn
more living skills from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Center is the only
professional panda research center in China. Covering more than 30
hectares, it simulates the panda's natural environment.
</P>
<P>
A female giant panda gives birth to one or two cubs annually,
but experts believe it is difficult for pandas to mate naturally
in the breeding center. Only 24 percent of the females will breed,
so the birth rate is very low.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 giant pandas in the world, mainly
in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.

<P>
TOKYO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rallied Tuesday in
Tokyo after a sharp fall with the Nikkei index dropping to its
12-and-a-half-year low on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced 192.51 points, or
1.42 percent, from Monday's close to end at 13,789.81 in a
volatile session of trading.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 2.38 points or 0.23 percent to
1,050.17.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 510
million shares from Monday's 389.85 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders, however, said the gains masked concerns about the poor
health of Japan's economy and the political row surrounding
banking reform.
</P>
<P>
This rebound isn't one you can trust, a dealer said, adding
that the general downward direction would not change.
</P>
<P>
"With the falling economies in Asia and now Latin America,
there is not going to be any more volume growth," another dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
Export-led blue chips withered as domestic corporations sold to
nail down profits before the September-30 end of the fiscal
half-year for most Japanese firms.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,342 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
surpassed losers 594 to 537, with 161 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges Support for Tumen River Valley Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUNCHUN (Jilin Province), September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Government will, as always, support international cooperation in
the Tumen River Valley, said a Chinese foreign trade official.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangxiang, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, made this pledge while attending the ongoing
second international investment and trade fair of the Tumen River
Valley which opened Monday in Hunchun in northeast China's Jilin

</P>
<P>
The vice-minister also said that China will cooperate with
Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as
well as international organizations, in advancing development of
the region under the principles of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The three-day fair is sponsored jointly by the United Nations
Industrial Development Organizations (UNIDO), the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the Jilin Provincial Government,
with approval from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Fewer Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- There were 93,640 visitor
arrivals in New Zealand in August, 5,580 or 6 percent fewer than a
year
ago, according to Tuesday's media release from Statistics New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year to August 1998, New Zealand saw 1.453
million
visitors, also 6 percent fewer than the previous year's total of
1.54
million.
</P>
<P>
Last month, visitor arrivals from Asia totaled 24,280, a drop
of
9,610 or 28 percent compared with August 1997. This was mostly due
to a
fall of 7,420 in the number of visitors from the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the number of visitors to New Zealand has

generally been decreasing since the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In August, the country suffered a net loss of 1,260 permanent
and
long-term migrants, compared with a gain of 590 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
For the year to August, there was a net migration loss of
2,840,
compared with net gains of 14,490 and 28,390 for the two previous
years
respectively.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Earthquake-Proof Historic Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A team of engineers is
using computer software and innovative structural concepts to
earthquake-proof historic buildings in Wellington, the Evening
Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said that priority has been
given to Parliament buildings, the General Assembly Library and
the old Bank of New Zealand buildings.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand engineers have developed software to simulate how
the buildings would react in an earthquake. From this analysis,
they can pinpoint and strengthen areas of weakness, instead of
strengthening the entire building.
</P>
<P>
It saves cost and also means the building's original character
can be preserved without the need for obtrusive structural work.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the recent refurbishment of Parliament buildings
 included placing more than 400 rubber blocks (base isolation
bearings) in the foundations.
</P>
<P>
The blocks allow lateral movement of up to 35 centimeters in an
earthquake, it added.
</P>
<P>
Other refurbishment and strengthening projects in Wellington
include the former Harbor Board building and the old Maritime
Museum.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, New Zealand education officials
and experts were busy inspecting schools in the capital city to
see whether the safety and welfare of staff and students are
effectively implemented, an evacuation plan is in place and
emergency drills are held regularly.
</P>
<P>
Recently, New Zealand and foreign seismologists have repeatedly
 predicted the inevitability of a huge earthquake of 8 magnitude
on the Richter Scale in the Wellington region.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region Enjoys Warm Weather, More Rainfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- It is a common belief that
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which has
two-thirds of China's total desert area, is very dry and lacks
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
However, local meteorologists have pointed out that Xinjiang is
turning warmer and has been having more rainfall in past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Senior engineer Yang Qing of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Regional Meteorological Center drew this conclusion based on his
analysis of climatic changes during the 1987-1996 period compared
with climatic conditions during the 1967-1986 period.
</P>
<P>
The comparison showed that the annual average temperature in
the areas to the north of the Tianshan Mountains went up by one
degree Celsius in the last decade and 0.3 degrees over the
previous two decades. For the areas to the south of the Tianshan
Mountains, the annual average temperature increased by 0.6 degrees
and 0.2 degrees over the same periods.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qing pointed out that the changes mainly occurred during the
winter months.
</P>
<P>
A statistical analysis also showed that the annual average
rainfall in the last ten years grew by nearly 30 millimeters, or
18 percent, over the decade from 1977 to 1986 in the areas to the
north of the Tianshan Mountains; for areas to the south of the
mountain, the figure rose by 21.9 mm, or 30.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists found that rainfall has increased in the region
for all seasons of the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jiabao of Xinjiang's meteorological association said that
remote-sensing by meteorological satellites found that the
Taklimakan Desert, called the "sea of death," also is experiencing
rainy seasons. The annual rainfall in the desert now stands at 40
to 60 mm.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the warmer weather and increasing rainfall is
bringing more good than bad, and cited expansion of cotton
planting in the region as an example.

<HEADLINE> NZ Ruling, Opposition Parties Neck And Neck in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Party, the
ruling
party in New Zealand, has gained two points to draw level with its
major
rival the Labor Party in the latest One Network News-Colmar
Brunton
opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll was the first since last month's collapse of the
coalition
government formed by the National Party and New Zealand First, the
New
Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,000 people polled, 41 percent said they would vote for
the
National Party, an improvement of two points on last month's poll.
</P>
<P>
This shows support for the performance of the current National
Party-
led minority government rising after New Zealand First leader
Winston
Peters was sacked from the government.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party also gained one point more to record 42 percent
of
support.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance was supported by 7 percent, down two percentage
points
from 9 percent in the previous poll. ACT New Zealand remained
unchanged,
registering a support rate of 6 percent, while New Zealand First
lost a
point to record two percent.
</P>
<P>
If translated to a general election, the results would give the
 Labor
Party and the Alliance almost enough seats to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Asked if they would have voted in favor of the government
continuing
in office, as did 62 of the Parliament's 120 members earlier this
month,
42 percent of those polled said that they would and 50 percent
said they
would not.
</P>
<P>
National Party leader Jenny Shipley was the preferred prime
minister
of 28 percent of those polled, five percentage points more than
Labor
Party leader Helen Clark.
</P>
<P>
The poll has an estimated margin of error of 3.2 percent, the
NZPA
said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up Copyright Protection Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China established a national
copyright protection center in Beijing today to consolidate its
great wall holding back the tide of piracy.
</P>
<P>
"This action again demonstrates the Chinese government's
determination to eradicate copyright piracy," Yu Youxian,
director of the State Copyright Administration (SCA), told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The new center will take over some administrative functions of
the SCA to deal with copyright transfer business and provide
convenience for Chinese and foreign copyright holders, according
to Qi Xiangtong, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
When copyright disputes occur, the center will also
engage in legal procedures as a coordinator or arbitrator, Qi
added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there will be cooperation between the center and
state departments in investigating serious cases and punishing
violators.
</P>
<P>
China published its first Copyright Law in 1991 and
subsequently joined the Berne Convention. Since then, the public's
awareness of copyrights has increased and a protection network
established.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the establishment of the center is a result of
the country's progress in curbing piracy.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that 30,000 authors have planned to be registered
at the center to protect their work.

CHENGDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Logging in the primeval
forests of southwest China's Sichuan Province has been stopped as
part of the country's first project to protect natural forest
resources.
</P>
<P>
The region is one of the 3 big forest regions in China, but there
are only 4.65 million hectares of forest left after decades of
logging, that has caused serious degradation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The region has taken the lead in forest protection
projects. All timber processing plants and markets have been
closed and more than 40,000 workers have been put to work in
forest cultivation and protection, with salaries and costs
financed by the central and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
Teams have been established to enforce the forest-protection
work and roads that were used for logging purposes have been blown
up in the Panzhihua region.

<HEADLINE> Iranians, Afghan Refugees Clash in Central Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Clashes have taken place
between scores of Iranians and Afghan refugees in an Iranian
central province, the Iran Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Morteza Lotfullah Khajouei, head of Aliens and
Foreign Immigration Affairs Bureau of Isfahan Province, as saying
that the clashes occurred on September 11 in the northern part of
the province.
</P>
<P>
Forty Iranians, "who apparently took advantage of the present
circumstances," provoked the conflicts, Khajouei said, adding that
a number of Afghan refugees were injured in the skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
He said 39 Iranians were detained and 30 of them were then
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The official was referring to the growing tensions between Iran
and the Afghan Taliban group, whose militia killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a reporter last month in northern Afghanistan.
Angered Iranians have vowed to take revenge.
</P>
<P>
Khajouei said the Iranians instigating the turmoil considered
that the Afghan refugees have squeezed their employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
They opposed the residence and employment of the refugees in
the province and clashed with the Afghans before, he said.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Sales of motor vehicles that
are not equipped with electronic fuel injection systems will be
stopped in the Chinese capital as of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yixin, director of the Beijing Environmental Protection
Bureau, said that all new cars will be required to have emission
controls as well.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau said that exhaust pollution in the city has got

oxide up from 77 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 1986 to 133
micrograms in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some parts of the city have been under the threat of actinic
smoke because of an excessive amount of nitrogen and carbon
monoxide in the air.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that Beijing now has more than 1.3 million motor
vehicles, and that number is increasing by 15 percent annually.
Some of them have been running far beyond their service time and
are responsible for much of the pollution in the city.

Beijing will increase the scrapping of old vehicles and enforce
examinations of cars. It will also urge the use of natural gas and
liquefied petroleum gas by buses and taxis.

<HEADLINE> Maslyukov Outlines Three Stages for Boosting Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov has outlined three key decisions to be
taken by the Russian government on improving the situation in the
country, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the leaders of local industrial enterprises
held in St. Petersburg on Monday, Maslyukov emphasized the need
for boosting industrial production.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is to go through three stages to reach this
goal.
</P>
<P>
The first stage, he said, is to set up assembly shops and
principal production lines using foreign technologies. At this
stage, railways and the energy sector should be subsidized to
facilitate a recovery of the food industry and research-intensive
sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second stage is to resolve the problem of non-payments and
optimize the money supply, Maslyukov said, adding that another
goal at this stage would be to find the way back to the
international economic community and join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed Russian first deputy prime minister also
said that from mid-1999, the government should launch programs for
targeted support of industries and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is time "we summoned up courage and decided
what to do with the defense sector of economy, as we do not need
the volumes of nuclear production, submarines, and aircraft
production we used to have."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov regarded as the government's priorities making an
industrial policy, and increasing exports and reducing imports.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Revise Copyright Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to revise its
seven-year-old copyright law to bring it in line with
international norms in a real sense, sources revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen Rengan, Deputy Director of the State Copyright
Administration (SCA), told a press conference that the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, has placed the
revision on its agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for revising the law began four years ago,
according to Shen. The SCA handed the draft plan to the State
Council early this year and it is now being debated among
officials and experts across the country.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the NPC and the SCA have held several forums to
discuss this issue, and the draft plan is being revised. The State
Council will submit the revised version to the NPC in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
In the early 20th century, China adopted laws to protect
authors' rights. On June 1, 1991, the country's first copyright
law was officially implemented, signaling that China was beginning
to protect copyrights according to some international criteria.
</P>
<P>
However, piracy become rampant in the mid-1990s, aroused
intensified international and domestic concern, and even brought
the United States and China to the verge of a trade war.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, China has revised some parts of its
law which conflicted with the Berne Convention, according to Shen,
adding that the new version is aimed at meeting the demands of the
market economy as well as higher international standards.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the revision will enable foreign and Chinese
copyright owners' rights to be protected equally, and that some
new problems, such as the protection of Internet copyrights, will
be considered.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Small Banks to Set up Rescue Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Twenty small and medium
sized banks in Kenya will set up a rescue fund to stop a run by
depositors as a banking crisis in the east African state entered
the third week.
</P>
<P>
With an initial target of 600 million Shillings (some 10
million U.S. Dollars), "the Stabilization Fund will help members
in liquidity problems," the banks' spokesman Magan Chandaria
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will shortly be requesting the World Bank for funding to
help set it up," he was quoted by Tuesday's national press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The banks held a meeting Sunday and launched a program called
"Operation Restore Confidence" to stem rising public panic after
three commercial banks were placed under statutory management
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya also suspended Monday the Ugandan
branch of Trust Bank which was put under statutory management
last week.
</P>
<P>
Banking experts warned that the collapse of any of the small
banks would have far-reaching negative effects on the overall
economy and called for concerted efforts to save them.
</P>
<P>
However, a survey of most small banks showed that business was
as usual on Monday. Most of the banks said they had not put any
limits on the amount and regularity of withdrawals by depositors.
</P>
<P>
Manu Chandaria, a leading industrialist and former chairman of
the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, said Monday the banks
were seeking the help of Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to work out
modalities of establishing the fund and that once it is
established, the World Bank would be approached through Treasury
to assist.
</P>
<P>
He said the banks had agreed with CBK's recommendations that
in the long term the small and medium-sized banks should enhance
their capital base or merge to strengthen the local banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Reliance Bank, Trust Bank and Bullion Bank were placed under
statutory management by the central bank one after another
because they failed to honor checks or meet debt obligations.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt's Cash Demand Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government's need
for money to meet its budget is reducing as demonstrated by the
continued drop in the yield on the popular Treasury Bills (TBs)
and the amount it is seeking from the public.
</P>
<P>
Results of last week's TBs auction show that the yield on the
92-day tenor as well as the 182-day tenor is on a declining trend
for the second week running, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The low yield reduced the amount of money the Central Bank of
Kenya was able to raise from potential investors from 6 billion
to 5.6 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Currently 60.0678 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop was for the 182-day tenor where the yield
dropped from 23 percent the previous week to 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the popular 92-day tenor remained largely at the
previous week's level of 22.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government will be in the market this week seeking a
reduced amount of two billion Shillings compared to 6 billion
Shillings the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Heavy borrowing by the government to meet budgetary needs has
been blamed for the high interest rates prevailing in the banking
sector. Commercial banks use the yield on the bills to set the
base lending rates.

hill 25 kilometer north of the city.
</P>
<P>
"Underneath the houses (in the street) lay 20 clay pots
which contained the skeletons of children," said archaeologist
Jean Paul Thalmann who heads the excavations.
</P>
<P>
He explained to the paper that in those days people used
to bury their children under the floor of the house.
</P>
<P>
From the structure of the foundations, Thalmann concluded that
the houses were about five meters high and people lived on
the top floor and used the bottom one for storage.
</P>
<P>
Other spectacular finds from the site were a pottery
workshop and a warrior tomb.
</P>
<P>
Excavations at Tal Arqa started in 1972 but were then
delayed by Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Thalmann said so far the excavations have gone through the
mediaeval, Arab, Byzantine, Greek and Phoenician layers and have
now reached the early Bronze age.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Culture and Higher Education Fawzi
Hobeish had said he would request the United Nations
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to adopt
Tal Arqa as a world heritage site, the paper said.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Township-run companies in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province had 107 billion yuan in output
value in the first eight months of this year, up 20 percent from
last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that this is the third consecutive
year of rapid growth of township-run companies in Shaanxi, making
it easier for the province to achieve its annual economic target
of 10-percent growth.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fast development of rural industry to greater
attention paid by the local government and more investment in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The government of nearby Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is
helping the development of 34 key privately-owned enterprises to
bring annual sales to 100 million yuan in 3 years.
</P>
<P>
The 34 companies, which are in commerce and trade, building
materials, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal husbandry,
were chosen from 15,000 enterprises in the region. They will enjoy

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An 11-year-old girl who
received a new liver one year ago is now able to go to school with
her new schoolbag just like any other healthy student, it was
reported today in the Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Yu Faqin was diagnosed with a liver disease when she was two
years old. In November 1996, doctors from the Xi'an No. 4 Medical
University of the PLA examined her and found early symptoms of
cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
In June of last year, more than 50 professors, doctors and
nurses took part in an operation which successfully removed the
girl's diseased liver. A new liver was then transplanted,
consisting of one-third of her father's liver.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Morning Post said Yu was the first patient to
undergo and survive a liver transplant in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- About 800 soldiers from
South Africa and Botswana entered Lesotho Tuesday morning to help
the embattled government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili,
said sources reaching here from Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping forces exchanged gunfire with opposition
supporters at the Royal Palace of king Letsie III soon after
their arrival in Maseru, capital of the mountain kingdom, which
is bordering with South Africa, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
At least one soldier was wounded and a South African
Broadcasting Corporation cameraman injured, according to one
witness.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Troops were also involved, a reliable government
source said.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention follows unsuccessful attempts by a
Southern African Development Community (SADC) team headed by
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi to mediate a
negotiated settlement to the crisis triggered by opposition
claims that the May 23 election in the country was rigged.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been wrecked by instability since early August,
with the capital Maseru paralyzed by unrest and the government
unable to rely on the support of its security forces after an
insurrection in the Lesotho Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Defense Force said in a statement
that the Lesotho government requested military intervention from
the heads of state of Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe to restore normality to his country.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Strikes at International Auto Mafia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian authorities busted
three car stealing rings and 38 criminal groups, Chief of the
Central Service for Organized Crime Control Kiril Radev said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 687 stolen cars were found and 20 deluxe cars smuggled
from Canada were confiscated in police operations, Radev said in a
report to an international conference on "Insurance Frauds, Car
Thefts and Smuggling" which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will continue to pay attention to the issue of
international car mafia because the country is part of a channel
for transiting and selling cars stolen from West Europe to the
markets of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, Radev told
the delegates from 20 European countries, the Unites States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Interpol Secretary-General Raymond Kendall, who is also
participating in the conference, praised Bulgaria's Interpol
bureau for its performance.
</P>
<P>
Interpol has more than 1.1 million stolen cars registered as to
September 1, according to Kendall. Most of the cars originated
from Germany, followed by several East European
countries. Bulgaria is the sixth on the list.

<HEADLINE> Public Interest in Alternative Medicine Grows in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Almost 70 percent of
Americans now turn to alternative forms of medicine to cure their
illness when regular medicine has failed, according to a recent
nationwide survey.
</P>
<P>
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted by the
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, found that 56
percent of those surveyed believe their health plans should cover
alternative care. They are also willing to pay for it in their
medical insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
The label "alternative medicine" covers a range of products and
treatment, some derived from centuries-old spiritual and healing
traditions of non-Western societies, others as new and high-tech
as pressurized oxygen chambers.
</P>
<P>
In common is that they all fall outside the list of "standard"
therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical
authorities.
</P>
<P>
While the Stanford survey reflected the growing acceptance of
alternative medicine in the United States, half the people who
seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine
for basic health care. On average, participants in the study made
four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
</P>
<P>
On average, the survey respondents said they would be willing
to spend an additional 15 U.S. dollars a month in health insurance
for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or
acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School
revealed that one in three Americans used non-traditional or
non-Western medicine, spending 14 billion dollars a year in
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Los Angeles Times report said that
alternative medicine is now an 18-billion-dollar industry edging
into the U.S. mainstream. Americans will spend 3.65 billion
dollars on herbal remedies this year, a 100 percent increase since
1994.
</P>
<P>
California takes the lead in this trend. Six major health
insurance firms in California alone decided this year to cover
acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
A medical center in Los Angeles opened its integrative medicine
program in May. And the Stanford University Medical Center opened
a similar patient-care program in April.
</P>
<P>
What attracts consumers, medical centers and insurance
companies is the hope that alternative medical practices may
provide health plans with a relatively low-cost feature.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, doctors say, there is a negative feeling toward
Western medicine's ability to deal with certain health problems,
particularly chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Western medicine has made considerably less progress against
lingering health problems such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis
and chronic pain.

Today, she played very well, too, trying to keep every ball back.
I just played my best." said Tanasugarn.
</P>
<P>
For her victory, Li said "it was a little difficult in this
wind, but not too bad. The score looks easy, but every game was
tough. I just hit a couple of forehands here and there and she
made a lot of mistakes."

<HEADLINE> Lesotho FM Defends SADC Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Foreign
Minister Tom Thabane Tuesday morning defended his government's
request for South African Development Community (SADC) military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention follows a well judged situation by the four
SADC governments -- Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Botswana," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Thabane
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with SAPA, Thabane declined to say
when Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili had requested military
assistance from his SADC allies. He also declined to say whether
Mosisili and Lesotho cabinet ministers were still in the capital
of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Thabane said he was not in a position to comment on Tuesday's
intervention, and on the resulting gun battles and anarchy in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the intervention had been necessary as
Lesotho had experienced a complete breakdown in security on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The radio stationwas closed, the industrial areas were
closed, our Chinese investors were forced (by opposition youths)
to pack up and go home... There was general mayhem," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 800 soliders from South Africa, Botswana reportedly
entered Lesotho at 5:00 a.m. Tuesday morning to help restore
stability in the land-locked mountain kingdom at the request of
the embattled government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili.

<HEADLINE> Reclamation Project Canceled To Save Mangroves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
recently canceled a 25-million-yuan reclamation project because
local experts believe it posed a threat to the growth of mangrove
forests in the coastal city of Longhai.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated by the city government last year as a
key measure to enlarge its cultivated area, aimed to reclaim 460
hectares of marshland along the coast.
</P>
<P>
However, this area included 33 hectares of mangrove trees under
government protection, so experts from the provincial
environmental protection and forest departments called for an
immediate halt to the project in accordance with related laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The city government then reconsidered the reclamation plan and
decided to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
Mangroves usually grow in swampy area in the torrid and
subtropical zones, and they are able to protect and reinforce
river dikes with their exuberant roots.
</P>
<P>
The total area of mangrove forests in China has shrunk to
15,000 hectares from 50,000 in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, the northernmost mangrove habitat, put 200 hectares of
mangrove forests in Longhai under provincial protection in
1988.

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts Water Conservation Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Jiayu County, one of the most
seriously hit flood areas in China, is intensifying efforts to
change its water conservation strategy to deal with the water
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to a resettlement plan, evacuated farmers will no
longer return to towns that have been flooded, but will instead be
relocated elsewhere and the flooded places will become water
diversion areas when the floodwaters recede.
</P>
<P>
The county government plans to help rebuild homes in new places
for the farmers in three years to help them avoid moving around
whenever there is flood trouble as part of a nationwide campaign
to remove obstacles along major rivers and lakes that are
vulnerable to seasonal flooding. China had the devastating floods this
year, the worst since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists attribute the flooding partly to the
worsening struggle between local people and water over land along
major rivers and lakes. The total area of the eight big lakes
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, for
example, has been reduced by a third since the 1950s, something
that has greatly harmed their water control ability.
</P>
<P>
Hubei used to be known as the province of a thousand lakes, but
it now has only 309 lakes. To make matters worse, its growing
population has put pressure on land use. As a result, a large
amount of shoreland has become farmland, and rivers have been
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Yangtze River economic belt will not fully develop
before human beings give way to water, water conservation,
specialists argue.
</P>
<P>
The lessons drawn from this year's record floods have shown how
to exist peacefully with rivers, and flood-damaged provinces like
Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are all making an effort to leave more
room for water diversion areas while rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance recently issued 100 billion yuan in
treasury bonds, a large part of which will be used for major
rivers and lakes, with 30 billion yuan going to the Yangtze River
Valley, sources say.

</P>
<P>
More than 30 experts from 24 countries and regions are

</P>
<P>
Though China has rapidly developed its fishing industry during

</P>
<P>
He noted that this seminar has offered an opportunity for
China's experts to cooperate with their overseas counterparts on
the utilization of incidental fish-harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Yang Lin, an expert with the Chinese Academy of Fishery
Sciences, noted that China has been attempting to make full use of
these kinds of catch, but profits have been low.
</P>
<P>
The APFIC, an affiliate of the Food and Agriculture
Organization, now has 20 member countries including China. More
than 100 experts and officials from 39 countries and regions will

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Releases Thai Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Monday
set free 101 Thai prisoners as part of its goodwill gesture toward
Thailand, official sources confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The release came five days after Thai Army Commander-in-Chief
General Chetta Thannajaro met with his Myanmar counterpart,
General Maung Aye in Yangon, reaching an agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Of the 101 Thai prisoners, 57 were from Yangon's prison and the
rest from Kengtung.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, Myanmar also released 98 Thai prisoners
under an agreement reached between Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, and
General Thannajaro who visited Yangon at that time.

<HEADLINE> Gold, Silver Prices Fall on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Gold and silver futures
fell sharply Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following
a remarkable increase over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Gold for December delivery fell by 2.60 U.S. dollars to 291.60
dollars an ounce, while December silver fell by 12 cents to 4.855
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted the sharp decline of gold and silver
futures followed a remarkable jump of the precious metals to their
highest levels in nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
One of the main causes behind the ups and downs, they said, was
the prevailing concern that President Bill Clinton's videotaped
testimony on his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky would highlight reasons to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
But with no immediate fresh surprises on the tapes, broadcast
Monday morning to the public, market participants began returning
to U.S. stocks and bonds, slashing demand for safe haven
investments such as precious metals.
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, gold remains significantly above a 19-year
low of 273 U.S. dollars an ounce set in August, partly because of
a continued robust demand in India, the world's largest consumer
of gold.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Economic Growth May Slow Down: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The protracted flood in
Bangladesh this year will have an negative impact on the country's
economic growth, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) growth may slow down by at
least one percentage point, State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin
Alamgir was quoted Tuesday by The Daily Star newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the government's top economic planner, Alamgir was Monday
talking about the revision downward of the GDP growth target to 5
percent from the previously estimated 6 percent, but some
economists said the GDP growth could remain well below the level.
</P>
<P>
One economist said the rate might be as low as 4 percent,
considering the preliminary estimates of flood-caused losses at
3.4 billion U.S. dollars, about 10 percent of the country's GDP
and the huge damage to infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In the current Fifth Five-Year Plan (1998-2002), the
Bangladeshi government projected the GDP growth at an average
annual compound rate of 7 percent, with an estimated 6 percent for
the first year and 8.3 percent for the terminal year.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged flooding, which experts termed as the worst
Bangladesh has faced in this century and which lasted more than
two months before it began to recede last week, stopped most
economic activities in as many as 52 out of the country's 64
districts.
</P>
<P>
The government however remains optimistic about reaching the
five-point mark, hoping to cash in on largely-unaffected service
sectors and a likely bumper output of boro, unseasonal and
irrigated rice, in areas not hit by the floods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the state minister, the nation's GDP is dominated
by the service sector which contributes more than 48 percent,
followed by agriculture 29 percent and industry 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Massive programs have been planned to rehabilitate agriculture
to minimize the flood damage. In unaffected areas, "we will have a
bumper boro and potato harvest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The service sector more or less remains unaffected and the
country's exports have escaped the onslaught of the deluge to a
large extent, according to the state minister, who is busy
estimating damage to the economy as croplands and homes of
millions have begun to emerge from under the flood water.
</P>
<P>
Economists said rehabilitation of agriculture would be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Omar Haider Chowdhury, research director at Bangladesh
Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), said a bumper boro
harvest would not help much. "It would still be too far to reach
normal national rice production," he said. BIDS researcher Quazi
Shahabuddin agreed, saying rehabilitation of agriculture would be
difficult because "one cannot simply go for cultivation if it is
not a season for a crop."
</P>
<P>
Achieving a 4-percent growth in GDP would be a challenge to the
government. "If the economy grows at that rate this year, it will
be good news for the nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Moyeen Khan, former state minister for planning, also
ruled out the chances of hitting the 5-percent target. "If
agriculture goes down, so does the GDP," he argued, referring to
the farming sector's dominance in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Economics Professor Wahiduddin Mahmud of Dhaka University
warned against "excessive monetary expansion and inflation" in the
wake of the government's special efforts to increase credit
facilities to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
It would not be a problem, if "increased credit meets the
genuine short-term needs for working capital," he said. "But if
funds are misused and credit discipline is jeopardized, not only
scarce resources will be wasted but also macroeconomic
stabilization will be put at great risk."
</P>
<P>
But the crisis also offers some opportunity for the government
when it comes to shedding unnecessary, politically-driven
projects, the professor pointed out. "The exercise of revising the
Annual Development Program also gives an opportunity for getting
rid of low-priority politically-mandated projects, which have
proliferated in recent years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned against "leakage of funds in public works" and
"compromising quality" when the government would be hurrying to
spend as much as possible to spur economic activity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Good Signs in Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that some good results will come out of elections held this
month in Bosnia despite that a hardline nationalist will defeat
pro-West Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we would have far preferred Mrs. Plavsic to be
re-elected, you know that. But in the parliament it looks like the
moderates are doing reasonably all right, so we may be able to
make progress," said a defense official, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me if I think Bosnia's on a reasonable trend
line... I would expect the answer's yes," he told a briefing about
Defense Secretary William Cohen's trip to Europe later this week.
</P>
<P>
The official said the facts that the elections took place,
appeared to be fair and involved little violence were all good
signs.
</P>
<P>
"Our fundamental preference is to recreate a civil society in
Bosnia... and these are the third set of elections. That's not too
bad in terms of going forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think we're still on a trend line. I don't want to not
say there's a lot to be done, because there is a lot to be done,
but it's a set of elections, and we'll work with it."
</P>
<P>
Ballots cast in the September 12 and 13 elections are still
being counted, and the outcome is not expected to be announced
until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had said before the election that it supported
Plavsic. But the Serb Radical Party's Nikola Poplasen is expected
to win the presidency of the autonomous Serb Republic in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's trip to Europe includes a meeting of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) in Portugal and visits to Macedonia and
Bosnia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Florence Griffith Joyner
only needed to beat the world records once, but the women's dash
events had died before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
She was one of a special kind. No one could close to her
100-meter world record of 10.49 seconds. That is a record belongs
to the space world, no living female now and future could shatter
it.
</P>
<P>
Besides the fastest women's sprinter in history, she also
established the standards for fashion in track and field.
</P>
<P>
No one could match her speed 10 years ago, the 100m and 200m
world records stand still. And no one has duplicated the flair
she displayed -- her flamboyant, colorful, one-legged outfits,
her elaborate, well-polished, 6-inch fingernails.
</P>
<P>
Sprinter-hurdler Gail Devers and 400-meter hurdler Sandra
Farmer Patrick have tried to emulate the glamour of Griffith
Joyner, who died Monday of a heart-related problem at 38.
</P>
<P>
Devers, two-time Olympic 100 meter winner in 1992 and 1996, is
well known for her extremely long fingernails, and Farmer Patrick
for her stylish attire, but neither star has received the acclaim
nor captured the imagination of the flashy, provocative "FloJo."
</P>
<P>
Farmer Patrick was very sad after learning Griffith Joyner's
death. "Florence was like a sister to me," she said, crying
uncontrollably. "We shared so much together. We shared lots of
childhood memories and career goals. We had similar values and
religious beliefs."
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner was the godmother of Farmer Patrick's
4-year-old daughter, Sierra.
</P>
<P>
"I chose her because of her strength and her courage," Farmer
Patrick said. "I loved her dearly."
</P>
<P>
Even though there were rumblings during the 1988 Olympics that
Griffith Joyner was using performance-enhancing drugs because she
appeard bulked up. But she passed all drug tests and remained
clean.
</P>
<P>
Griffith was co-chair of the Presidnet's Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports.
</P>
<P>
"She was very good with kids," said John Smith, one of the
premier sprint coaches in the world. "Whenever she came to see
me, she brought a FloJo doll for my daughter."
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss her. She made a great contribution to
track and field, like Wilma Rudolph did before her and like
Marion Jones is doing now."
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner authored many children's books, featuring the
character Barry Bam Bam, she wrote poems; she was a beautician,
an artist, a model and a clothes designer, she performed in
movies and television; she did numerous commercial endorsements;
she made many speaking engagements, and she designed the uniforms
for the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
Craig Masback, executive director of USA Track and Field, said
FloJo's records "might last into the 21st century," but that
should not be the only thing for which she is remembered.
</P>
<P>
"She revolutionized the way athletes dress. Her flair and
everything else she did captured the imagination," he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Party Summit Held in Siem Reap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A summit meeting of Cambodia's
rival political leaders opened here Tuesday under the auspices of
King Norodom Sihanouk, aimed at defusing current political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The meeting began at 9:30 am Tuesday at the King's Siem Reap
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, vice-president of the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) and Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy of opposition Funcinpec and
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and
deposed First Prime Minister Ranariddh had a face-to-face meeting
in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
CPP Vice-president Hun Sen and Funcinpec President Prince Ranariddh
were co-premiers in the last government, which emerged from the 1993
UN poll. But the prince was ousted after faction fighting in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
It's uncertain whether any substantive coalition issues will be
discussed and resolved at the summit, or whether the talks will deal
mostly with trying to heal deep wounds and prepare for Thursday's
event.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party officials said Monday the summit's success depends
on the King, but indicated that election results and the travel ban
are two issues that must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The SRP said Monday, its delegation plans to introduce a series of
substantive items to be agreed upon in order firstly to create the
conditions for meaningful dialogue at the summit itself, and secondly
to determine fundamental goals for a possible coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition supporters took to the streets of Phnom Penh over the
last three weeks to protest the election results and to demand the
resignation of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk stepped into defuse the crisis when weeks of protests
erupted into violence following a police interference that left at
least two dead on the streets and scores of others injured and
missing.

Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the visiting Czech Prime Minister Milos
Zeman, Klima said the Sudeten problem should not stand in the way
of the Czech bid for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Sudeten, a region in the northwestern part of the Czech
Republic, was captured by the German army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Even though most of the population are Germans, Sudeten was
returned to the Czech Republic after the war. However, the Czech
government started to drive Sudeten Germans out of the area,
triggering quarrels between Prague, Bonn and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Both Klima and Zeman agreed to set up a committee to
investigate historical problems between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
At present, some Austrians have established -- as a
precondition for the Czech Republic to join the EU -- that Prague
should compensate the exiled Sudeten Germans.
</P>
<P>
Zeman said at a press conference that politics had to look
forward rather than backward, adding that the Sudeten problem
should be separated from its bid for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"History belongs to historians," Zeman noted, saying that the
Czech Republic and Germany had signed a reconciliation statement
last year and the Sudeten problem was no longer regarded as a
major issue.
</P>
<P>
Zeman arrived in Vienna for a brief visit. He also met Austrian
President Thomas Klestil and President of the National Council
Heinz Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Central European countries will gather in Vienna on
October 12 to discuss EU expansion.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP Grows 1.8 Percent in First Half of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 1998, bringing the
annual increase to 1.15 percent, the National Statistics Institute
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
For the entire first half of this year, GDP showed a growth of
1.8 percent, compared with a gain of 0.6 percent in the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that Italy's economic growth was in line
with that of other major industrialized countries. France reported
a second-quarter growth of 0.7 percent, Britain 0.5 percent, the
U.S. 0.4 percent and Germany 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Italian commodities and services went up by 2.5
percent on a quarterly basis and household consumption 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Italian economy was expected to grow by 2.5 percent this
year, but the forecast was scaled back to two percent later. To
hit that target, the economy will have to climb 2.2 percent in the
remaining two quarters, the institute said.

<HEADLINE> China Promises Closer Cooperation with IAEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China, as a nuclear weapon
state, advocated the complete prohibition and destruction of
nuclear weapons, and will continue its close cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Zhang Huazhu, head of
the Chinese delegation, told the 42nd Session of the IAEA General
Conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China had always supported the indefinite extension of the
Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and signed
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Zhang said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen nuclear export controls, China joined the Zangger
Committee in October 1997 and formally promulgated the Regulation
of Nuclear Export Control of the People's Republic of China last
year, and the Regulation of Nuclear Dual-Use Items Export Control
of the People's Republic of China this year.
</P>
<P>
"The promulgation and implementation of these two regulations
have put nuclear exports and nuclear-related dual use items
exports on a legally controlled track, which has positive
significance for promoting nuclear cooperation and nuclear trade
between China and other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet demand for electricity in its economic development,
China had successfully constructed two nuclear power plants in the
1990s with a total installed capacity of 2,100 MW, which have been
operating smoothly, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five Year Plan, China planned to build another
four big nuclear power plants, with a total of eight units and the
total installed capacity of 6,600 megawatts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that preventing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons was still a pressingly important task. "The nuclear tests
conducted in May by India, which went against the trend, and then
by Pakistan, shocked the international community and met universal
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"The acts of India and Pakistan are a hard blow on the
international effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and constitute a big challenge to the global nuclear
non-proliferation regime of which the NPT is the cornerstone," the
Chinese official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged India and Pakistan to fully implement
U.N. Security Council Resolution number 1172, abandon their
nuclear weapon development programs and accede to the CTBT and NPT
immediately and unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> NBA Talks Stalled Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The NBA owners and
players failed to set up a bargaining session because both sides
couldn't agree on the basic rules.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commissioner Russ Granik and players union president
Billy Hunter both acknowledged Monday that talks aimed at closing
the lockout could have resumed almost a week and a half ago,
though they differed on why such a get-together never took place.
</P>
<P>
Since the lockout beginning on July 1, both sides only held
one formal bargaining session, and the league is to begin
canceling exhibition games later this week.
</P>
<P>
"We invited players to come back to the table, and they
declined," Granik said. "They said as long as we would be talking
about a hard cap or some system that set a defined percentage of
revenues to go toward player salaries, they didn't see any point
of meeting."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he had proposed to have a meeting with four
representatives from each side. But he refused to do so when
commissioner David Stern insisted that the owners' labor
committee should send eight members to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's progressive or beneficial when there
are 40 people in the room," said Hunter, who nonetheless tried to
call Granik on Monday afternoon to discuss moving the process f
orward.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are still waiting for a decision from arbitrator
John Feerick, who will rule on the players' grievance contending
that some 220 players with 800 million worth of guaranteed
contracts should be paid during the lockout. But Feerick's
ruling is not expected until early October.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Reports Less Private Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Private capitals entering
Latin American countries and the Caribbean dropped drastically
from 26.2 billion U.S. dollars in the 1996 fiscal year to 13.6
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported on Monday that
capital fluctuations were caused by the closure of foreign banks
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the reform and restructuring of the Latin American
banking system -- relevant to private capital -- were also
affected by Southeast Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of Asia's financial debt crisis in Latin America
were more evident in September 1997. Argentina, Panama and
Venezuela bought global 30-year bonds for a total of 7 billion
U.S. dollars," IMF reported. The deepening of the Asian crisis
only increased the debt of the Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1997 fiscal year, the debt of Latin America
and the Caribbean grew to 4.636 billion dollars, compared with
4.263 billions dollars during the previous fiscal year.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's commercial banks
will continue to extend credit to firms exporting tea to
crisis-hit Russia in a bid to protect the tea industry in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This decision followed a high-powered conference between
government officials and representatives of commercial banks last
weekend, according to Finance Ministry sources Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government at the meeting urged the bankers to continue
with the credit facilities to exporters as the Russian currency
crisis is expected to blow over soon, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is Sri Lanka's biggest tea market and the Russian
currency crisis had affected tea prices at most tea auction
centers recently.
</P>
<P>
Price at the Colombo auction at present continues to fall and
Sri Lanka's tea small-holders are the most affected.

HAVANA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Millions of people have been
alerted to the coming hurricane "George" through the Caribbean
region as it closed in dangerously to Puerto Rico on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After strong tides and heavy raining hit the northern part of
Lesser Antilles, the hurricane, now a little weakened, closed on
Monday afternoon to Puerto Rico, where authorities and population
had reportedly made necessary preparations.
</P>
<P>
Classified as number three on the Saffir-Simpson scale of five,
"George" has sustained winds at 175 kilometers per hour, with
threats directed also at the Dominican Republic, where a state of
alert was declared.
</P>
<P>
In Santo Domingo, the Civilian Defense installed a Center of
Operations and started to put up shelters for possible victims of
the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Has 30 percent of State Budget Untouched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With less than two weeks left
in the fiscal year, nearly 30 percent of the Thai government's
budget remains unspent, the Bangkok Post newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Finance Ministry is working to speed up
disbursements, at least half of the remaining money is unlikely to
be spent before this fiscal year ends on September 30, the
newspaper said, quoting Deputy Finance Minister Pichet
Phanvichartkul.
</P>
<P>
As of last Thursday, 580 billion baht (14.5 billion U.S.
dollars) had been disbursed from the 830-billion-baht (20.7
billion-dollar) budget for fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expects to disburse 134 billion baht (3.4 billion
dollars) by the end of the month, bringing total disbursements to
714 billion baht (17.9 billion dollars) or 86 percent of the total
budget.
</P>
<P>
Delays in budget disbursements and last-minute spending sprees
are nothing new, said the newspaper. But this year officials blame
the delays on the need to adhere to strict conditions set earlier
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF subsequently agreed to relax constraints, allowing the
government to run a deficit.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1998 budget of 830 billion baht contained a
provision for a deficit of up to 117 billion baht (2.9 billion
dollars) or 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). State
enterprises were allowed to run a maximum deficit of no more than
0.6 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims in Inner Mongolia Settled for Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the
flood-stricken areas of northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region have all been provided with proper housing and sufficient
food and clothing in preparation for the coming winter, according
to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in August, the local government began to make
arrangements for the settlement of these families so they could be
settled before the freezing winter comes. Temporary, public, and
vacant houses are being used to accommodate those who lost their
homes in the floods.
</P>
<P>
The local government also adopted measures such as grain loans
from the government, donations from neighboring cities, and other
effective means to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region suffered seven
devastating floods this summer which destroyed 178,600 houses and
left some 300,000 people homeless. More than one-million people
were left in desperate need of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the local government plans to allocate one thousand
yuan to each flood-affected family, along with subsidies for
rebuilding houses and a two-month grain supply. Some 13,500 tons
of donated grain and 1.8 million pieces of donated clothes have
already been distributed to the flood victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
Levies that by their nature represent government functions will
be replaced by taxes and included in the government budget, while
a limited number of levies that are compatible with international
practices will be allowed to remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, China's related departments have cancelled 29
items of administrative operating charges and 147 unreasonable
fund items, which together will reduce the burden on enterprises
by some 13 billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that over the past year local authorities
throughout the country have revoked a total of 20,700 items of
irrational charges on firms, involving a total value of 49.3
billion yuan, and handled more than 12,000 cases of illegal
levies.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular recently demanding various
localities to clear up all administrative operating charges, fines
and fund-raising items before this October, with major attention
given to such industries and departments as electricity, railways
and public security.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance revealed that pilot projects will be
launched to turn charges into taxes in rural areas, with the aim
of lowering total levies on farmers to under five percent of their
average annual per capita income.
</P>
<P>
In order to create effective levies management procedures and
establish a sound taxation system, the State Council and related
departments have published a series of policies and regulations
involving the management of extra-budgetary funds, the
rectification of unreasonable levies on firms and stricter control
on receipts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time. the State Council is also making efforts to
bring the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure mechanisms
into accord with market practices.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech foreign trade
deficit fell 46.7 percent in the first eight months of this year
as a result of growth in imports and exports, the country's
statistics bureau said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Imports for the first eight months grew 13.3 percent to reach
613 billion korunas (19.9 billion U.S. dollars) while exports

from the ministry confirmed that Sri Lanka's deforestation rate is
one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The survey has revealed a great need to address environmental
problems and new issues emerging daily in a more effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The existing legislation pertaining to environmental protection
is not adequate to address the fast-changing environmental
scenario.
</P>
<P>
In addition to deforestation, acute coastal degradation also
results in a loss of around 55 million dollars annually, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Because of administrative lapses and loopholes in the
environmental laws, effective action could not be taken to arrest
the situation, a senior official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
said Monday it wants 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in emergency funds
to rebuild the embassies destroyed by bombs last month and to beef
up security at U.S. facilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official told a briefing that the U.S. administration
would send its request to the Congress later this week.
</P>
<P>
Of the funding request, about 1.4 billion dollars would be used
to rebuild the U.S. embassies in Kenya and in Tanzania, which were
destroyed by bombs on August 7, and to beef up security at
U.S. facilities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Much of the remaining money would provide aid to Kenya and
Tanzania to help the families of those killed in the bombings and
help pay the medical expenses of those injured.
</P>
<P>
Officials who briefed reporters on the emergency package said
the administration would likely seek more such funding next year.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Levies Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 22 (Xinhua) -- For China's fiscal and
taxation departments, clearing up levies has become the
core of their work.
</P>
<P>
Sources from related departments said that effective measures
are being introduced to rectify various levies in order to create
an ideal environment for state fiscal and tax management.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal levy system reform carried out in 1994 has been
successful, with industrial and commercial tax revenues increasing
some 100 billion yuan, or 16 percent, annually.
</P>
<P>
However, exorbitant levies by local governments at various
levels have seriously hurt state revenues and resulted in heavy
burdens on businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that various levies and funds
approved by the State Council and the ministries, combined with
those approved by local governments, have exceeded 2,000 items,
with a total value of more than 40 percent of all fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China's fiscal revenues accounted for
some 10 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and compared
with other developing countries, Chinese businesses pay
comparatively less in taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, many firms are subject to more types of levies, other
than taxes, and the total amount of these levies often equals that
of the taxes they pay.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that at present the combined value of taxes and
levies on Chinese firms accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the the
GDP, surpassing the average level of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said that rampant levies
introduced not only disturb orderly distribution and hurt fiscal
revenues, but also do harm to the image of the government and, to
some extent, make it easier for corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that measures will be taken to deal with various levies
in terms of their nature, category and circumstances. "Illegal and
irrational levies will be definitely revoked," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Team Confirms Rapes During May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Joint
Fact-Finding Team investigating the May riots in the country
asserted on Monday that despite some officials' denials, sexual
assaults and rapes did take place in the unrest in Jakarta and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
"We confirmed to the government that sexual assaults including
rapes occurred during the May riots," team chairman Marzuki
Darusman was quoted by the newspaper The Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki told this to reporters after meeting Minister of
Defense and Security/Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, Minister
of Justice Muladi and State Minister of Women's Affairs Tutty
Alawiyah at the Ministry of Justice on Monday.
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate on the basis of the team's statement,
Marzuki said the 19-member team had access to sources of
information about the sexual assaults during the riots.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that a number of team members had met with
victims of the sexual assaults and rapes.
</P>
<P>
"We will convey the complete report (on sexual assaults and
rapes during the riots) when we announce our final report in
October. The important thing is we want to assure that these
things have happened and this is accepted by the government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, the country saw the worst looting and
rioting in decades in Jakarta, Medan and Solo, killing more than
1,200 people and damaging thousands of buildings and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Joint Fact-Finding Team on July
23 which includes representatives from the Armed Forces,
government agencies, the National Commission on Human Rights and
non-governmental organizations to investigate reports that the
riots were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Activists, including those in the Volunteers for Humanity led
by Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, have said 168 women and
children were raped or sexually assaulted during the riots, 20 of
whom died or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
Sandyawan is one of the Joint Fact-Finding Team members.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the team met the ministers on Monday to
deliver an interim report on its investigation into the May riots.
The team is expected to complete its task by October 23.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto told reporters after a two-hour meeting with the team
that they had collected "a lot of facts as well as information"
relating to the rapes alleged to have occurred during the riots.
</P>
<P>
"The team has gathered a lot of facts and information and
shared them with us (the government). We will use them to
complement the inputs the government has previously received on
the incidents," Wiranto added.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Preparing Yarlung Zangbo River Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region
is preparing an expedition along the Yarlung Zangbo River to make
the deepest valley in the world more available to tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhengqi, director of the Tourism Administrative Bureau of
Tibet, told the First Southwest China Tourism Promotion Fair in
Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, recently that visitors
can see a variety of ecosystems and vegetations similar to that of

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Allow Private Firms to Import Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will allow private companies to import good-quality rice and sell
it directly to consumers to help boost supply on the domestic
market, a minister was quoted by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Private-sector imports would be restricted to first- and
second-grade rice while the State Logistics Agency (Bulog) would
continue to import lower grades, State Minister of Food Affairs
and Horticulture A.M. Saefuddin said in a hearing with House of
Representatives Commission III for agriculture and food affairs on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said private traders importing rice would be exempt from
import duties and value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
The market for first- and second-grade rice, which is mainly
consumed by the country's rich, was big enough to make the trade a
viable commercial proposition.
</P>
<P>
"Imports of good quality rice will be limited to only 600,000
tons in this fiscal year because it is consumed by only 20 percent
of the total population," Saefuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Harvest failure has prompted the government to commit itself to
importing 4.1 million tons of rice in this fiscal year beginning
April.
</P>
<P>
Contracts have been signed for the import of 2.4 million tons
of rice, some of which has already been delivered. Of the
remaining 1.7 million tons, Bulog last week procured 526,000 tons
through a competitive bidding process and contracts to import a
further 674,000 tons will shortly be put out to tender. The
remainder is expected to be good-quality rice imported by private
companies.
</P>
<P>
Saefuddin told the House that half of the country has been hit
by food shortages.
</P>
<P>
He said 150 of the country's 308 regencies were facing a food
shortfall, adding that shortages in 53 of these regencies were
severe.
</P>
<P>
"Shortfalls exist in 25 of Indonesia's 27 provinces. Only
Jakarta and Bali are not facing a shortfall. In Jakarta, only the
urban poor in slum areas are vulnerable to food shortages," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking several steps to combat the problem,
including increasing rice imports, he added.

<HEADLINE> Program Helps Tibetans Regain Their Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A 40-year-old Tibetan woman who
suffered from cataract-related blindness for many years and who
had not seen her 15-year-old son, regained her sight when doctors
from Beijing performed eye surgery on her three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Cangjue, burst into tears, and said, "I thought I
would see nothing for the rest of my life," as she thanked the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
She is one of 980 cataract patients who have regained their
sight since a medical team started providing surgery for free in
the Tibet Autonomous Region since August in a program sponsored by
"Sight First China Action", whose intention is to help 1.75
million Chinese cataract sufferers regain their sight before the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The program was started by the Ministry of Health, the Chinese
Disabled Persons' Federation, and Lions Clubs International in
August of last year.
</P>
<P>
The people of Tibet run a much higher risk of cataracts because
of excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays. The incidence of
cataracts is twice as high as in other parts of China, and they
generally appear 10 to 15 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
People can not do farm or even household work, making their
lives much harder. Cangjue thought that she would have to make her
son quit school and help the family with their cattle as a result.
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned about the serious situation in Tibet,"
says Wang Chengjin, vice chairman of the executive council of the
disabled persons' organization. He explains that the medical team
consists of some 20 leading ophthalmologists from hospitals in the
cities of Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing and Lhasa. They traveled about
4,600 kilometers to remote towns and counties in spite of mountain
sickness, and bad weather, and poor road conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity both for local patients and us. I've never
been so excited and happy as when Cangjue could see again," says
Doctor Li Meiju, of Beijing's General Hospital of the Air Force,
who removed Cangjue's cataract and added the artificial lens.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Recover State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) - Chinese courts handled
258,000 criminal cases and convicted 265,000 defendants during the
first seven months this year, according Xiao Yang, president of
the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Xiao told participants in a recent conference that the
nation's courts issued judgments leading to the recovery of four
billion yuan (about 500 million U.S. dollars) in assets belonging
to the State and collectives.
</P>
<P>
Chinese courts have focused on prosecuting cases involving
heinous crimes, drug traffickers, publishers of illegal and
obscene materials, smugglers and corrupt public officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the January-July period show that Chinese courts
handled 258,000 criminal cases of the first instance, up 7.39
percent on the previous year's period. The courts handed down
judgments in 222,000 cases, down 3.97 percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The courts convicted 123,000 felons involved in disrupting
social order and 15,000 individuals charged with economic crimes,
including 217 high-ranking county and 21 prefectural
(departmental) officials.
</P>
<P>
Xiao noted the courts have witnessed a sharp increase in
financial disputes.
</P>
<P>
"State-owned commercial banks have recorded a relatively high
ratio of bad loans, various non-financial institutions have
engaged in illegal financial transactions, irregularities have
surfaced in the nation's stock and futures markets, and there has
been a upsurge in the number of fraud cases," according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
He said courts issued judgments in 223,000 financial cases
during the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Courts have accelerated efforts to handle the increasing number
of cases related to the reform of state-owned enterprises,
land-use contracts in rural areas and both real estate and labor
disputes. The efforts of the courts center on safeguarding
economic development and social stability.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government still
has under its jurisdiction 23,215 hectares of land to be returned
to Panama, Panama's Interoceanic Regional Authority (IRA) said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaty, signed by the two countries
in 1977, the land will be transferred gradually by December 31,
1999, the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
Panama plans to develop industrial, tourist, commercial and
maritime projects at the U.S. military bases of Fort Kobbe,
Cocoli, Corozal, Fort Sherman, Fort Clayton, Howard and Rodman,
where there are still 4,500 U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
The transfer is carried out under the guidelines set by
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares in the law that
contains the General Use, Conservation and Development Plan of the
Canal area and for the development of the returned land.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government is expected to invest 103 million
U.S. dollars to achieve the proposed goals.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRA's plans, there will be reforestation
projects as well as installation of public institutions and
non-government organizations over 12,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has returned a total of 70,000 hectares to Panama
since 1979, when the New Canal Treaty was put into effect.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Patent Bureau
recently approved a patent for an invention of Kiu Tai Yu, a watch
designer in Hong Kong, for the Kiu Mystery Tourbillon, which he
calls "the King of watches".
</P>
<P>
It is the first patent accorded a Chinese for sophisticated
mechanical watch works. Kiu blends the traditional Chinese art of
seal cutting and calligraphy in watchmaking.
</P>
<P>
Kiu, who is a native of Jiangsu Province, began his love affair
with antiques and watchmaking when he was just 12 years old. He
moved to Hong Kong in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Kiu made his first invention, called the 'tourbillon',
which won him the title of great master of watch design in Asia,
and in the past 7 years he has completed 14 different models.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bora Milutinovic, the
only man to guide four different teams into the second round of
the World Cup, was hired on Monday to coach the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Serbian-born Milutinovic became the club's fifth
coach in three years with a contract running to the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
The club saw the departure of Brazilian Carlos Alberto
Parreira who left in December to coach Saudi Arabia in the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
The MetroStars clinched a playoff berth last month, but lost
their last six matches, fallen from second to third in the
Eastern Conference and dropped to 14-17 with one game remaining
before the post-season.
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Milutinovic led Mexico to the quarterfinals at
the 1986 World Cup, its highest finish.
</P>
<P>
He took over Costa Rica just before the 1990 World Cup and
stunned many by getting it into the second round and guided the
United States for the second round in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic appeared again on the world scene in France this
summer, guiding Nigeria into the second round before it was
eliminated by Denmark.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Young Asians shouldn't lose
their traditional wedding culture to the irresistible trend toward
a Western living style, a Japanese wedding expert said recently at
the 4th Asian Wedding Culture Symposium held in the northeast
China coastal city of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Yumi Katsura, head of the Japan Wedding Culture Association,
said Japanese wedding culture is being Westernized these days, and
the same thing is happening in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
China.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that more than half of Japanese newlyweds
hold their wedding ceremonies in churches and wear Western-style
wedding dress. Another 30 percent wear both Western dress and
Japanese traditional dress.
</P>
<P>
Yumi Katsura said that Asian tradition should coexist with
Western culture, not be eroded by it.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, different nationalities have their own traditional
wedding culture with elaborate rites and colorful costumes.
</P>
<P>
An the symposium, experts and wedding dress designers from
Japan, India, the ROK and other Asian countries exchanged views on
the promotion and protection of traditional Asian wedding
culture.

<HEADLINE> Avon Shifts from Direct Sales to Retailing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Former direct-sales giant
Guangzhou Avon Co. Ltd. has recently turned to retail and whole
selling in China with the approval of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As a joint venture between Avon of the United States and a
local company in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province,
Guangzhou Avon became the first direct-sales company in China in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Since the State Council issued a ban on direct selling in China
in April, Guangzhou Avon has been busy adjusting its operations.
</P>
<P>
After getting approval on September 9, Guangzhou Avon and its
68 subsidiaries in China will soon be doing retail and wholesale
business in shops.
</P>
<P>
The company recently invested 40 million U.S. dollars to build
a new factory in the city of Conghua in Guangdong Province. The
new facility is expected to become operational this November.
</P>
<P>
Avon is the world's largest direct-sales cosmetics dealer,
with annual sales of 5.1 billion U.S. dollars. By 1997,
the company had invested 70 million U.S. dollars in China, and
sales that year hit 75 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Avon has paid taxes of 55 million U.S. dollars in
China thus far.

<HEADLINE> NZ Suffers More From UV-B Radiation: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- "The amount of
ultraviolet-B (UV-B) reaching the earth's surface of New Zealand
is higher than northern hemisphere countries that are at an
equivalent latitude," a New Zealand expert said.
</P>
<P>
Brian Jordan, director of the Monogastric Research Center of
the Massey University, said the reason for higher level of UV-B
radiation in New Zealand is that the country has clear skies with
no pollution to act as a "filter," the local newspaper The
Dominion Tuesday reported.
</P>
<P>
Because of the higher level of UV-B radiation, New Zealand has
already become "one of the highest incidences of skin cancer in
the world," said Jordan, who has just returned from a U.N. meeting
in Hawaii on the environmental effects of ozone depletion and UV-B
radiation.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact of pouring chemical by-products into the
atmosphere would continue to deplete ozone for 50 years despite
international cleanup measures.
</P>
<P>
Jordan called on New Zealanders to maintain "vigilance of the
long-term possibility of increasing levels of UV-B radiation."
</P>
<P>
"High levels of UV-B are damaging but our behavior can reduce
the risk," he said. "For humans, keeping out of the midday sun and
covering up are two simple but effective protective measures."

<HEADLINE> Cow Bones May Be Used in Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Hamilton in

New Zealand's North Island have made a breakthrough in molding
human
joint implants out of cow bones, the New Zealand Press Association

(NZPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the achievement of the Waikato University scientists
and
the Meat Industry Research Institute of New Zealand is expected to

benefit cancer patients and crash victims.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have found a way to turn cow thigh bones from
the
abattoir into a dry, softer substance that doctors can cut for use

in non-load-bearing human joints. Those who will benefit include
bone cancer patients, accident victims with bone-crush injuries,
people with birth deformities, arthritis patients and people
wanting
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
The NZPA said the government-funded research has been conducted

for two years and the purified bone they have developed is called
calcium phosphate. Overseas doctors already use it in a synthetic
form, but it is costly to import. The Hamilton researchers found a

much cheaper way to make it naturally.
</P>
<P>
The process involves cutting the top off the yellow bone,
pressure-cooking it to kill bugs and remove fat and blood, soaking
it
in solvents to remove the last traces of fat, bleaching it and
agitating it to remove collagen.
</P>
<P>
The next step is animal and human trials, the NZPA said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Investigates Ex-President's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto
to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the
investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
</P>
<P>
"With this letter of authorization, I can go anywhere in the
world to search accounts that may be held by Soeharto," Ghalib was
quoted by the newspaper The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Without such a letter, it will be hard for the team to ask
foreign banks to open their records due to long-established
banking secrecy policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate
alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
</P>
<P>
A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib
said without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing
wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune
overseas.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on
May 21, swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in a
statement broadcast by his own daughter's television station early
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday
reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating
Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
"The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal
fortune. Should there be indications (that this wealth was amassed
illegally), the government will pursue the case and take legal
action," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the special team tasked to investigate the former
president has already scheduled a meeting with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Soeharto will receive the team soon," Tanjung said.

<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The English Football
Association charged Monday goalkeeper Mark Bosnich with
misconduct following allegations that he swore at fans during
Aston Villa's goalless draw against Everton.
</P>
<P>
A police report was filed following the incident that
supposedly took place on August 15.
</P>
<P>
One of the complaints that lead to the report came from a
member of the Mersey tunnel Authority's private police force, the
other from a member of the public.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich refutes the claims, saying, "This is all ridiculous.
It never happened.
</P>
<P>
"When the final whistle went I just turned round and made a
gesture of triumph to the crowd because we had won a hard-earned
point."
</P>
<P>
In October 1996, Bosnich landed himself in trouble after
delivering a Nazi-style salute to Tottenham fans.
</P>
<P>
He subsequently received a formal warning from the FA
regarding his future conduct.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich has 14 days to reply to the fresh claims.

<HEADLINE> Ben Johnson Fails in Lifting Lifetime Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson
failed on Monday in its latest attempts to overturn the lifetime
ban when an appeal court quickly dismissed his appeal.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that a lower court did the right thing last
summer when it refused to lift Johnson's ban from track and
field, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The sprinter looked stunned when given the verdict. Earlier,
he said that he would appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada if
the appeal court did't rule in his favor.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Canadian was still hoping to return to the
track and field 10 years after his Seoul Olympic gold was
stripped after testing positive for a banned steroid.
</P>
<P>
At that time, he was handed a two-year suspension from
competing.
</P>
<P>
He returned to sprinting in 1991, and took part in a semifinal
of the 100 meters event at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But when he tested positive for the second time at a track
meet in Montreal in 1993, the International Amateur Athletics
Federation imposed a lifetime ban on him.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Johnson asked the general division of Ontario Court
to lift the ban from competition. His request was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
If Canadian courts had ruled that his ban should be lifted,
the federation might have allowed Johnson to compete again, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> European Commission, IOC Start Direct Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee president on Monday visited the European Commission to
start a dialogue between the world governing body of sports and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue went underway as Juan Antonio Samaranch and
European Sports Commissioner Marcelino Oreja discussed the model
of European sports, the relations between sports and television
industry and the role sports plays in the framework of politics
and society.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, is drafting a legal text devoted not only to the
subject of competition and broadcasting rights but also to public
health and youth protection policy.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member commission is to debate a statement regarding
the drafting of the legal text.
</P>
<P>
The commission is concerned about the doping problem in sports
and the IOC invited Oreja to attend the global anti-doping
conference slated for next February in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The commission has already approved the ban on tobacco
sponsorship for sports and arts events in the European Union and
the ban is expected to enter into full force in 2006 at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner briefed Samaranch on his intention to propose
to the commission the designation of the year 2004 as the
European Year of Sports due to the fact the 2004 Summer Olympic
Games will be held in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Present at the dialogue were also representatives from
international sports federations and television broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Stuns Blackburn in English Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two late goals from Norwegian
substitute Tore Andre Flo helped Chelsea beat Blackburn Rovers
4-3 after the two sides finished the English Premier league match
with 10 men.
</P>
<P>
A night of drama and two penalties at Ewood Park also saw
Blackburn's French defender Sebastian Perez grab his first goal
for the club and then get sent off in the 68th minute with
Chelsea's former Blackburn player Graeme Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Flo was on the pitch for only around 14 minutes but
he had an immediate effect with the equaliser in the 82nd minute
and then a fine winner in the 86th with the assistance of fellow
substitute, Danish international Brian Laudrup.
</P>
<P>
European Cup Winners' Cup holders Chelsea had opened the
scoring in the 15th minute with a curling Gianfranco Zola
free-kick that flew over the wall and past the flailing Tim
Flowers. It was the Italian's second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
Chris Sutton then equalised in the 22nd through the legs of Le
Saux and Blackburn should have gone in at the interval ahead
after Garry Flitcroft missed a good 45th-minute chance.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea forged ahead again after the break with a 51st-minute
penalty taken by French World Cup winner Franck Leboeuf after
Flowers was deemed to have brought down Zola.
</P>
<P>
Perez made up the gap in the 68th minute with a neat
close-range goal from a Flitcroft overhead kick but 10 minutes
later he and Le Saux went off after a touchline clash with the
Chelsea player lashing out and Perez falling to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Perez was also booked, controversially and for reasons that
were clearly unclear to his irate manager Roy Hodgson, and
trudged off having picked up a yellow card earlier.
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Hodgson later denounced several of the
referee's decisions, including the Chelsea penalty, and said that
Perez paid the price for having "had the misfortune to put his
nose in the way of someone else's elbow".
</P>
<P>
Sutton doubled his tally with a 79th-minute penalty after a
foul on Swedish international Martin Dahlin that looked to have c
linched the match but then Flo came on. The Norwegian was unlucky
not to have finished with a hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted Chelsea to 11th place on eight points and
left Blackburn struggling in 18th on four.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Industry to Conduct Large-scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 21 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented
effort, the U.S. retail industry will survey 82,000 retail vendors
in the country on their readiness for the year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
The survey is under the auspices of the National Retail
Federation's Survival 2000 Project. The federation is scheduled to
send a joint letter Monday signed by 37 prominent retailers
including Sears, J.C. Penney and the Home Depot to vendors
spanning the entire retail supply chain to determine their ability
to deal with potential computer problems.
</P>
<P>
The letter notes that "the failure of an organization to become
Year 2000 compliant may seriously jeopardize or impair critical
business operations."
</P>
<P>
As there are less than 500 days left before the end of the
millennium, the federation said in a statement, an organized,
cross-industry survey is highly necessary and serve to build
awareness and to provide valuable information to participants.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of the letter demonstrates retailers' reliance
on merchandise vendors, malls, telecommunications providers and
numerous other companies for smooth operations. This landmark
joint effort marks the first time an industry has approached this
number of business partners.
</P>
<P>
The National Retail Federation (NRF) is the world's largest
retail trade association. Its members represent an industry that
encompasses more than 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments,
employs 20 million people and registered 1997 sales of over 2.5
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October, the federation will conduct a roundtable discussion
on the Y2K issue, NRF announced earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Eight countries on
Monday evening concluded a meeting on Afghanistan, with a joint
call for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations aimed at peaceful
solution to the conflicts in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"With a view toward ending conflict inside Afghanistan, and
ending further bloodshed, the Taliban and other parties should
declare an immediate ceasefire and undertake negotiations aimed at
achieving a political settlement culminating in the establishment
of a broad-based, multi-ethnic, representative government," a news
release said at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
was held on the sidelines of the current 53rd session of the
General Assembly.

"All forces should immediately release non-combatants in
detention, including Iranians," the representatives from eight
countries, namely six of Afghanistan's neighbors plus Russia and
the United States. .
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban should expedite the return of the remains of the
three Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, cooperate fully with an
international investigation into the killing of Iranian diplomats
and United Nations staff in Afghanistan, and bring the guilty
parties to justice," the meeting participants said.
</P>
<P>
"United Nations humanitarian assistance should be resumed as
soon as possible, with all factions providing safe and secure
conditions under internationally accepted norms," they stressed.

<HEADLINE> China: Afghan Issue Should be Solved by Afghan People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The question of
Afghanistan should be solved by the Afghan people and the Afghan
people have the ability to solve the problem of their own, China
stressed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a meeting on Afghanistan
which was initiated by the U.N. Secretary-General, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said as a neighboring country of
Afghanistan, China of course was following very closely the
developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that all factions in Afghanistan will
immediately achieve a ceasefire and the national reconciliation,
and China had consistently believed that the question of
Afghanistan should be solved by the Afghan people free from
external intervention," said Tang who is here to attend the
general debate of the 53rd session of the general Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"China has consistently opposed terrorism of any form and we
deeply deplore and regret the unfortunate killing of 9 Iranian
diplomats not long ago in Afghanistan which is entirely a serious
humanitarian crime and also a breach of international law. So the
Chinese Government strongly condemns such kind of act," Tang
continued.
</P>
<P>
"We are also following with great concern the recent
developments in the the border areas of Iran and Afghanistan.
China hopes that the parties concerned will keep calm and
exercise restraints and to settle their disputes through
dialogues and consultations in the interest of the peace and
stability in the region and in the interest of the appropriate
settlement of the Afghan issue," Tang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Ease of Iran-Afghan Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Annan was opening a meeting of eight
countries, namely representatives from six neighbors of
Afghanistan plus Russia and the United States to defuse tension
between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"A particular danger is posed by the increase in tension in the
border areas between Iran and Afghanistan. This threat, if allowed
to continue unattended, poses a very real danger to the peace and
stability of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the endless sufferings of the Afghan people,
this is a source of deep concern for me and the international
community at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Afghanistan meeting, sponsored by the United Nations, clearly
demonstrates the concern of the international community over recent
development between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the border areas between Iran and Afghanistan
was triggered by the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in
Afghanistan. Declaring that it reserves the right to take any
action to revenge, Tehran has maintained a buildup of 200,000
troops in its border areas with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Afghanistan has gone from bad to worse in
recent weeks, as the Taliban movement intensified its offensives
in the northern part of the country," Annan said, "The fighting ...
has led to further destruction and loss of life in a country
that had already been devastated by 20 years of war."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "It is in the interest of all the States
represented here to end the conflict in Afghanistan and ensure
peace and stability in the region," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that today's meeting will send out message to those in
the region that the high-level delegations represented here this
afternoon are united in the conviction that the situation in
Afghanistan and the region should not be allowed to deteriorate
any further," he added.
</P>
<P>
"What is solely needed in Afghanistan is a representative and
inclusive government which truly reflects the interests of all
ethnic and religious groups in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The militia Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, was
not represented at the meeting, held on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly session, as a majority of U.N. members refused to
recognize it as the solely legitimate representative of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Chineses Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his counterparts
from Pakistan, Russia, the United States and Uzbekistan attended
the meeting.
</P>

Also present at the meeting were deputy foreign minister of

UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from

</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his counterparts from

What is impressive at the meeting is that foreign minister of

</P>
<P>
Asked why the Iranian foreign minister failed to attend the
meeting, Fred Eckhard, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said, "I don't know why it is, you have to ask him."
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian sources simply said that Kamal Kharrazi,
Iranian foreign minister, had to accompany Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, who took the floor on Monday afternoon at the
general debate of the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Javad Zarif, deputy foreign minister of Iran and permanent

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
should reinforce the mechanism of conflict resolution in Africa,
said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is because no external mechanism could achieve lasting
peace in the continent, he told the U.N. General Assembly on
behalf of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
On economic matters, he said Africa has spared no efforts to
establish an internal climate conducive to economic growth and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
After years of stagnation, a new era of courageous reform in
the management of state affairs has emerged, he said, adding that
the goal is to set up the African Economic Community in the first
half of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Compaore said it was time to rethink the role of international
organizations in regulating the world economy, so that the
widening gap between rich and poor would not continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of the U.N. reform, Compaore said it
is unthinkable that an African representative is not seated on the
Security Council when Africa accounts for one third of the U.N.
members.
