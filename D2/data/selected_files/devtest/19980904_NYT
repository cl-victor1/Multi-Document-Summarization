COMMENTARY: THE DAYS OF SEPTEMBER  
 (JT)

<P>
   In September of 1998, when it seemed that some Americans would
lose money in the stock market and others might even lose jobs,
America and its government focused on nations they felt were to
blame, and on what American policy should be toward them. Russia,
Indonesia, Japan and so on.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September of 1998, when it has become a reality for decades
past and a probability for decades ahead that terrorists select
Americans for death, the United States and its government pays
attention only after a terrorist attack, and then briefly. The
United States has no international anti-terrorist policy that is
either consistent, effective, understood by the world or that
frightens terrorist nations. Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya and so on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historians of the future will write paragraphs like those two.
They will try to explain why the strongest country in the world
could not deal with terrorism, its troops and its masters. But
Americans can figure out the reasons right now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans cannot get their heads around the fact that those
two-bit countries have us on the run politically and even
militarily. And in the high reaches of our government dwell
officials of medium ability, without sufficient power of
intellectual constancy to understand the past, see the present and,
through both, envision and lucidly discuss the future.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top foreign-affairs officials could not answer
questions from Ohio college students without trembling. The way the
administration has managed foreign affairs leads our allies and
beneficiaries to tell us to get lost, and Saddam Hussein just to
dispatch a vassal to slap us down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe the attacks against Afghanistan and the Sudan were
justified in a war against killers who cannot defuse generations of
hatred or its bombs. But Washington created the impression that
Osama bin Laden was Dr. No _ the fountainhead of world terror. The
job is to deal with terrorist groups and the terrorist nations
without which they could not exist long _ both halves of a poison
mushroom, not one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody believe that two Libyan intelligence officers
decided all by themselves to blow up Pan Am 103, thoughtfully
keeping the secret from their commander, Colonel Gadhafi?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tries to deal with Iran
through its president, Mohamed Khatami. Sometimes the U.S. press
calls it her finest moment. Could she find time to tell him that we
would appreciate his suggesting publicly that the ayatollahs who
control Iran stop sending certain daily planes into
Syrian-controlled Lebanon? I mean the ones loaded with killing
material destined not only for Israel _ oh, that _ but for chosen
enemies worldwide.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saddam is the terrorist who influences most other terrorists.
The United States is now so weak in mind and muscle that it allows
him to bar U.N. inspections _ again and again.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter is making it hard to think only about stocks and
bonds. A former Marine major, he headed U.N. inspectors assigned to
track down the Iraqi and foreign network that Saddam uses to
conceal the renewal of his nuclear, chemical and biological weapon
programs. The Ritter team needed one more surprise inspection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was scheduled for Aug. 10, and canceled Aug. 8, on U.S.
demand. Ritter resigned _ to tell Americans what they should know.
He testified Thursday before a Senate committee. He says that
despite the cancellation, and U.S. interventions, earlier
inspections showed the network began and ended at Saddam's office
door. We do not have to be inspection experts to understand what
that means.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long as Saddam exists, so will Iraq's plans to become a power
in weapons of mass destruction _ for itself and for selected
traveling terrorists. Washington apparently does not want that
advertised, possibly because after six years in office the Clinton
administration has no plan to make him non-exist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now please note well: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ritter nor any of the other U.N. inspectors believe that
without enforcement Saddam will allow the full inspection he
promised. That would end his programs for weapons of mass
destruction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this September of 1998, Ritter told senators that without
effective inspections, Saddam Hussein would have nuclear weapons
within three years. And he said that without that inspection Saddam
would have bacteriological weapons in six months.

BIG BOARD VOTES TO END MANDATORY JOB-BIAS ARBITRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of the New York Stock Exchange voted
Thursday to no longer require industry arbitration of
job-discrimination claims, deciding that it will hear such claims
only when they are submitted and after a dispute has arisen,
according to executives at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which affects the whole brokerage industry as it
covers stockbrokers and other members of the exchange, will be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few
days, and after a period for public comment, it is expected to lead
to a change in the exchange's rules, said James Buck, senior vice
president and corporate secretary of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage industry's practice of mandatorily referring
employment disputes to industry arbitration _ as many brokerage
employees agree to do when they sign their work contracts _ has
gradually been eroded. Critics of mandatory arbitration have
maintained that it gives unfair advantage to brokerage firms, and
denies employees their civil rights by preventing them from getting
access to courts. The proponents of mandatory arbitration say it is
quicker, cheaper and more efficient than resorting to the courts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The change by the Big Board follows federal court decisions in
Massachusetts and California, which held that brokerage firm
employees could take discrimination claims to court and did not
have to submit to industry arbitration. It also follows a recent
decision by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which
oversees the Nasdaq market. That body recently ruled that the
matter of mandatory arbitration in these cases was one for
individual securities firms to decide for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   George Nicolau, a past president of the National Academy of
Arbitrators and now a spokesmen on such issues, called the decision
``a progressive step toward fairness.''

PRESIDENT NAMED AT FIDELITY INVESTMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments named James C. Curvey as president
Thursday, shifting all operating responsibilities for the giant
mutual fund and investment firm to him.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1997, Curvey, 63, has served as chief operating
officer and a vice chairman of FMR Corp., Fidelity's parent. As
such, he has been second in command to chairman and chief executive
Edward C. Johnson III.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Curvey said Johnson, 68, would continue in
those posts and was not preparing to retire or otherwise remove
himself from Fidelity's management.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson will spend more time overseeing policy and strategy
for Fidelity and less time on the day-to-day operations of the
company's various business units, Curvey said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's post at Fidelity was last occupied from 1983 to
1986 by Samuel W. Bodman III, who left to join Cabot Corp., a
Boston industrial company, as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey will have responsibility for overseeing Fidelity's mutual
fund business; its three distribution channels, which serve retail
customers, corporate retirement plans and brokers and other
financial intermediaries, and its venture capital unit.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey will also continue to supervise Fidelity's administrative
and legal departments. Robert C. Pozen, who heads Fidelity's mutual
fund unit, will continue to report to Johnson on matters of
investment policy.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey said his priorities as president would include
integrating the operations of Fidelity's domestic and international
units.

<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ Troy Kruger, a young refueler at
Halifax International Airport, heard the voice on the radio in his
truck on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot in an unknown plane was carrying on an urgent, barely
controlled conversation with the man in the airport tower.
</P>
<P>
   What Kruger did not know was that the voice belonged to the
pilot of Swissair Flight 111 and that he had only moments earlier
told air-traffic control that he was ``one level below an
emergency,'' according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot circled back, heading toward Boston, they said.
Air-traffic control advised him that Halifax was closer, 50 miles
away. The pilot turned around and flew on.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, his voice was being heard in Halifax by Kruger,
the tower operator, and a pilot on the ground named Andrew Arthur.
``He said there was smoke in the cabin, that it was an extreme
emergency,'' Arthur said. ``I wasn't sure it was a big plane, but
when he said he was going to dump 208 tons of fuel, I knew it was a
major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With smoke filling the plane, the pilot guided the MD-11,
carrying 229 people, to within 30 miles of the Halifax airport.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Kruger stepped outside and stared up at the sky. ``We
were waiting for the lights to come down, something, anything. But
nothing came,'' Arthur said. ``You could hear the tower guy's sigh,
almost like he was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the villages that dot the forested south shore
near Halifax, hundreds of people sat in square houses with the kind
of pitched roofs you find in a child's drawings. At the same time,
they all heard it. The boom, the thunder. And they felt it, the
noise that rattled their windows.
</P>
<P>
   In Hubley, Alice Wilson and her son heard what she said
``sounded like a plane, but all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bayswater, Harris Backman and his son Steve heard a loud
clap, preceded by a sickly whirring, like ``a plane trying to take
off and failing,'' said Backman's wife, Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, numerous emergency 911 calls came in,
reporting the sounds of a plane in distress.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the Backmans got a call from the local Coast
Guard Auxilliary office, where they are volunteers. Father and son
rode into the night on a boat to search for survivors of what was
now known to be a terrible plane crash. Instead, they found bits of
plane and bodies that none of them want to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Buckley, captain of a whale-watching ship from Peggy's
Cove, was shocked to see that the emerald sea was wearing a new set
of jewels: One white sneaker, a lady's glove, bits of paper, a
lonely floating teddy bear, an airpline wing, floating like a razor
blade in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley squinted his dark eyes against the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Morash of Hackett's Cove said the sound reminded him of May
27, 1981, when an Canadian Air Force Thunderbird crashed near here
and he was sent to clean it up. That date remained with him, he
said, because it was such an awful sight. But this? ``My God,'' he
said, standing the day after on a rock, looking out to the sea for
something, some sign.
</P>
<P>
   All he saw was a large gray Navy tanker called the Preserver.
According to Constable Brad Reid, the spokesman for the Royal
Canadian Mounted Patrol in Halifax, the Preserver is equipped with
both a hospital and a morgue, but the hospital was not needed.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m., 17 bodies had been found. Fishermen asked for body
bags, then more body bags. By 12:30 p.m., 36 bodies were taken to
the ship, one to shore.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they all were taken to the Shearwater military base,
where six teams of specialists under the watch of the coronor's
office did their scientific best to find names and pasts for what
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, searchers were aided by good weather, a dramatic
change from the previous night's rain and high seas. But 120 feet
under the sea, a hunk of plane, still intact, sat mute in the
darkness.

FOR PIAZZA AND METS, COUNTDOWN NOW BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ If the Nerw York Mets end up winning the National
League wild card playoff spot this season, they will certainly have
earned it. And Mike Piazza, the All-Star catcher who has seemed
unhappy at times with the Mets, will have enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say this, but this team definitely has
some good chemistry,'' Piazza said after homering in a 4-1 victory
over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday night. ``This is a real fun
team to play on. Obviously, you have more fun when you are winning.
But the guys are good guys here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Piazza has admitted enjoying himself with
the Mets, an experience that included repeated booing at Shea
Stadium before his hot streak began. His statements, however, were
not an indication that he will sign with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their future with Piazza, the Mets need to concentrate
on the rest of their season. Half of the Mets' remaining schedule _
11 of the final 22 games _ will be against a pair of division
leaders, the Braves and the Astros. A four-game series against
Atlanta begins Friday night at Shea, pitting two of the top
left-handers in the majors: the Mets' Al Leiter (13-5) against Tom
Glavine (18-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves are a real good team, we know that,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said after his team completed a 5-4 western swing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had just been reminded that the Mets are 0-5 against
the Braves, the NL East leaders, this season. ``But we're a real
good team, too,'' he said. ``We believe that now. And we're a
better team now than when we last faced them,'' in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Mets are good enough to take a series from the
Braves remains to be seen. But the Mets have responded to their
toughest stretch of the season with some of their best baseball of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets weathered a homestand two weeks ago that featured three
doubleheaders in four days. Then they went west with a one-game
lead in the wild card race. After Armando Reynoso (6-1) shut down
the Padres, yet another first-place team, on four hits over eight
innings Wednesday, the Mets _ one game behind the Cubs in the wild
card race _ returned for a much-needed off day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing two games in the standing to Chicago, the Mets
(77-63) finished a West Coast swing with a winning record for only
the fourth time in their last 18 trips.
</P>
<P>
   And now things really get tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many games have we played them, five?'' Valentine said of
the Braves, whom the Mets trail by 14 games. ``I'm not worried that
we haven't beaten them. They haven't beaten this team yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What Valentine meant was that the Mets are much different than
when they were swept in Atlanta July 3-5, in the last series before
the All-Star break, and at Shea July 14-15. After the Mets lost
July 16 to Philadelphia, they were just two games over .500 and
their wild card chances seemed to be slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, they are 12 games over .500. Their starting
pitchers are rested, thanks to Valentine's six-man rotation
experiment. And the newcomers Tony Phillips and Lenny Harris have
energized a lineup that had often been punchless. Harris drilled
his fifth home run in 16 games Wednesday to erase an early 1-0 San
Diego lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference in the Mets is Piazza, who was
struggling in the Mets' first two series against the Braves. He has
all but carried the Mets offensively for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   For the 130 games he has played this season, Piazza is hitting
.319 with 28 homers and 93 runs batted in. In his 88 games with the
Mets, his relative numbers (.339, 19 homers, 58 RBI) are even
better.
</P>
<P>
   If Piazza can approach the September he had last season, when he
hit .406 with eight home runs and 27 runs batted in for the
Dodgers, the Mets will greatly improve their chances to reach the
post-season for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a more balanced club than the last time we played the
Braves,'' Piazza said. ``And we've been a lot more consistent since
before the break. But let's be frank. We've got a tough schedule.
And we've got some week ahead. If _ and it's a big if _ we do
happen to get there and win the wild card, we really will have
earned it.''

JUST DESERTS FOR KANELL: $9.5 MILLION FOR 3 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It made the Giants uncomfortable that
the starting quarterback Danny Kanell was making the league's
minimum salary of $216,000. It made Kanell uncomfortable that even
backup quarterbacks make five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, reached not coincidentally right before the
pivotal season-opening game with the Washington Redskins, was a
renegotiated three-year contract, worth $9.5 million, beginning
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And though the new deal makes Kanell one of the team's four
highest-paid players, it could be nothing more than a step toward
an even bigger payday. If Kanell blossoms this season into the star
the Giants hope he can become, this latest contract will be torn up
next winter and renegotiated as well.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Rob Johnson, with one National Football League start
in his career, extracted a five-year, $25 million contract from the
Buffalo Bills last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, mindful of the
four-year, $12.8 million contract the Giants gave quarterback Dave
Brown in 1996, was unwilling to give Kanell that kind of
commitment. But he did not want Kanell, who was 7-2-1 as a starter
last season, to be distracted by his league-minimum salary this
year or to have the chance to field other teams' offers as a
restricted free agent next year. The new contract found a middle
ground, with the understanding that should Kanell flourish, an
annual salary of $3 million would no longer be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Michael Strahan, with a salary-cap value this
season of $3.77 million, is currently the team's highest-paid
player. Incentive clauses make ranking Giants salaries difficult,
but the injured cornerback Jason Sehorn, with an average of more
than $3 million annually, would be next in the mix along with
Kanell and linebacker Jessie Armstead, whom the Giants upgraded
with a new deal last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very fair,'' Kanell said Thursday. ``I don't feel
like I'm one of the top quarterbacks in the league, but I shouldn't
be getting what backups and third-stringers are getting either.
It's a great step of faith. Now I want to make the Giants proud and
show them I'm worth every penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said the Jets' signing of running back Curtis Martin,
who was a restricted free agent last winter, had some effect on the
Giants' strategy with Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell would have been a restricted free agent after this
season, and though the Giants could have matched any offer he
received from another team next winter, the Jets' successful
pursuit of Martin with a diabolically complex offer sheet revealed
the difficulty a team can have trying to keep a key player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny's the starting quarterback and something had to be
done,'' Accorsi said Thursday of his talks with Kanell, who signed
a three-year, $704,000 contract as the team's fourth-round draft
pick in 1996. ``We both got something out of it. And getting it
done now made sense because doing it during the season is not a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said, ``I trusted the Giants' organization to pay me what
I deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do to celebrate his new salary, Kanell
smiled. ``Watch film of the Redskins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel had the Giants install a high-tech $36,000
videotape player and projector in the condo Kanell rents in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I guess I can get a big-screen TV, too,'' Kanell said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Summer vacation in the Berkshire Mountains included,
by custom, a family pilgrimage to Wahconah Park in Pittsfield,
Mass., where the minor-league Pittsfield Mets set up shop from June
to September. In case you wonder about the name, they are the New
York-Penn League offspring of the better-known Mets of Flushing
Meadows, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Wahconah Park (capacity 4,000) offers baseball the way it was
meant to be: in an intimate setting, with splendid seats for the
general admission price of $2.50 and with no silly distractions
like exploding scoreboards, guys in chicken suits telling you when
to clap or luxury skyboxes that make a mockery of the game's
egalitarian roots.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its pleasures, Wahconah is showing its age. It was
built in 1919, four years before Yankee Stadium opened, and the
summer has been filled with cries of how Pittsfield sorely needs a
new ball field. Sound vaguely familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers may be interested in the relationship between
the ball club and its neighborhood. Pittsfield has fallen on hard
times, having endured its share of economic body blows, like
General Electric pulling up stakes a few years ago. But you do not
hear the local Mets talk trash about the community that has
sustained it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of being out in the community and being a part
of it,'' said Richard Murphy, the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at what our mission statement is,'' he added,
``and that's affordable family entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts turned to Murphy during a rain delay at Yankee Stadium
on Wednesday night (in a so-so seat near the right-field foul pole
that cost $20). It was hard not to contrast his remarks with the
behavior of the Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner III of Tampa,
Fla., who has continued to bad-mouth the Bronx gratuitously despite
the millions he makes there and despite the season-attendance
record his team is close to setting.
</P>
<P>
   Mission? Steinbrenner makes clear that his is not to be part of
a community but rather to take New York City for what he can in his
quest for a new ball park. It certainly isn't to provide affordable
family entertainment, not with his lust for so many luxury boxes
that Yankees baseball risks becoming the preserve of the wealthy
and the corporately connected.
</P>
<P>
   Only George Steinbrenner can add a sour note to this enchanted
season when the Yankees may become the winningest team of the
century. Haven't they already provided enough magic to carry this
city through the bleakest winter? Not to their bilious owner. ``I
really don't care about how many victories we get this year, I
really don't,'' he said last month. ``What I care about is the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, City Hall politicians allowed this man's
ambitions to make a mess of their municipal budget negotiations.
Now, because of him, they are set to clutter the November ballot
with one dubious referendum or another.
</P>
<P>
   This may be as good a time as any to note how generous New York
has already been to the Yankees _ and, for that matter, to the
Mets. Compare that with the city's contract with the U.S. Tennis
Association, a favorable deal for New York even if its
Yankees-adoring mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, does not think so. (No
doubt, it is purely a coincidence that this agreement was reached
by David Dinkins, his tennis-loving predecessor.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, the tennis association has paid the city
$5.3 million in rent for its U.S. Open matches in Flushing Meadows,
compared with $2.1 million paid by the Yankees and $2 million by
the Mets for the use of their stadiums. Bear in mind that the Open,
now under way, lasts a mere two weeks while the regular baseball
season is six months long.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the tennis deal shine is that the Dinkins
administration required the association to pay all maintenance
costs. By contrast, the Yankees and Mets get to deduct those
expenses from their rent bill. And Steinbrenner has not been above
an occasional chisel. Some years, his accounting had the city owing
him money. Once, he tried dunning the city for an engineer who
supposedly worked 168 hours a week. Guess how many hours there are
in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, all this is something New Yorkers may wish to ponder in
the thickening battle over a new playground for the Yankees' owner.
How did the Pittsfield man put it? ``It's a question of being out
in the community and being a part of it.''

HURRICANE POUNDS FLORIDA WITH FLOODS AND TWISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lead graf) (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A hurricane lashed Florida's Panhandle coast with winds
of 80 miles an hour, crossing the coast in the darkness of the
early morning hours and killing two people there and one in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurricane, named Earl, spared the state major damage
before moving into Georgia and the Carolinas as a weaker storm.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed near St. Helena Island in South Carolina
in a tornado spawned by the storm, emergency officials said. In
Florida, the bodies of two fishermen were found off Panama City,
one on a beach near the town and the other 10 miles at sea.
Injuries were few and mostly minor, Florida officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Downgraded to a tropical storm, the storm was traveling through
the southeastern states with sustained winds of 45 miles an hour
and was expected to stay inland through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the size of the storm and how erratic it was, for
the most part we got out pretty well,'' said Ann Rowe, a
spokeswoman with the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Rated as a Category 1 hurricane, the mildest classification,
Earl approached with menacing winds of 100 miles an hour but lost
some of that punch as it went ashore near Panama City, a beach area
of about 35,000 residents that bulges with tourists in the summer.
But it was storm surges of 7 to 12 feet that caused the most
damage, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen counties along the coast south and southwest of
Tallahassee reported heavy beach erosion, damage to more than 1,100
homes, submerged coastal roads and more than 15,000 residents
without electric power. Six counties reported tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who wanted to return home on Thursday after being
evacuated were sometimes blocked by impassable roads. Gov. Lawton
Chiles, who asked the federal government for a disaster declaration
to insure financial aid, said most damage was caused by flooding
and a surge that some residents said was worse than previous
hurricanes that have pounded the area recently. Comprehensive
damage reports were note expected for a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we got quite a bit of water,'' the governor said
at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But state tourism officials said the hurricane caused ``little
to no damage'' to tourist destinations of the Panhandle. Panama
City, Destin, Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach all had reported
favorable conditions for travel during the upcoming Labor Day
weekend, they said, and beaches, golf courses and campgrounds were
open.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was less relaxing in areas like Shell Island, a small
community in Wakulla County, where 26 boats, ranging from small
fishing vessels to large cabin cruisers, washed away from a marina
and were bobbing atop the water in front lawns.

EDITORIAL: CONTRACEPTION, THREE DAYS AFTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In an important advance for women's health, the Food and Drug
Administration has approved the marketing and sale of emergency
contraceptive pills that women can take within three days after sex
to prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, researchers have known that regular
contraceptive pills that are taken daily to prevent pregnancy are
also safe and effective if taken in larger doses as
``morning-after'' pills. Although this practice has been approved
in many European countries, most American doctors offer their
patients no guidance on it, so most women here know nothing about
emergency contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs such as RU-486, emergency contraception pills
cannot end a pregnancy. Instead, they work by preventing ovulation
or by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine
wall. They are thus acceptable to at least some anti-abortion
activists.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1996 that the FDA convened an expert committee
to examine this issue. The agency's action this week will now allow
a drug manufacturer, Gynetics, to package prescription
contraceptive pills into kits specifically for emergency use. Two
pills to be taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex and two
more taken 12 hours later will be about 75 percent effective in
preventing pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   By making this method more widely known, hundreds of thousands
of women may be able to avoid unplanned pregnancies and subsequent
abortions.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It was the question asked most often during the spring: How good is
the Astros' offense?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We knew going in that we would score a lot of runs,'' manager
Larry Dierker recalls. It's time for an update:
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are zeroing in on the club record of 777 runs set a
year ago. Opening a three-game series at Arizona tonight, they need
five runs to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past, the Astros' run production hasn't been limited
to a couple of players. Moises Alou already has 118 RBIs, and two
teammates are threatening to join him in surpassing 100. Never have
the Astros had more than two players top 100 RBIs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on their mood, the Astros have scored early, late
_ and often. Big innings. One run at a time. Somehow, the runs
continue to mount. And with them the wins, including 42
come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dierker points out, ``You can score a ton of runs and
still be a .500 club.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case with the Astros, who lead the National
League Central by 10 games. Through it all, the one constant has
been an offense that has shifted from being two-dimensional into an
eight-headed monster.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams in baseball have as solid a lineup from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Astros would have found it difficult to survive
0-for-4 performances from Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell. But
because of what Dierker calls a ``magnetic`` effect, the Astros
aren't as dependent on their big two. Not that they have slacked
off.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio has the highest average (.329) among every-day starters.
Bagwell is on the way to a third straight season of at least 30
homers and 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell has kept his average above .300 all season and is
approaching 100 RBIs for the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who got a glimpse of Alou during the playoffs last year
had an idea what the Astros were getting when they traded for the
All-Star outfielder. He has punctuated his first go-around in
Houston with 38 home runs and could eclipse Bagwell's club record
of 135 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett began the season in a platoon with rookie Richard
Hidalgo before winning the job outright with a hot June.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of lineup, opposing pitchers have found it tough
to pitch around certain players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of all five of those guys having a bad day are not
good. The chances are a couple will have a good day,'' Dierker
said. ``If they happen to do it the same inning, you've got some
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have enough good hitters, what they'll end up doing is
acting like a magnet for the guys that aren't good hitters. They
draw them into the production line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pittsburgh Pirates and the Big Red Machine (Cincinnati)
used to be like that (in the 1970s),'' Dierker said. ``It seems
like they always had good-hitting teams. They would pick up some
guy from another team that had never been a good hitter, and all of
a sudden the guy is hitting .280 or .300.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the known big guns, there have been some pleasant
surprises. The third-base platoon of Sean Berry and Bill Spiers has
accounted for 16 homers, 86 RBIs and a .296 average. Everett and
Hidalgo _ who sometimes are on the field at the same time _ have
produced 18 homers and 95 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   That type of balance is what sets this team apart, a few Astros
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a team like the Yankees that is really
successful, they don't have somebody hitting 60 home runs on their
team,'' Berry said. ``They have a lot of guys that can hit the ball
out of the ballpark, a lot of guys that get clutch hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we compare better to them _ not a bad team to compare
yourself to.''
</P>
<P>
   The best gauge of how well the offense has clicked is its
ability to produce clutch hits late. The offense has pulled out
victory 22 times in the Astros' last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   They showed Atlanta the late-game thunder Monday. Down two runs
in the ninth inning with John Smoltz dominating on the mound, the
Astros appeared beaten. Instead, six singles off Smoltz and Kerry
Ligtenberg produced a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an offense that can do so much. You just feed off one
another's success,'' Everett said. `` There's really no way to
pitch around our club. You have to go through five quality hitters
before you get to someone that you may say, `I can get this person
out.' By then, it's too late. The lineup is so talented, you can't
make mistakes.''

ANTI-AMERICAN ATTACKS CERTAIN, FBI CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Terrorism is war, and Americans must expect more
and larger attacks and additional U.S. responses against groups
that hate the United States, FBI Director Louis Freeh told a Senate
panel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi
expatriate believed responsible for bombing two U.S. Embassies in
Africa last month, has declared war on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What is less well understood is that his declaration can be
taken literally even though bin Laden is not the leader of another
country, commands no formal army, and holds no particular
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at
the invitation of Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said there is ``some
certainty'' that bin Laden will react with potentially spectacular
violence to the recent U.S. bombing raids on suspected Afghan
terrorist training camps and a Sudanese chemical weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is highly likely to respond with force against
bin Laden's holdings and those of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be no illusions about the fact that (bin
Laden) as recently as May of this year declared war on America,''
Freeh said. ``That is about as serious a threat as I could
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   If new terrorist attacks follow the current trend, it could mean
greater losses of life and higher-profile targets, Freeh said.
Terrorism once meant the hijacking of an airliner; then the bombing
of an aircraft. Now, it often means attacks on large structures and
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers of the World Trade Center, Freeh said, intended to
kill 100,000 people by toppling one tower onto the other. And the
group responsible for introducing sarin gas into the Japanese
subway system intended mass deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the signs and the trends, the public isn't prepared,
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people need to get ready for (increasingly
horrific attacks) and need to do the things necessary to confront
that,'' he said. ``It's absurd we're in for something we're not
ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said the United States needs to devise a stronger and more
consistent ``strategy, not just a policy'' for dealing with
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's administration must account for the
``disparity between public representations of his policy as one of
firmness and the . . . (revelations of a policy) of appeasement,''
Kyl said, citing complaints by Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons
inspector who quit over concerns that the United States allowed
Iraq to circumvent some inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh testified that although terrorist groups are not formally
organized under the flag of an army or country, they are
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 terrorist organizations have been identified by the
FBI in the United States, Freeh said, and there are dozens of other
loose affiliates. The bin Laden group has operatives in the United
States and ``several dozen'' countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because of bin Laden's vast financial resources, his allies have
access to some of the most sophisticated weaponry the world has to
offer, from night-vision technology to chemical weapons, Freeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   To combat these groups and respond to their attacks, the FBI
needs better communications equipment, dedicated aircraft to rush
its agents to crime sites, and the keys to computer encryption
technology developed by American companies.  &QL;

ARE YOU READY FOR NFL OVERKILL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An horrific horde of NFL hors d'oeuvres to chomp on, food for
thought as to why the start of American professional football this
Sunday hasn't been declared a national holiday _ it's just a fluke
that it fits into Labor Day weekend this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ On a spin tour about a month ago before a group of media
groupies in Pasadena, CBS Sports President Sean McManus calmly
proclaimed: ``There is no project in the history of this company _
and not just the history of CBS Sports, but the history of the CBS
Corporation _ that has ever been given more funding, more
attention, more resources or more priority than the relaunching of
the NFL on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the most vital blip on CBS' radar was making sure
Dick Van Dyke was locked into a ``Diagnosis Murder'' contract for
as long as he's physically able to move laterally with a hypodermic
syringe.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Poltrack, CBS's executive vice president in charge of
planning and research, has admitted something crazy: On network
promos alone, CBS has used the equivalent of $150 million in
advertising time just to remind everyone that the NFL is back on
its network.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, all movies today have huge advertising budgets. But keep
in mind, they could have !ital!sold!off! that time and
!ital!made!off! a hundred-and-fifty mil but chose instead to raise
its self-worth and boast about its most recent programming purchase
to anyone who cared.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the past four autumns, KCBS Channel 2 has filled Sunday
afternoon programming with...
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' says station general manager John Culliton. ``A lot
of junk. I know a lot of knives were sold.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part because of the return of the NFL to the network
docket, KCBS' ``Sports Central'' will become the channel's largest
commitment to a sports show.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the NFL season when CBS has just an early game,
``Sports Central'' could run from about 1-to-5 p.m., leaving
co-hosts Jim Hill and Bret Lewis plenty of banter time with
reporter Lisa Guerrero, XTRA's Steve Hartman and former Chargers
concussion-abused quarterback Stan Humphries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Central'' will actually begin with a pre-taped 8-to-9
a.m. show _ a pregame to CBS' ``NFL Today'' pregame _ where the
focus will be on previewing the games shown to L.A. that day and
include some discussion of the gambling lines with the head of the
Caesars Palace sports book.
</P>
<P>
   Culliton admits that without advertising support, the show
couldn't expand to such proportions, both in time commitment and
talent hired. But with the NFL in tow, local advertisers have
climbed over each other to support ancillaries shows like this.
That spills over into the affiliates' other prime-time programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was above and beyond a smart decision for the network,''
said Culliton, whose CBS owned-and-operated affiliate has had to
pay part of the freight for the network's rights fees. ``This
station stands to make a lot more money that it otherwise wouldn't
be making.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means they didn't sell that many knives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some didn't read the fine print in the new NFL agreement until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN pulled off an Olympian feat by locking up the
rights to all NFL highlights shown over the TV airwaves from 10
a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The impact could be felt less by shows like KCBS' ``Sports
Central,'' which has talking heads to fill time, but more with the
three-man staff at Fox's ``Overtime.'' Each can show only six
minutes of game highlights in that time window. Don't be stunned if
``Sports Central'' uses much of that highlight reel time on
Chargers games, with Humphries and Hartman there for local opinion
and CBS established as the AFC network.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net is also limited with highlights in that window.
In the all-roads-lead-to-Disney mentality, the idea is for ESPN to
monopolize the highlights for its ``NFL Prime Time'' show from
4-to-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disney, also trying its darndest to make ``Sunday Night
Football'' seem so much like ``Monday Night Football'' that it even
has Hank Williams Jr. doing a theme song for the ESPN game, hasn't
made much ado about reminding folks that Monday's kickoff will be
at about 5:20 p.m _ or when many L.A. commuters are frantically
trying to find the AM station with Jack Buck and Hank Stram calling
the game on their car radios.
</P>
<P>
   (Clue in: Buck and Stram no longer do MNF calls. And XTRA-AM 690
has the national coverage, if the Valley boundaries allow you to
obtain the signal).
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute-earlier kickoff is clearly to benefit East Coast
prime-time viewers at the expense of the West Coast audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as curious as you are as how this will shake out,'' said
Al Michaels, the only West Coast member (Brentwood) of the MNF
crew. ``For someone who has walked into the house at 6:30 for the
last 26 years, there could be a one-sided game that determines
whether or not to stick with the broadcast. The research department
apparently knows more than we do about it. In my informal polls, I
haven't heard anyone say, `That's too early.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels' poll did not include the greater Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinforcing the idea that enough is never enough, CNN's
one-hour NFL preview show will air at 7 a.m. local time. That'll be
4 a.m. Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's again-expanded two-hour infomercial begins at 8 a.m. and
will have Hootie and the Blowfish as the in-studio band for Week 1.
</P>
<P>
   God bless the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   STATION BREAK
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- ABC's Frank Gifford, relegated to a sports bar in Baltimore
for ``Monday Night Football'' pregame babble, apparently will never
be allowed to live down le affaire. On the cover of the Sept. 7
issue of People magazine, there's Frank and Kathie Lee lumped in
with the Clintons under the headline ``Surviving Infidelity.'' On
the cover of the September issue of Redbook magazine, there's
Kathie Lee smiling under the headline: ``It's been a year since
`it' happened. Here's how she's surviving the worst betrayal a wife
can face....'' Then there's reports Kathie Lee is livid over her
and Frankie's inclusion in a book about to be published titled
``Women Who Stay With Men Who Stray: The Untold Truth About
Infidelity.'' What has her most upset is the book publisher is
Hyperion, which is owned by Disney, which also produces ``Regis and
Kathie Lee'' and still employs Frank. There's the old saying that
there's no such thing as bad publicity. Frankly, Mr. Gifford would
not concur.

   WHAT CHOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Football Network will launch as promised Saturday _ for
just two hours, on large satellite dishes only. From 9-to-10 a.m.,
it'll be on Telstar 5, C-band, Transponder 15 with a Pac-10 preview
show and a show on the San Diego Chargers cheerleaders. Then, from
1:30-to-2:30 p.m., on Transponder 16, it'll be the Notre Dame
coach's press conference from earlier in the week, with a reminder
to watch the Irish opener vs. Michigan on NBC. Maybe we expected
more, but we understand you've got to start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fox's Terry Bradshaw celebrated his 50th birthday Wednesday
promoting Fox football on CBS' ``Late Show with David Letterman.''
Bradshaw's first choice, ``The Magic Hour,'' did not respond to his
request to come on.
</P>
<P>
   -- New ABC ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Boomer Esiason has
a novel approach. His a book entitled ``Toss,'' about to be
published. Boomer admitted to the New York Post that the book is a
little racy and he'll ``probably catch some heat on it, but that's
what you're supposed to do.'' Gifford does not endorse this book,
either.

COWBOYS TO LETT LOOSE ON DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Imagine All-Pro defensive tackle Leon Lett
playing the right side on one play and the left side the next. Or
maybe nose tackle Chad Hennings attacking the center one play, then
dropping into pass coverage on the next.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the preseason talk heading into Sunday's season
opener with the Arizona Cardinals has centered on first-year head
coach Chan Gailey's offense, the Cowboys were also making changes
in their defense. The Cowboys' new alignment will allow Lett to
play various positions, free up end Kavika Pittman to rush the
quarterback and, defensive coordinator Dave Campo hopes, make the
Cowboys stronger against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are better against the run,'' Campo said. ``I like our
speed and ability to get to the football. I think the biggest
question is, Can we get to the passer?''
</P>
<P>
   The alterations feature an alignment shift from the traditional
4-3 (with four down lineman and three linebackers) to an
overshifting 4-3 (that adds a nose tackle) and allows Lett to move
along the line of scrimmage and create mismatches. Lett will
primarily line up on the weak side, away from the tight end, but be
allowed to move to other positions.
</P>
<P>
   The premise in the scheme change, Campo said, is for the tackles
and ends to clog up the line of scrimmage and force the running
backs to the perimeter where Cowboys linebackers Dexter Coakley and
Randall Godfrey can make a majority of the tackles. The changes
also allow the Cowboys to take advantage of Pittman's speed, Campo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman will now play the weakside end position, which the
Cowboys liken to a glorified rush linebacker. First-round pick Greg
Ellis will play strongside end and will line up on the side of the
tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe change\S was done to fit our players abilities,'' Campo
said. ``It gives us a chance to put our best 11 in the best
position possible to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defense's ranking of second in the league last year,
Campo said his unit was not without faults and that the changes
were necessary for the team to rebound from 1997's 6-10
performance. Specifically, the Cowboys needed improvement in run
defense, creating turnovers and third-down defense. They finished
24th, 30th, 18th in the league in those areas respectively last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is pleased with the early results, though he is still
concerned about the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' pass-rushing concerns are serious enough for the
team to consider re-signing retired defensive end Charles Haley and
also negotiate with free-agent linebacker Quentin Coryatt over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
   But even without any more player additions, the Cowboys coaches
and players said they will be better because Lett will be on the
field for a full season. He missed the first 13 games of last
season because of a suspension for violating the NFL's
substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lett joins cornerback Deion Sanders and safety Darren Woodson in
giving the Cowboys three All-Pro caliber defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominating players have to continue to make plays,'' said
defensive line coach Jim Bates. ``And the guys around them have to
be consistent, play their roles, and make plays when they have
their opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the changes could potentially turn Lett into a superstar_
as Campo said it puts Lett in position to be more of a playmaker _
the main goal was aimed at improving the Cowboys run defense first.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings, one of the league's tallest nose tackles at 6-foot-6,
295 pounds, will drop into pass coverage on some zone blitzes. He
said improving against the run was a must. The 1,994 rushing yards
allowed by the Cowboys last season were the most since 1986. The
last nine opponents in 1997 averaged 147.7 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we must stop the run,'' Hennings said.
``That's what everything comes off of. If we stop the run, then you
set yourself up for a good pass rush, fumbles and everything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo agreed. He said creating turnovers and being better on
third-down were byproducts of good run defense. If the Cowboys can
improve against the run, that will keep them from playing more
eight-man fronts and free safeties up for coverage instead of run
support. That could help create more turnovers and improve on their
seven interceptions of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop them and force them to throw the ball in the air,
good things can happen,'' Campo said. ``You've got to stop the run
first.''

MCGWIRE, SOSA BATTER HISTORY INTO CHEAP SEATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead, break it this weekend. Redo history here and now. Do
it in the name of progress. Do it for the good of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this greed-ridden era of baseball desperately needed
something grand, something that could even blow the opening of the
NFL season right off the sporting pages of America.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Does the magical number of 61 have to be surpassed by ``so-sa''
much? By Mark McGwire hitting 70? By Sammy Sosa hitting 67 or 68?
Or who knows, Sosa maybe hitting more than McGwire?
</P>
<P>
   Let that nagging doubt serve as my only regret while the
greatest record in all of sports is about to be ... well, not just
broken, but chopped up like a machete going through sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   Why 1998? The Roger Maris feat of 61 stood for 37 years, while
Babe Ruth's glorious achievement of 60 in a 154-game season was
untouchable for seven decades. Both will be left in the bat dust of
McGwire and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Is the expansion-year pitching that bad? What about today's cozy
major league strike zone that ranges from the belly-bottom to the
top of the fly? Was there a sinister plot this season by major
league honchos to secretly juice the ball -- home runs sell
tickets, and this many home runs sell history?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, please be advised that neither McGwire or Sosa had
the pleasure of facing the Rangers' rotation. That might have meant
another 10 homers apiece.
</P>
<P>
   But due to the excitement and the fury at the top of the Maris
chase, few may have noticed that while the long ball derby of '98
will have two players over 60, there will also be two others over
50, and maybe nine to 10 over 40.
</P>
<P>
   One local baseball purist is Doug Melvin, who knows as much
about the inside history of the game as he does today's players.
And the Rangers' general manager takes pride in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reasons there are this many homers this season, I
don't think that cheapens the accomplishment in any way,'' said
Melvin. ``This year is like the Maris thing in '61, with
expansion-era pitching, the rumors of the ball being wound tighter,
and that stuff. There were a lot of homers in '61 like there are
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I always go back to Ruth, who set the standard for
home runs in his decade \Rthe '20s\S long before he hit 60. No one
was hitting more than 10 and 12 a season, and then one year
\R1920\S he jumped up and hit 54, and then kept going. That, to me,
is the greatest achievement ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Melvin admits he cheers for McGwire and Sosa to
smash history. ``My only regret is the next generation might forget
a Maris or a Ruth,'' he said. ``To them, home-run history will be
all about McGwire and Sosa. Maris should never be just another
footnote in the history books. And, obviously, neither should
Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to current events _ is there any theory involved here
on both McGwire and Sosa being in the National League? The best
sluggers are supposed to be in the other league, where McGwire had
spent a career until late July of 1997. Since going to the National
League he has destroyed bleachers from coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that NL pitchers challenge the power hitters more
than American Leaguers could be helping McGwire. But why then does
he have a chance to set the major-league record for most walks in a
season? That's not challenging him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the league makes no difference for McGwire. Maybe it's
simply a matter of this being the most healthy season he's ever
had, meaning more at bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in McGwire and in Sosa we are seeing hard work and
coaching pay off in the form of both being more selective at the
plate than anytime in their careers,'' said Toney Howell yesterday
from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Howell has had a front-row seat all season to the heroics of
McGwire and Sosa. He's a National League scout for the Rangers, and
two of the six teams he covers are the Cubs and St. Louis. Very few
have personally seen more at-bats this season from both McGwire and
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also happen to know them personally, and I love the attitude
both are showing over the last few weeks,'' said Howell. ``Even
with everything McGwire has been through with the media, he's now
more open and talkative than ever. That is so good for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers did spend about half the season working around
him. Mark took the walks, too. He's disciplined. But lately, the
pitchers have said what-the-heck. I think a lot of these guys want
to try and strike him out. It has made for some great
confrontations, and, yes, for more home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   So many more that the countdown-to-62 begins tonight.

NOT QUITE SAMPRAS  
 LUCKY TO BE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also see TEN-U.S.-OPEN) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At age 18, Marat Safin does not often face someone
younger in a men's tennis tournament. Thursday was an exception,
and when the final 125-mile-an-hour serve had been pummeled, Safin
had given Taylor Dent, 17, a good sense of how much Dent needs to
improve to be competitive in the higher reaches of professional
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play like Sampras, but he's not Sampras for the
moment,'' Safin said of Dent after beating him 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2),
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Safin was referring to Pete Sampras, of course, and to Dent's
voracious appetite for risk. But Safin, a Russian teen-ager who
upset Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten en route to the fourth round
of this year's French Open, also had encouraging words for Dent,
son of the former Australian tennis star Phil Dent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be top 10; maybe not now, but in four
years,'' Safin said. ``He's very young now, and he has not so much
experience. He made a lot of mistakes at the beginning of the
match, but he started to play better in the third set. The first
two, it was so easy. He missed all the balls. But the third was
different. He has unbelievable serve and nice shots, but he's going
for too much. He does not need to go for too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin has been known to get greedy from the baseline himself,
but though he, like Dent, is playing in his first U.S. Open, he is
considerably further along in the developmental, maturation and,
perhaps most important, conditioning process. While the
6-foot-4-inch Safin is built like a whippet and often moves like
one on the court, the 6-3 Dent appears a bit round around the
middle and often appeared a step too slow when Safin stretched him
wide on his forehand. To Dent's credit, he adjusted his tactics in
the third set, taking pace off his ground strokes and his serve in
an attempt to improve his consistency and break Safin's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm just young I guess, and I happen to go off every
so often,'' said Dent, a Californian who turned professional this
week but might still play in next week's junior event. ``But I have
to hand it to the guy. I fought hard. I gave him a chance to mess
up, and he did good.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin was born in Moscow but has lived and trained in Valencia,
Spain, for the last four years. He hits a two-handed backhand as
consistently hard as anyone on tour and, according to Safin's
first-round victim, Magnus Gustafsson, he has a chance to be in the
top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to be there very soon,'' Gustafsson said.
``It depends on his head and who is around him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Safin wants the chance to play Sampras in the fourth round,
he must first get past a man 12 years his senior _ Thomas Muster _
in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   A Fateful Change of Plans
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision one makes in a couple of seconds and because
of those couple seconds, you're alive,'' Marc Rosset said Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset, the 1992 men's Olympic tennis champion from Switzerland,
and his coach, Pierre Simsolo, had booked seats on Swissair Flight
111, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday night,
killing everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday afternoon, Rosset, who had lost in the first
round on Monday at the U.S. Open, decided to stay in New York and
train for at least another day. He and Simsolo canceled their
reservations, and, on Wednesday evening, after a friend in New York
called and told him to turn on the television, Rosset said he
stayed awake most of the night watching television footage of the
crash scene with a mixture of relief and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of emotions,'' Rosset said. ``Really, I should have been
on this plane, and then at the last minute I decided not to, so I
am so happy to have a chance to still be alive. But I am also very
sad for the victims and the families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed the footage of the families waiting at the airport
in Geneva. It just makes your heart hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rosset told a Swiss reporter that his parents called him
from Switzerland, he later said that he called his parents and
several of his friends shortly after he realized what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say they were pretty glad to hear my voice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset said Thursday that he was not sure when he would be ready
to fly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I am going to leave tonight,'' he said. ``I am a
little afraid now. I have had car accidents, yet this is quite a
different thing. But I think there is less chance to die on a plane
than on the streets of New York, and I'm still walking around New
York.''

<P>
   Minerva Bernardino, a major force behind the founding of the
United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and a pioneer
among Latin American feminists, died Aug. 29 in the Dominican
Republic. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernardino, who was appointed a representative of the
Dominican Republic at the United Nations in 1950, was one of only
four women to sign the U.N. Charter in 1945. At the charter
conference in San Francisco, she insisted that the document include
the phrase ``to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms without discrimination against race, sex, condition or
creed.''
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary of Eleanor Roosevelt, whose passions for human
rights she shared, Ms. Bernardino joined Mrs. Roosevelt and three
other women who were delegates to the first U.N. General Assembly
in 1946 _ Jean McKenzie of New Zealand, Evdokia Uralova of the
Soviet Union and Ellen Wilkinson of Britain _ in writing an ``Open
Letter to the Women of the World'' calling on women to take a more
active role in politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   She was vice chairman and then chairman of the Inter-American
Commission on Women from 1944 to 1949, the first regional body set
up to advance the rights of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Bernardino spoke up for women in the aftermath of World
War II, understanding that life for women would never be the same,
`` said Kristen Timothy, deputy director of the U.N. Division for
the Advancement of Women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernardino, born on May 7, 1907, at Seibo in the Dominican
Republic, was the granddaughter of a provincial governor and one of
seven children in a family that was unusually liberal on women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was very progressive and I was reared in an
atmosphere that was, at that time, most unusual in my country,''
she once told The Christian Science Monitor in an interview. Her
father also encouraged her independence.
</P>
<P>
   When she was orphaned at 15, her lack of inhibitions about women
working led her into a career in the civil service. Meanwhile, she
was studying for a bachelor of science degree.
</P>
<P>
   By 1929, she was active in the women's rights movement in the
Dominican Republic, where she was a leader in Accion Feminista
Dominicana, which led the fight for expanded rights in the 1942
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In her long life of fighting for women's and children's rights,
Ms. Bernardino won many honors. In 1995, she was awarded the
Hispanic Heritage Award for excellence in education in Washington.
On the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Commission on the Status of
Women in 1997, she was honored in a speech by Secretary General
Kofi Annan, who called the Commission ``to an important extent her
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernardino was also known in Latin American for her
sustained opposition to strongmen _ she went into what friends
described as self-imposed exile to demonstrate her opposition to
the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in her own country _
and for her work on international panels dedicated to making the
region a zone of peace.

COWBOYS FOCUS ON SIGNING FORMER COLT CORYATT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former Colts linebacker Quentin Coryatt was
expected to visit the Cowboys late yesterday to talk the club about
playing here this season.
</P>
<P>
   But a move to re-sign retired defensive end Charles Haley
appears to have been pushed to the bottom of the club's list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who has an injured pectoral muscle, took a physical in
Chicago on Wednesday. The Bears decided not to sign him. Before
Coryatt was released from the Colts last week, one of his teammates
questioned Coryatt's ability to play with pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably his worst critic because I tell him day in and
day out that we need him,'' Colts linebacker Jeff Herrod told the
``Indianapolis Star-News''. ``I say `Hey, I've got a fractured
wrist, I'm playing and I'm 32.' Quentin has great ability and he
means a lot to this defense; he's just got to play hurt. That's
something I've done my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys scouting director Larry Lacewell said he has reviewed
game tapes of the linebacker and believes the seventh-year player,
who was released by the Colts in a salary cap move last week, is an
impact player.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he remembers Coryatt as an
intense competitor who gave the Steelers' offense fits. It was
Coryatt who knocked out Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart during
a Sunday night game last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quentin is an excellent football player,'' Gailey said. ``I
know what kind of athlete he is. But right now, it's just pure
speculation,'' whether the Cowboys will sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also said the Cowboys' coaching staff has not had
extensive talks about Haley, who had three back surgeries in four
years before retiring from the Cowboys before the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said team owner Jerry Jones ``made mention of it the
other day for about 10 seconds. I've got a whole bunch of other
things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was in New York for much of yesterday for league matters
concerning the Cleveland Browns franchise and was unavailable for
comment. Haley, who would have to pass a physical to play again,
was not signed by the San Francisco 49ers after a brief workout in
Santa Clara, Calif., on Tuesday. Briefly Gailey said defensive
tackle Leon Lett (knee) and end Kavika Pittman (ankle) made it
through practice without re-aggravating injuries. He said he
expects both to start Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Backup safety George Teague, who missed most of Wednesday's
practice with a strained left hamstring, surprised Gailey by
participating in team workouts yesterday. He could still play on
some passing downs Sunday. ``I don't know if he's 100 percent, but
he looks good enough to play,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The club completed its practice squad by signing wide receiver
Anthony Eubanks and offensive lineman Earl Scott. Defensive back
Zebbie Lethridge was signed to the practice squad Wednesday. Team
vice president Stephen Jones said the Cowboys will only have three
players on the practice squad for now.
Cowboys spotlight How much of a difference would re-signing Charles
Haley make?
</P>
<P>
   It would all depend on Haley's health, and how willing he is to
do things the way Chan Gailey wants them done. Haley has been
working out daily since the spring and despite his recent back
surgeries, he could probably pass a Cowboys physical. If the
Cowboys could get 15 plays a game from him, it would help a pass
rush that has been unimpressive this summer. But Haley's past
relationship with Cowboys defensive coaches was thorny sometimes,
and new coach Chan Gailey would not be expected to allow Haley to
upset team chemistry.

TCU REPORTS VIOLATION TO NCAA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU has turned itself in to the NCAA for a
violation in connection with the purchase of former basketball
recruit Brian Brookhart's books, athletic director Eric Hyman said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart's books were mistakenly deducted from the athletic
department budget instead of TCU's general scholarship budget,
Hyman said. According to a receipt obtained by the Star-Telegram,
Brookhart purchased three books for $139.45 on Aug. 21 and then two
more on Aug. 25 for $116.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart renounced his basketball scholarship on Aug. 19 as a
result of a disagreement about TCU's desire for him to enroll in
junior college. As a concession to Brookhart and his family, TCU
administrators agreed to give Brookhart a scholarship for tuition
and books as a part-time student, once his release from the team
was completed.
</P>
<P>
   By going to school part-time, Brookhart can take classes and not
use up any of his collegiate eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, however, prohibits the athletic department from
contributing to any part of Brookhart's scholarship unless it
counts as a men's basketball scholarship. Hyman and provost William
Koehler said the money to pay for the scholarship should come from
institutional aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honest mistake,'' said Hyman. ``But any time
something is charged to the incorrect account and you change it to
the correct account, you have to report that.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA director of enforcement Charles E. Smrt would not confirm
that TCU turned itself in, but said a ``secondary'' violation such
as this is considered minor and that his office normally accepts an
athletic department's recommendation for preventing further
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for a secondary violation can range from no action
to a 20 percent reduction in grants.

EDITORIAL: JANET RENO MAY FINALLY GET IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is belatedly becoming more curious
about the fund-raising abuses in President Clinton's re-election
operation. This week Reno let it be known that she might ask for an
independent counsel to examine the costly television ``issue'' ads
directed by Clinton, and paid for by the Democrats' ``soft-money''
war chest, in a brazen effort to avoid federal contribution and
spending limits on his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Reno is seeing the light, as her people say, or feeling
the heat from Congress, as we suspect, she is moving in the right
direction. But she should get on with appointing an independent
prosecutor to investigate all potential abuses, not just the
limited range she has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's latest action in ordering a preliminary review of the
television ads, disclosed initially by The Wall Street Journal and
The Washington Post, is said to have been based on an audit the
Justice Department subpoenaed from the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, in our view, Reno was feeling pressure from the
Senate and House Judiciary Committees, which also this week got a
look at redacted versions of the internal memos from FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former chief prosecutor for
campaign finance, advising her to step aside in favor of a
prosecutor not beholden to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports have suggested that Reno would ask for a prosecutor
to look into the ads, paid for with unregulated soft money, in the
campaigns of both Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole. That
would be an excellent move bound to have broad political
repercussions. Both the Republican and Democratic campaigns for the
House and Senate are starting to run another round of expensive
ads, once again paid for by soft money raised from special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Launching an investigation into this offensive practice from
1996 would warn both parties that they may be violating the law if
they let these ads proceed outside strict federal fund-raising
limits. It also might prod the Senate to follow the lead of the
House and pass legislation banning soft money altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years Reno has stubbornly blocked an unrestricted
investigation into one of the most corrupt election campaigns in
modern history. Recently she began reconsidering on the narrow
question of whether Harold M. Ickes and Vice President Al Gore may
have lied about their own campaign practices. But there is no need
for more dithering. The attorney general should combine all the
campaign issues, including such excesses as the Democrats'
harvesting of millions of dollars in foreign money, possibly in
return for favors to China, under the jurisdiction of one
independent investigator. It has long been obvious that such a step
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Reno should stop stonewalling and try to salvage her own
reputation and that of the Justice Department.

TEXAS TECH WEATHERS ECONOMIC WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Tech chancellor John T. Montford lately has enhanced his
reputation as a hands-on administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out collaring people on the sidewalks,'' Montford
said, referring to recent university efforts to boost ticket sales
for tomorrow night's season-opening football game against UT-El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Montford well might find more truth than fiction
in his jest. He is not a reluctant solictor. But few can argue that
the university's strong region-wide marketing push of the past
month _ fueled by an anonymous $200,000 gift _ has turned midsummer
concern into optimism around an athletic department that is
financially challenged because of recent NCAA problems and a
region-wide economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's athletic ticket office had moved only about 20,000
tickets for UTEP just a few weeks ago. Ticket manager Russell
Warren now says with an expected active game-day purchase, he
anticipates a crowd of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when it's all said and done that our
\Rfootball-generated\S revenue is going to be as good as or better
than it was last year,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is profoundly important to a department confronted by
millions of dollars in expenses and lost revenue because of an NCAA
investigation and subsequent sanctions. Included on the debit sheet
are a forfeited $1.75 million share of Big 12 bowl revenue,
approximately $1.5 million in internal audit and lawyer's fees and
the eventual loss of more than $1 million from the
conference-shared pot of NCAA Tournament-generated basketball
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic department last year operated under a 15 percent
expenditure cut from a $13 million budget. Athletic director Gerald
Myers says the department will again operate under a
yet-to-be-determined percentage slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chancellor who says he is not concerned about his athletic
department budget is suspect,'' Montford said. ``But from a
preliminary look at the numbers. ... we frankly made it fine last
year. And I guess I would say I'm cautiously optimistic we'll do
well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is markedly different from that of midsummer. The
1998 Texas drought will take a heavy fiscal toll when totals are in
from the October cotton harvest. That economic hit is compounded by
the eventual loss of some 600 jobs as a result of a Texas
Instruments plant closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this summer, we were extremely concerned about the
economic factors,'' Warren said. ``The TI closing was a factor, but
the majority of it had to do with the cotton crop. Because out
here, everything goes the way cotton goes. And we had a sense of
urgency as to how we were going to combat this.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic department officials formulated a marketing plan.
Montford secured the donation that spawned a campaign that included
60-second television spots and billboards throughout the South
Plains region. Montford appeared in the spots along with Tech
president Donald Haragan, Myers and head coach Spike Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   Montford and Haragan also put their money where their mouths
were. They and health and sciences center president David R. Smith
donated $20,000 toward purchase of 4,000 UTEP tickets that have
been offered to faculty and staff for $5 apiece. Tech's strong
legion of supporters has also responded. Myers says Red Raider Club
donations of more than $1 million are up approximately $50,000 over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans, our boosters and our alumni have all stuck with
us,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Warren estimates season-ticket purchases are down
approximately 5 percent, he says individual-game tickets are moving
_ in part because of response to selective promotional packages
offered individuals and local corporate partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out here tend to rise to the occasion,'' Montford said.
``I've been out here since 1971, and Lubbock as well as the South
Plains is pretty resilient. It seems like we rebound pretty well in
these downturn cycles. And in an agriculturally based economy, you
get used to those.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the economic situation nor NCAA problems has affected
response to the seat-option purchase plan for the United Spirit
Arena, which is scheduled to open for spring '99 graduation
ceremonies. That program has taken in more than $5.3 million,
according to program administrator and assistant AD Joe Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen any change in the buying habits of our fans,''
Hornaday said. ``The entertainment dollar out here is such that
people may be a little more particular where they spend it, but
athletics is such a high priority that most people feel comfortable
in continuing to support the various programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA investigation has had almost no impact that I can
tell. In part, that's because this is a 10-year commitment and
people knew the NCAA stuff would be over early in the program and
they wanted to go ahead and wrap up good seats for the future.''

JETER'S SEASON NOT WASTED ON YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whenever Derek Jeter's name is announced, whenever he
gets another pivotal hit or whenever he makes another slick
fielding play, the reaction is much different than it is for other
Yankees. For others at Yankee Stadium, there are roars. But for
Jeter, there are squeals. They escalate as if Jeter were a singer
with the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The young fans, especially young girls, marvel at Jeter. They
adore him because he is young and handsome, because he plays
shortstop for the Yankees and because he even chats with fans from
the on-deck area.
</P>
<P>
   Do not let the squealing obscure how important Jeter is to the
Yankees. Even the smartest baseball scout might squeal after
watching Jeter play. It sounds cliche, but the 24-year-old Jeter
keeps improving every day. It is not cliche to reason that Jeter is
as valuable a player as the record-setting Yankees have.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that raises another question. If Jeter is the most
valuable Yankee _ and it probably is either Jeter or Bernie
Williams during this special season _ could the shortstop also be
the most valuable player in the American League? It is an arduous
question because there are several worthwhile candidates, like
Williams, Boston's Nomar Garciaparra or Mo Vaughn and Texas' Juan
Gonzalez. Still, Jeter definitely belongs in this discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would love to be the MVP,'' Jeter said. ``I think a
lot of guys on this team could be MVP. We have a lot of guys who
have done well this season. Regardless of what your numbers are, we
have a lot of guys having great seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Jeter handles questions about personal accomplishments
the way he might react to swallowing vinegar. He looks at his feet,
utters something about not being perfect until he bats 1.000 and
makes no errors and shifts the focus to the Yankees. Jeter has been
this modest since his 1996 rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter embraced a discussion about the MVP long enough to
thrust support behind his type of player. While not necessarily
pushing himself for MVP, Jeter argued that the award should not
simply be given to a player who has the gaudiest numbers and
stressed the value of intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering to have your name mentioned,'' said Jeter, who
is second in the league with a .335 average, and also has 17
homers, 73 runs batted in, a league-high 111 runs scored and 25
stolen bases. ``I'm not going to hit 50 homers or have 180 RBIs.
Not too many people can do that. But you can work on the little
things and the things that are valuable to your team. For me, it's
moving a guy over, bunting and playing defense. A lot of people
look at homers and RBIs as the only thing that's important, and
that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Jeter mentioned how shortstop Barry Larkin won the award
with Cincinnati in 1995 while hitting .319 with 15 homers, 66 RBI
and 51 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``MVP is the most valuable player,'' Jeter said, ``not
necessarily the player who had the best numbers or had the best
year.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Torre was asked about the MVP, the first name that
spilled out of his mouth was Jeter, then Williams, who leads the
American League with a .341 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it tough with our ball club is we've had so many
players contribute, there will be a splitting of the votes,'' Torre
said. ``All of a sudden, the guy with the best numbers gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that might be Gonzalez (.306, 39 homers, a major
league-best 144 RBI), Garciaparra has incredible statistics for a
shortstop (.324, 30 homers, 110 RBI) and is probably the
front-runner to win. Or will Vaughn, the soul of the Red Sox and a
.331 hitter with 34 homers, snag more votes? What about Williams, a
center fielder and integral switch-hitter with 21 homers and 83
RBI?
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeter what he needs to improve on and he responds like a
high school senior addressing a college coach. He wants to run the
bases better, reduce his strikeouts, boost his on-base percentage,
cut down on his errors and belt 30 homers. Most important, the MVP
candidate wants to continue hearing squeals until the Yankees win
another ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can have a better season than when we won the
World Series in 1996 is to do it again,'' Jeter said. ``Regardless
of what we do in the regular season, unless we win the World Series
again, it's not going to be very rewarding.''

NEW JERSEY SEEKS TO LURE AMEX AND NASDAQ 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ State officials are involved in talks intended to
woo the nation's second- and third-largest stock exchanges out of
New York City and into a new home in New Jersey, an economic
development official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Lisa Kruse, who is the vice president for
marketing and development for the New Jersey Commerce and Economic
Growth Commission, confirmed unattributed reports in The Newark
Star-Ledger on Thursday that the state was talking to the
computerized Nasdaq Exchange and the American Stock Exchange about
a possible move to New Jersey. She would not disclose the locations
involved, but the published reports said that Jersey City and
Hoboken had been mentioned as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both exchanges, which are working out the final
details of the merger that their members approved three months ago,
would not comment on whether they were involved in any talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Nasdaq has 3,100 employees in New York City,
Washington and its suburbs and Trumbull, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old American Stock Exchange, which has 600 employees
and 1,500 traders, is spread over three lower Manhattan locations.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Smith, executive vice president of Hartz Mountain
Industries, a developer of office space along the Hudson River and
elsewhere in the state, said he had no knowledge of such talks, but
he added that he was not surprised at the reports. All the
exchanges have expressed a need for new and larger sites, and now
New Jersey seems to have an edge over New York when it comes to the
cost and availability of office space, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, the savings of New Jersey over New York were
substantial, and it appears that we may be approaching that kind of
era again,'' Smith said. ``Every businessman, it seems to me, has
to periodically address the cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the talks comes on the heels of reports in May that
New Jersey was trying to interest the New York Stock Exchange in
moving. Over the years, New Jersey has been a perennial option, but
it has lost out more than it has won; in many cases it appears that
companies used the threat of moving to New Jersey to wring more
incentives out of New York City and state officials.

   NEW YORK _ When Swissair Flight 111 plunged into the inky waters
off Nova Scotia Wednesday night, it took an uncommon number of
lives of dogged humanitarianism. It claimed a tireless battler
against the scourge of AIDS and researchers perched on the
seemingly fathomless frontiers of science.
</P>
<P>
   It took a contingent of U.N. workers settled into a flight as
familiar and reassuring to them as the evening commuter train,
people who intrepidly hopscotched across the tender borders of
war-torn nations but met their end near a tranquil fishing village.
But most starkly it visited heartache on a dozen countries on two
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The cold statistics of the disaster were merciless. All 215
passengers and 14 crew members on the plane bound for Geneva from
Kennedy Airport in New York died.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger roster was something of a kaleidoscope of the
world's nations. Swissair said there were 136 passengers from the
United States, 30 from France and 28 from Switzerland. A half-dozen
came from Britain, three from Italy and three from Germany. There
were two passengers from Greece mixed in with solitary travelers
from Saudia Arabia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Spain, Iran, St. Kitts
and Nevis, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Air disasters rarely excuse anyone. Two of the victims were mere
infants. One man was bumped off two other flights that night before
getting a seat on the one that would never land.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, Swissair had not yet released the
passenger manifest of Flight 111, as officials continued the grim
task of notifying relatives. However, colleagues and relatives
confirmed the identities of some of those who boarded the doomed
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, who helped shape the international campaign
against AIDS, was traveling on the flight with his wife, Dr. Mary
Lou Clements, to attend AIDS-related meetings in Geneva. A public
health physician, he founded the Global Program on AIDS in 1986 for
the World Health Organization. In 1990, he resigned in bitter
protest against WHO's failure to move faster, and recently he
became the first dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clements was an epidemiologist and vaccine expert who headed
the center for immunization research at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Hygiene and Public Health. Both she and her
husband were 51 and lived in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gostin, a director of the Georgetown University-Johns
Hopkins University Program on law and public health who knew Mann
for some 20 years, remembered Thursday how he had accompanied Mann
on the first day he entered the WHO building in Geneva: ``It was
literally Jon and one Swiss secretary. He built that program within
a matter of years to be, by far, the largest disease- prevention
program in the history of the WHO. That alone, his mobilization of
the world against AIDS, is his greatest legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Mann, one of Mann's daughters, is a student of Gostin's at
Georgetown University Law Center. Gostin said he spoke to her only
hours before the crash and she mentioned that her father was
contemplating moving overseas to reapply his zeal to international
work.
</P>
<P>
   To workers at the United Nations, the nightly Flight 111 was
affectionately known as the U.N. airbus because it served as
something of a commuter flight for officials and diplomats
shuttling back and forth between the secretariat in New York and
the European headquarters in Geneva. ``This is a flight that so
many of us take routinely that I think it spooked a lot of us,''
said Fred Eckhard, the U.N.'s senior spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Few Swissair 111 flights lift off without at least a few U.N.
people buckled into their seats. And thus as soon as U.N. workers
learned the flight number, they knew that some of their people were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials identified seven staff members or associates,
including Mann, as having perished in Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of all the
victims, and in particular to the relatives and friends of all
those who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the
United Nations,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan from
Durban, South Africa, where he was attending the summit meeting of
nonaligned nations.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included Pierce Gerety, 56, an American lawyer who
had devoted his life to the plight of refugees. Only an unlikely
convergence of events put him on the plane. According to his
brother, Tom Gerety, president of Amherst College, he had a ticket
for a KLM flight to Amsterdam. It was overbooked and he was bumped
along with some others. He was put on a Swissair flight. It was
canceled. His consolation was a ticket on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of operations for the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees in the ravaged Great Lakes region of Central Africa,
including Rwanda, Gerety seemed to spend more nights in tents with
refugees than he did in his own home. Wherever war, famine and
social unrest uprooted people from their homes, he was there. Time
and again, he stared death in its face and scared it off.
Associates said he was shot at, narrowly evaded bombs and never
shied from jumping aboard a rickety plane for a perilous flight
into the bush. They could only wonder how he could die in the
comfort of a gleaming commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, 37, a French social worker and therapist
who worked as senior welfare officer in the Geneva headquarters of
the refugee unit, also died in the crash. She had counseled
refugees in Bosnia, Mali and Rwanda, and had transferred to Geneva
in June so she could spend more time with her husband and baby.

COWBOYS MUST TAKE GAMBLES LIKE CORYATT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were two things working against that foolhardy notion of
Charles Haley returning to the Cowboys' fold:
</P>
<P>
   A bulging disk and a big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Both, as it turned out, have been detrimental to Haley's NFL
career, though the official stance at Valley Ranch has always been
that Planet Haley was an amiable, semi-cooperative sort.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   As Owner Jones indicated Wednesday, the Cowboys didn't think it
was anybody's best interests for the Planet Haley to resume his
local orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the guy apparently can still play _ he can still rush the
quarterback on scattered downs. But he can't practice. And maybe by
December, when a team would really need him, Haley wouldn't be able
to bend over to tie his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Is he worth the trouble, not to mention the expense?
</P>
<P>
   No, and Owner Jones agrees. Which means whatever money the
Cowboys can jiggle free from the NFL salary cap can go to
linebacker Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want to take a look at the former Texas Aggie
headhunter, who was officially declared a $19.5 million bust in
Indianapolis earlier this week. They want to take a closer look at
the once-torn pectoral muscle that he says still hurts him, but
that left the Colts doubting.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to his job interview here, Coryatt reportedly did not
pass medical muster with the Chicago Bears. It should give pause to
all loyal Cowboys fans. The Bears, after all, are in a position to
refuse no one, unless he has a note from the coroner.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what the Cowboys have had to resort to in the wake
of Broderick Thomas' season-ending knee injury in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt should not be considered a pass-rush specialist. The man
has 8 1/2 sacks in six NFL seasons _ more than $2 million per sack.
But the Cowboys apparently think Coryatt could help at the outside
linebacker spot and allow them to move Randall Godfrey inside.
</P>
<P>
   You do what you have to do. Not all that long ago, the Cowboys
dealt from a full deck. But free agency and their self-imposed
salary-cap stranglehold have made them 11th-hour scramblers, just
like the Bears, Giants, Redskins and, egads, even the proud 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Just wondering, but what do you suppose was really going on
inside 49ers quarterback Steve Young's oft-flogged head Wednesday
when he learned that Haley had been in for a visit? Wasn't it Haley
who dedicated an entire chapter in his autobiography (Haley, a
writer?) to saying Young couldn't hold Joe Montana's Jockey shorts?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it Haley who bathed, so to speak, his exit from San
Francisco by relieving himself on a teammate's car tires?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the proud 49ers franchise must have had to swallow hard
just to let the Planet Haley back on the grounds, albeit for a
brief workout. But you do what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's case, there is a troubling lack of depth in
the defensive line. The 49ers have had draft problems. Younger,
stronger backs have come and some have gone _ Tim Harris? Todd
Kelly? _ but the 49ers have never really replaced Haley.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys can attest, even the proudest of teams can make
drafting mistakes. With the release this week of Stepfret Williams
and Steve Scifres, the Cowboys symbolically admitted again that
their recent drafts have been cluttered with mistakes. There is no
one to show from the 1993 draft. The only one left from the 1994
draft is Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   So a team does what it has to do. It looks to a Coryatt, hoping
there is something left in the tank of a once-lofty draft choice
whose career may have turned perpetually south. Bad pectoral muscle
and all.
</P>
<P>
   In Coryatt's case, the gamble is one that a team coming off a
6-10 season must take.

 UNDATED: in Geneva. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two officials with UNICEF were on the flight. Yves de Roussan, a
Canadian, worked with adolescents who were abandoned or ran afoul
of the law and was UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and
Eastern Europe. Ingrid Acevedo, 32, an American who was director of
public relations for UNICEF's U.S. National Committee, was on her
way to attend a meeting to plan for an annual communications
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   As an expression of mourning, all 185 flags of the U.N.'s member
states were taken down Thursday at the U.N. complex perched along
the East River in midtown Manhattan. The blue and white U.N. flag
was lowered to half-staff in both New York and in Geneva. A
memorial service was planned in Geneva for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had its share of chronic fliers. It was small wonder
that Norman Scoular was on a plane flight Wednesday night. Last
year, in carrying out the demands of business, he spent 337 nights
in hotel rooms. Scoular, 45, a Scottish-born resident of
Manchester, England, was the chief executive of Sylvania Lighting
International, which had been recently acquired by SLI Inc. of
Canton, Mass., and of which he had become chief operating officer.
After meeting with SLI officials, he had boarded Flight 111 to go
to Geneva to shut down an office there.
</P>
<P>
   Don Scheer was a 49-year-old biochemist from Norfolk, Mass., who
journeyed the globe promoting his discoveries. He was in fact
tiring of the travel and Tuesday night told his brother, Jerry,
that after one more trip to Europe to tout a product he designed to
separate DNA strands, he was going to sink into his couch, flick on
his 35-inch television and scream his lungs out for the Cleveland
Indians, the team he loved. Scheer took Flight 111 with his wife,
Diane. He was going to Budapest and then planned to join her in
Greece for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the Indians stunk and weren't going anywhere, but
that was his team,'' said Jerry Scheer, laughing for a minute as he
remembered that last conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved sports,'' Jerry Scheer said. ``We talked about
college football coming up. We talked how on Thanksgiving we were
going to watch three football games in a row. And then I told him,
``Have a safe trip.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., said that it
lost both a physicist and a guest researcher in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Kinder-Geiger, 36, a German citizen who was an associate
theoretical physicist at the laboratory, was on his way to Trento,
Italy, where he was to speak at a physics workshop. He then planned
to continue his work at a particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Per Spanne, 53, a Swedish citizen, was a guest researcher at
Brookhaven's Synchrotron Light Source facility. His career was
rooted in finding new ways to use X-rays to diagnose disease and
for high-resolution imaging of objects. He helped pioneer a
technique known as phase-contrast microtomography that allows
detailed images of the interior of solid objects.
</P>
<P>
   As is always true with international flights, even in the last
gasps of summer, some of the passengers were bound for pleasure.
John Mortimer, 75, a former executive of The New York Times, had
boarded the flight with his wife, Hilda, 69, on their way to a
vacation in the south of France. Mortimer had joined The Times in
1962 as the paper's industrial relations manager and held several
positions, including senior vice president for personnel and
industrial relations. In 1982, he was named assistant to the
president of New York Times Co. He retired in 1983. Mrs. Mortimer
was on the staff of various non-profit organizations engaged in
education exchange and other international issues. They lived in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Nelson was on Flight 111 to carry out a good deed and for
love. She was to meet her boyfriend, Edward Fierastale, in Geneva.
They were then traveling to Grenoble, where he was going to propose
to her and she was going to help her sister, Judy, nine months
pregnant, give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson, 35, was a naturopathic doctor who spurned drugs in
favor of natural agencies like herbs and sunshine. She recently
closed her practice in Mystic, Conn., and was about to open an
office in Manhattan, where her parents live. ``You couldn't get an
appointment with Tara,'' said her mother, Sheila, who was in tears.
``It would take six months. She was so successful. And she met her
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster inevitably has its other side, those individuals whose
moments of vacillation saved their lives. Marc Rosset, 27, the
Swiss tennis player, told reporters at the U.S. Open that he was
booked on the doomed Flight 111 after his first-round defeat forced
his early departure from the tournament. Not long before he was due
at the airport, he said he chose to stay one more day to get in
some practice with the top-level hitting partners available at the
tournament.

NBA LOCKOUT ILLEGAL, UNION SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basketball players' union contends that there is no
stipulation in the contracts of the 225 players who have guaranteed
salaries that enables National Basketball Association owners to
lock them out without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The owners' response is that a clause in the NBA's last
collective bargaining agreement, signed in 1995, allowed the owners
to shut down business and reopen the agreement if the players made
more than 51.8 percent of the league's basketball-related income in
a season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, player salaries accounted for roughly 55 to 57
percent of such income.

USC'S JACKSON MAY GET HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Redshirt junior Jabari Jackson has been nearly
invisible since he arrived at USC last season. But with tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie out for the season with a knee injury, Jackson
might emerge as a candidate for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild card is Jabari Jackson,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said, while assessing the tailback situation. ``He's going to get a
shot in the single- and two-back offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was a junior-college All-American at San Francisco,
considered transferring last season but said he feels ready to
compete at the tailback position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely all know somebody has to step up,'' Jackson
said. ``I'm going to try to make it be myself. I feel I've worked
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is officially grouped with Frank Strong as the No.3
tailback, behind starter Chad Morton and No.2 Petros Papadakis.
</P>
<P>
   With freshman Sultan McCullough now looking like the No.5 back,
it has probably become the deepest position on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Denmon, Douglas miss practice: Neither offensive linemen Rome
Douglas nor Eric Denmon attended practice Thursday because of
``family issues,'' according to Hackett. Denmon flew to Texas to be
with his grandfather, who is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be back Tuesday,'' said Hackett, who said both were
excused from practice.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen happy: Freshman defensive end Ryan Nielsen from Royal
High got his first career start against Purdue, and once he got
over the initial surprise of starting, he felt he did fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. I was in so fast, I didn't have a chance to get
excited (about starting),'' Nielsen said. ``I did all right. I
played about what I expected. I was pleased with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Low profile for Palmer: Even with all the media attention
focused on Carson Palmer after his big game against Purdue, the
freshman has managed to avoid being caught up in the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer doesn't have a phone yet at his apartment. He moved his
furniture into his apartment this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have a TV yet,'' he said. ``I'm out of touch with
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Big-time bed check: Some players were stunned last Saturday
night, when the 11 p.m. curfew check was personally enforced by
Hackett, who visited every player's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never have imagined John Robinson coming in for a
bed check,'' wide receiver R. Jay Soward said. ``But coach
Hackett's a very believable person.''
</P>
<P>
   No practice: Hackett decided to cancel practice today and give
the team a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have a game, lethargic might be the best way to
go,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen update: Hackett said he would like to have offensive
tackle Ken Bowen (hyperextended elbow) back by Sunday. Hackett said
Bowen would be the reserve right tackle, behind sophomore Brent
McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas remains the reserve left tackle behind Matt Welch.
Offensive guard Travis Claridge and Welch missed practice Thursday
because of soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano left practice with an ankle sprain, but
it was not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lawrence Larry (Littlerock), who played against
Purdue, has also been sitting out to rest his sore ankle.

HOLYFIELD SAYS HE WAS ASKED TO HELP TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield said Thursday that he was
approached by a member of the New Jersey State Athletic Control
Board in July and urged to write a letter in support of Mike
Tyson's getting a license to fight in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield would not identify the board member and was sketchy in
describing the details of what had been asked of him. But it was a
curious admission by the World Boxing Association and International
Boxing Federation heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what it should say, and I signed the letter,''
Holyfield said at a luncheon in Manhattan to promote his Sept. 19
fight against Vaughn Bean in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson withdrew his application to the New Jersey board one day
before it was to render a decision and immediately filed for
reinstatement in Nevada, which had revoked his license to fight
last year. A hearing is scheduled there on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Phone messages to the offices of the New Jersey board were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Tyson, Anthony Fusco Jr., presented a letter signed
by Holyfield at the July 29 hearing before the board. The letter
said that Holyfield did not have any objections to Tyson's
receiving a license despite the incident in the championship bout
in Las Vegas, Nev., on June 28, 1997, in which Tyson bit
Holyfield's ears. The Nevada State Athletic Commission revoked his
license and fined him $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said Thursday that he was willing to fight Tyson
again, but did not think such a bout would happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour talk with reporters, Holyfield was sympathetic to
Tyson's problems, which worsened this week when two men filed
assault charges against Tyson following a traffic accident in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson will be back,'' Holyfield said. ``And he's going to whip
everybody out there, except me.''

<P>
   As relatives of passengers aboard Swissair Flight 111 filed into
the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy International Airport in New York
on Thursday and huddled in a private conference room to wrestle
with their grief, the scene carried poignant echoes of July 1996,
when families reeling from the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight
800 gathered under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar sense of astonishment over what had
happened. There was a similar hunger to know how and why.
</P>
<P>
   But to help relatives deal with the shock of Wednesday's crash,
Swissair and Delta, the U.S. carrier through which some passengers
had booked their tickets, flooded both the Ramada in Queens and the
airport in Geneva with airline officials, grief counselors and
clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines seemed intent on avoiding the fury that TWA
drew from some relatives and politicians for taking too long to
confirm Flight 800's passenger list and not tending aggressively
enough to families' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of New York City's Office of Emergency
Management, said there was ``no comparison'' between the actions of
Swissair and Delta and those of TWA two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an extraordinary amount of care and attention
paid to the details, which can make a horrendous situation that
much more horrendous,'' Hauer said Thursday. ``I've seen questions
get answered, and I've seen needs get met quickly, efficiently and
with great compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   But even such painstaking accommodations could do little to
assuage survivors' sorrow. At the Geneva airport, as the passenger
list was read out loud Thursday, relatives hearing the names of
loved ones broke into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there,'' one person blurted out. ``Oh, my God.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conference room in the Ramada, the somber atmosphere was
interrupted at one point by a woman's uncontrollable screaming.
Darren Mudge, a Salvation Army officer who was there, said she was
quickly taken out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing can become contagious, because everyone is
right there, on the edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who stormed television news programs in
1996 to attack TWA, offered Swissair and Delta nothing but praise
at a press conference early Thursday evening at the Ramada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have handled this exceptionally well from the
beginning,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 111 went down on Wednesday around 9:30 p.m. EST, and by
1:10 a.m. Thursday, according to a spokesman for Swissair, the
airline was providing information on the identity of passengers to
relatives over a special telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it took nearly 20 hours for TWA to provide a
passenger manifest to New York City officials who repeatedly
requested one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ed Merlis, a senior vice president with the Air Transport
Association, a trade group that represents U.S. airlines, said the
Family Assistance Act, a federal law passed in 1996 in response to
criticisms leveled against TWA, compels airlines to work as quickly
as possible to release passenger lists following crashes. Although
it applies only to crashes in the United States, he said, most
airlines have adopted that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair and Delta also hurried to make flight arrangements for
relatives who wanted to fly to Halifax, Nova Scotia, near the site
of the crash. Charter flights from both Geneva and Newark were
scheduled to arrive there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, relatives were assisted by clergy members from the
city's religious community, and by psychologists and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim cleric, Ouardiri Hafid, described the gathering of
families as one of ``great dignity, great silence.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, counselors at the Ramada outnumbered relatives
3-to-1; many had rushed automatically to the hotel as soon as they
heard about the crash because they remembered the important role
they had played for relatives in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some relatives of the passengers aboard TWA Flight
800 began making plans to travel to Halifax to offer support to the
newly grieving mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, who would
be gathering there.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Becker of St. Petersburg, Fla., whose 19-year-old
daughter, Michele, was killed aboard Flight 800, said late Thursday
night that the Flight 800 families were merely awaiting assurance
from Delta that they would be able to see the relatives of
passengers who died on Swissair Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Those relatives would be experiencing an agonizing ordeal, he
said, recalling the loneliness and confusion he felt in 1996.
``You're thinking that you're totally isolated and that something's
wrong with you,'' Becker said in a telephone interview. ``It still
comes and goes.''

 McCAUGHEY ROSS' MONEY PROBLEMS MAY HURT LIBERAL PARTY  
 (With NY-ROSS-CAMPAIGN)  
 (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The financial problems hobbling the gubernatorial
campaign of Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross are also threatening the
viability of the New York state Liberal Party, which has staked its
future on her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The party chose Ms. McCaughey Ross as its candidate last spring
after concluding that she was its best bet to draw 50,000 votes in
the general election, a threshold that would allow the Liberals to
meet the legal requirement for retaining a place on the ballot for
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a boon to the party that Ms. McCaughey Ross' husband
_ Wall Street financier Wilbur Ross _ pledged to spend millions of
dollars to underwrite her quest.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal nomination was an important victory for Ms.
McCaughey Ross, guaranteeing her a spot on the November ballot even
if she lost the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   But considerable doubt was cast Thursday on Ms. McCaughey Ross'
prospects of either winning the Democratic primary Sept. 15 against
three other major candidates or having a strong showing on the
Liberal Party line in November. After weeks of speculation, she
announced that her husband had taken back most of the roughly $4
million he had donated to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party's longtime leader, Raymond Harding, seemed
unfazed by the news. He predicted that even without the money, Ms.
McCaughey Ross would draw at least 50,000 votes on the Liberal
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am perfectly content with the situation the way it is,''
Harding said. ``We support her fully and expect her to wage a
vigorous campaign right through Nov. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   But people who follow state politics said the financial loss
could mean trouble for Harding, who has led the Liberal Party for
most of the last 20 years and whose political influence could be
sharply diminished if Ms. McCaughey Ross loses badly in November.
</P>
<P>
   Without a large campaign war chest, Ms. McCaughey Ross is
unlikely to do well in the Democratic primary, they said. And
without a strong showing in the primary, the lieutenant governor is
unlikely to win many votes on the Liberal line in November.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   ``She can't get it without the money,'' said former Gov. Mario
Cuomo, a Democrat who drew 92,000 votes on the Liberal line in 1994
despite losing the general election to Republican challenger George
Pataki. ``Money is just about the sine qua non.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party's choice of Ms. McCaughey Ross strained
relations between the party and Democrats, which have been tense
since 1989, when the Liberal Party began supporting New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have complained that the party embraced Ms.
McCaughey Ross, who was a Republican until last year, only because
she was a woman and had promised to spend a considerable amount of
money on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ms. McCaughey Ross announced her financial problems
Thursday, rumors were swirling that Harding was eagerly seeking a
new candidate. But Harding on Thursday described the rumors as
``disinformation.'' He pointed out that under state election law,
party nominees can be replaced only if they die, receive federal
judgeships or move out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is silly season,'' he said. ``People will say anything
during the early periods of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding said it was unfortunate that so much attention had been
paid to Ms. McCaughey Ross' money problems. But, he added, the
focus on Ms. McCaughey Ross' finances was a sign that the campaigns
of the three Democratic candidates _ New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, former state Transportation Commissioner James
Larocca and Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   Harding said his party would work hard to raise money for Ms.
McCaughey Ross this fall. He had planned to do that anyway, he
said, because the donation from Ms. McCaughey Ross' husband was to
be spent only on the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harding said, Ms. McCaughey Ross should stop talking
about money and focus on issues like education and health care.
``The reason the Liberal Party nominated her is her close
identification with certain issues,'' he said, ``and she has been
faithful to those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he did not think the Liberal Party could raise much
money for Ms. McCaughey Ross. But he added that he would not be
surprised if Ross put a significant amount of money back into his
wife's campaign after the primary _ even if she is running only as
a Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to conclude that if he doesn't spend it now, he
won't spend it in November,'' Cuomo said. ``Nothing would surprise
me.''

AT SARATOGA, 2-YEAR-OLDS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Some of the most accomplished and most
ambitious 2-year-old horses in the country will try to pass
milestones on the road to juvenile championships in the next two
days when Saratoga stages two Grade I stakes for beginners: the
Spinaway on Friday for fillies and the Hopeful on Saturday for
colts.
</P>
<P>
   The races mark the third and final stakes in Saratoga's cycle
for juveniles, and they are the richest in money and career values,
each with a purse of $200,000, each at seven furlongs, each filled
with history. In this decade alone, four Spinaway winners have gone
on to win the juvenile championship: Meadow Star in 1990, Flanders
in 1994, Golden Attraction in 1995 and Countess Diana in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year's class strikes most observers as somewhat softer in
talent, but the Spinaway could give a substantial boost to the
credentials of the favorite, Things Change, who won the Adirondack
last month in only the third start of her career. Her trainer,
Linda Rice, has posted a high-yield record with five winners in 15
starts at Saratoga this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things Change is coming into this race in great shape,'' Rice
reported. ``Based on the numbers for her last race, she should move
forward.''

TEXAN HELPS RESURRECT MISSOURI FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (One of a series) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri safety Caldrinoff Easter doesn't have to go far when he
yearns to talk to somebody from home _ he goes to football
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston native is one of 13 Texans on the Tigers' roster.
Twice that number are found at fellow Big 12 member Oklahoma, but
Missouri's Lone Star State contingent is second only to the 58
Missourians who wear the black and gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how nice it is to have these other guys up
here,'' said Easter, a strong safety with a reputation as a big
hitter who is scheduled to start his 23rd consecutive game tomorrow
night against Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came up here \R1995\S, I was one of the only
\RTexans\S up here. Really, being a Texas guy, at first I didn't
even know where Missouri was on the map. It was a hard adjustment,
but I played through it. And having other Texans up here supports
my bragging. Because I've been telling people up here all along
what Texans can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Easter needn't have wasted his time with fifth-year Missouri
coach Larry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-most number of players on our team is from Texas,
and that's by design,'' Smith said. ``Part of our recruiting
philosophy all along has been to get into the Texas high school
recruiting scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Texans reside on the two-deep roster of Missouri's featured
offense. Though quarterback Corby Jones finished high school at
Columbia (Mo.) Hickman, he went through the 10th grade in
Richardson, where he was good friends with Tigers redshirt junior
defensive tackle Steve Erickson. Easter and Erickson both play
prominent roles on a Missouri defense whose improvement is regarded
as key if the Tigers are to enhance last year's breakthrough 7-5
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both those guys have been in our system for four years, and
they bring a lot of experience,'' Smith said. ``They are both pure
football players who have been taught well in high school. Football
is important to them. They have been a big part of the rebuilding
of our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri won only 11 of 34 games through Smith's first three
seasons before recording the Tigers' first winning season since
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a difference in attitude,'' Erickson said. ``Like night
and day from when I first came in. But we want more. We're going
after the big prize now. And I'm so pumped, I think it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers ranked 84th nationally in scoring defense a year ago.
But Smith has pointed out some extenuating circumstances that led
to the conclusion Missouri was weaker defensively than it actually
was. Though they surrendered an average of 30.5 points a game, 76
points came after victory was assured. Twenty points came in
overtime and special-teams breakdowns figured in 23 opposition
drives of 56 yards or less. And over the latter half of the season,
MU had a 13-5 advantage in turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus on playing better defense against the score
and cutting down on big plays,'' Smith said. ``We did improve on
forcing turnovers and we want to continue to improve on that. It
was a significant reason why we won four of our last five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Easter expects six returning starters and a wealth of backup
experience to translate into a defense that is not just an
afterthought to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed up a few things to utilize our speed and
experience,'' Easter said. ``When you've been in a system as long
as most of us have, it's a wonder what you can do out there
adjusting things. But this year, we want to make people adjust to
us _ not us adjusting to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense was really getting after people by the end of the
season. We felt like we gave up way too many points last year and
we want to cut that in half. Our offense does an excellent job. But
we have to take up some slack. We have to be the ones controlling
things out there.''

AT OBEDIENCE CAMP, DOGS AND KIDS LEARN A FEW NEW TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By SUZANNE BOYNTON   The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa,
Calif.)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Louie, a formerly timid miniature poodle,
stood on his hind feet and walked backward while Benjamin Rait, 13,
held a cookie over his head, garnering the ``best trick'' vote from
fellow campers.
</P>
<P>
   Winston, a 90-pound black Labrador retriever, escaped from the
after-lunch nap area without 60-pound James Ryall, 9, but was
captured by an instructor. On the second try, he sat until James
invited him out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Weir, 9, lay across the body of his ``dead''
mixed-breed, Kosar, and wailed. Then the pair jumped up and took
their bows.
</P>
<P>
   Amber, a small golden retriever, really didn't want to go
through the obstacle course tunnel, but was coaxed through by Julia
Ponder, 11, and Nancy Pierson, an instructor, who stood at each end
of the tube and used an extra treat. ``When in doubt, throw an
extra cookie,'' quipped Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical day at Camp Best Friends, a one-week day camp
for kids ages 9 to 13 and their dogs, conducted for the first time
in mid-August at Best Friends Dog Training and day care facility in
southwest Santa Rosa. Best Friends is owned by Julee Fullenwider,
who led the camp with instructors Pierson and Pat Engle.
</P>
<P>
   While the camp's first day had been fairly chaotic, said
Fullenwider, by the last day, the kids had fairly good control of
their dogs. The camp's goal was to give the youngsters a format for
thinking about and relating to their pets. Even parents who know
how to train dogs themselves don't always teach their children how,
said Fullenwider. ``They'll say `don't do that,' but don't tell
them what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Amber and Julia, for instance. ``Amber used to not listen
to me,'' said Julia. ``Now she listens to me a lot better.'' It
wasn't that Amber didn't know what she was supposed to do _ she had
previously attended obedience classes with Julia's mother, Janet
Ponder. The camp taught Julia how to take command.
</P>
<P>
   Local trainers agree it's important to involve the whole family
in the selection, training and care of a family pet. Children are
often expected to care for an animal, but are not taught to train.
In return, the dog ignores the child.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Warz, who teaches dog training classes for the Humane
Society of Sonoma County animal shelter and Sebastopol Community
Center, says the point of dog training classes is training people.
She takes children as young as 7 in her classes.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problem children have in relating to the family
dog involves motivation, not a lack of training skills or
responsibility, said Warz. ``It occurs when the child is not part
of the decision to select the animal. A lot of parents have a
picture of the kind of dog they want to live with. They get the
dog, supposedly for the child, and expect the child to buy into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that children are irresponsible when it comes to
caring for and training the family dog, said Warz, is ``just not
true. There are some physical restrictions - it's terrible to have
a tiny 7-year-old come in with a huge (untrained) malamute ...
That's not fair for the dog, but it's really not fair for the
child. We try to set things up for success.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Warz said where dog training is concerned, children have the
advantage that ``they don't have all the baggage we adults do. If I
say to the class that we're going to work these dogs and then
reward them with praise, the child knows how he feels about that.
He will get on the floor and roll with 'em. A child is very attuned
to the relationship developing between them and their dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Beliveau, daughter of a professional field-dog trainer,
was only 9 when she started training her father's clients. She
finds that when it comes to dog handling, ``children can do
basically the same as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   The only catch, said Beliveau, is that the child must have the
dog's respect and trust in order to make it behave properly. ``Kids
are not as assertive as they should be with the dog. He should be a
little bit worried that you're the alpha dog and could correct
him,'' Beliveau said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Davis, 8, achieved just that at camp. Major, a German
shepherd mix adopted in June from the Rohnert Park shelter,
wouldn't listen to him, though Major obeyed Austin's parents. But
after the first day at camp, Austin said, ``He was like, oh-oh,
here comes Julee _ oh-oh, here comes Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullenwider believes this first-day phenomenon was simply due to
the fact that for the first time, each child-dog team had spent a
lot of time concentrating on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five hours, we were consistently expecting the kids to be
in control of the dogs. They were getting rewarded for controlling
the dogs. Three of us (instructors) were watching them, reminding
them. Our patience didn't wear down _ we knew they were going
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogs that were dedicated to pulling on their leashes got prong
collars, which press the blunt ends of several stiff wires into the
neck when the dog pulls. The training itself, though, was not
intimidating for the dogs. The sternest discipline was a spritz of
diluted vinegar water in the face, administered by instructors
only, for the high crime of barking. (Don't do this at home without
proper directions, Fullenwider warns; unless applied correctly, it
won't work.)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the camp, the children had learned to make their
dogs heel, sit, lie down and stay (most of the time) and do tricks,
mostly of the dog's choice. These behaviors were emphasized in
games like tic-tac-toe, wherein the child was required to make the
dog sit or lie down and stay in order to hold the square on a board
painted on the floor of Fullenwider's training center.
</P>
<P>
   Other games emphasized just-for-fun teamwork between child and
dog. In ``bobbing for hot dogs,'' the children directed their
canines' attention to a bucket of water in which hot dog pieces
were floating. Most dogs took little directing to find and gobble
up the treats.
</P>
<P>
   In the T-shirt relay, the child dressed the dog in a T-shirt,
walked a course with the dog at heel, then removed the shirt for
the next team member. There was an obstacle course for agility.
</P>
<P>
   Campers heard speakers on veterinary care, and learned to groom
their dogs and brush their teeth. There were videos, a daily craft
period after lunch where campers made things like doggie treats and
thank-you cards for the speakers, and lessons in Tellington Touch,
an internationally practiced form of acupressure-type massage.
</P>
<P>
   Of the latter, Fullenwider said, ``The founder feels that touch
at certain places on a dog's body can help with certain ailments.
But where I'm coming from is, I think it's a great calming exercise
for the dog, and gives kids a structure rather than pulling on
their ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to learn different ways of playing with the dog
and controlling the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who came to watch the video the children had made on the
last day of camp said the camp had succeeded in showing their
children how to handle their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia had a close relationship with Amber before, but this has
made it even closer. I think maybe Amber has taught Julia a few
tricks,'' said Julia's dad, Steve Ponder.
</P>
<P>
   Alfie, a mixed breed, was also recently adopted from a shelter.
As far as training, ``He started from zero. Camp has been a really
good experience for my daughter,'' said Bev Zeigler, watching
Josie, 12, catapult a tennis ball for Alfie to catch. ``During
camp, we tried to let her take care of him. We'll have to see now
that camp's over whether she'll keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeigler added, ``She feels more in control. The dog's more under
control. It's definitely a good thing.''

WAC'S FINAL RIDE WITH 16 PROMISES INTRIGUE, PASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the poor, misbegotten Western Athletic Conference wobbled
into its final months as an overstuffed, underpaid curiosity,
suddenly there was a bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Up in East Lansing, Mich., a moment of redemption arrived for
the long-suffering, oft-abused and officially shattered league.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the Colorado State Rams _ ranked higher than they have
ever been since statehood _ taking on Michigan State in front of
almost 70,000 Big Ten types and a national viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   In a daring ploy, they spotted the hosts 16 points, then raised
the flag and mounted a charge. The startled Spartans were rolled
under as if they were just another band of pilgrims from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a moment, what a ... uh, hold it, something seems amiss
here. HEY! WHERE'S THE LOGO?!?!
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it develops that in this moment of glittering triumph, the
Rams showed up practically nude: no WAC logo on the jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the booth, the gents reporting it all to a grateful nation
were clearly confused. Or as one kept saying to the other,
``Y'know, Dan, this doesn't really look like a WAC team ... more
like a Big Ten team, wouldn't you say?''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, of course, it did not escape notice that CSU
is one of the eight defecting schools, and reasonable minds
instantly spotted a tawdry plot to discredit the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quick phone call to CSU athletic director Tim
Weiser, commissioner Karl Benson pronounced himself satisfied that
it was an ``oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wearing new jerseys,'' Benson said, ``and the
equipment manager simply did not get around to sewing the patches
on. Tim has assured me they will be on for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   This was met with the standard query: ``So, Karl, you're
satisfied there's no conspiracy here?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the final days of the old WAC, which should prove
entertaining, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Logos aside, the Rams' day on national TV was not a cheery
occasion for the schools that will constitute the WAC next year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the gratuitous slam from ESPN analyst Lee Corso was
replaced by something far more graphic: a comparison of records
over the last two years, leading the boys in the booth to the
conclusion that the ``haves'' were defecting and the ``have nots''
would be left to carry the WAC banner next year.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposed against the image of CSU conquering the Spartans was
the announcement that TCU had opted to punt a three-game series
with Nebraska off the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new'' WAC isn't exactly mummified.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 are expected at Rice Stadium when the Owls and
SMU _ two of the more combative WAC teams in any scenario _ tee it
up tomorrow night in the traditional season-opening promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This one will benefit the Houston Food Bank, and could bring a
larger crowd than the 53,145 who showed up last year for Rice's
game against Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Average attendance is up to more than 35,000 a game _ more than
twice what it was 10 years ago _ and the Owls have won seven games
in back-to-back years for the first time since 1960-61.
</P>
<P>
   An ``academic'' school, Rice has revived under Ken Hatfield to
the point that it is now competitive with everyone in its own
league and has dotted upcoming schedules with Michigan, Nebraska,
Oklahoma and Texas and is feeling good about the future.
</P>
<P>
   SMU, which came up a winner last year for the first time since
'86, has a $50 million building program in progress and an
aggressive program under Mike Cavan. Both schools believe they can
survive the next couple of years and come out in good shape on the
other side of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win some championships and keep bringing people out
to see what our program is like and what our kids represent,''
Hatfield says. ``This is a great school, and there is a feeling on
the part of the remaining WAC schools that whatever happens, we
will stick it out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the festivities in Houston will be the inauguration of a
new trophy _ the Mayor's Cup, which will be awarded annually to the
winner of the SMU-Rice game. Designed to strengthen the rivalry _
and the interest in it _ the concept is similar to that of The Iron
Skillet, which is awarded each year to the TCU-SMU winner.
</P>
<P>
   This one, however, has a new twist. All parties have agreed that
the mayor of the losing borough will show up at the next city
council meeting decked out in an elegant ensemble featuring the
winning school's game jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of Saturday's game will be a halftime ceremony
in which former Rice All-American Dicky Maegle will present his
Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame trophy to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Maegle, a member of the inaugural class of inductees this
summer, gained fame in the 1954 game when Alabama's Tommy Lewis
lurched off the bench and tackled him as he ran down the sideline
en route to a 95-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Officials awarded him the balance of the run, and Maegle went on
to score three times and establish a still-standing record of 265
yards rushing, as the Owls won, 28-6.
Still in awe
</P>
<P>
   Although Colorado State is loaded, is riding a 10-game winning
streak, and thoroughly dominated Michigan State in the second half
Saturday, coach Sonny Lubick was still a bit awed by the day's
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've been around too long,'' he said. ``I go back far
enough to where teams like Michigan State still conjure up a lot of
fear in you. We got out there in front of all those people, and I
still had that thought, like, `I wonder if any of us really knows
what we're doing here?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ranked higher (15th) than we've ever been in ...
probably eternity. But it was still CSU against Michigan State, and
this school had never beaten a Big Ten team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rams got the expected strong performances from
stars Damon Washington, Kevin McDougal and Darran Hall, the big
news was senior quarterback Ryan Eslinger, making his first
collegiate start after backing up Moses Moreno for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Eslinger hit 13 of 26 passes for 205 yards and a touchdown,
effectively erasing what was considered CSU's biggest doubt about
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it was a great win,'' said Lubick, whose team faces
Colorado this weekend. ``but I kinda wish it had been the last game
of the year. Then I could spend a few days strutting around
celebrating, maybe getting a few free beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, I have to spend the whole week trying to tell people
it was no big deal.''
Buzz
</P>
<P>
   A change of position is one thing, but San Jose State coach Dave
Baldwin] was taken aback when Carlos Meeks, his top rusher,
approached him last spring. ``He said he was quitting football
because he wanted to become a rapper,'' Baldwin recalled. But after
a brief fling in the music world, Meeks was back during two-a-day
practices, asking to be reinstated. ``I let the seniors vote on it,
and it was unanimous,'' Baldwin said. ``So we have our leading
rusher back.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   When Hawaii faced Arizona last night, two former Rainbows
coaches were on the Wildcats sideline _ head coach Dick Tomey and
assistant Bob Wagner. Asked if this brought extra significance to
the game, UH coach Fred vonAppen replied, ``We're not playing their
staff. As far as I know, no one has arranged a scrimmage between
the coaches.'' VonAppen was more concerned about his own team _
especially the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   While most coaches pronounced themselves ready to finally play a
game, Fresno State's Pat Hill said he is glad his team iss off this
week. ``We have 105 players, and 80 of them are in their first or
second year,'' he said. ``We need another week off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's Dave Rader, on running back Reggie Williams, who led the
team in rushing in '95 and '96, but was benched last year in favor
of 1,000-yard man Charlie Higgins: ``I guess he's our forgotten
man, kind of like Wally Pipp,'' referring to the New York Yankees'
first baseman replaced by rookie Lou Gehrig in 1925.

ANGELS TRY TO AVOID LATE SWOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AL West race is the only race left for a division title in
the majors, as no other division leader besides the Angels entered
Thursday with less than a 10-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels open a five-game homestand tonight _ without Darin
Erstad, who re-injured his left hamstring Wednesday and figures to
miss the rest of the regular season _ having just played the
American League's top three teams _ record-wise _ on the road and
held their own. They won three of five in New York, two of three in
Boston and split two games in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue the Angels had more at stake. The Yankees have
an 18-game lead in the AL East, the Indians have a 12{-game lead in
the AL Central and the Red Sox lead the wild-card race by 7{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams can afford to let up, or let down, for a game here
and there. They can rest their regulars to get ready for the
playoffs. Because for them, there is no doubting they will be
there.
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, there is no such guarantee. Especially when they
are fighting history as much as the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels haven't had a winning month of September since 1991.
And they are a combined 49-83 in September since then.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins, meanwhile, was only a part of one
September with the Angels _ last season. But as a major-league
manager, he's finished in second place every year. Three times with
Houston and last year with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sees the Yankees and Indians, and to a lesser degree the
Red Sox, use September as sort of a spring training for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, of course I'm envious of them,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the theory that a team that has a playoff spot
wrapped up so early it loses its edge and can't turn it on in time
for the playoffs? Collins doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of teams rise up,'' he said. ``The last couple of
games, I'll bet you see them turn it up, they won't rest anybody.
There will be a big buildup.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Collins might like his team to take a little
break now and then, he likes that his team has to fight for a
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us,'' he said. ``We'll go in doing the same
things we've been doing. Those guys (Yankees, Indians, Red Sox)
have been there. They know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins looks at the rest of the league's teams that have no
chance at the postseason and feels sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How nice is it to get up every day and know you have something
to play for?'' he said. ``Every day you come to the park there's
something on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   With a pennant race comes added attention, and Collins said it's
a matter of being able to prioritize your time when it comes to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a distraction, it's part of the job,'' he said. ``You
have to budget your time. That's why I get to the ballpark when I
do (typically noon for a 7 p.m. game). So I have a segment of time
that's mine. At 3 o'clock, I do interviews. I don't like it, but I
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells his players to remember what's important before each
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them first of all, make sure you get your work done,''
he said. ``Get your treatment if you have an injury. Do you weight
training, stretching, take batting practice. Handle it
professionally, but the only thing that matters is getting ready.''

MINOR-LEAGUE STARS GIVE RANGERS' FRONT OFFICE PREVIEW OF FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers acknowledged center fielder Ruben
Mateo as the organization's No. 1 prospect during July.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin refused to involve the 20-year-old
outfielder at Double-A Tulsa in trade discussions during his
attempts to strengthen the Rangers' pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the closest to being untouchable,'' Melvin said in July.
``We think he's got a chance to be an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Few major-league officials disagree. Yet Mateo and the
organization's other top prospects will not receive a cameo
appearance this month, with the Rangers involved in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials identify second baseman Pedro Guerrero,
first baseman Carlos Pena, shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt, catcher
Cesar King and third baseman Rob Sasser as the Rangers' most
coveted prospects among position players. Right-handers Jonathan
Johnson, Ryan Glynn and Joaquin Benoit and left-handers Matt
Perisho and Corey Lee represent the best pitching prospects the
system offers, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   All pale in comparison with Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is without a doubt the best Double-A player I saw this
year,'' said one major-league scout, who predicts Mateo will hit
.270-.275 with 20-25 home runs during his first major-league
season. ``He's a five-tool player. He's going to hit for average,
and he's going to hit for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run. He can throw. He's got great range. He can play
shallow and go get the ball. He can cut the ball off in the gap and
make the throw. He's just an exciting guy to watch.'' Ruben Mateo

</P>
<P>
   Mateo overcame a one-month stint on the disabled list when he
separated his left shoulder in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, every now and then, you're fortunate to have an
individual who is exceptionally talented,'' Rangers assistant
general manager Dan O'Brien said, ``and while Ruben Mateo certainly
fits that classification, it's a little unfair to him at this
juncture in his career as a Double-A outfielder to label him as an
impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly has the potential to be that, but you've
obviously got to have some patience in allowing him to work his way
up here, get established and let his talent take him to whatever
level he is capable of.''

<P>
   Comment: ``I don't like him; I love him,'' says Mets assistant
general manager Omar Minaya, who previously served as the Rangers'
director of professional and international scouting. ``I love him
as much as Ruben Mateo. He's the next one to be looking for among
the Latin stars who have come through the Rangers' organization.
He's going to be a star.'' 2. Carlos Pena Position: 1B. Height:
6-2. Weight: 210. Bats: Left. Throws: Left. Age: 20. Obtained:

</P>
<P>
   Comment: Pena, who six years ago moved with his family to the
United States from the Dominican Republic, received the largest
signing bonus ever awarded a draft choice by the Rangers after his
final season at Northeastern University in Boston. ``He's a pure
hitter, not just power hitter,'' Melvin said. ``He's the type of
hitter we like to have for our park. We're always looking to add
left-handed power to the organization.'' 3. Kelly Dransfeldt
Position: SS. Height: 6-2. Weight: 195. Bats: Right. Throws: Right.
Age: 23. Obtained: Fourth-round selection in the 1996 June draft.

</P>
<P>
   Comment: Dransfeldt, who in 1997 hit .227 with six home runs for
Charlotte, worked extensively with minor-league hitting instructor
Don Reynolds and emerged as perhaps the poster child for the
organization's player development process. ``He's always had
physical ability,'' O'Brien said. ``He's got multiple tools. He
plays a premium position, and he's a solid defensive player. He
probably deserves the award or at least consideration for the award
in the organization ... for most improved player. Obviously, he has
catapulted himself into a very strong position for consideration in
the future here at the major-league level.'' One major-league
scout, though, does not view Dransfeldt as a shortstop. Dransfeldt
possesses a good arm and average hands, but he lacks range and a
stroke that leaves him vulnerable to pitches up and in, the scout
said. 4. Cesar King Position: C. Height: 6-0. Weight: 175. Bats:
Right. Throws: Right. Age: 20. Obtained: Signed Sept. 4, 1994, as a

<P>
   Tulsa (AA) .222 316 40 70 16 2 3 39 30 68 1 .313 .288
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Rangers anticipated that the promotion to Double-A
Tulsa might not be an easy one for this catcher. ``King would
excite me one night and let me down the next,'' one scout said.
``He got a little pudgy, too. I think he's a little overweight.''
Is King a disappointment? ``Well, if you want to judge solely on
the basis of statistics, I suppose someone could make that
assumption,'' O'Brien said. ``However, the one thing that I think
gets overlooked is how old he is. To have someone with his talent
at his age playing in his fourth professional season at the
Double-A level is really a considerable tribute to him. Has it been
easy for him this year? No, and he'd probably be the first one to
admit it. He'd probably also tell you that this is the year when he
has learned the most about the type of adjustments that he's going
to have to make to be successful.'' 5. Rob Sasser Position: 3B.
Height: 6-3. Weight: 205. Bats: Right. Throws: Right. Age: 23.
Obtained: Oct. 31, 1997, as the player to be determined in the July
29, 1997, trade that sent right-hander Ken Hill to the Angels.
Statistics Avg. AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI BB SO SB Slg. OBP
</P>
<P>
   Rangers .000 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 .000 Tulsa (AA) .281 417

</P>
<P>
   Comment: Scouts rave about Sasser's athleticism, and some in the
organization view him as someone who could play all three outfield
positions. However, his stroke might lack the power aspect desired
from a third baseman, one scout said. ``He settled in \Rat Tulsa\S
very nicely, and while he may not have had a spectacular season,''
O'Brien said, ``for a player who is 23 years old playing in Double
A for the first time after coming out of the Midwest League in
1997, what he has done is commendable.''

HYPE FOR L.A. RACE MISLEADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite what you might have thought you heard on
your radio, this is not Winston Cup auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the Rainbow Warriors, tire controversy and 180 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But it is NASCAR _ albeit it's rookie-level Featherlite
Southwest Tour with a few bona fide Winston Cup stars tossed in to
sweeten the draw. And Bill Burke and fellow organizers of this
weekend's Ford Los Angeles Street Race hope to bring a handsome
crowd downtown for three days of racing around the boulevards and
avenues of L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Burke denies radio spots that beckoned race fans to ``come watch
the NASCARs run,'' were deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasers of advance grandstand tickets, which Burke says have
sold briskly, were clearly advised the main-event race involved
NASCAR's Southwest Tour, not its Winston Cup superstars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, most Southern Californians are somewhat out of
the loop when it comes to auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is most people don't know the difference between
the Southwest Tour and Winston Cup in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We're pretty sure they do, but Burke promises exciting racing
regardless of who is on the 1.4-mile track, which runs through
Exposition Park just outside the Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of event sponsor Ford, some genuine NASCAR major
leaguers will be behind the wheel Monday for the Kragen Z-One 200,
the newest and by far the most-hyped event on NASCAR's Featherlite
Southwest Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Flying out from Darlington, S.C., at the bequest of Ford,
following Sunday's Southern 500, will be Mark Martin _ one of the
genuine stars of Winston Cup racing. Fellow Winston Cup regulars
Ken Schrader and Chad Little and Craftsman Truck superstar Ron
Hornaday Jr. are also expected.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who will also race Saturday in the Busch Grand National
race in Darlington, has said he hopes to become the first driver he
knows of to win three NASCAR events on successive days.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of other racing tours will run in events that begin at
10 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The American City Racing League features open-wheel Indy-like
cars racing in a team scoring format. The Porsche Pro Racing
series, obviously, runs sports cars. And the Ultra Wheels Spec
Truck Series _ where Hornaday will race _ features pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's weekend of racing differs from most events in that
actual racing _ not merely practice and qualifying _ will take
place on each of the three days.
</P>
<P>
   The ACRL and the Porsche Pro series will race all three days.
The Spec trucks will race Sunday and Monday. And the Southwest Tour
cars, which practice Saturday and qualify on Sunday, race on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Grandstand tickets range from $8 for a child's seat on Saturday
to $50 for an adult three-day pass. General admission, which Burke
said is all but limitless, varies in price from $5 for a child on
Saturday to a $25 adult three-day pass.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket information: 1-800-690-RACE.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid: Jeff Gordon always has a streak of one kind or another
going these days.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gordon, who has won four of the past six Winston Cup
events, attempts to win his fourth straight Southern 500 at
Darlington, S.C. He will also be going for his second straight
$1-million bonus awarded to the driver who finishes in the top five
at the Brickyard 400 _ which Gordon won _ and then wins the
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the running are Mark Martin, Bobby Labonte, Mike Skinner
and Dale Earnhardt, who followed Gordon to the finish line at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over: The reason for Max Papis' sudden resignation from
the Arciero-Wells race team came to light this week, when Bobby
Rahal named Papis to replace him next season.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal is said to have chosen Papis from a list that included
fellow CART star Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   Cross your fingers: Rumor has it that the moguls of CART and the
rival Indy Racing League are working behind the scenes to create a
scenario that would allow CART to return to the Indianapolis 500 by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope it's more than wishful thinking. Without CART, the
once-premier auto race in the world has become just another event.
</P>
<P>
   Big money: Tony Stewart's move to Winston Cup racing next season
will have deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs Racing announced Thursday that Stewart's effort will
be sponsored by The Home Depot, the nation's largest home
improvement retail outlet, 690 stores strong. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE'S PONCIANO PUTS PLAYERS FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Sometime in December, after Cal State
Northridge has completed its 11-game football season, rookie head
coach Ron Ponciano will be evaluated. Wins and losses will be
tallied, achievements and failures assessed.
</P>
<P>
   What the game notes, box scores and won-loss column won't count,
however, is what might matter most in the Ponciano era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Milhon taught me that people are more important than Xs
and Os,'' Ponciano says, recalling the words of the former Azusa
Pacific coach who gave him his start.
</P>
<P>
   As the Matadors kick off the 1998 season Saturday at Boise
State, the evaluation of Ron Ponciano, football coach, will begin
by those who employ him and those who support the team.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, Ponciano already has won the respect
and loyalty of his team, and of other coaches, with a very
non-football trait. His humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares for people. . . . Ron would do anything for a young
man,'' says San Jose State head coach Dave Baldwin, Ponciano's boss
for two years at CSUN and one year at SJSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make fun of him, that he's a softy,'' says CSUN assistant
head coach Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   And the listener thinks, (begin ital)you gotta be kidding(end
ital). Ponciano barks like Lombardi, cusses like Bobby Knight and
can, when he wants to, reduce a 300-pound lineman to a lump of
soft-serve frozen yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the burly 39-year-old's occasional bellowing belies his
downright '90s-man mentality. Ponciano cares. Almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, defensive back Howard Henry quit the team _ and
took his scholarship with him. Henry, who had sunk on the depth
chart, decided his studies had become more important than football.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano could have retracted Henry's scholarship and used it
elsewhere in the cash-strapped program. Instead, he told Henry to
keep it, with the agreement that Henry keep a 3.0 grade-point
average.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, receiver James Maldonado, a transfer from Kent
State, left the team suddenly to attend to a personal crisis. A
week later, Maldonado walked back into Ponciano's office and asked
to be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are already seven deep at wide receiver, and again,
could have applied the scholarship elsewhere. But after listening
to Maldonado's story, Ponciano quickly invited the senior back to
the team and moved him to free safety, where he has a better chance
of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given me an opportunity again to play football, the thing
I love to do,'' Maldonado says. ``I didn't know what to expect, to
be honest with you. He was very compassionate about my situation
and very humanistic, understanding of what went on. He didn't give
me a life sentence for the mistakes I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the lesson Ponciano learned from his old mentor at
Azusa. But perhaps, too, it is Ponciano's own mistakes that color
his responses.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman fullback at Cal, Ponciano left training camp one
night with four others, his morale crushed by a coach who placed
more value on football than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember they weren't treating us right. We felt like
just meat,'' Ponciano says. ``And probably I was too immature to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also partying far too often, drinking and smoking and
generally acting like a typical 18-year-old away from home for the
first time. But Ponciano got a second chance at St. Mary's,
straightened out his life and eventually finished his career at
Azusa, where he later began a coaching career that wound through
USC, Valley College and Missouri Western State.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he picked up many of the traits of the head
coaches he worked for.
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson throughout: ``Your kids are all you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Football, they'll take with them for the rest of their lives,
but it's a small portion of their lives,'' he says. ``Hopefully we
teach them some kind of skills, some kind of character things . . .
that can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words took on new meaning for Ponciano 18 months ago, when
his wife Lisa gave birth to their first child, Chad. Now it's rare
to pass through a practice at CSUN without seeing the tow-headed
tot scampering by, with Lisa not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best thing that ever happened to me,'' he says. ``The thing
since I've had Chad, I realize that whoever I'm talking to, (some
parent) feels as strongly about that player as I feel about my son.
Someone loves him that much. So there's no reason to degrade
anybody. There's times I can get in (a player's) face, which I do,
and there's times I need to chew on them, which I do. But there's
times to love 'em up, which I do.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ponciano has fired an assistant coach who used intimidation
tactics, has brought back players from the brink of dropping out
and is so protective of his players that he banned them from
fraternity parties after a freshman got into trouble at one.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's not surprising then that Ponciano sets a
general goal of finishing in the upper tier of the Big Sky
Conference but speaks at length about improving graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you can never do enough for them to make them
better people,'' Ponciano says. ``Because the only thing that's
really important is that they can get a job, hold down a job,
provide for their family and be good parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And the wins, well, they'll come in time too.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ASTROS manager Larry Dierker knows the feeling. He was pitching for
the Astros in September 1973 when he was called in from the bullpen
to face Hank Aaron in the next-to-last game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerin' Hank, in pursuit of Babe Ruth's career home-run mark
of 714, was sitting on 713.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd spent most of the year on the disabled list &UR;  &LR; with a broken
bone in my hand,'' Dierker said. ``I was only back with the team
for a few days, and I wasn't on top of my game, so I wasn't in the
best frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yeah, it pumped me up. Why not see if you can rise to the
challenge?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few days, some other National League
pitcher is going to have the challenge staring him in the face. And
as Mark McGwire bears down on Roger Maris' single-season home-run
mark, few in the Astros' clubhouse would want the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pulling for Mark McGwire,'' Randy Johnson said. ``Just
like I'm pulling for Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. I'd like to see
them all break the record. But now that McGwire's right there, I'm
hoping he gets it done before the Cardinals come to Houston next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't run and hide. You do your best and give him your
best pitches. But there's a lot of baggage that comes with the
situation. To be honest, I don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of burden that has Tracy Stallard doggedly ducking
the media in this summer of the long ball. The man who served up
homer No. 61 to Maris on Oct. 1, 1961, has dodged every request for
an interview, still pained that his entire big-league career has
been capsulized in that one moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand his feelings about not wanting to talk about
it,'' Billy Wagner said. ``I mean, you have a career that lasts
years. You do your best, and the only thing that anybody wants to
talk to you about is one pitch. Was it a bad pitch or just a good
swing by Maris? I don't know. Nobody seems to care. But Tracy
Stallard can't get away from &UR;  &LR; it after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go in there and give it my best shot against
McGwire if it comes to that. But that's one hell of a way to make
it to the Hall of Fame. It's like you're infamous.''
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Tom Zachary, who delivered the pitch to Ruth
for his 60th homer, and Al Downing, who served up No. 715 to Aaron
in the spring after Dierker's confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The game is filled with victims. For years, Dodger Ralph Branca
was tortured by the memory of his 1951 playoff pitch that Bobby
Thomson launched to give the pennant to the Giants. But these days,
Branca has made peace with himself and makes appearances all over
the country with Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the kind of thing that I'd be proud of at all,'' Mike
Hampton said. ``History, maybe. But if you're a pitcher, giving up
a home run means you didn't do your job. It means you lost that
at-bat. There is never any honor in losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher who surrenders No. 62 to McGwire is likely to be
hounded by fans and the media almost as much as the slugger
himself. In this age of overanalysis paralysis, blanket coverage
and 24-hour sports channels, it might take a unique individual to
deal with the burden.
</P>
<P>
   Say, Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, put me in there against any of them,'' Lima said. ``I'll
go right at them, give them my best shot. If they hit, they hit.
That's the name of the game. I'm not afraid of Mark McGwire or
Sammy Sosa or the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire's already got one off me this year. Pow! Gone in three
seconds. Hardest ball ever hit against me in my life. A line drive.
(Jeff) Bagwell told me if it had hit the scoreboard, we would have
had a delay in the game. It would have knocked the lights out. So
what, man? It's power on power.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it depends on the self-confidence of the pitcher. A
veteran, sure of himself, might not let one pitch define him. A
less secure individual could crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing research for my baseball library as a
broadcaster,'' Dierker said. ``I looked into the only two home runs
that were ever hit all the way out of Dodger Stadium, both by
Willie Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit the first one off a young guy named Alan Foster. Willie
told me that for the next several years, every time he came to the
plate against Foster, the guy tried to knock him down. He'd just
throw the ball and snarl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second homer came against Andy Messersmith, a great
pitcher, who just smiled at Willie and tipped his cap. I think
that's all you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did Aaron do against Dierker &UR;  &LR; in that long-ago September
showdown?
</P>
<P>
   ``A broken-bat single over shortstop,'' Dierker said, smiling.
``I didn't get him out. But I kept him in the park.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Swissair Flight 111 plunged into the inky waters
off Nova Scotia Wednesday night, it took an uncommon number of
lives of dogged humanitarianism. It claimed a tireless battler
against the scourge of AIDS and researchers perched on the
seemingly fathomless frontiers of science.
</P>
<P>
   It took a contingent of U.N. workers settled into a flight as
familiar and reassuring to them as the evening commuter train,
people who intrepidly hopscotched across the tender borders of
war-torn nations but met their end near a tranquil fishing village.
But most starkly it visited heartache on a dozen countries on two
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The cold statistics of the disaster were merciless. All 215
passengers and 14 crew members on the plane bound for Geneva from
Kennedy Airport in New York died.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger roster was something of a kaleidoscope of the
world's nations. Swissair said there were 136 passengers from the
United States, 30 from France and 28 from Switzerland. A half-dozen
came from Britain, three from Italy and three from Germany. There
were two passengers from Greece mixed in with solitary travelers
from Saudia Arabia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Spain, Iran, St. Kitts
and Nevis, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Air disasters rarely excuse anyone. Two of the victims were mere
infants. One man was bumped off two other flights that night before
getting a seat on the one that would never land.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair released the passenger manifest of Flight 111 late
Thursday night after officials finished notifying relatives.
Earlier, colleagues and relatives had confirmed the identities of
some of those who boarded the doomed airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, who helped shape the international campaign
against AIDS, was traveling on the flight with his wife, Dr. Mary
Lou Clements, to attend AIDS-related meetings in Geneva. A public
health physician, he founded the Global Program on AIDS in 1986 for
the World Health Organization. In 1990, he resigned in bitter
protest against WHO's failure to move faster, and recently he
became the first dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clements was an epidemiologist and vaccine expert who headed
the center for immunization research at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Hygiene and Public Health. Both she and her
husband were 51 and lived in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gostin, a director of the Georgetown University-Johns
Hopkins University Program on law and public health who knew Mann
for some 20 years, remembered Thursday how he had accompanied Mann
on the first day he entered the WHO building in Geneva: ``It was
literally Jon and one Swiss secretary. He built that program within
a matter of years to be, by far, the largest disease- prevention
program in the history of the WHO. That alone, his mobilization of
the world against AIDS, is his greatest legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Mann, one of Mann's daughters, is a student of Gostin's at
Georgetown University Law Center. Gostin said he spoke to her only
hours before the crash and she mentioned that her father was
contemplating moving overseas to reapply his zeal to international
work.
</P>
<P>
   To workers at the United Nations, the nightly Flight 111 was
affectionately known as the U.N. airbus because it served as
something of a commuter flight for officials and diplomats
shuttling back and forth between the secretariat in New York and
the European headquarters in Geneva. ``This is a flight that so
many of us take routinely that I think it spooked a lot of us,''
said Fred Eckhard, the U.N.'s senior spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Few Swissair 111 flights lift off without at least a few U.N.
people buckled into their seats. And thus as soon as U.N. workers
learned the flight number, they knew that some of their people were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials identified seven staff members or associates,
including Mann, as having perished in Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of all the
victims, and in particular to the relatives and friends of all
those who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the
United Nations,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan from
Durban, South Africa, where he was attending the summit meeting of
nonaligned nations.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included Pierce Gerety, 56, an American lawyer who
had devoted his life to the plight of refugees. Only an unlikely
convergence of events put him on the plane. According to his
brother, Tom Gerety, president of Amherst College, he had a ticket
for a KLM flight to Amsterdam. It was overbooked and he was bumped
along with some others. He was put on a Swissair flight. It was
canceled. His consolation was a ticket on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of operations for the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees in the ravaged Great Lakes region of Central Africa,
including Rwanda, Gerety seemed to spend more nights in tents with
refugees than he did in his own home. Wherever war, famine and
social unrest uprooted people from their homes, he was there. Time
and again, he stared death in its face and scared it off.
Associates said he was shot at, narrowly evaded bombs and never
shied from jumping aboard a rickety plane for a perilous flight
into the bush. They could only wonder how he could die in the
comfort of a gleaming commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, 37, a French social worker and therapist
who worked as senior welfare officer in the Geneva headquarters of
the refugee unit, also died in the crash. She had counseled
refugees in Bosnia, Mali and Rwanda, and had transferred to Geneva
in June so she could spend more time with her husband and baby.
</P>
<P>
   Others victims among the U.N. family were Joachim Bilger and
Ludwig Beaumler, Germans who were respectively the controller in
the office of internal oversight and productivity and the senior
director for international and operational affairs with the World
Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two officials with UNICEF were on the flight. Yves de Roussan, a
Canadian, worked with adolescents who were abandoned or ran afoul
of the law and was UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and
Eastern Europe. Ingrid Acevedo, 32, an American who was director of
public relations for UNICEF's U.S. National Committee, was on her
way to attend a meeting to plan for an annual communications
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   As an expression of mourning, all 185 flags of the U.N.'s member
states were taken down Thursday at the U.N. complex perched along
the East River in midtown Manhattan. The blue and white U.N. flag
was lowered to half-staff in both New York and in Geneva. A
memorial service was planned in Geneva for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had its share of chronic fliers. It was small wonder
that Norman Scoular was on a plane flight Wednesday night. Last
year, in carrying out the demands of business, he spent 337 nights
in hotel rooms. Scoular, 45, a Scottish-born resident of
Manchester, England, was the chief executive of Sylvania Lighting
International, which had been recently acquired by SLI Inc. of
Canton, Mass., and of which he had become chief operating officer.
After meeting with SLI officials, he had boarded Flight 111 to go
to Geneva to shut down an office there.
</P>
<P>
   Don Scheer was a 49-year-old biochemist from Norfolk, Mass., who
journeyed the globe promoting his discoveries. He was in fact
tiring of the travel and Tuesday night told his brother, Jerry,
that after one more trip to Europe to tout a product he designed to
separate DNA strands, he was going to sink into his couch, flick on
his 35-inch television and scream his lungs out for the Cleveland
Indians, the team he loved. Scheer took Flight 111 with his wife,
Diane. He was going to Budapest and then planned to join her in
Greece for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the Indians stunk and weren't going anywhere, but
that was his team,'' said Jerry Scheer, laughing for a minute as he
remembered that last conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved sports,'' Jerry Scheer said. ``We talked about
college football coming up. We talked how on Thanksgiving we were
going to watch three football games in a row. And then I told him,
``Have a safe trip.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., said that it
lost both a physicist and a guest researcher in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Kinder-Geiger, 36, a German citizen who was an associate
theoretical physicist at the laboratory, was on his way to Trento,
Italy, where he was to speak at a physics workshop. He then planned
to continue his work at a particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Per Spanne, 53, a Swedish citizen, was a guest researcher at
Brookhaven's Synchrotron Light Source facility. His career was
rooted in finding new ways to use X-rays to diagnose disease and
for high-resolution imaging of objects. He helped pioneer a
technique known as phase-contrast microtomography that allows
detailed images of the interior of solid objects.
</P>
<P>
   As is always true with international flights, even in the last
gasps of summer, some of the passengers were bound for pleasure.
John Mortimer, 75, a former executive of The New York Times, had
boarded the flight with his wife, Hilda, 69, on their way to a
vacation in the south of France. Mortimer had joined The Times in
1962 as the paper's industrial relations manager and held several
positions, including senior vice president for personnel and
industrial relations. In 1982, he was named assistant to the
president of New York Times Co. He retired in 1983. Mrs. Mortimer
was on the staff of various non-profit organizations engaged in
education exchange and other international issues. They lived in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Nelson was on Flight 111 to carry out a good deed and for
love. She was to meet her boyfriend, Edward Fierastale, in Geneva.
They were then traveling to Grenoble, where he was going to propose
to her and she was going to help her sister, Judy, nine months
pregnant, give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson, 35, was a naturopathic doctor who spurned drugs in
favor of natural agencies like herbs and sunshine. She recently
closed her practice in Mystic, Conn., and was about to open an
office in Manhattan, where her parents live. ``You couldn't get an
appointment with Tara,'' said her mother, Sheila, who was in tears.
``It would take six months. She was so successful. And she met her
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster inevitably has its other side, those individuals whose
moments of vacillation saved their lives. Marc Rosset, 27, the
Swiss tennis player, told reporters at the U.S. Open that he was
booked on the doomed Flight 111 after his first-round defeat forced
his early departure from the tournament. Not long before he was due
at the airport, he said he chose to stay one more day to get in
some practice with the top-level hitting partners available at the
tournament.

`THE GIRLS' ADD POLISH TO RUIDOSO
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, lapel pins and jealous
husbands. And if their 2-year-old quarter horse Old Habits wins
Monday's All American Futurity, the 10 women who own him will have
$1 million to share.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves ``The Girls,'' and they are doing their
best to feminize the sport's good old boys.
</P>
<P>
   Their jockey, Dusty Stimpson, will wear racing silks that have
oversized red lips on the back. And in a ceremony tomorrow
afternoon that hopefully won't be televised, they are each painting
one of trainer Danny Cardoza toenails with red polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm, the camaraderie ... we are having so much
fun,'' said Janice Knorpp, one of the partners. The only Texan in
the bunch, she resides in Clarendon, about 60 miles southeast of
Amarillo. ``We've all become very good friends. We just look at
each other and smile.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. The women paid only $1,850 each to buy Old Habits,
and his quarter-mile qualifying time of 21.55 seconds was the
fastest of any All American finalist. The Ruidoso Downs, N.M., race
is the richest in quarter horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Old Habits _ named for a country song _ already has made $85,203
from four wins in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Knorpp said she and Sue Hukari of Bonsall, Calif., ``fell in
love'' with Old Habits at a yearling sale last year in California.
They bought him for $18,500, joined by their regular partners
Bonnie Vessels, also from Bonsall, and Mary Thead of Poway, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went around to folks that we knew,'' Knorpp explained.
``We said, `Look, this one we really do like, would you like in?'
And they said OK. That's how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first racehorse experience ever for Connie Cobb of
Tidewater, Ore., Glori Ekker of Hanksville, Utah, and Leslie
Schwabacher of Daniel, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the sorority are all from California:
Sharon Gordon of Orange, Melodie Knuchell of Los Alamitos, and
Cathy Monji of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels, a racing veteran, acts as the unofficial social
chairman. She communicates with the other owners through e-mail,
and they all seem to get along wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairy tale that's coming true,'' said Ekker. ``And what
a lucky fellow \ROld Habits\S is to have 10 women drooling over
him, granting his every wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Girls are dressing in red for Monday's big race, which will
be televised live on ESPN2 with a post time of 5:45 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the husbands to be attired in whatever the wives want
them to wear. The Girls are laughingly referring to their spouses
as ``the five-percenters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas and California are community-property states,'' Knorpp
explained.
Hoofbeats and The Buzz
No Super showdown
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop meeting in
the Sept. 27 Super Derby lasted only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, trainer Shug McGaughey announced that instead of
shipping Coronado's Quest to Louisiana Downs, he would instead
point him toward the Sept. 19 Woodward Stakes in New York home
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of staying home and running a mile and an
eighth,'' McGaughey told the New York Daily News. ``I'll get five
pounds from the older horses, and I won't have to ship all the way
to Louisiana Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   By running Coronado's Quest in Belmont Park's Woodward,
McGaughey is opting to send his 3-year-old against a battalion of
older horses expected to include Skip Away, Free House, Gentlemen
and perhaps Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that was the most palatable choice.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was loading the unpredictable colt on a plane
bound for Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, where the weather can be
hot, the paddock is more confining, and the distance is the same
mile-and-a-quarter that he just barely survived in the Travers
Stakes. That is one quest McGaughey chose not to undertake. Flat on
his back
</P>
<P>
   These horse races are fraught with peril, and lately it seems
Mike Smith has been on the receiving end of more than his fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Smith will miss an estimated four months with
fractured vertebrae he sustained in a Monday spill at Saratoga.
Smith cracked his T-12 and L-3 vertebrae and will be in a body cast
for two months, with no paralysis or other permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-race accident was determined to be the result of
careless riding by Edwin Cotto, who has a 1998 record of 0-for-41.
Most jockeys who are judged guilty of infractions are suspended for
a week, but Saratoga stewards handed Cotto a 30-day penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Smith broke his collarbone on the Florida Derby
undercard at Gulfstream Park and was sidelined for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's latest injury will cost him big-race mounts this fall on
Coronado's Quest, and other top horses such as Ajina, Aldiza and
Maxzene.  &LR; railhed:Another jackpot The guaranteed pick-six craze
shows no signs of abating, and Del Mar cranks up another one on
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The track is again guaranteeing $2.5 million in the total pool.
And again Monday, nationwide betting is likely to exceed $3 million
and perhaps $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The wager can be played at Lone Star Park's Post Time Pavilion
simulcast center.
</P>
<P>
   Three previous Southern California promotions have resulted in
modest payoffs, although $15,000 is certainly nothing to sneer at.
But one of these days, someone is going to hit a home run with a
single winning ticket in the $2 million vicinity.
 &LR; railhedDrug quandary
</P>
<P>
   Horsemen don't seem to care about the public perception that
racing has a drugging problem, and the new National Thoroughbred
Racing Association is being dragged into the middle of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA has formed a task force to look into the controversial
issue, which has many avenues for exploration.
</P>
<P>
   First, not all performance-enhancing drugs can be detected by
urine or blood testing. Second, medication rules and penalties for
breaking them are different from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most ominous, some believe the foundation of the
thoroughbred breed itself is threatened by use of legal race-day
drugs such as Lasix and Butazolidin. For more than a decade, horses
needing these drugs to compete effectively have been retired to the
breeding shed, and critics say the result is becoming apparent:
succeeding generations of horses that are more fragile than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers to this one, as the NTRA will soon
discover.
</P>
<P>
   As long as racetracks run long meetings and seek full fields,
and as horse-related expenses continue to rise, owners and trainers
will continue to face pressure to race their horses more often than
they know they should.
</P>
<P>
   And that, they say, can only be accomplished through the use of
therapeutic race-day medications.  &LR; railhedBonus rules According to
a rules stipulation by the insurance company, the $1 million
DeBartolo Racing Challenge bonus, payable if Classic Cat wins the
Super Derby, depends on whether a seven-horse starting lineup can
be put together for the race.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective field now includes just four other horses:
Victory Gallop, Raffie's Majesty, Leave A Legacy and Thomas Jo. But
chances are good that Louisiana Downs director of racing Pat Pope
will be able to round up a few more, especially now that Coronado's
Quest won't participate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the seven-horse requirement isn't met (or if seven
horses start and he loses), Classic Cat won't go home with empty
saddlebags. According to the complicated rules of the DeBartolo
participation bonus, if Classic Cat doesn't win the $1 million, he
will be guaranteed a $100,000 bonus simply for leaving the starting
gate, and another $100,000 if he finishes fourth or better.
 &LR; railhedDel Marred To put it bluntly, a catastrophic injury in a
racehorse is defined as one that results in death. During the first
35 days of its 43-day season, Del Mar had 10 such injuries on its
dirt and grass tracks either in races or during morning training
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of its meeting, six horses died as the result
of racing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Lone Star Park's recent thoroughbred meeting,
where, according to statistics compiled by track superintendent Ron
Moore, just three horses died from breakdowns in a 73-day meeting.
Two of those were in one race.  &LR; railhed:Et cetera Skip Away won his
eighth consecutive race Sunday, a dramatic photo-finish triumph in
Monmouth's Iselin Handicap despite carrying 131 pounds. That will
almost certainly be the heaviest weight he'll ever be asked to
carry. The Woodward and subsequent dates on Skip Away's tentative
schedule this fall are weight-for-age races and not handicaps,
after which the 5-year-old probably will be retired to stud,
perhaps as the horse that won the most money ever. ... Pat Day has
moved past David Gall into third place on the list of all-time
winningest jockeys. The 44-year-old Day rode his 7,264th winner on
Saturday, and trails only Bill Shoemaker (8,833) and Laffit Pincay
(8,632 through Monday). ... Pincay, 51, returned from a broken
collarbone and broken ribs Monday to ride a winner at Del Mar. ...
Texas-bred Thomas Jo runs Monday in the Pennsylvania Derby, his
scheduled tuneup for the Super Derby. ... Once-beaten filly
Relaxing Rhythm has been retired. ... Trainer Wayne Lukas tries for
the fourth Hopeful Stakes victory of his career Saturday with heavy
favorite Yes It's True, who looks like the country's fastest
2-year-old. ... Silver Charm worked a fast mile on Sunday, but
trainer Bob Baffert is still mum on a possible next start. ...
Saratoga's meeting ends Monday, and Del Mar concludes Wednesday.

`THE GIRLS' ADD POLISH TO RUIDOSO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, lapel pins and jealous
husbands. And if their 2-year-old quarter horse Old Habits wins
Monday's All American Futurity, the 10 women who own him will have
$1 million to share.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves ``The Girls,'' and they are doing their
best to feminize the sport's good old boys.
</P>
<P>
   Their jockey, Dusty Stimpson, will wear racing silks that have
oversized red lips on the back. And in a ceremony tomorrow
afternoon that hopefully won't be televised, they are each painting
one of trainer Danny Cardoza toenails with red polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm, the camaraderie ... we are having so much
fun,'' said Janice Knorpp, one of the partners. The only Texan in
the bunch, she resides in Clarendon, about 60 miles southeast of
Amarillo. ``We've all become very good friends. We just look at
each other and smile.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. The women paid only $1,850 each to buy Old Habits,
and his quarter-mile qualifying time of 21.55 seconds was the
fastest of any All American finalist. The Ruidoso Downs, N.M., race
is the richest in quarter horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Old Habits _ named for a country song _ already has made $85,203
from four wins in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Knorpp said she and Sue Hukari of Bonsall, Calif., ``fell in
love'' with Old Habits at a yearling sale last year in California.
They bought him for $18,500, joined by their regular partners
Bonnie Vessels, also from Bonsall, and Mary Thead of Poway, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went around to folks that we knew,'' Knorpp explained.
``We said, `Look, this one we really do like, would you like in?'
And they said OK. That's how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first racehorse experience ever for Connie Cobb of
Tidewater, Ore., Glori Ekker of Hanksville, Utah, and Leslie
Schwabacher of Daniel, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the sorority are all from California:
Sharon Gordon of Orange, Melodie Knuchell of Los Alamitos, and
Cathy Monji of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels, a racing veteran, acts as the unofficial social
chairman. She communicates with the other owners through e-mail,
and they all seem to get along wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairy tale that's coming true,'' said Ekker. ``And what
a lucky fellow \ROld Habits\S is to have 10 women drooling over
him, granting his every wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Girls are dressing in red for Monday's big race, which will
be televised live on ESPN2 with a post time of 5:45 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the husbands to be attired in whatever the wives want
them to wear. The Girls are laughingly referring to their spouses
as ``the five-percenters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas and California are community-property states,'' Knorpp
explained.
Hoofbeats and The Buzz
No Super showdown
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop meeting in
the Sept. 27 Super Derby lasted only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, trainer Shug McGaughey announced that instead of
shipping Coronado's Quest to Louisiana Downs, he would instead
point him toward the Sept. 19 Woodward Stakes in New York home
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of staying home and running a mile and an
eighth,'' McGaughey told the New York Daily News. ``I'll get five
pounds from the older horses, and I won't have to ship all the way
to Louisiana Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   By running Coronado's Quest in Belmont Park's Woodward,
McGaughey is opting to send his 3-year-old against a battalion of
older horses expected to include Skip Away, Free House, Gentlemen
and perhaps Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that was the most palatable choice.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was loading the unpredictable colt on a plane
bound for Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, where the weather can be
hot, the paddock is more confining, and the distance is the same
mile-and-a-quarter that he just barely survived in the Travers
Stakes. That is one quest McGaughey chose not to undertake. Flat on
his back
</P>
<P>
   These horse races are fraught with peril, and lately it seems
Mike Smith has been on the receiving end of more than his fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Smith will miss an estimated four months with
fractured vertebrae he sustained in a Monday spill at Saratoga.
Smith cracked his T-12 and L-3 vertebrae and will be in a body cast
for two months, with no paralysis or other permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-race accident was determined to be the result of
careless riding by Edwin Cotto, who has a 1998 record of 0-for-41.
Most jockeys who are judged guilty of infractions are suspended for
a week, but Saratoga stewards handed Cotto a 30-day penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Smith broke his collarbone on the Florida Derby
undercard at Gulfstream Park and was sidelined for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's latest injury will cost him big-race mounts this fall on
Coronado's Quest, and other top horses such as Ajina, Aldiza and
Maxzene.  &LR; railhed:Another jackpot The guaranteed pick-six craze
shows no signs of abating, and Del Mar cranks up another one on
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The track is again guaranteeing $2.5 million in the total pool.
And again Monday, nationwide betting is likely to exceed $3 million
and perhaps $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The wager can be played at Lone Star Park's Post Time Pavilion
simulcast center.
</P>
<P>
   Three previous Southern California promotions have resulted in
modest payoffs, although $15,000 is certainly nothing to sneer at.
But one of these days, someone is going to hit a home run with a
single winning ticket in the $2 million vicinity.
 &LR; railhedDrug quandary
</P>
<P>
   Horsemen don't seem to care about the public perception that
racing has a drugging problem, and the new National Thoroughbred
Racing Association is being dragged into the middle of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA has formed a task force to look into the controversial
issue, which has many avenues for exploration.
</P>
<P>
   First, not all performance-enhancing drugs can be detected by
urine or blood testing. Second, medication rules and penalties for
breaking them are different from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most ominous, some believe the foundation of the
thoroughbred breed itself is threatened by use of legal race-day

DON'T BE QUICK TO DISMISS WILL CLARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Clark should not be lightly discarded after this season is
over.
</P>
<P>
   That point needs to be made clear to all those people eager and
ready to spend Tom Hicks' money.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rafael Palmeiro dearly wants to return to Texas and, yes,
his 41 home runs and 112 runs batted in would look terrific behind
Juan Gonzalez in the Rangers' lineup. There's no doubt at this
point of their careers that Palmeiro is the better offensive player
than Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just not that simple. The Rangers unquestionably need
Clark back next year.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Clark remains the undisputed leader of this team, and
he changed the personality of this team after arriving in 1994. He
had help from Mickey Tettleton, Mark McLemore and many others.
Manager Johnny Oates also played a significant role. But Clark was
the one who began the badly needed change from me-first to
team-first.
</P>
<P>
   He plays hurt, he plays hard, he plays the game right and those
intangibles can't be overlooked. If they are, people are forgetting
the Ruben Sierra-Julio Franco era, when the Rangers had 25 players
doing their own thing, much to the detriment of team goals.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Clark is no longer the great offensive
player he was in San Francisco. There's also little doubt he has
played in his last All-Star Game and probably hasn't seen the last
of the disabled list. That body is being held together more by
willpower than any significant physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   But as Oates said, ``Will Clark today is a pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Clark reminds me of Carl Yastrzemski, the Red Sox
Hall of Fame outfielder. Yastrzemski, like Clark in San Francisco,
was one of the great players in the game in his peak years of
1967-70, when he was winning batting titles, Gold Gloves and a most
valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the injuries, and Yastrzemski's great talent slowly
eroded. For the last 13 years, he was never close to the player he
was in 1967, when he won baseball's last Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But he remained a productive player and great team leader right
up through 1983, simply through determination. Yastrzemski's simple
philosophy was to tape it up, play every day and get the job done.
Clark does the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles have shown over the past three years that
buying the best players does not produce the desired results. They
have great talent on the field, but their clubhouse mix has been
bad. The melting pot has not worked there.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, on the other hand, have demonstrated the
value of having more than just great talent. The talent is there,
but they also have some gritty ballplayers like Joe Girardi, David
Cone, Paul O'Neill and, yes, even Darryl Strawberry, who has
matured greatly and is leading the team in home runs despite a bad
knee. Teams don't have the kind of season the Yankees are having on
great talent alone. Just ask the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Palmeiro might want to come back to Texas, but he's
not going to come back cheaply. He's looking for $10 million a
year, which makes general manager Doug Melvin squirm.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have more important ways to spend Hicks' cash.
Pitching, as always, has to be their first priority. Shortstop
Royce Clayton also needs to be re-signed; otherwise, the Rangers
are going to be hurting at an important position.
</P>
<P>
   Clark won't come back cheaply. He makes $6.25 million this year
and his intense pride will make a pay cut difficult to accept. One
possibility is a two-year deal with performance-based options,
similar to what the Rangers did with John Burkett last year.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be explored. He is not Rafael Palmeiro. He is not Mo
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still Will Clark, and that has meant too much to the
Rangers to be discarded.
</P>

LENDER'S SHARES TUMBLE 33%
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of PacificAmerica Money Center fell more
than 33 percent Thursday with the company saying the plunge may
have resulted from some investors selling at steep loses to satisfy
margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed Thursday at $5.125, down $2.625, as
874,500 shares changed hands, more than 33 times the daily average
volume over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica is a sub-prime lender of home mortgages and its
stock has been falling in the past week along with that of other
companies in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everybody has taken a beating,'' said Charles J.
Siegel, the company's chief financial officer. ``The whole market
has fallen quite a bit in the last week. We believe the reason our
price fell was (that) there were a lot of margin calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he did not know which of PacificAmerica's big
shareholders had margined the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Margin accounts allow customers to buy stock with money borrowed
from the broker. A margin call demands that the customer deposit
enough money or stock to bring the account up to its minimum
maintenance requirements.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica said there was no material change in its loan
pool performance through July 31 and that it anticipates an
all-cash sale of about $137 million in loans during the third week
of September.
</P>
<P>
   The company still expects to report positive cash flow and
earnings for the third quarter.

NOTHING LIKE 61-HOMER RECORD IN ALL OF SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Equipped with an agile thumb on the remote control,
the baseball fan Wednesday had an opportunity to experience the
local alpha and omega of televised experiences.
</P>
<P>
   On one channel was former Mariner Randy Johnson, blowing away
the Atlanta Braves and Greg Maddux and even laying down a sacrifice
bunt, a small-ball adventure his former teammates have yet to
consider attempting under manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   On another channel was Mariner relief pitcher Bobby Ayala giving
up a game-winning grand slam, an event as pathetically predictable
as a stadium cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   On a third channel was blessed relief from Mariner grief.
Highlights from the Forearm Festival showed Mark McGwire on such a
vigorous stampede into baseball history that the porcelain Jeff
Manto doll atop the TV vibrated off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to home run No. 59 this week might wind up nearly as big
a feat as besting the record of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's home run analysts have always talked about how
difficult a big final month can be for sluggers. For 37 years, the
theory held, thwarting all the ``on a pace for 62'' projections.
</P>
<P>
   No one gave much consideration to the idea that the labors of
Hercules could be completed by Labor Day. Never has the most
majestic record in sports looked so vulnerable, and never have so
many people been so excited about a paper chase.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderfully curious thing, this record and its pursuit. Given
the otherwise dismal year of the St. Louis Cardinals, there is no
team reward at stake. And there are individual records of greater
improbability _ Ted Williams' .401 batting average, Joe DiMaggio's
56-game hitting streak, Johnny VanDerMeer's back-to-back
no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing like the single-season, major league home
run mark. And to have it pursued by not one but two engaging
fellows, each handling the pressure in his own way, yet with equal
aplomb, is almost better than discovering strawberry shortcake is a
cure for old age.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the record's conquest, its appeal is worthy of a
little scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not only America's oldest organized professional
sport, it's the only sport where record-keeping is its own
institution. Great effort has been expended to seamlessly connect
generations by quantifying everything in universal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Linear thinkers will rightly conclude it is mostly a bogus
exercise, since the many changes in ballparks, equipment and rules
have rendered moot most of the relevance of modern records to the
pre-World War II statkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball is linear only along foul lines and base lines. A
game of round ball against round bat takes many hops that can't be
defined by tabular mathematics. Those parts of baseball are
explained in words and legends that far exceed any other sport's
capacity to enchant.
</P>
<P>
   No figure in sports is as romanticized as Babe Ruth, for all the
reasons that are well-known, plus one that is often lost _ the home
run record before Ruth's career was 27, set in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   He doubled that mark in 1920, then hit 60 in 1927 _ gargantuan
leaps of achievement that have been exceeded only once in more than
70 years. That means three generations of fans have become attuned
to the 60 standard in an activity that, perhaps outside of fishing,
is the only one to remain mostly the same for a grandchild as a
great-grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the well-understood standard, there also is the nature
of a single-season record that makes it tidily comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   A single-game superlative, such as a perfect game or batting for
the cycle, is a spontaneous development that can't be anticipated.
Anticipation is an integral part of a modern sports achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Career records, such as Cal Ripken's consecutive-game streak,
can be anticipated, but nearly all are intellectual appreciations
that are harder to connect with emotionally. (Besides, what did you
do in school with the kid who had perfect attendance? You gave him
a headlock and a noogie, or pulled up the back of his shorts.)
</P>
<P>
   All career sports records owe something to the luck of good
health, which is wonderful but not satisfying. Feats that span the
decades, such as Hank Aaron's record for homers, Cy Young's record
for pitching wins and Pete Rose's record for hits, are magnificent,
but not as compelling as a single season with a beginning, middle
and climax.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from matters of time and history, there is the nature of
the home run. As McGwire said recently, the home run is about power
and bigness, America's most identifiable characteristics. We savor
big cars, big conflicts, big landscapes, big pizzas and big debt.
McGwire the man is our perfect physical metaphor, built along the
lines of an RV, and his homers are big enough to be national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs, thanks to the trot, also allow for instant, mandatory
celebration of an individual in the context of a team game, another
big deal to Americans (see Oscars, Emmys, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Home runs also are instantly gratifying and have an indisputable
finality _ perfectly resolved chords for a culture that otherwise
seems like an AM radio on scan.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare your ears, and your sporting soul: The big ta-DAH is
coming.

   Scores of bodies and bits of debris were recovered from choppy
seas off Nova Scotia on Thursday as officials sought to determine
why a Swissair jetliner bound from New York to Geneva began smoking
and fell into the Atlantic minutes short of an emergency landing in
Halifax Wednesday night, apparently killing all 229 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   As Canadian naval vessels and a flotilla of fishermen searched
the crash site five miles off a picturesque village called Peggy's
Cove on Nova Scotia's south shore, it seemed unlikely that any
survivors would be found, though all hope was not abandoned. Many
of the victims' grieving families gathered in New York and Geneva,
and some were flown to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were Jonathan Mann, the first director of the
World Health Organization's AIDS program, and several other U.N.
officials whose work had taken them into hazardous regions,
including Pierce Gerety, a Harvard-educated lawyer who had worked
for years on behalf of refugees in strife-torn regions of Africa
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators said that, although the cause of the
crash was still a mystery and might not be learned for weeks or
months, there were no immediate indications that the wide-bodied
jet, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, had been brought down by an
explosion or an act of criminality or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to indicate at this time any possibility or
suggestion of any criminal act,'' Terry Ryan, a deputy commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told a news conference.
Similar comments came from the White House, the FBI, Swissair and
Canadian and American air safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers, who retrieved at least 36 bodies, as well as body
parts and debris that included clothing, baggage and seat cushions,
spotted in the afternoon what seemed to be a large piece of the
aircraft intact _ perhaps the fuselage, containing many of the
victims and the flight data recorders _ in about 120 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, unlike Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which blew up
without warning in the sky off the south shore of Long Island soon
after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport on July 17, 1996,
with a loss of 230 lives, investigators said Swissair Flight 111
apparently did not explode, but ran into trouble about 15 minutes
before it crashed and did not break up until it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the doomed flight, investigators said the plane
left Kennedy Airport at 8:17 p.m. ET and, nearly an hour later, was
out over the Atlantic in Canadian airspace, cruising at 33,000 feet
about 320 miles east-northeast of Boston, when the pilot radioed
air controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, at 9:14 p.m. that there
was smoke in the cabin, its source unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, the investigator in charge for Canada's National
Transportation Safety Board, said the pilot proposed going back to
Boston's Logan Airport for an emergency landing, and had begun
turning when the Canadian controller told him that Halifax
International Airport was closer, only about 70 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, identified by Swissair officials as Urs Zimmermann,
50, aided by the co-pilot, Stefan Low, 36, turned again toward
Halifax and flew on for 11 minutes, gradually descending to 9,600
feet, according to radar tracking data. During that time, the
passengers and crew were told of the emergency and put on life
jackets, which were later found on some bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit crew and the controllers at Moncton spoke to one
another at various points as a rescue center at Halifax was
notified and arrangements to clear the way for the landing were
made. As the plane crossed over the south shore of Nova Scotia and
headed inland toward Halifax Airport 30 to 40 miles away, however,
it suddenly changed course again, apparently after the pilot
concluded that he had to dump some of his fuel at sea, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said it was the pilot's decision to do this, probably
because an emergency landing is safer without heavily loaded fuel
tanks, or because the plane might have been easier to land without
the extra weight. In any event, radar tracking data showed that the
plane circled left and flew in a wide arc over land, down St.
Margaret's Bay and out over the ocean again, traveling at little
more than half its normal cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the aircraft was too heavy to land while
approaching Halifax and had to dump some fuel,'' Gerden said. ``My
understanding is that he would have turned or maneuvered somewhat
to dump the fuel prior to attempting the landing because he was too
heavy to land.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:25 p.m., the fuel dumping began _ rescuers later reported a
heavy odor of fuel on the water _ and, for reasons that were
unclear Thursday, the crew raised its distress call to a formal
mayday emergency. Five minutes later, at 9:30 p.m., under moonless
but clear skies, the plane suddenly plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plane, when it fell, was about 40 miles, or 7 to 10 minutes
of flying time, short of Halifax Airport, officials said, and there
no explanation why it happened. No one suggested that the plane had
dumped too much fuel and run out. And no one suggested that the
pilot's decision to twice divert his course _ first to head for
Boston and then, with Halifax Airport less than 40 miles away, to
circle around back to sea and dump fuel _ had been a judgment
error.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Peggy's Cove, Blandford, Hubbards and other coastal
towns, many of them already in bed _ it was 10:30 p.m., local time
_ reported hearing the sputtering noises of an aircraft passing
overhead, and then a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting with my husband outside by the little cottage
behind our house, by the water,'' said Sharon Hoagland, 48, of
Hubbards, on St. Margaret's Bay, 10 miles from the crash site. ``We
heard a huge sound. Initially I thought it was thunder. Then we
herd a smaller second rumble. It was a thunderous boom, but there
was no rain, no lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Blandford, Mabel Schnare, was at her son's house by
the water. ``I heard this big noise,'' she said. ``My, oh my, I
said to myself. What does this fool think he's doing, flying so
low. It was so loud I thought it would hit the house.'' A moment
later, the house shook violently.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Comdr. Glenn Chamberlain, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy
and Coast Guard's joint rescue command center in Halifax, said that
local boaters with intimate knowledge of treacherous coastal waters
_ fishermen, lobstermen and others _ provided invaluable aid in the
early hours after the crash. Many ran down and pushed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people who recognized that this was a tragedy, that
people needed help, and they didn't pause to think _ they just went
and helped,'' Chamberlain said. The seas, relatively calm at the
time of the crash, grew to angry 10 foot swells through the night
as drenching rains fell and winds rose to a howl.
</P>
<P>
   Within 40 minutes of the crash, the small boaters were joined by
Canadian Navy and Coast Guard vessels: frigates, cutters, supply
ships, helicopters and other craft, including police boats. Flares
rocketed aloft and fell slowly on parachutes, and the night search
recovered the first bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy weather forced a suspension until dawn, after which
the small boaters were sent home. By late morning, the operation
involved more than 1,500 search and rescue personnel on land, sea
and in the air. A makeshift morgue was set up aboard the Canadian
supply ship, HMCS Preserver, which had decks for helicopters and a
crew of 250.
</P>
<P>
   A small armada of search vessels, led by the Canadian frigate,
HMCS Ville de Quebec, hunted on a grid that was gradually expanded
from 5 square miles to 10 or more square miles. Several seaborne
helicopters were joined by land-based planes flying out of
Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base at Dartmouth, across Halifax
harbor from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   A large morgue also was set up at Shearwater, and bodies, as
they were recovered, were to be flown there, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Steve Duncan, chief superintendent of criminal
operations of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Roy Bears, an
official of Canada's National Transportation Safety Board, were
saying that a large section of the aircraft had been found about
120 feet under water. They did not say whether it had been detected
visually or by sonar.
</P>
<P>
   But they noted that if it was a large section of the fuselage,
it might yield many of the victims and the plane's cockpit voice
recorder and its flight recorder, the so-called black boxes that
detail a plane's movements, speed, altitude, fuel, electrical
systems and other vital information.
</P>
<P>
   American air safety experts were sent to assist Canadian
investigators, who had primary responsibility for the recovery
operations and the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Kennedy Airport on Thursday night,
Jeffrey G. Katz, the chief executive of Swissair, said the airline
was focusing on ``caring for the families of the passengers
involved and the families of crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the jetliner's maintenance and
safety record, including compliance with safety orders from the
Federal Aviation Administration, he said he believed that the plane
involved in the crash had ``a clean bill of health.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of relatives and friends of the victims gathered
overnight at the airports in New York and Geneva, many of them
distraught or in states of shock. Grief counselors and Red Cross
workers were on hand to give assistance, and officials of Swissair
and Delta Air Lines, Swissair's U.S. partner, provided lounges and
other aid. Flights were arranged to take family members from Europe
and the United States to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, 900 rooms were reserved for families of the victims,
along with transportation to Peggy's Cove, a village of 60
residents that was founded in 1811 and, with its lighthouse and
fleet of small boats, is one of the most picturesque in the
Maritime Provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair officials said the plane that crashed was put into
service in August 1991 and had been overhauled in August and
September last year. ``This airplane was in perfect working
order,'' said Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer of
Swissair's parent, Sairgroup. The jet had completed more than 6,000
flights in 35,000 hours aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The three-engine MD-11 _ with big jets on each wing and one in
the tail _ is known for reliability, aviation experts say. About
180 are in service, many of them as cargo carriers. Boeing, its
manufacturer, has announced plans to discontinue the model in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst since Swissair was founded in 1931. The
airline's last fatal crash occurred on Oct. 7, 1979, when one of
its DC-8s overshot a runway in Athens while trying to land and
burst into flames, killing 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   There were expressions of sympathy from around the world. In
South Africa, where he was attending a meeting, the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, spoke of the loss of eight
colleagues. President Clinton, who was told of the disaster as he
left Moscow for Belfast, also expressed sorrow.

IN SPORTS, THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE WITH BASEBALL'S HOME RUN
MARK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf for correction to make it read Emmitt Smith, not
Emmitt Thomas)  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pursuit of baseball's home run record took a day off
Thursday, giving the contenders, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, and
everyone else a chance to relax and take a few deep breaths before
they resume the most captivating and chronicled sports chase in
recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   No other sport has seen anything like it; in fact, no other
sport seems to have a record that can equal the home run record for
glamour and notoriety. It may not be the most difficult record to
achieve, even in its own sport, but it has taken an unyielding grip
on the summer sports scene that no other milestone could seemingly
match.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following test, for example, without consulting
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   (1) Who holds the National Football League record for most
touchdowns scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (2) Who holds the National Basketball Association record for
most points scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (3) Who holds the National Hockey League record for most goals
scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (4) Who holds the major-league baseball record for most home
runs hits in a season, and how many did he hit?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the last question is certainly more widely known
now because of the ongoing exploits of McGwire and Sosa, who have
spent the better part of the summer chasing Roger Maris'
37-year-old mark of 61 home runs in a season. McGwire, who has
raised his total to 59 home runs with 12 in the St. Louis
Cardinals' last 17 games and his last 52 times at bat, and Sosa,
who has remained doggedly close with 56, rested Thursday in their
mad-dash pursuit of the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   They resume their seemingly inevitable quest Friday night,
McGwire at home against the Cincinnati Reds and Sosa in Pittsburgh,
where the Chicago Cubs open a weekend series with the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   No pursuit of a record in any other sport has created the
electrifying atmosphere in which McGwire and Sosa take their daily
whacks. Touchdowns, baskets, goals are scored throughout the sports
year, but nothing grabs attention like home runs, especially the
prospect of a record number of home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that challenges to Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting
streak or to the .400 batting average barrier could match the
intensity of the attention that is focused on the home run chase,
but those challenges have been virtually nonexistent. Occasionally
players have flirted with hitting .400 _ a mark last achieved by
Ted Williams (.406) in 1941 _ but never in the last month of the
season. And DiMaggio's streak has never been seriously threatened;
no player has reached 50 games, and Pete Rose's 44-game streak in
1978 stands as the closest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run is a unique sports event,'' Fay Vincent, the
former baseball commissioner, said. ``No other sport has anything
like it. Everything in football requires two or more people. On one
team one guy can hit a home run and change everything. It's the
single most dramatic one-man event. There's so much magic that
surrounds a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one man, let alone two, pursues the record, fans
everywhere watch. It has engulfed fans at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Reich, a lawyer, who has represented players in three of the
four major professional team sports, recounted a recent experience
at a Cardinals' game in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario Lemieux wanted to see McGwire,'' said Reich, who took
the former hockey superstar to the game. ``We went in the dugout
before the game, and McGwire gave him a bat. Then he hit a home run
and Mario was one of the first to jump up and give him a standing
ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf is another star athlete who has become enthralled
with the home run chase. ``I'm very excited about it and I check it
every day,'' she said. She is one of only five players to win
tennis' Grand Slam, but when told that no one had ever hit 62 home
runs, she acknowledged ``Well, I guess that's tougher then.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from other sports acknowledge the allure of the
home-run pursuit. ``I'm a hockey fan first and foremost,'' said
Gary Bettman, commissioner of the National Hockey League, ``but the
energy and excitement are contagious.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people, even casual sports fans, have become caught up
in the McGwire-Sosa onslaught, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, senior vice president and executive editor of ESPN,
related that on the day Sosa hit his 56th home run, Wednesday, he
called his wife, and ``she knew Sosa had hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As wonderful an athlete as Michael Jordan is,'' Walsh added,
``and as great as his achievements are, I don't think there was
that kind of excitement as the Bulls were setting their record. I
can't think of another record that has the same excitement to it as
the home run record.'' As executive vice president of Elias Sports
Bureau, the best-known official sports statistician, Steve Hirdt
spends his life dealing in numbers and records. Nothing comes close
to the home run record, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attention given to it this year solidifies that
argument, if there ever was an argument,'' Hirdt said. ``I think
it's the sexiest record in sports. It's appealing both to casual
fans and dyed-in-the-wool fans. It's a very easy concept to
understand even for someone who isn't interested in baseball at
all, and the more you know about baseball the more you realize how
difficult it is to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Further explaining his assessment, Hirdt cited three ``really
important'' components for a good record that this one has:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, the home run is baseball's signature play. Second, a
home run is something that is difficult to gerrymander. Three, it
has an unyielding time limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's daily schedule enhances the interest. Every day for
six months, the drama of such a race builds.
</P>
<P>
   The home run record, of course, dates further back into sports
history than those in other sports, and its creator is seen as the
reason interest in it has been sustained for more than seven
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all tied up in Babe Ruth; it's tied up in that
mythology,'' Reich said. ``It's punctuated now by the fact that
McGwire reminds people of that Ruthian mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, said Steve Greenberg, president of Classic Sports, is an
American icon. ``His is the name that was associated with that
record for the better part of our lifetimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Hirdt noted, ``the first record that got people
interested in records.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said other sports' records don't rank with the one
Ruth established, first with 59 home runs in 1921, then with 60 in
1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average fan probably doesn't know those other records,''
he said, alluding to the quiz. ``I'm an average sports fan. I don't
know who holds the record for goals in a season in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of baseball, probably the best-known record, at least to
some of the people interviewed, is the 100 points that Wilt
Chamberlain scored in an NBA game March 2, 1962. Hirdt said the
number itself makes it attractive, as does the player who achieved
the number.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirdt also said, ``In baseball, you have only a certain
number of turns in a season to do something, whereas in other
sports you can achieve records a little more easily by deciding to
do so, giving the ball to a running back to gain a record number of
yards or giving a player enough shots in basketball so he can score
a certain number of points.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg agreed that the Chamberlain record was a great
achievement, but he added, ``On the other hand, it was one night.
He also averaged 50 points a game that season. That's amazing. But
basketball isn't baseball. With all due respect to Wilt and David
Stern, it wasn't then and it isn't now. It doesn't capture the
heart of America like baseball does.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the National Football League's best-known records was the
2,003 yards O.J. Simpson gained rushing in the 1973 season. And
that was before he really became well known. But his record has
been eclipsed, and the 2,105 yards that Eric Dickerson gained in
1984 is not a number that comes readily rolling off even football
fans' lips.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Hirdt suggested, it was the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because O.J. Simpson was right at the 2.000 mark, that had a
lot to do with it,'' he said. ``More people are familiar with O.J.
Simpson aside from his more recent notoriety than Eric Dickerson at
2,105.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, the sports agent, recalled Lemieux's chase of Wayne
Gretzky's consecutive-game scoring streak in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to break it until his back went out,'' Reich
related. ``But even that wasn't like this. The record for goals in
a season was a blow-the-roof-off record, but it's not even close.
This is the ultimate.'' In recent weeks, Reich said, he has been at
parks in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
``The excitement is unbelievable over this,'' he said. ``People
can't get enough of this. This is mythology in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, is captive to the chase. When Jim Fassel,
the New York Giants coach, was asked if he was following the home
run race, he said, ``I only read football news in the paper. If I
catch it on the television at the right time, then I'll follow it.
Otherwise I'm asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But he readily acknowledged that football has no record that
compares. ''A home run in baseball,'' he said, ``is the ultimate
when it comes to records and that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf was asked if hitting 62 home runs is harder than
winning a grand slam in tennis? ``How many people have done this?''
she asked. Told no one had hit 62, she said, ``Well, I guess it's a
bit tougher then.'' Part of the answer, then, to Question 4 on the
test is 61. And the player who hit that many home runs was Roger
Maris. But everybody knows that. How many know that Emmitt Smith
scored a record 25 touchdowns in 1995, that Chamberlain scored a
record 4,029 points in the 1961-62 NBA. season and Gretzky scored a
record 92 goals in the 1981-82 NHL season?

EDITORIAL: CHOICES FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   New York's state legislature is mostly a closed shop, where
incumbents are protected by a complex petitioning process and an
unfair fund-raising system. But there are a few competitive primary
contests in New York City on Sept. 15. Here are our recommendations
in 10 races in overwhelmingly Democratic districts where nomination
is tantamount to election.
</P>
<P>
   MANHATTAN: In Senate District 30, which stretches north from
Chelsea and also includes a small section of the Bronx, two
compelling candidates are competing to replace retiring Sen. Franz
Leichter, a Democrat. Daniel O'Donnell, Rosie's personable brother,
has run a good campaign, emphasizing his service as a public
defender and community activist. Nevertheless, we endorse Eric
Schneiderman because of his solid work on issues ranging from
subway fares and abortion rights to crime prevention and campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Assembly District 72, which includes Washington Heights,
Inwood and Marble Hill, a local political feud has matched the
two-year incumbent Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican elected
to the Assembly, and Isabel Evangelista, a candidate backed by
Guillermo Linares, the first Dominican on the City Council. Ms.
Evangelista has waged a spirited race, but we endorse Espaillat,
who has made a good start in Albany and deserves more time to
pursue issues of concern to his district.

<P>
   THE BRONX: In Assembly District 75, in the southeast Bronx, we
prefer the young incumbent, Ruben Diaz Jr. He has shown
independence from his father, a Bronx minister with anti-homosexual
views. Diaz is pro-choice, has the support of gay activists and has
sponsored useful legislation on asthma, a major problem in his
district. His opponent, Jose Espada, has failed to make any good
arguments why Diaz does not deserve another term.
</P>
<P>
   The 79th Assembly District, which includes Morrisania, Melrose
and part of Fordham, has a growing Hispanic population. The
challenger, Frankie Cruz, the cable television commentator, says
the longtime incumbent, Gloria Davis, an African-American, has
shortchanged the newer arrivals. Ms. Davis, who has the support of
most of the party heavyweights, does need to become more inclusive.
But she seems the better choice, based on her ability to deliver
for this needy district.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN: Among the most interesting contests is in the 42d
Assembly District, which includes parts of Crown Heights and
Flatbush. The veteran incumbent Rhoda Jacobs faces Samuel Nicolas,
cousin of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant brutally injured in
police custody last year. Ms. Jacobs deserves praise for her 10
terms in Albany, and her efforts to reach out in a district that
has become a mainly Caribbean community. But we endorse Nicolas,
who might bring a fresh burst of energy to a district where many
residents are estranged from the political system.
</P>
<P>
   In the 45th Assembly District, which sweeps through Brighton
Beach, Kings Highway, Flatbush and Midwood, there are four
candidates for the seat vacated by Dan Feldman. They are Arnold
Wolsky, a lawyer and Jewish activist; Alan Sclar, a former Feldman
aide; Joel Garson, the party organization's candidate, and Lena
Cymbrowitz, a native of Egypt who is a fund-raising and marketing
consultant. We endorse Ms. Cymbrowitz, a bright and centrist
candidate whose sympathies for the elderly we admire.
</P>
<P>
   In the 54th Assembly District, which includes Bushwick and
Cypress Hills, the incumbent, Darryl Towns, faces a former ally,
Martin Malave-Dilan. Dilan, a lackluster City Councilman, has
charged that Towns is a do-nothing legislator waiting to take over
the Congressional seat of his father, Representative Edolphus
Towns. Towns has shown troubling signs that he has his father's
soft spot for the tobacco lobby, helping to kill a bill to limit
smoking in restaurants around the state. Nevertheless we endorse
him because he is an articulate voice who has been trying to create
a multiracial, progressive caucus in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   QUEENS: State Sen. George Onorato has reigned for 15 years in
Senate District 14 in northwest Queens. He now faces two strong
challengers: George Delis, the Community Board 1 district manager,
and Edward Sedarbaum, a community and gay rights activist. Either
is preferable to Onorato, whose strong anti-abortion position and
ties to the Christian Coalition are increasingly at odds with his
changing community. Since Sedarbaum seems likely to be the more
innovative legislator, we support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a special election last March, voters in Assembly District
31, in Far Rockaway, Springfield Gardens and South Ozone Park,
elected Pauline Rhodd-Cummings, candidate of the Queens Democratic
Party, by a scant 211 votes. She is again opposed by the Rev. Evan
Gray, minister of a church in Far Rockaway. Gray is a worthy
challenger but Ms. Cummings deserves another term to pursue an
ambitious agenda on education, jobs and housing.
</P>
<P>
   In Assembly District 36, in Astoria and Long Island City, Kimon
Thermos barely lost the last primary to the incumbent, Denis
Butler. Butler has represented the district diligently, but after
22 years it is time to pass along the duties to Thermos, an
impressive young candidate who wants to use his energies to improve
local schools, cut juvenile crime and enhance health care for
seniors. Thermos has also promised to tackle the state's abysmal
campaign finance reform system, which too often gives New York
legislators their jobs for life.

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since he resigned in 1990 after a bitter dispute with
the World Health Organization's director over global AIDS policy,
Dr. Jonathan Mann hadn't set foot in the organization's
Geneva-based headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to return Thursday. With his nemesis gone and a
more simpatico WHO director in place, the ever-restless 51-year-old
Mann looked forward to a series of talks about how he might launch
a new phase of his career in international health.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash of Geneva-bound Swissair Flight 111 Wednesday
night turned what was supposed to have been a grand reunion into a
harrowing memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's wife, Johns Hopkins University vaccine expert Mary Lou
Clements-Mann, also perished in the crash. She had planned to
attend meetings on how to design an AIDS vaccine that would be
practical for use in developing nations where 90 percent of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur.
</P>
<P>
   Planned agendas were canceled as 500 of the Manns' stunned
colleagues gathered in WHO's biggest auditorium _ the same room
where Mann announced his resignation as director of the Global
Program on AIDS on March 16, 1990 _ to absorb the news and
contemplate its poignant timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional indeed,'' said Daniel Tarantola, a
Harvard AIDS Institute scientist who will shortly become a top
adviser to Dr. Harlem Gro Brundtland, the new WHO director.
``Jonathan was very popular at WHO.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in the auditorium Thursday, Tarantola remembered the
staff's reaction to Mann's resignation eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of people formed a sort of escort or fence outside
the room when Jonathan left and applauded him. It was an emotional
departure,'' Tarantola said. ``He was about to come back as a
guest, a friend, a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Tributes to Mann, one of the most visible and passionate of the
world's first-generation warriors against the AIDS epidemic,
clogged media fax machines Thursday. Their theme was appreciation
for a man who insisted, with rare eloquence, that the virus would
never be stopped as long as governments, societies, and individuals
persisted in stigmatizing those it was most likely to infect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never get used to losing our friends in the fight against
AIDS,'' said Larry Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts
AIDS Action Committee. ``I just feel this is a tremendous loss. Jon
was a true missionary, a very powerful voice about the
interconnection of health, justice, and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation will not see a better man,'' added Dr. June
Osborn, former chairman of the President's AIDS Commission and now
president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. ``He made an
extraordinary mark on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's influence was more than rhetorical. In the late 1980s, he
successfully pushed the World Health Assembly to pass a strong
resolution urging its 187 member nations not to discriminate
against people with AIDS or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That resolution was a landmark,'' Tarantola said. ``I can
assure you governments would have passed laws restricting the
rights of people with HIV/AIDS, imposing mandatory testing, even
putting them in jail. There was a search-and-destroy frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mann enjoyed the spotlight, his career was marked by
unconventional zigs and zags dictated more by principle and passion
than by ambition or self-preservation. His friends believe he is
one of only two people to relinquish an endowed professorship at
Harvard _ a report that university officials Thursday said they
could not confirm.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native whose father was a well-known psychiatrist and
whose mother is a retired librarian and artist, Mann graduated from
Harvard in 1969 and got a medical degree from Washington University
Medical School in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A stint with the US Centers for Disease Control convinced Mann
he wanted to work in public health, and by the early 1980s he was
in Zaire, antagonizing government authorities loathe to acknowledge
the emerging AIDS epidemic. By 1986, Mann was founding director of
the WHO's global program on AIDS, but disputes over funding and
philosophy put him on a collision course with WHO's then-director,
Hiroshi Nakajima.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned with a blast at Nakajima, Mann took a post at
the Harvard School of Public Health, where in 1993 he founded the
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights with a
$20 million gift, the largest Harvard had received in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Mann announced he would give up the professorship
to become founding dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia. ``The idea of
creating a new school along the lines of his vision of public
health was incredibly appealing to him,'' said Sofia Gruskin,
director of the human rights program at the Bagnoud Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Allegheny University is suffering from severe
financial problems that recently led Mann to explore options in
Geneva. ``He was really excited about this trip and what it might
mean,'' Gruskin said. ``He had a lot of hope that finally the WHO
and he were sharing a similar vision. When we taught courses
together, he liked to tell students, `This course is for people who
believe the world can change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mann is survived by his mother, Ida Mann, of Newton, Mass.; twin
daughters by his first marriage, Naomi, of Washington, D.C., and
Lydia, of Boston; and a son, Aaron, a Peace Corps volunteer now in
Burkina-Fasso.

 &HT;    Couple's lawn ``unsightly'' in village eyes
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Tequesta couple that has battled village officials for almost
a decade over their landscaping was cited again this week for
violating village codes.
</P>
<P>
   Hattie and Bill Siegel were cited for excessive accumulation of
plant material because their yard is overgrown and untended,
village officials said. They also were cited for creating an
unsightly condition because they used tar paper and cinder blocks
to try to smother unwanted grass growing in their front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Siegels, who have lived in their house on Dover Road for
three decades, have chosen to landscape their back and front yards
with native plants and other shrubs, trees and flowers that require
little water to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and village officials believe the yard is a health
hazard and unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   The village has cited the couple several times in the past eight
years. Each time, the Siegels have appealed the citations. Several
cases were settled out of court. In the most recent case, a
three-judge panel overruled the village's hearing officer because
she hadn't followed the intent of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The village vowed to cite the Siegels again under the same
ordinance _ creating a public nuisance by allowing too much plant
material to accumulate on their property.
</P>
<P>
   Tequesta code enforcement officer Sgt. John Irovando issued the
warning letter this week, giving the Siegels 30 days to comply or
face another hearing before the village's code enforcement hearing
officer. Irovando said he also ordered the village to clean up the
portion of land in front of the Siegel's house that is in village
right-of-way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code enforcement is having the village do the same thing we're
asking the Siegels to do,'' Irovando said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, when an article appeared in The Palm Beach Post
about the situation, dozens of people have called the couple
offering cash and help, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not Hattie's way,'' said their attorney, Greg Tayon.
``She doesn't want to take anything for nothing.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Becky Howe speaks mind, saves senior community
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up in Piqua, Becky Howe learned little girls didn't
speak up, didn't rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   As a licensed practical nurse for nearly 30 years, she learned
to bite her lip, to turn the other cheek, to never never talk back
to patients, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, with all this practice, at age 50, she'd be adept
at holding her peace. Not so. Miami County's unlikely new heroine
has been speaking her mind since June 9, when she received notice
that Anthem was planning to cancel her coverage and that of some
20,000 Ohio residents using its Medicare HMO, known as Senior
Advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The change would mean a devastating lifestyle change for Howe
and her partner, Ronnie Hines, who has diabetes and multiple
sclerosis. Arthritis and a degenerative joint disease forced Howe
to retire two years ago. When the couple switched to Senior
Advantage around the same time, they saved an average of $150 to
$200 a month. They could play Bingo, go out to dinner from time to
time. That would all end. Worse yet, Howe says, ``The elderly and
the disabled would have no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe started mouthing off, and she doesn't intend to stop until
Anthem promises continued coverage in 22 rural and suburban
counties threatened with losing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been spanked for holding my breath, let's put it
that way,'' Howe says.
</P>
<P>
   Good bet she has never been spanked for excessive politeness
either. ``I can go from zero to bitch in 1.2 seconds,'' she is fond
of saying. She told one Anthem executive, ``I hope you sleep well
at night.'' She reminded an Anthem doctor, ``You took a Hippocratic
oath to take care of any and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe's crusade began with a letter to the editor to The Piqua
Daily Call, urging others to join her cause: ``Maybe together we
can bring the company to their knees. Speak up, Miami County, your
lives are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Her phone rang from 8:45 a.m. to 11 p.m. Still, friends
speculated, ``It's just Becky blowing smoke again.'' Naysayers
warned, ``You can't fight corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm going to try,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Before Howe knew it, politicians, TV cameras, lawyers and even
The New York Times camped out on her doorstep in Piqua. With
typical condescension to all things Midwestern, The Times referred
to her hometown as ``a weary looking city surrounded by
cornfields.'' But what the hey? It was legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit was filed and some 1,000 protesters
appeared at four rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Howe has declared an ``85-percent victory'' with the news last
week that Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials have agreed
to reconsider their decision. Officials are meeting with federal
administrators about a plan to save Senior Advantage by
establishing premiums and higher co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of you,'' neighbor and bosom buddy Mary Atkins told
her friend. ``She showed us that one person can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is congratulating me, but it took all of us
together,'' Howe corrects. ``There are a lot of people on this
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, of course. But the band needed a conductor. And
that's where Howe came in _ a single noisy woman who may very well
have shamed a huge corporation into doing the right thing. And if a
compromise plan isn't reached?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be out here,'' Howe says, ``and I'm not
going to keep quiet.''

 &HT;    Pitchers have to even the score, says Riggleman
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As manager of the Chicago Cubs, Jim Riggleman
watches his own player, Sammy Sosa, with a smile. But when he
watches Mark McGwire against his team, he grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that on any pitch Sosa and McGwire can catapult a
baseball far into the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Why are baseballs flying out of ballparks in great numbers?
Already this season, 22 players have hit 30 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last eight to 10 years, hitters have made a lot more
progress than pitchers,'' Riggleman told The Chicago Tribune.
``Hitters have gotten stronger and the parks have gotten smaller.
Hitters are recognizing the forkball now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 20 years ago that San Francisco manager Roger Craig
developed and pushed the split-finger fastball. Hitters, though,
have caught up with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers are going to have to come up with something to even
the score again,'' Riggleman said. ``Maybe they'll have to raise
the mound. All I know is that it has made it frustrating for a
manager. You think you have the game in hand and, boom, the ball is
over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the most players to hit 40 or more homers in the
same season was eight _ and that was 1961 when Maris hit his 61. It
also was an expansion year, just as this season is an expansion
year that thins out the pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 12 players hit 40 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago relief pitcher Rod Beck says he doesn't care if Mark
McGwire is taking andro or nitro or Cheerios, what he is doing is
amazing. But he makes another point. He says baseballs used to be
so soft he could move the cover with his fingers. Now you can use a
baseball to sink an 8-ball.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the way McGwire is locked in, he probably
could use a pool stick and whack a baseball 450 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has 59 homers and it's the first couple of days in
September . . . and that's a joke,'' teammate Tom Lampkin says.
``This can't be happening. It's daily. It's nonstop. It's
continuous disbelief. We just laugh and shake our heads. There is
nothing you can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound about Roger Maris losing his hair and his
appetite during his chase of Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the case for McGwire. They call him Big Red because
of his hair and he doffed his cap to show everybody his hair is
firmly in place and said, ``It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before he hit home runs Nos. 58 and 59, McGwire went
to lunch in Fort Lauderdale with Lampkin and performed a Ruthian
feat. Babe Ruth was known for his gastronomical abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, McGwire ate a steak, a teriyaki chicken breast, a bowl of
chicken noodle soup, rice pilaf, a baked potato, a plate of salad
and washed it all down with two large jugs of iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   If he had eaten another steak, he might have hit three homers.

 &HT;    Biscuits rise to the task
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall a South Georgia friend, knowing of my taste for
old-fashioned eating, sent us a bottle of prime cane syrup. It
languished unopened on a back shelf in the pantry for almost a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have been ruled medically incorrect, my wife is
never anxious for me to indulge in the wonderful but allegedly
artery-clogging delicacies that were staples of the Southern diet
before food police ruled everything good is bad. I was surprised
when she mentioned the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why haven't you tried any of the syrup Ned sent you?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I haven't had anything to sop it with,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Being a child bride with no memories of the Great Depression,
she didn't understand why you can't just up and have syrup for
breakfast the same way you do strawberry jam, or even fig
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   You can't sop syrup with toast, or bagels. You have to have
biscuits, and biscuits in our kitchen have gone the way of running
boards on automobiles. They don't exist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I explained why it's necessary to have biscuits for breakfast if
you're going to have syrup for breakfast. I reminded her that when
I was growing up on the farm my mother always baked 10 biscuits for
my breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder your pants are always too tight,'' she said. ``In
addition to spoiling you rotten, your mother let you develop bad
eating habits.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained how my mother didn't make the big, sawmill-type
cathead biscuits they serve in places called Mama's Kountry
Kitchen. Her biscuits were classy and delicate, cut out of the
dough with a Vienna sausage can. A growing boy needed at least 10
to keep from having scrawny legs and skinny little arms, and being
too weak to learn multiplication tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ned was nice enough to send you the syrup all the way from
South Georgia you shouldn't let it go to waste,'' my wife said.
``I'll get you some biscuits.''
</P>
<P>
   I was shocked, but pleased. ``Great!'' I replied. ``You'll have
to buy a sack of self-rising flour and some lard. I don't guess you
have any buttermilk, either. Do you still have a rolling pin?''
</P>
<P>
   As my mouth began to water, I could visualize my mother at the
kitchen counter, preparing breakfast. She began by dipping several
cups of flour out of a tin canister, where the flour had been
transferred from the 25-pound sack bought at Mr. John M. Jackson's
store in Fayetteville. The sacks came decorated in flowered
patterns, so that wives and mothers could sew them into church
dresses and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The flour went into a hand-hewn wooden bowl. She added a handful
of lard and fresh buttermilk from a pitcher. After kneading the
mixture with her hands, she sprinkled flour on a wooden board and
rolled the dough into a thin sheet before cutting it into circles
with the Vienna sausage can.
</P>
<P>
   Then she lightly greased an old black pan with lard, positioned
the uncooked biscuits so they could rise separately, and popped
them into an oven heated to precisely the right temperature by
practiced application of stovewood into the fire box.
</P>
<P>
   I was elated when my wife volunteered to fix biscuits. I offered
to make the trip to the grocery store to buy flour, lard and
buttermilk. She said no. She'd go herself.
</P>
<P>
   When she got back, she didn't have flour, lard, or buttermilk.
She had a can that said, ``Hungry Jack's Flaky Biscuits. Bake in
400-degree oven for eight minutes before serving.'' The can went
`poof!' when she twisted it open, according to directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only have one,'' she said. ``The label says each
biscuit has 100 calories, and you know how you've gained weight
this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief debate, she agreed to bake two for me and one for
herself. When she turned her back to get something out of the
refrigerator, I slipped another one into the oven.
</P>
<P>
   When the eight minutes were up, I took the four biscuits out of
the oven. They were nice and brown, and just about the size of the
ones my mother cut out with the Vienna sausage can. We buttered
them hot. We opened Ned's South Georgia ribbon cane syrup, poured
it on plates, and sopped it up with the Hungry Jack's biscuits. I
was surprised when they turned out to be the best I've tasted since
our semi-farmer son's wife cooked a batch several years ago and
Edith McCalla went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly consumed my two and was about to reach for the extra
I'd slipped into the oven when my wife beat me to it. ``Ned's syrup
is very good and 100 calories are only a little more than a slice
of toast,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Syrup is habit forming. That's the reason it's almost extinct in
the modern diet. Hot biscuits with syrup are like peanuts. It's
impossible to eat just one. Scientists found a way to split an
atom, but nobody yet has figured out how to make a helping of syrup
come out even with a biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   You just have to keep on pouring syrup and reaching for biscuits
until they're both gone, and that can take a long time.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Home runs make the game
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Home runs are the most exciting part of baseball.
That's my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather see a ball hit out of the stadium than watch a
pitcher throw a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   If that shows my ignorance of the game, then so be it. Mickey
Mantle made me this way.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey was my hero. He also was my big brother. Some quirk in
the universe caused Mickey to be raised by another family in
another state and prevented the two of us from ever meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The World Champion Yankees brought Mickey up to the bigs when he
was still a teen-ager. I was 12 at the time, only months away from
being a teen-ager. It was cosmic.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle could hit the ball a mile. That's how he made it to the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling New York Yankees scout who decided to catch a summer
league game in Baxter Springs, Kans. watched in amazement as a high
school kid from nearby Commerce, Okla. hit three home runs into a
river that ran behind the ball park.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later that kid from Commerce was wearing pinstripes
and playing right field next to the ``Yankee Clipper,'' Joltin' Joe
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle was the only ball player I ever wanted to see break Babe
Ruth's home run record. The ``Sultan of Swat'' hit 60 home runs in
1927.
</P>
<P>
   It looked liked The Mick might break The Babe's record in 1956
when he hit 52 home runs. That year I played first base on my high
school team. I used a Mickey Mantle Louisville Slugger and swung
for the fence on every pitch within reach, plus an equal number no
one could reach.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1961 season, I did not want Mantle's teammate Roger
Maris to break the Bambino's home run record. That's because I
wanted my man Mantle to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it was Maris not Mantle who hit 61 in '61 and
broke Ruth's 34-year-old record. Mantle hit ``only'' 54 home runs
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I never became a well-rounded baseball player, I also
never became a well-rounded baseball fan. That's fine because the
1998 baseball season has been tailor-made for me and other fans
with stunted appreciation for the finer aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Mickey is signing baseballs for angels, or whomever,
I'm enjoying heaven on earth watching Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and
Ken Griffey Jr. launch balls into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of the sluggers. Surely McGwire and Sosa not
only will break Maris' home run record, they will smash it. Griffey
is only slightly off Maris' pace and also might break the record.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball purists, who always have something to complain about,
have three complaints designed to take the fun out of the current
home-run record chase.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that the balls appear juiced, that the players are
using drugs and that the pitching has been watered down.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the sluggers become too successful entertaining
low-brow fans such as myself, the purists complain that the
baseballs are being wound too tight or somehow doctored by the
powers that be just to jack up fan interest, as if that's something
terrible. That's a phony argument.
</P>
<P>
   The drug complaint involves the fact that McGwire and other
players take a legal, over-the-counter nutritional supplement that
they believe helps build muscle mass. Since the substance,
androstenedione, is untested, no one knows what it does, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa doesn't take it, so it's possible that the stuff doesn't do
anything. But anyway, it's legal and not banned by Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The third complaint made by baseball purists is on the money.
Due to the expansion of both leagues, there are pitchers in the
bigs whoought to be honing their skills back in double-A ball.
</P>
<P>
   Let the baseball purists stew in their own juices. Home runs are
great fun. That's my opinion.

 &HT;    Tick-born disease halts WVU quarterback
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ After a freshman year spent learning the system
at West Virginia University, former Valley View football star Andy
Keating expected to make a run at the No. 2 quarterback spot this
season.
</P>
<P>
   If practice went well, maybe, just maybe, he'd get a chance to
play in front of family and friends in the Mountaineers' biggest
game of the year Saturday against No. 1 ranked Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for Keating, who was at the very least
expected to be WVU's holder Saturday, things did not go well. After
the first day of practice in mid-August, he became violently ill,
with a fever of 103.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there it just went downhill,'' said Keating, who helped
lead Valley View to a state championship in 1996. ``I couldn't keep
anything down. I couldn't stop vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to sleep it off. But when he awoke the next morning and
collapsed while trying to get out of bed, he knew his illness was
serious.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next eight days in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Tests ruled out flu, mononucleosis, meningitis and E. coli,
Keating and WVU team trainer Dave Kerns said. Still puzzled,
doctors brought in an infectious disease specialist, Keating said,
who suspected a rare and potentially deadly tick-borne illness
called ehrlichiosis (pronounced air-LICK-i-o-sis). Ehrlichiosis is
usually transmitted by a certain type of tick or possibly by
mosquitos and is ``almost like Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain
(spotted) fever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What was odd, Keating said, is that he was told ``the tick
itself is not found in West Virginia or Ohio'' and that only about
500 cases of the disease have been documented in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he was given antibiotics to treat
ehrlichiosis and released from the hospital soon after. WVU trainer
Kerns would not confirm the ehrlichiosis diagnosis, saying doctors
still aren't ``100 percent sure'' what Keating's illness was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible we may never know,'' Kerns said. ``Or it may
come back if it was this tick-related disease.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, Keating, who lost 15 pounds during the ordeal,
appears well on his way to recovery. He's regained about five
pounds, he said, and just recently started attending classes and
team meetings. Football practice and weight lifting are off limits
for now, although he hopes to resume both in a week or two.

 &HT;    Florida pays higher prices for gas, despite country low
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in those carefree days before oil embargoes and OPEC became
seared in the national consumer consciousness, gasoline wasn't this
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   As the last big driving weekend of the summer approaches, gas
prices across the U.S. are approaching their lowest level ever when
adjusted for inflation. Local prices are at or near record lows as
well _ but Palm Beach County drivers continue to pay more for gas
than other motorists around Florida and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The average price nationally for a gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded was $1.01 on Monday, according to a weekly report by the
U.S. Department of Energy. A survey by AAA last week put the
average at $1.03 in Florida and more than $1.11 in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjusted for inflation, this year's gasoline prices are the
lowest ever,'' said Michael Burdette, who tracks prices for the
DOE's Energy Information Administration in Washington, D.C. The
only time the weekly national average was lower was one week in
March when it was a penny cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Palm Beach County, the AAA's pre-Labor Day average
of just under $1.12 a gallon is the lowest inflation-adjusted price
since the organization started tracking local prices in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For the West Palm Beach area, the only time real prices were
lower than AAA's latest $1.11 average was in March, when the
average was $1.10.
</P>
<P>
   A year before the 1973 Arab oil embargo, according to federal
government statistics, gasoline cost an average of 36.1 cents a
gallon _ the equivalent of $1.40 today. Prices peaked in 1980 and
1981 during Ayatollah Khomeini's heyday at $1.25 to $1.38 a gallon,
the equivalent of nearly $2.50 in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Experts list a variety of reasons for the plummeting pump
prices: a worldwide oil glut caused by the Asian economic crisis,
discord among members of OPEC (Oil Producing and Exporting
Countries), more cost-efficient offshore exploration and drilling
techniques _ even El Nino, which brought a milder winter and less
demand for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, those factors have lowered average prices by
23 cents nationally. In Palm Beach County, pre-Labor Day prices
this year are 22 to 23 cents lower than a year ago, according to
AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County's consistently higher prices led Florida
Attorney General Bob Butterworth to launch a price-fixing
investigation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After several months, he found no conspiracy but concluded Palm
Beach County motorists pay more because there isn't as much
competition among major oil companies as in other parts of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth also found more ``consumer price insensitivity''
among local drivers than other Floridians. In other words, gas
stations can charge higher prices because locals seem willing to
pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this pricier market, several outlets were selling gas
for less than $1 a gallon this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine cents a gallon is pretty good,'' said Will
Seaberry at a suburban West Palm Beach Texaco station charging 99.9
cents per gallon for self-serve regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been delighted,'' said Barbara Keller while pumping the
sub-$1 fuel into her Dodge Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Local prices vary widely. While many convenience stores and
independent stations are a few pennies below $1 a gallon, a Shell
station west of Boca Raton was charging $1.59 this week for a
gallon of self-serve regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was a 14-cent price spread within shouting
distance of the Texaco where Seaberry and Keller tanked up at the
intersection of Forest Hill Boulevard and Military Trail.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texaco charged 99.9 cents, the independent Banks
Service Center on the other side of Forest Hill charged 97.9 cents,
a BP station diagonally across the intersection charged $1.07 and a
Shell station across Military Trail charged $1.12.
</P>
<P>
   At the BP station, manager Joe Garza looked at the sub-$1 prices
and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texaco shouldn't be doing what he's doing,'' Garza said.
``He's trying to make like a war, but we aren't going to play that.
These two guys (Texaco and Banks) have been at it for two or three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price wars, the Shell station was busiest during the
hour a reporter visited this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to the prices,'' said Shell customer
Mike Jones of West Palm Beach, illustrating the ``consumer price
insensitivity'' Butterworth described.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's price insensitivity, or maybe it's heightened
sensitivity to other factors.
</P>
<P>
   For Hector Guajardo, who had been driving east on Forest Hill,
the ease of making a right turn into the Shell station made it
worth paying 14 cents a gallon more than crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other one, you have to turn (left) or make a U-turn,''
Guajardo said, pointing to the less-expensive station. ``If they
were right next to each other, of course I would take the least
expensive one.''

 &HT;    Advertisers show interest in PAX TV debut
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAX TV won the lottery this week.
</P>
<P>
   Not the state's $6 million Lotto prize, but an advertising
contract for the Florida Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Because of better-than-expected Nielsen ratings that PAX TV has
generated since its launch Monday, local advertisers have taken
note.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lottery, three more new advertisers signed on by
Wednesday in the West Palm Beach market, according to Roger Koch,
station manager at WPXP-Channel 67.
</P>
<P>
   The station has about 30 contracts with advertisers including,
Hulett Pest Control, Schumacher Automotive and Rapids Water Park,
Koch said. According to one advertiser, the spots range from $30 to
$150.
</P>
<P>
   But one advertiser got an even better deal. A Carl's Furniture
commercial aired Wednesday night at no cost _ a trial run while the
South Florida retailer and the station are in negotiations, Koch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl's is ``the exception, because of the potential dollars they
can spend with us. They are a top 10 advertiser in the market,''
Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida furniture company has 14 stores in areas from
Stuart to Kendall, according to Carl's Advertising Director Gary
Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at whether or not we're going to put them into
our annual mix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PAX, whose parent is Paxson Communications (AMEX: PAX, $10.31)
in West Palm Beach, has promised viewers and advertisers its
programming will be free of sex and violence and provide viewing
for the family. The foundation of its programming are reruns of
Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The target viewers are women age 25 to 54, a demographic that's
a close match to what Carl's is looking for, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a couple months before Carl's decides whether to buy
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy on an annual basis,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``We'll make
these decisions in October and November. If they do numbers, it'll
be a good buy,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that PAX doesn't have to do big numbers to be
successful. ``They do 2s (in ratings) and a lot of people are going
to buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research's overnight ratings of PAX's prime time
programming Wednesday was 2.1 in the West Palm Beach market. And
while the rating service has not provided a national rating for PAX
yet, a Paxson-devised measure put it at 1.4 on a national basis.
Both were nearly the same as the first night's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Barnette, of Barnette Advertising Group in West Palm Beach,
said he bought a three-month contract with WPXP on behalf of

 &HT;    Advertisers show interest in PAX TV debut
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAX TV won the lottery this week.
</P>
<P>
   Not the state's $6 million Lotto prize, but an advertising
contract for the Florida Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Because of better-than-expected Nielsen ratings that PAX TV has
generated since its launch Monday, local advertisers have taken
note.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lottery, three more new advertisers signed on by
Wednesday in the West Palm Beach market, according to Roger Koch,
station manager at WPXP-Channel 67.
</P>
<P>
   The station has about 30 contracts with advertisers including,
Hulett Pest Control, Schumacher Automotive and Rapids Water Park,
Koch said. According to one advertiser, the spots range from $30 to
$150.
</P>
<P>
   But one advertiser got an even better deal. A Carl's Furniture
commercial aired Wednesday night at no cost _ a trial run while the
South Florida retailer and the station are in negotiations, Koch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl's is ``the exception, because of the potential dollars they
can spend with us. They are a top 10 advertiser in the market,''
Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida furniture company has 14 stores in areas from
Stuart to Kendall, according to Carl's Advertising Director Gary
Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at whether or not we're going to put them into
our annual mix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PAX, whose parent is Paxson Communications (AMEX: PAX, $10.31)
in West Palm Beach, has promised viewers and advertisers its
programming will be free of sex and violence and provide viewing
for the family. The foundation of its programming are reruns of
Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The target viewers are women age 25 to 54, a demographic that's
a close match to what Carl's is looking for, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a couple months before Carl's decides whether to buy
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy on an annual basis,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``We'll make
these decisions in October and November. If they do numbers, it'll
be a good buy,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that PAX doesn't have to do big numbers to be
successful. ``They do 2s (in ratings) and a lot of people are going
to buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research's overnight ratings of PAX's prime time
programming Wednesday was 2.1 in the West Palm Beach market. And
while the rating service has not provided a national rating for PAX
yet, a Paxson-devised measure put it at 1.4 on a national basis.
Both were nearly the same as the first night's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Barnette, of Barnette Advertising Group in West Palm Beach,
said he bought a three-month contract with WPXP on behalf of
Schumacher Automotive. Barnette wouldn't say what the ads cost, but
said the range for spots on stations in this market was wide: from
$20 to $4,000 for each spot.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rice, marketing director and co-star of advertisements for
Hulett Environmental Services, bought a year's worth of
advertisements, with prices ranging from $30 for a daytime spot to
$150 for an ad in prime time.
</P>

the pest control company likes to play to homeowners because its
business is residential.

 &HT;    Pratt shutting down Riviera's Turbo Power
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Pratt &AMP; Whitney will close its Turbo Power
and Marine Systems subsidiary in Riviera Beach, Florida, leaving as
many as 52 employees without jobs, the company said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Turbo Power makes industrial gas turbine generators for
electrical power stationsplants. The small stepsister of Pratt's
huge Large Military Engines and Space Propulsion units in
northwestern Palm Beach County appears to be the first local
casualty of Pratt's plans to restructure its operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the workers are members of Local 971 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Its
secretary-treasurer, Paul Strand, said the company pledged to try
to absorb some of the positions at its sprawling plant on the
Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best we can hope for is for them to absorb some of those
folks into (the Beeline) facility. According to their memo, they
said they would try,'' Strand said.
</P>
<P>
   The average pay of an hourly worker at Turbo Power is $20 an
hour, Strand said.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt spokesman Gary Minor said the volume of Turbo Power
production has been flat and the company can't justify keeping the
plant open. It has faced increasing competition from ABB Group of
Sweden, Rolls-Royce of England and General Electric, and couldn't
improve its already low market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been a particularly strong business for Pratt &AMP;
Whitney. The demand just hasn't been there for our product,'' Minor
said. ``We've always had single-digit market share. We're not a
significant player in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will try to relocate some of the workers, but others
will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about severance and outplacement assistance
now,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   Minor emphasized that Turbo Power's closing isn't an indication
of Pratt's intentions with its remote jet-engine and rocket plant,
where it employs 4,900 as Palm Beach County's largest employer.
Rumors have circulated for months that the company will lay off
workers, MOME design teams or the entire plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not associated with any rumors related to the closing
of the Large Military Engine and Space facility. It's actually a
wholly owned subsidiary of Pratt. No other decisions have been
made,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. Lawton Chiles and Pratt President Karl Krapek
have agreed to drop their meeting at the Farnborough Air Show in
England next week. Krapek had invited Chiles to meet after the
governor had called him with concerns about the company moving its
Florida operation to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor and Karl have agreed that no meeting is required
at this point,'' Minor said, because no other decisions on the
local plant have been made.

   Nuclear plant sends improper letters to environmental panel
</P>
<P>
   By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ There's a fine line between the wonders of technology
and the blunders of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Utilities, a Dallas-based electric utility, and the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission learned that lesson this
week. As a result, officials are scrambling to salvage a
two-year-old legal case involving a proposed disposal site for
low-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder began when Jim Kelley, vice president of nuclear
engineering for Texas Utilities, urged employees of the company's
Comanche Peak nuclear power plant to write the state's three
environmental commissioners in support of the disposal site.
Conveniently, his memorandum included the electronic-mail addresses
of the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails, propelled by the click of a computer mouse button
and the wonders of the Internet, arrived Monday and Tuesday when
Chairman Barry McBee and commissioners John Baker and Ralph Marquez
logged onto their computers.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem: It's illegal for a party in a
pending legal matter to communicate directly with the
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake, frankly,'' said Eric Schmitt, a spokesman
for Texas Utilities. ``It was an innocent mistake. There was no
intent to try to short-circuit the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The violation is a serious one and in theory could require the
case to be thrown out and restarted from scratch, said Geoff
Connor, the conservation commission's general counsel. But the
infraction appears to be curable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Connor notified all parties in the case and gave
them until Sept. 18 to file legal briefs in response to the
e-mails, which argued that the site was geologically safe and that
it would have positive social and economic impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners are expected to decide later this year whether
to grant a license to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Authority to build and operate a landfill near Sierra
Blanca, 90 miles southeast of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Two state hearing examiners recommended last month that the
commissioners reject the application because of questions about a
geologic fault and inadequate examination of socioeconomic issues.
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday enacted a measure allowing Maine and
Vermont to ship waste to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the conservation commissioners function in a
quasi-judicial role. Much like judges, they are not supposed to
receive communications from parties in a pending case unless those
communications take place in a formal public session or are
submitted in writing simultaneously to all parties in the case.
</P>
<P>
   David Frederick, a lawyer representing the Sierra Club Legal
Defense Fund and other opponents of the waste site, said Texas
Utilities officials ``got caught with their hand in the cookie
jar.'' He said the incident did not seem to warrant starting the
case from scratch, however.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Caroom, a lawyer for the disposal authority, said he
doubted the e-mails raised any issues that had not come up in a
two-month hearing earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first instance of improper communication at the
environmental agency under the Bush administration, Connor said.
Staff members routinely screen letters, faxes and phone calls to
the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is not screened,'' Connor said. ``It just pops up on
their computers. E-mail is a very useful tool, and I wouldn't want
to unduly restrict its use. But that's obviously something we have
to think about.''

 &HT;    Woodworkers' 'jewels' have grain, reveal painstaking delicacy
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now for something completely different:
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry. Wooden jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry by its very name connotes precious metals and stones,
but it has come to mean virtually any sort of personal adornment,
and you'd be surprised, perhaps, at how many woodworkers are making
jewelry, and how striking so much of it can be.
</P>
<P>
   All this is embodied in a new book from Sterling entitled ``The
Art of Making Fine Wood Jewelry,'' by Tony Lydgate, who made his
reputation on boxes designed to hold jewelry. The book, one of
Sterling's more lavish publications with lots of color
illustrations, is $19.95 in softcover. As far as I know it's the
only book extant on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The book covers the work of two dozen people. Some of it is not
difficult, in a technical sense, at all, providing your hands and
eyes are up to such fiddly work. Mine are not.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a single simple project is outlined. However, the
book fortunately doesn't waste space trying to teach you things
like turning on the lathe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the makers in this book use built-up laminate blocks as
the starting point for their jewelry. This is a simple matter of
selecting a bunch of thin strips of constrasting woods and veneers,
deciding upon a happy sequence for them, and glueing them up. Once
the block is ready, pieces are cut out of it at angles and put
together, sometimes with pieces from other blocks, to make the
finished pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The only technical problem here is, of course, absolutely
perfect and virtually invisible glue joints in the laminates. The
technique, of course, is perfect for rapid production.
</P>
<P>
   The many ways in which these laminates can be used is
fascinating. One maker, David Marson of Arkansas, makes very
intricate laminates and uses the end grain as a face, resulting in
work that is reminiscent of the rosettes in fine, if somewhat
gaudy, guitars.
</P>
<P>
   There are several turners represented, including that well-known
mistress of the miniature lathe, Bonnie Klein. Her work is quite
fine, but I like it no better than that of Mark Burhans, a young
midwesterner I met several years ago in St. Paul. Mark works in
spalled wooods, making every simple but very elegent pins and
buttons. Most charming are his tiny flower vase pins, into which
live wildflowers may be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Shinichi Miyazaki makes a variety of work, ranging from
bracelets to small boxes, but most elegant of all are his small
combs.
</P>
<P>
   A young man with the unlikely name of T. Breeze VerDant uses
exquisite marquetry for his pins, which are among the most striking
work in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pieces appear to be shaped using a belt sander, but
a few are carefully carved. Chief among these are the fetish
jewelry _ exquisitely carved figurines of animals or objects _ of
Pat Metheny, the largely abstract work of William Chappelow, and
the tiny birds and musical instruments of Karen Scates.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of mixed media, most spectacular is the work of
Mindy and Larry King: insects with bodies of wood and appendages
made of wire.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful work in this scale is done in very
fine-grained wood; there are a few pieces here done in
coarse-grained wood which simply don't look right.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, much of what is in this book could be done in a
minimum of space and with very few tools; a bandsaw, a small belt
sander, perhaps a couple of good bench planes and some other
standard hand tools. It's just one more good way to get into
woodworking without hocking the family heirlooms.

 &HT;    VOC Analytical buyout saves 45 jobs
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ A buyout of VOC Analytical's assets in a
bankruptcy liquidation will save 45 jobs in Palm Beach County, but
holders of the company's stock weren't as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, Massachusetts-based U.S. Biosystems, is a private
pharmaceutical company in Wellesley, Mass. It produces drugs for
diagnostic imaging and plans to expand the Boca Raton operation to
add pharmaceuticals to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to build onto the facilities we already have,''
said John Connors, who is chairman of Biosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Raton operation, which was the first company to move
into the Florida Atlantic University research park, does
environmental testing for companies trying to comply with state and
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Biosystems bought the assets of VOC for $1.5 million from
Comerica Bank and Brown &AMP; Caldwell, an environmental consulting
firm in California. The two were VOC's secured creditors who took
possession of the assets after foreclosing on collateral from loans
to VOC.
</P>
<P>
   Biosystems, which employs 70 people, bought VOC's operation on
July 25, three days after the VOC Chapter 11 bankruptcy case was
converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding to liquidate its assets. VOC
had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Biosystems, Palm Beach County would have lost
45 jobs. Every person was rehired,'' said Alex Moreno, former chief
executive of VOC. Biosystems also hired Moreno as the manager of
its Boca Raton operation.
</P>
<P>
   The holders of the company's 5.9 million shares probably won't
be compensated. They are below unsecured creditors in the pecking
order of who receives money as a result of the sale of assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders? They won't get anything unless someone buys the
corporate shell,'' said U. S. Bankruptcy Trustee Patricia
Dzikowski.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy case remains open to administer any assets other
than the physical assets already sold, to pursue claims and to
resolve legal challenges, Dzikowski said. VOC's registration as a
publicly traded company remains in effect and could be sold to pay
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of inquiries. We've talked to them and they
haven't come back with anything concrete,'' Dzikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   One legal issue to be resolved is whether federal and state
regulators will receive money from any fines as a result of the
company's pleading guilty to unlawful disposal of hazardous waste
this week. The decision will be announced on Nov. 13.

 &HT;    Paramount improves Kings Island
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of its third biggest weekend of the year, Paramount's
Kings Island announced plans to add a new roller coaster and a
free-fall drop ride.
</P>
<P>
   The projects are part of a $40 million capital-improvement
program slated to take place over the next two years. Park
officials said the proposed projects are Kings Island's largest
investment since it was constructed for $35 million 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new rides are: _ Face/Off: Company officials said the
coaster will have paired sets of seats which face each other.
Riders of the hanging roller coaster will go over a 138-foot hill,
fly through a 72-foot loop, a boomerang with two inversions and up
another hill at 55 mph. They then repeat the ride backwards. _ Drop
Zone: A 315-foot free-fall ride, Drop Zone lifts and spins riders
on a 30-foot ring outfitted with 40 seats up more than 26 stories
and then drops them in a 67 mph free fall. Park officials bill the
ride as the world's largest ``gyro-drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sort of set up a reputation or expectation for world
record thrill rides and we're just building on that reputation,''
park spokeswoman Barbara Colnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Colnar said the investment also includes construction of a third
ride, but she declined further details.
</P>
<P>
   Both rides will be placed at the park's northwest end. Plans
call for the park to recondition the area to resemble a movie
studio's backlot and rename it the Paramount Action Zone. The Top
Gun and King Cobra roller coasters, which sit near the proposed new
rides, will undergo cosmetic changes to fit in with the new theme,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials declined to say how much the projects will cost
individually. The park sits on 712 acres, only 237 of which are
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Crews expect work on Face/Off to start next week and conclude
before the park's April opening. Drop Zone will be ready by
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day weekend stands as the park's third busiest time of
year. But holiday weekends typically do not attract the size crowds
one would expect since most people prefer to attend other events
such as family barbecues, Colnar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before (Memorial Day) and after Labor Day, it's really
Cincinnati and Dayton's park,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the smaller crowds, people traveling to Kings Island or
its neighbor, The Beach Waterpark, can expect slow going this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State Patrol Lt. R. Scott Borden said Labor Day usually
means heavy traffic around King's Island and The Beach. However an
effort to consolidate two exit ramps into one will slow traffic
even more this weekend, Borden said. Crews are combining two exit
ramps from Interstate 71 at Ohio 741 into a single, multi-lane
ramp, a project slated for completion in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, the weekends have been bad there all summer,''
Borden said.

   To offset this, the OSP's Lebanon post will station two troopers
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. _ the heaviest traffic time _at the exit
ramps to manually control traffic lights and prevent traffic from
backing up onto I-71.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the inconvenience, Borden suggests travelers factor
in construction delays and practice patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get angry,'' he said. ``Everybody is doing everything
they can. Getting angry just affects your driving rationale and
affects the nice day you had planned with the family.''

 &HT;    Sampras, Agassi, Rusedski need extra sets
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pete Sampras needed four sets against a wild card
fresh out of Stanford who is friendly with first daughter Chelsea
Clinton. Andre Agassi took five to beat a 45th-ranked Frenchman
with a home in Boca Raton. And sixth seed Greg Rusedski held off a
match point to win in five sets for the second round in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from those few struggles, most of the top players
remain in both the men's and women's draws at the U.S. Open
entering the fifth day of play. On the men's side, just three of
the 16 seeds have lost with half of the second round left.
</P>
<P>
   The women didn't even have that much trouble: top seed Martina
Hingis, second seed Lindsay Davenport, fifth seed Venus Williams
and 15th seed Anna Kournikova all won in straight sets Thursday.
And the only women's seed not to reach the third round was Ai
Sugiyama, the 16th seed who retired from her second-round match
with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been weird because in other tournaments there have been
a lot of upsets and a lot of close matches,'' said Davenport, who
beat 35-year-old Lori McNeil 6-1, 6-1. ``You can't control things
like that and I don't know what the reason is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the No. 1 seed and four-time champion, also didn't have
an explanation for the number of seeds remaining. He considered
fourth seed Petr Korda's first-round loss a big upset, but the only
other seeds missing are Alberto Berasategui (15) and Albert Costa
(16).
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who last won here in 1996, played a tight match against
Stanford graduate Paul Goldstein, member of a record four NCAA
championship teams. He won 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein, 22, didn't allow Sampras, 27, any service break
opportunities and lost just a handful of points on his own serve in
the first two sets. The crowd eagerly got behind the underdog,
making the match even more enjoyable for Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect going out there,'' he said.
``Part of me know I should feel I should win. Part of me wanted to
keep him out there at least an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein never really felt he could win. That matched
Sampras' feelings, which appeared in the third set when he moved
better and played more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was really in risk of losing the match,'' he
said. ``It was one of those days where I wasn't playing that great
and I just needed to find a way (to win).''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had to do the same thing, and it took him four minutes
less than three hours to fend off outstanding play by France's
Guillaume Raoux. Agassi eased by Raoux in the first two sets, then
had his serve broken early in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the eighth seed and the 1994 Open winner, earned the
break back but lost the set in a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real frustrated at myself for a period of the fourth set
for not executing my shots in the tiebreaker, and I lost my serve
early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth set, Agassi fought off a break point in the
first game and then seemed to cruise, as Raoux increased his
errors. Agassi won 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, a finalist here last year before losing to Patrick
Rafter, played Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, the second unseeded opponent
to take the Canadian to five sets. Ulihrach, 23, stretched Rusedski
to 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 and two hours, 50 minutes to earn the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski injured his ankle just before Wimbledon and had taken
two months off before the Open. He thinks the time off contributed
to his two long early matches. In the first round, he defeated
Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4. He plays Jan
Siemerink, ranked 21, next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never won two matches in five sets in a row before so
that just gives you more confidence,'' Rusedski said. ``Two days
ago, (I fought off) two match points. Today it was one so hopefully
there won't be any more.''

 &HT;    Minority recruiting gap delays police cadet class
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin Police Department officials say they are
seriously lagging in their attempts to recruit more minority
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Their inability to attract African Americans, Hispanics and
women to the department, despite a big pay and benefits increase
approved earlier this year, is one of the reasons a November cadet
class has been postponed until January.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the lack of success range from competition by big
corporations to a distrust of the police in some parts of town,
according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more black female applicants and just a lot more
females in general,'' said Lt. Joy Mooney, an African American
officer who heads recruiting for the department. ``A minority can
do more inside the police force to correct attitudes by the
community than they can from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight cadet classes that have graduated since January
1995, 13 percent of the applicants were Hispanic _ 7 percentage
points lower than the department's goal. Nine percent of the
applicants were black, compared with the 11 percent recruiters were
hoping to get.
</P>
<P>
   While officials have struggled to make at least 20 percent of
the applicants women, only 12 percent of the applicants to the past
eight cadet classes were women, according to police figures.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Police Officer Catherine Haggerty, a 16-year veteran of
the force, said police work ``has been and still is a
male-dominated world, and that in itself may discourage some
women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From television, the public gets the perception that we are
tough and throw people around and wield guns and run down the
street,'' said Haggerty, president of the Austin Police Women's
Association. ``This makes some women less inclined to look at it as
a profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Although female recruits are especially sought by the department
these days, officers are combing minority neighborhoodsseeking
African Americans and Hispanics of either gender.
</P>
<P>
   Minority recruitment has been difficult because of sometimes
troubled relationships between police and minority communities.
Harsh feelings still linger from a 1995 Valentine's party on Cedar
Avenue in East Austin that ended with the mainly African American
party-goers scuffling with police.
</P>
<P>
   Party organizers called police to remove a suspected gang member
from the gathering, and 80 officers responded after an officer was
injured. Several of the teen-agers also were injured, and some
accused officers of using excessive force and racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit some party-goers filed against the police department
was settled out of court in July, with police admitting no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who read about things like Cedar Avenue are focusing on
isolated instances,'' said Senior Sgt. Joe Munoz, head of Amigos en
Azul (Friends in Blue), which represents more than 150 Hispanic
officers in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems have occurred, but these situations have involved all
colors, so everybody has to deal with (distrust),'' he said.
``Regardless of what's happened in the past, the police chief (Stan
Knee) has made it clear that fair treatment is a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, veteran black and Hispanic officers are spending
time in neighborhoods scouting for promising young African American
and Hispanic adults they feel would make good cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this individualized approach will work,'' Munoz said.
``It's got to. The biggest problem we have with recruiting
minorities is not problems like Cedar Avenue. It's competition from
corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people are asking themselves, `Why be a cop and
work night shifts and get shot at when you can go to work for Dell
or Motorola?''' he said. ``We've got to show them that we've got a
pretty good salary and benefits program and that police work is
extremely satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those face-to-face recruitment drives will occur Sept. 12
at the Austin Area Urban League Center. Officers will brief
interested people on requirements for being an officer, including
the types of tests given and the 28-week academy training course.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney said she hopes the the Urban League gathering and similar
programs will bolster the number of minorities in the postponed
class, which starts Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for delaying the class is to give training
officers a chance to add new curriculum and training methods to the
cadet courses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the possibilities being studied by academy commander Jim
Fealy is working the concept of community policing into every
aspect of police training.
</P>
<P>
   Community policing allows officers to get to know residents on
their beats and solve problems before they become crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we teach community policing as one block course,''
Fealy said.
</P>
<P>
   Postponement of the fall cadet class will not interfere with
producing enough cadets to reach the department's goal of having
more than 1,111 officers by next fall, according to police
spokeswoman Sally Muir. The department had 1,048 officers as of
late July. The total fluctuates day to day.

 &HT;    Agassi may cut Davis Cup ties
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Poor decision-making and players' lack of control has
ruined Andre Agassi's view of Davis Cup, and he's so frustrated he
may never play for the United States again.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi already had said he won't play the upcoming match against
Italy because the USTA-selected location conflicts with an event
for his charity foundation. He will not play the final round
either, if the team wins in Milwaukee on Sept. 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was in my backyard, I wouldn't walk out the back door to
play,'' Agassi said Thursday. ``I have heard a lot of apologies in
the last number of years ... (but) if you are really sorry about
something, be sorry enough to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup has suffered from numerous problems in the past 10
years, including many players' refusal to play, a team captain
dispute, high ticket prices and refusing to let players make more
decisions _ from team captain to site selection. The USTA handles
U.S. Davis Cup issues.
</P>
<P>
   World No.1 Pete Sampras did not play the first two matches of
the year, won't play the third and probably will not play a final.
Michael Chang also hasn't played this year. He has no tournament
conflicts with the Italy match but wants to continue getting
healthy and has told captain Tom Gullikson he won't be available.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves 27th-ranked Todd Martin as the top player available.
Possibilities to join him are: Justin Gimelstob (ranked 89th and
injured), Jan-Michael Gambill (57), Boca Raton's Vince Spadea (42)
and Richey Reneberg as a doubles partner for Martin. Davis Cup
stalwart Jim Courier is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a good chance (to win),'' Agassi said. ``(But)
there is going to be a guy playing there that hasn't played before
and we have got to ask Todd to come through with three points, and
that is asking a lot under any conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Each win in a Davis Cup match equals one point.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi doesn't expect anything to change, because these are
issues he has complained about, publicly and privately, on many
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patching it up: Venus Williams wore the required Corel WTA
Tour patch on her neon-green cut-out dress, a decision she
discussed only briefly after her match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I always wear the patch when I play,'' she said.
``I wasn't sending any messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok left the decision on how to handle the controversy to
Williams. She didn't wear the patch in her first match Tuesday and
was fined $100. Reebok said it would violate her contract to wear a
patch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' first-round dress was strapless, but the second-round
dress had shoulder straps with room for the patch. Williams put it
sideways on the top of one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _ Safin advances: Unseeded Russian teenager Marat Safin easily
defeated unseeded American teenager Taylor Dent in a battle of
probable future stars.
</P>
<P>
   Safin, 18, won 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) behind 35 winners. Dent, son
of former Australian player Phil Dent, made 29 unforced errors and
never got a chance to break Safin's serve.
</P>
<P>
   Dent, 17, was playing in his first tournament as a professional.
He entered his first grand slam with a wild card, meaning he can
keep the $18,000 prize money. The Newport Beach, Calif., player
reached the second round when his first-round opponent retired with
cramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really played as well as I can at this level yet,''
Dent said. ``I'm a little inexperienced.''

 &HT;    Bastrop debates shirttail ruckus
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nearly 300 Bastrop High School students, parents
and administrators gathered recently to speak, listen and learn
more about a controversial dress-code rule requiring students to
tuck in their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which was written into the district's dress code this
summer in an effort to make it easier for school officials to spot
concealed weapons, had not been strictly enforced at the high
school during the first two weeks of classes. Earlier this week,
however, teachers began enforcing the rule, prompting some students
to speak out against it.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which was called after more than 100 students
walked out of their second-period classes and marched from the high
school to the district's administration building, was intended to
be a dialogue on the issue, not a meeting to change the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to consider what you've said,'' said Bastrop
Superintendent John Walch. ``I purposefully tried to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Walch said the rule will be considered at a previously scheduled
school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At least two-dozen speakers _ students and parents _ took the
podium in the school cafeteria to voice opinions and suggestions
about the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Richardson, a parent, said a rule requiring shirts to be
tucked in is too controlling and takes away students' freedom to be
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``School controls their life almost 100 percent these days,''
she said. ``Taking away their freedom of wearing their shirt
untucked is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said she has a thin daughter and a larger daughter.
The rule, which school officials had said would be flexibly applied
to pregnant and obese students, discriminated against her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thin daughter is being punished, and my other one is not,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, Hector Hernandez, beamed with pride over his
children's participation in the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, am I proud that my kids are in Bastrop High School and
they're doing things the American way,'' said Hernandez, a Bastrop
truck driver who had just returned from a trip. But not everyone
said they believed the rule is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Milliken, a father of two boys, was one of about three
speakers who had a different perspective on tucking in shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly agree with the rule, but I prefer a stricter
version of it,'' said Milliken, who has one son at Bastrop High and
another in a San Marcos boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule not only encourages respectable appearance, but it
encourages discipline,'' Milliken said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniforms would be an even better idea, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of uniforms appeared deplorable to many of the
students who took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is your uniform, ma'am?'' student Michelina Fideli said
to one woman who had just advocated uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meeting was peppered with sometimes disruptive
applause, school officials were generally pleased with the results
and looked forward to finding a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they will go away from here knowing we do listen,''
said Bastrop High Principal James Richardson.

 &HT;    Southwestern will unveil new building in October
 &HT;    By Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Southwestern University unveils its new
campus center next month, the white limestone building will mark
one of the final steps in a decade-long push to upgrade facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of construction has long filtered throughout the
liberal arts college's rolling grounds, as crews replaced a women's
dormitory, added a recreation center, built on-campus apartments,
erected an academic building and cleared playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   A 24,000-square-foot science building expansion will be finished
later this year, and an expanded fine arts center will open next
summer _ all this as the university prepares to celebrate the 100th
anniversary Tuesday of the oldest structure on campus, the Cullen
Building.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Leadership 2000, the university's $75 million
campaign that includes scholarship funds and $42 million in new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the buzz of saws and rumble of tractors on campus aren't
because of a booming student population. While full-time enrollment
and faculty at Southwestern have increased 30 percent over the last
two decades, school leaders decided in the 1980s to cap enrollment
at about 1,200 to maintain quality and a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   That's been difficult. Last year saw an enrollment of 1,215
students and the largest graduating class ever _ 284. This year,
the university, which has received national recognition as an
outstanding liberal arts college, accepted 378 incoming freshmen,
up from 334 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added buildings not because we we're growing, but
because we wanted to enhance programs in academic and student
life,'' said Marilyn Rhoads Mock, vice president for university
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Red &AMP; Charline McCombs Campus Center was among half a dozen
construction projects outlined in the Leadership 2000 plan. From
the outside, the center resembles most other campus buildings _
white limestone, built in the Richardsonian-Roman- esque style,
found in many of the state's old county courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   But that old-fashioned style stops at the center's door. A
Starbucks coffee shop will peddle espresso and pastries inside, and
students will lounge on beanbag chairs in front of a 120-inch TV
screen. A food-court-style dining area, with lines where cooks
prepare food as diners watch, will cater to dorm residents, and a
marble fireplace and overstuffed furniture will beckon visitors who
just want to relax.
</P>
<P>
   A ballroom, meeting rooms, student activities area, bookstore
and post office also are part of the 62,000-square-foot facility,
which is more than twice the size of the school's old student
union. That building, built in the 1960s, was torn down to make way
for the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wish list was fulfilled,'' said student Charles
Boehm, public relations chairman for the student government.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm will work in the new building as a staffer on the The
Megaphone, the campus newspaper that has been temporarily housed at
the college's old animal behavior lab.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Connally, student body president, said the new center is
long-awaited. ``Not having a central meeting place for students has
been hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red McCombs, chairman of the university's board of trustees,
donated $6 million toward construction of the $11.5 million
facility and headed the Leadership 2000 fund-raising project. The
San Antonio businessman said the new center will become the
heartbeat of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this center means to the 1,200 students is, this is their
dining room, living room and den,'' McCombs said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect to serve the first meal at the center on Oct.
5. An open house is planned for Oct. 9-11, and a dedication
ceremony is set for Oct. 17, said Jaime Woody, director of student
activities and summer conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at first hoped to renovate the existing student union,
said Richard Anderson, vice president for fiscal affairs. But, he
said, ``Because of structural problems with that building, we
decided we couldn't save it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a common problem at older campuses. And Southwestern,
which formed when four small Methodist colleges built in the 1840s
merged, is one of the oldest in the state. First called Texas
University in 1873, it gave up that name in 1875 so the state could
name its own public institution the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni are proud to point out that Southwestern beat UT-Austin
in the first college baseball game ever played in the state, in
1884.
</P>
<P>
   But the school struggled during the Great Depression, and the
administration couldn't guarantee it would stay open from one year
to the next. The turnaround came during World War II, when the War
Department awarded the campus a naval training unit.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment grew slowly from 600 in 1958 to 1,000 in 1978 and
1,200 today. That could change as faculty develop a new plan to
lead the school into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that rather than trying to become a grandiose school
and try to compete in size, we'll put our money into quality
educational components,'' said William B. Jones, acting provost and
dean of faculty.

 &HT;    Southwestern will unveil new building in October
 &HT;    By Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Southwestern University unveils its new
campus center next month, the white limestone building will mark
one of the final steps in a decade-long push to upgrade facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of construction has long filtered throughout the
liberal arts college's rolling grounds, as crews replaced a women's
dormitory, added a recreation center, built on-campus apartments,
erected an academic building and cleared playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   A 24,000-square-foot science building expansion will be finished
later this year, and an expanded fine arts center will open next
summer _ all this as the university prepares to celebrate the 100th
anniversary Tuesday of the oldest structure on campus, the Cullen
Building.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Leadership 2000, the university's $75 million
campaign that includes scholarship funds and $42 million in new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the buzz of saws and rumble of tractors on campus aren't
because of a booming student population. While full-time enrollment
and faculty at Southwestern have increased 30 percent over the last
two decades, school leaders decided in the 1980s to cap enrollment
at about 1,200 to maintain quality and a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   That's been difficult. Last year saw an enrollment of 1,215
students and the largest graduating class ever _ 284. This year,
the university, which has received national recognition as an
outstanding liberal arts college, accepted 378 incoming freshmen,
up from 334 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added buildings not because we we're growing, but
because we wanted to enhance programs in academic and student
life,'' said Marilyn Rhoads Mock, vice president for university
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Red &AMP; Charline McCombs Campus Center was among half a dozen
construction projects outlined in the Leadership 2000 plan. From
the outside, the center resembles most other campus buildings _
white limestone, built in the Richardsonian-Roman- esque style,
found in many of the state's old county courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   But that old-fashioned style stops at the center's door. A
Starbucks coffee shop will peddle espresso and pastries inside, and
students will lounge on beanbag chairs in front of a 120-inch TV
screen. A food-court-style dining area, with lines where cooks
prepare food as diners watch, will cater to dorm residents, and a
marble fireplace and overstuffed furniture will beckon visitors who
just want to relax.
</P>
<P>
   A ballroom, meeting rooms, student activities area, bookstore
and post office also are part of the 62,000-square-foot facility,
which is more than twice the size of the school's old student
union. That building, built in the 1960s, was torn down to make way
for the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wish list was fulfilled,'' said student Charles
Boehm, public relations chairman for the student government.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm will work in the new building as a staffer on the The
Megaphone, the campus newspaper that has been temporarily housed at
the college's old animal behavior lab.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Connally, student body president, said the new center is
long-awaited. ``Not having a central meeting place for students has
been hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red McCombs, chairman of the university's board of trustees,
donated $6 million toward construction of the $11.5 million
facility and headed the Leadership 2000 fund-raising project. The
San Antonio businessman said the new center will become the
heartbeat of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this center means to the 1,200 students is, this is their
dining room, living room and den,'' McCombs said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect to serve the first meal at the center on Oct.
5. An open house is planned for Oct. 9-11, and a dedication
ceremony is set for Oct. 17, said Jaime Woody, director of student
activities and summer conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at first hoped to renovate the existing student union,
said Richard Anderson, vice president for fiscal affairs. But, he
said, ``Because of structural problems with that building, we
decided we couldn't save it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a common problem at older campuses. And Southwestern,
which formed when four small Methodist colleges built in the 1840s
merged, is one of the oldest in the state. First called Texas
University in 1873, it gave up that name in 1875 so the state could
name its own public institution the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni are proud to point out that Southwestern beat UT-Austin
in the first college baseball game ever played in the state, in
1884.
</P>
<P>
   But the school struggled during the Great Depression, and the
administration couldn't guarantee it would stay open from one year
to the next. The turnaround came during World War II, when the War
Department awarded the campus a naval training unit.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment grew slowly from 600 in 1958 to 1,000 in 1978 and
1,200 today. That could change as faculty develop a new plan to
lead the school into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that rather than trying to become a grandiose school
and try to compete in size, we'll put our money into quality
educational components,'' said William B. Jones, acting provost and
dean of faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The new campus center is an example of just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to do something for cohesion of faculty and
students on campus,'' Jones said. ``It's almost what you would call
a little village. I think it's going to improve what is already a
good spirit on campus, make it more intimate.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- ``So how much have you lost?'' Not many people
were uncool enough to ask the question. All the same it hung in the
air in lunch-rooms throughout Silicon Valley as the news of last
Monday's stockmarket rout was digested along with the seared-tuna
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in Silicon Valley like to pour scorn on ``old
world, East Coast economics'', few places are as exposed to the
gyrations of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America's high-technology industry, firms in
the Valley have been at the heart of the bull market. Their
employees have participated in it directly. An unusually large
proportion of workers in the Valley receives share options as well
as salaries. Their private investments are heavily biased toward
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a sector that draws its strength from a strong dose of
optimism, high-tech firms have also proved particularly vulnerable
to the market's sudden loss of confidence. That gravity-defying
Internet shares such as Yahoo! and Excite should head earthward
when the market turns sour is not surprising, as one analyst drily
observed: ``they may be insulated from earnings, but not from
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But when ``safety stocks'' such as Microsoft, Dell and Cisco get
caught up in the general mayhem, a frisson of fear runs through the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   True, during the week the technology-rich Nasdaq index clawed
back some of the week's losses. But the share prices of many
technology firms are well down from the record highs of earlier
this year. Worse, American firms, giddy after Wall Street's
see-sawing, may cut spending on electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week there were signs that all was not well in
the nerve-center of high-tech America. Many of its inhabitants like
to believe that the magic land between San Francisco and San Jose
has discovered the secret of perpetual profit-free share-price
growth. The Valley, they argue, is a ``New Economy'' based on
knowledge, not goods, and is thus less exposed to unpleasant
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell a different story. It is true that the
region's software industry has produced much of the recent growth.
This sector, however, employs only one-third as many people as the
computer, communications and semiconductor industries together.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Valley's economy today depends more on exports
than it did -- particularly exports across the Pacific. Since 1991,
the region's sales of manufactured goods abroad have doubled,
reaching almost $40 billion in 1996. That makes Silicon Valley
America's top exporting region, ahead even of Detroit. Well over
half of those exports were shipped to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the more traditional Silicon Valley has been hurt
by an ``unprecedented convergence'' of three factors, as James
Morgan of Applied Materials termed it, when the world's largest
semiconductor-equipment maker announced layoffs of 2,000 people at
the end of August. These are economic turmoil in Asia, overcapacity
in the semiconductor industry and the shift toward low-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why the Valley job machine has slowed in recent
months. In the year to July 22,800 new jobs were created in Santa
Clara County, the heart of the region, compared with 53,000 in the
year to July 1997. At the same time, the unemployment rate has
edged up from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent although that is still
well below the American average.
</P>
<P>
   Equally sobering are the hints that the area's frenetic
venture-capital market may be pausing for breath. Some fear that
the process of financing start-ups has run out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unhealthy overfunding has led to a lack of the Darwin
effect,'' says Ann Winblad, a venture capitalist at Hummer Winblad,
who is a noted bear. Cynics exaggerate only slightly when they say
you have only to stamp ``Internet'' or ``.com'' on your business
plan to get a bucket-load of money. Many indifferent or easily
imitable ideas have found financing.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the supply of money is still flowing. In the
second quarter, venture capitalists made deals worth a record $1.25
billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But even before this week, the number of IPOs of American
high-tech companies was dropping. The Valley has shared in the
retreat: in the first half of 1998, only 15 went public, compared
with 39 in the whole of 1997 and 72 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The geyser of venture capital is sure to falter if a weak
stockmarket further reduces the scope for IPOs. Some think that the
Valley's larger listed companies can take up the slack by acquiring
more start-ups (a trend that has been growing). But that seems
unrealistic: in a bear market, the M&AMP;A business is bound to lose
some of its momentum. As one venture capitalist puts it: ``The
venture market is a lot like real estate. It will go through denial
a long time, and then eventually capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other venture capitalists say the difficulty of carrying off
listings means that firms will now have to demonstrate sound
fundamentals first. If so they will have to make their venture
capitalists' cash last longer. And that will call for decent
management, the Valley's scarcest resource.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for talent to run new companies, venture
capitalists have begun to spend more time looking for people than
finding money. Indeed, many cite a lack of managers as one of the
main symptoms of the amazing ease of raising capital. Some have set
up ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs to foster chief
executives. Despite their efforts, however, many start-ups are run
by less-than-stellar managers.
</P>
<P>
   Irrepressible confidence and unbounded optimism are essential
parts of Silicon Valley's unique business ecology. The question is
whether the coming slowdown will damage them for any length of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a modest pause may not be such a bad thing. It could
give Silicon Valley a chance to address the problems that threaten
its long-term ability to remain the world capital of high-tech: an
overburdened infrastructure, skyrocketing house prices and
increasing social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   The long boom has left the Valley under strain. Appalling
traffic morning and afternoon is costing businesses approximately
$3.5 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted resources.
Because they cannot afford to buy or rent a house in the Valley,
many workers have little choice but to commute, in many cases for
two hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   House prices have risen to an average of almost $317,000. In
smart places such as Hillsborough and Atherton, the average house
costs almost twice as much as in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate boom has also increased the gap between those at
the top and those who keep the offices clean and the entrepreneurs
fed. At $46,000 a year, Santa Clara County now has the highest
average wage in America, but it also has one of the highest rates
of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' some Silicon Valley veterans respond. Structural
problems have been around for a long time; they have not prevented
the region from prospering. There is as yet no exodus to other
high-tech hubs such as Austin, Boston or Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a declining quality of life threatens to drive
away the people the region most needs to stay competitive in the
``New Economy'': talented managers and young creative people
working in small software companies. Headhunters report that the
quality of life in the Valley is frequently an issue when they try
to hire qualified people.
</P>
<P>
   High rents around Palo Alto have begun driving graduate students
and faculty away from Stanford University, the cradle of Valley
entrepreneurialism, to other prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley elite appears worried too. In early October,
Joint Venture, an organization of businesses, governments and other
local groups, will publish ``Vision 2010,'' a plan for what the
Valley should look like in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although a soft landing might benefit the Valley, the danger is
of something more dramatic. At the moment few think that Silicon
Valley is heading for the kind of bust that happened 15 years ago
when the Japanese invaded the memory-chip market. But an economy
that depends so vitally on confidence can turn down sharply when
that confidence is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of submerged stock options alone should not be
underestimated. Over the past few years people have grown used to
spending far beyond their income, because they owned options that
seemed continually to grow in value.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist with Integral Capital
Partners, predicts that: ``There will be some kind of downturn for
no other reason than Silicon Valley needs to clean the pipes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The vertiginous fall of technology shares was an uncomfortable
reminder that the miracle may be fragile and that, even in a
high-tech paradise such as Silicon Valley, prosperity isn't
automatic.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- ``So how much have you lost?'' Not many people
were uncool enough to ask the question. All the same it hung in the
air in lunch-rooms throughout Silicon Valley as the news of last
Monday's stockmarket rout was digested along with the seared-tuna
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in Silicon Valley like to pour scorn on ``old
world, East Coast economics'', few places are as exposed to the
gyrations of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America's high-technology industry, firms in
the Valley have been at the heart of the bull market. Their
employees have participated in it directly. An unusually large
proportion of workers in the Valley receives share options as well
as salaries. Their private investments are heavily biased toward
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a sector that draws its strength from a strong dose of
optimism, high-tech firms have also proved particularly vulnerable
to the market's sudden loss of confidence. That gravity-defying
Internet shares such as Yahoo! and Excite should head earthward
when the market turns sour is not surprising, as one analyst drily
observed: ``they may be insulated from earnings, but not from
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But when ``safety stocks'' such as Microsoft, Dell and Cisco get
caught up in the general mayhem, a frisson of fear runs through the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   True, during the week the technology-rich Nasdaq index clawed
back some of the week's losses. But the share prices of many
technology firms are well down from the record highs of earlier
this year. Worse, American firms, giddy after Wall Street's
see-sawing, may cut spending on electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week there were signs that all was not well in
the nerve-center of high-tech America. Many of its inhabitants like
to believe that the magic land between San Francisco and San Jose
has discovered the secret of perpetual profit-free share-price
growth. The Valley, they argue, is a ``New Economy'' based on
knowledge, not goods, and is thus less exposed to unpleasant
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell a different story. It is true that the
region's software industry has produced much of the recent growth.
This sector, however, employs only one-third as many people as the
computer, communications and semiconductor industries together.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Valley's economy today depends more on exports
than it did -- particularly exports across the Pacific. Since 1991,
the region's sales of manufactured goods abroad have doubled,
reaching almost $40 billion in 1996. That makes Silicon Valley
America's top exporting region, ahead even of Detroit. Well over
half of those exports were shipped to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the more traditional Silicon Valley has been hurt
by an ``unprecedented convergence'' of three factors, as James
Morgan of Applied Materials termed it, when the world's largest
semiconductor-equipment maker announced layoffs of 2,000 people at
the end of August. These are economic turmoil in Asia, overcapacity
in the semiconductor industry and the shift toward low-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why the Valley job machine has slowed in recent
months. In the year to July 22,800 new jobs were created in Santa
Clara County, the heart of the region, compared with 53,000 in the
year to July 1997. At the same time, the unemployment rate has
edged up from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent although that is still
well below the American average.
</P>
<P>
   Equally sobering are the hints that the area's frenetic
venture-capital market may be pausing for breath. Some fear that
the process of financing start-ups has run out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unhealthy overfunding has led to a lack of the Darwin
effect,'' says Ann Winblad, a venture capitalist at Hummer Winblad,
who is a noted bear. Cynics exaggerate only slightly when they say
you have only to stamp ``Internet'' or ``.com'' on your business
plan to get a bucket-load of money. Many indifferent or easily
imitable ideas have found financing.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the supply of money is still flowing. In the
second quarter, venture capitalists made deals worth a record $1.25
billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But even before this week, the number of IPOs of American
high-tech companies was dropping. The Valley has shared in the
retreat: in the first half of 1998, only 15 went public, compared
with 39 in the whole of 1997 and 72 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The geyser of venture capital is sure to falter if a weak
stockmarket further reduces the scope for IPOs. Some think that the
Valley's larger listed companies can take up the slack by acquiring
more start-ups (a trend that has been growing). But that seems
unrealistic: in a bear market, the M&AMP;A business is bound to lose
some of its momentum. As one venture capitalist puts it: ``The
venture market is a lot like real estate. It will go through denial
a long time, and then eventually capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other venture capitalists say the difficulty of carrying off
listings means that firms will now have to demonstrate sound
fundamentals first. If so they will have to make their venture
capitalists' cash last longer. And that will call for decent
management, the Valley's scarcest resource.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for talent to run new companies, venture
capitalists have begun to spend more time looking for people than
finding money. Indeed, many cite a lack of managers as one of the
main symptoms of the amazing ease of raising capital. Some have set
up ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs to foster chief
executives. Despite their efforts, however, many start-ups are run
by less-than-stellar managers.
</P>
<P>
   Irrepressible confidence and unbounded optimism are essential
parts of Silicon Valley's unique business ecology. The question is
whether the coming slowdown will damage them for any length of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a modest pause may not be such a bad thing. It could
give Silicon Valley a chance to address the problems that threaten
its long-term ability to remain the world capital of high-tech: an
overburdened infrastructure, skyrocketing house prices and
increasing social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   The long boom has left the Valley under strain. Appalling
traffic morning and afternoon is costing businesses approximately
$3.5 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted resources.
Because they cannot afford to buy or rent a house in the Valley,
many workers have little choice but to commute, in many cases for
two hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   House prices have risen to an average of almost $317,000. In
smart places such as Hillsborough and Atherton, the average house
costs almost twice as much as in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate boom has also increased the gap between those at
the top and those who keep the offices clean and the entrepreneurs
fed. At $46,000 a year, Santa Clara County now has the highest
average wage in America, but it also has one of the highest rates
of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' some Silicon Valley veterans respond. Structural
problems have been around for a long time; they have not prevented
the region from prospering. There is as yet no exodus to other
high-tech hubs such as Austin, Boston or Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a declining quality of life threatens to drive
away the people the region most needs to stay competitive in the
``New Economy'': talented managers and young creative people
working in small software companies. Headhunters report that the
quality of life in the Valley is frequently an issue when they try
to hire qualified people.
</P>
<P>
   High rents around Palo Alto have begun driving graduate students
and faculty away from Stanford University, the cradle of Valley
entrepreneurialism, to other prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley elite appears worried too. In early October,
Joint Venture, an organization of businesses, governments and other
local groups, will publish ``Vision 2010,'' a plan for what the
Valley should look like in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although a soft landing might benefit the Valley, the danger is
of something more dramatic. At the moment few think that Silicon
Valley is heading for the kind of bust that happened 15 years ago
when the Japanese invaded the memory-chip market. But an economy
that depends so vitally on confidence can turn down sharply when
that confidence is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of submerged stock options alone should not be
underestimated. Over the past few years people have grown used to
spending far beyond their income, because they owned options that
seemed continually to grow in value.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist with Integral Capital
Partners, predicts that: ``There will be some kind of downturn for
no other reason than Silicon Valley needs to clean the pipes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The vertiginous fall of technology shares was an uncomfortable
reminder that the miracle may be fragile and that, even in a
high-tech paradise such as Silicon Valley, prosperity isn't
automatic.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ If Russia had a government, it would
be flat broke. Before being shown the door, the prior government
defaulted on $40 billion in short-term debt _ money that was mostly
sucked out of the country with its connivance by the ruling
oligarchy. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ President Bill Clinton has returned from what we
may fairly, alas, call the Pathetic Summit to a worsening sink of
foreign problems that steamy, seamy Monicamess leaves him little
authority to deal with. The president either must find a way to put
this thing behind him or let Al Gore take command. (Teepen, Cox
News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ What Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have done
for baseball this year, in addition to filling stadiums that
otherwise would be near empty, is return the sport to its raw
basic: pitcher throws ball, batter slams the bejabbers out of it.
For too many recent years, the actual playing of the game has been
influenced by other elements, particularly pitching terminology I
cannot comprehend, or by calls by umpires that are beyond our
recognition. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.

<P>
   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ It's not that I wanted a glass of sweet tea. I
really prefer it half-and-half, and most restaurants gladly mix it

because my friend Jay Greland, the Mobile Register columnist, and
the newspaper itself organized and sponsored it. (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 9/3.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _WACO, Texas _ Home runs are the most exciting
part of baseball. That's my opinion. I'd rather see a ball hit out
of the stadium than watch a pitcher throw a perfect game. If that
shows my ignorance of the game, then so be it. Mickey Mantle made
me this way. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ Last fall a South Georgia friend, knowing of my
taste for old-fashioned eating, sent us a bottle of prime cane
syrup. It languished unopened on a back shelf in the pantry for
almost a year. Now that they have been ruled medically incorrect,
my wife is never anxious for me to indulge in the wonderful but
allegedly artery-clogging delicacies that were staples of the
Southern diet before food police ruled everything good is bad. I
was surprised when she mentioned the syrup. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Growing up in Piqua, Becky Howe learned little
girls didn't speak up, didn't rock the boat. You'd think, with all
this practice, at age 50, she'd be adept at holding her peace. Not
so. Miami County's unlikely new heroine has been speaking her mind
since June 9, when she received notice that Anthem was planning to
cancel her coverage and that of some 20,000 Ohio residents using
its Medicare HMO, known as Senior Advantage. (McCarty, Dayton Daily

   DOWNSIZING-CONDO When Jill Vantosh, an Atlanta interior
designer, downsized froma house to a condo, she seized an
opportunity to create a streamlined interior that emphasizes a few
of her favorite things _ including an unconventional material.
Vantosh stripped the second-floor unit of a 1950s red-brick
building to its concrete bones, from floor to ceiling , then
extended the material to the kitchen countertops. The result is a
clean, industrial look made warm and inviting by juxtaposing the
unpainted beams and chrome furnishings with oak floors and rich

officials say they are seriously lagging in their attempts to

reasons a November cadet class has been postponed until January.

THE COUNTERREPORT  
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend, President Clinton's surrogates signaled his next
stratagem in the war against Independent Counsel Ken Starr. When
Starr sends Congress his report on the Clinton investigation,
Clinton's lawyers will issue a counterreport exonerating Clinton
and leveling charges against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution and the independent counsel statute don't
authorize a counterreport, but they don't forbid it, either. De
jure, since Starr is a duly appointed investigator, his report
carries greater weight. But de facto, the Clintonites have so
tarnished Starr's reputation that only half the public is prepared
to believe his report, according to a recent poll. From the outset,
Clinton's ace in the hole has been the political nature of the
impeachment process. If voters don't trust the report, Republicans
in Congress will feel less emboldened to impeach Clinton, and
Democrats will feel less obliged to go along.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
and other Republican leaders have said they will suspend judgment
on the question of Clinton's punishment until Starr issues his
report. Their presumption that the report will clarify everything
seems oddly naive. For months, the GOP has marveled at the gall
with which Clinton's strategists have disregarded the spirit of the
law. Why expect them to defer to Starr's report? The president's
defenders can't silence Starr, but they can try to drown him out.
``Mr. Starr's voice is [only] one of many that will have to be
heard by the Congress,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., on Fox
News Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade the public that a counterreport is appropriate, the
Clintonites are drawing an analogy to the courtroom. ``Normally in
our system, you have the prosecutor and you have the defense,''
argued Democratic Party Chairman Roy Romer on ABC's This Week. On
CNN's Late Edition, former White House counsel Lanny Davis agreed
that Starr's report ``represents a prosecutor's view, without the
benefit of cross-examination. ... No exculpatory facts are to be
expected, nothing that will balance the truth, one side and the
other. It's a one-sided, biased report. ... Therefore, it does
require a counterpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the counterreport stop at exculpation. ``Mr. Starr and
his associates and staff have to be interviewed and have to be
deposed extensively,'' Dingell warned. ``There are enough
allegations about the behavior of Mr. Starr. We're going to have to
look at leaks, association with right-wing causes, contributions,
the fact that he practiced law and made extensive revenue from
people who were ... perhaps even enemies of the administration. All
these matters have to be inquired into.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Starr is that he's in a battle of
trustworthiness against an unarmed man. By admitting that he had an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he then lied
about, Clinton seems to have damaged his own credibility more than
the White House has damaged Starr's. But Clinton's lawyers don't
have to rehabilitate their client's credibility--any more than
Johnnie Cochran had to prove O.J. Simpson's innocence. All they
have to do is put the prosecution on trial.

CLINTON MEASURES HIS LAST OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the new Flytrap motto, brought to you by kindly
inquisitor Sen. Orrin Hatch: ``We are a forgiving people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Flytrap II enters Week II, it is segueing gracefully into the
second stage of scandal: The initial glee of Clinton's enemies has
matured into thoughtful magnanimity. The sound of young
conservatives baying for DNA has subsided. If last week's theme was
high dudgeon, this week's will be high-mindedness. The Republicans'
new strategy seems to be: (Possibly) Forgive and (Maybe) Forget.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, which Hatch, Sen. Arlen Specter, Bob Novak and
others hinted at over the weekend, seems to go like this:
</P>
<P>
   The president is trapped, and everyone else is embarrassed. The
only remedy is a presidential mea culpa (or rather, since the ones
pushing the culpa are not the person who would actually apologize,
a tua culpa). If Clinton admits his affair to the grand jury and
the American public, explains that he lied to protect his daughter
and wife, and apologizes with sufficient breadth and--this is
important--abjectness, then, well, we'll probably forgive him and
call off the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' Hatch said that he and House Judiciary
Chairman Henry Hyde (who would supervise impeachment proceedings)
are inclined to be forgiving (unless, of course, there is evidence
of other high crimes). Other Republicans, he implied, could also be
big-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   Any time I find myself agreeing with Hatch and Novak I grab my
wallet, and the cynic in me says this magnanimity may have been
arrived at only after much jujitsu with public opinion polls. The
Forgive and Forget strategy has this virtue for Republicans: It is
the only way they're going to win a clean PR victory.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are impossible for them. Surveys have been jiggered
and rejiggered to find some way, any way, 50 percent of Americans
would back impeachment. No luck. The best effort so far was a Wall
Street Journal poll that found that 45 percent of Americans--up
from 39 percent last month!--would favor holding impeachment
hearings if Clinton had an affair and perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   This is a number made absurd by the fact that:
</P>
<P>
   1) A 6 percent rise is hardly a tidal wave;
</P>
<P>
   2) in no universe is 45 percent a majority;
</P>
<P>
   3) impeachment hearings are not impeachment;
</P>
<P>
   and 4) similar polls registered impeachment support at 24
percent or 14 percent. This does not a winning issue make.
</P>
<P>
   The only poll that I've heard about that makes any sense, which
may be the one the GOP is reading, is the ABC News survey (I think)
saying that 69 percent of Americans would clear Clinton if he makes
a clean breast of it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they've reached their conclusion for cynical or
idealistic reasons, Hatch and Co. do seem to have hit on the only
solution to this mess, the only outcome that will punish Clinton
adequately, satisfy his persecutors enough to quiet them, and save
us from two more years of this horror. (All this assumes the
allegations are true. Insert usual caveats here: ``till Aug. 17,''
``DNA testing by the FBI,'' ``unreliable witness,'' etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Why would Clinton agree to apologize?
</P>
<P>
   1) It would shock no one and disappoint few to find out that
Clinton and Lewinsky did have an affair despite his earlier claims.
</P>
<P>
   2) Clinton has the rhetorical grace to pull off such an apology
in a way that doesn't seem phony (he'll blame it on his own big
heart, his fierce desire not to hurt wife and child).
</P>
<P>
   And most important: 3) An apology cuts off Starr's
investigations at the knees. Without an apology, Clinton is doomed
to enervating, fratricidal, interminable impeachment hearings. An
apology would prevent them. The Flytrap investigation is the only
part of Starr's work that America a) understands and b) actually
cares about. Would an admission of lying about Monica weaken
Clinton's claims in the other Starr matters? I doubt it. After a
mea culpa, the public or Congress are unlikely to muster much
enthusiasm for chasing Clinton through the dull, impenetrable
thickets of Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Republicans decide later that they don't actually
forgive and forget, it may be too late. An apology could wipe away
all the scandals but campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign yet that the administration is tempted by mea
culpa/Forgive and Forget. All leaks out of the White House suggest
that the president is sticking to his denial. Lanny Davis, the
closest thing to an official source who is talking, deflected the
idea of an apology when quizzed about it. But if the administration
isn't buying, its allies are. Democrats are matching Republicans
big heart for big heart.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Frank, the president's best friend in the House, has
suggested that Clinton should 'fess up if he had an affair, as has
Leon Panetta. On This Week, George Stephanopoulos all but implored
his former boss to cut his losses and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Will the White House come around? If I were a betting man, I
would wager that during this week, other prominent Democrats--as
they did when Clinton hesitated over Starr's subpoena--will make
increasingly obvious pleas for Clinton to apologize. And, unless
the dress is a red (navy blue) herring, I would wager that Clinton
will listen. Surely he's willing to tarnish the legacy he cares so
much about in order to save his presidency.

AUTHORS, HAVE YOU HUGGED A LIST LATELY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZA TRUITT  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, it seems as if half the books in bookstores have the
word ``best seller'' or some variant on the cover or the flap copy,
as in ``the best-selling author of ...''
</P>
<P>
   But what does that mean? About as much as the phrase ``original
recipe'' does on a jar of spaghetti sauce. Neither the government
nor the publishing industry regulates the use of the term, and
besides, there are many different kinds of best-seller lists
published every week in the United States. There are the major
national lists (the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA
Today, and Publishers Weekly) and the major regional lists (the
Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Los Angeles
Times, the Boston Globe, and the Chicago Tribune). There are lists
that compare sales at chain stores with sales at independent
stores. There are romance lists, business lists, African-American
lists, religious lists, health lists, and children's lists.
</P>
<P>
   What is a best-seller list? It is a ranking of the relative
sales of particular kinds of books at certain groups of stores
within a one-week period. Best-seller lists tell us not which books
sell the most, in absolute terms, but which fiction, nonfiction, or
advice books sell the fastest at the bookstores list makers think
deserve attention. A how-to book that sells 20,000 copies in one
week will shoot to the top of the best-seller lists, whether or not
those are the only copies it ever sells. A novel that sells 200
copies a week for 10 years will never appear on the lists, because
each week it will be beaten by faster-selling books.
</P>
<P>
   Why do best-seller lists matter so much? Because they are the
most convincing form of publicity around, which gives them the
quality of self-fulfilling prophecies. If a book is a best seller,
bookstore clerks will be more likely to put it in the front of the
store and readers to buy it. Publishers will also be eager to
publish more books like it, since best-seller lists also stand in
for industrywide sales data. (Most book publishing companies are
privately held and keep this information secret; even when the
companies are publicly traded, it is nearly impossible to find out
the unit sales of individual books.)
</P>
<P>
   This helps account for the uniformity in the books that top all
these lists--books by brand-name or celebrity authors,
inspirational and self-help books. Some authors will do anything to
try to break this vicious cycle. In 1995, Business Week ran a story
about two authors who purchased 10,000 copies of their own book,
The Discipline of Market Leaders, and got their corporate clients
to buy 30,000 to 40,000 more, in a successful plot to get onto the
New York Times list. (Click here to read about the legal tricks
book editors employ to try to place their books on the Times list.)
</P>
<P>
   These days, what best-seller lists are most likely to reflect is
the amount of money spent to publicize the books that wind up on
them. Superstores now allow publishers to pay to place a book up
front or in the window or to display advertising. That, plus an
author tour or appearance on national TV shows, can propel readers
into stores fast enough to get a book on the list. Word-of-mouth or
good reviews don't generate the dramatic concentrated sales
required.
</P>
<P>
   Some lists gather sales figures from more stores than others do.
The New York Times boasts the most stores reporting--4,000, plus
wholesalers. The Voice Literary Supplement list, which tells you
what the serious bohemians are reading, asks only about 25 high-end
independent stores, including San Francisco's City Lights;
Washington, D.C.'s Politics and Prose; and the Harvard Bookstore.
Some list makers rely on statistical sampling and extrapolation to
provide an estimation of what is selling at the stores that do not
report; some don't. Some lists, such as the Wall Street Journal's,
only track sales in big chain stores. Others, such as USA Today's,
include online booksellers. Some follow only independent stores.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem haphazard compared with the way the music
industry's main best-seller list--published in Billboard
magazine--is compiled: It tracks every single album sold at every
single music store in the United States. SoundScan Inc., the
company that began tracking CD and tape sales with a barcode
system, has in fact tried to get booksellers to employ a comparable
system called BookScan but with little success. The problem is
partly that BookScan is too expensive for many booksellers. But the
real issue is that BookScan misses the point: Book industry people
don't want a single compilation of what's really selling best
throughout the country; they want a variety of lists that break
down sales figures in ways beneficial to them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the most closely watched lists in the
publishing industry:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New York Times &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times list is the industry standard. It's the most
prestigious, appearing as it does in the premier book review in the
country. And it's the widest-reaching, based on data from the
largest number of stores. Many bookstores sell New York Times best
sellers at a discount, thereby generating even more sales for New
York Times best sellers. Publishers regularly write bonuses into
contracts to factor in the possibility that a book will makes the
Times list. This clause is typically phrased ``$7,000 for positions
1-5, $5,000 for positions 6-10, and $3,000 for positions 11-15.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times divides its best sellers into hardcover and paperback
lists and then divides each of these into fiction, nonfiction, and
a third category called ``Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous.'' This
last category has led some to accuse the straight nonfiction list
of being a ``useful fiction,'' designed to give publicity to books
that would otherwise fail.
</P>
<P>
   One significant but little-known fact about the Times
best-seller list is that it does not follow every single book
published each year. Instead, the Times sends a list to bookstores
indicating which books they are ``tracking'' as potential future
best sellers and asks for sales information on those books (and any
others the bookstores want to report on). The Times says this
tracking list is drawn up from information from bookstores, but
publishers say they routinely call up the Times to tip them off to
books selling with increasing momentum so that they can be added to
the tracking list.

 UNDATED: (tracking list.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Times Web site publishes another list: ``Chains vs.
Independents,'' which compares how books in all three categories
are selling in these two different types of outlets. This list was
a concession to independent bookstores, many of which were outraged
when the Times created hot links between every single book on its
Internet best-seller list and Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore,
which then gave a 30 percent discount to all the listed books. Some
independent bookstores were so angry about this that they boycotted
the list and, early in 1998, about 100 bookstores in Northern
California refused to report their sales to the New York Times
list. The Times claimed that the number boycotting never reached a
``critical mass'' that would have threatened the integrity of its
list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Francisco Chronicle &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle best-seller list tracks sales at
about 50 stores in the Bay Area, gathering data from a larger
percentage of independent stores than the New York Times list does.
This doesn't mean the Chronicle list doesn't contain traditional,
mainstream commercial titles--it does--but it includes books too
esoteric for the chains and books that people are willing to pay
full price for. Occasionally, books thought of as backlist titles
or classics will pop up on this list, and many less flashy books
that are quality reads start out on the independent-heavy lists
such as the Chronicle's.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle list is most valued by publishers for what is
considered its predictive value. Recent national best sellers such
as Snow Falling on Cedars, Cold Mountain, and Divine Secrets of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood appeared on the Chronicle list long before they
made it to the New York Times'. A.S. Byatt's Possession was on the
Chronicle list for six weeks before it appeared on the Times list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; USA Today &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   USA Today's list is the most inclusive one around. It lists 50
books (150 on its Web site) and mixes all categories: fiction,
nonfiction, hardcover, trade, and mass market paperbacks. Its
authors gather data in a straightforward fashion: They record
actual sales (no statistical sampling) at 3,000 bookstores and
include online booksellers, which many other lists don't. This
results in an unusual list that pits the paperbacks of successful
literary novels such as Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things
against hardcover celebrity health books such as Marilu Henner's
Total Health Makeover and inspirational titles such as Chicken Soup
for the Pet Lover's Soul. The list even includes the occasional
children's title. Literary books rarely appear in the first 20
positions.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today's list shows how different types of books that are
separated on other lists rank against one another. For example, Ron
Chernow's Titan, a biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr., held the
ninth position on the New York Times nonfiction list the week of
Aug. 17. On the USA Today list, it was not even in the top 150. The
often ignored murky bottom of the USA Today list also makes
interesting reading. It is peppered with literary books such as The
Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird, which are probably
selling well because of their inclusion on every high-school
English syllabus. The week after the movie version of Nabokov's
Lolita aired on Showtime, the book jumped from 204 to make a
surprise appearance at 121. Continuing publicity from its publisher
pushed it to 85 for the week starting Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Publishers Weekly &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   These nine lists are designed for people in the book industry:
booksellers, libraries, literary agents, and domestic and
international publishing houses. Thus PW's lists are divided into
subcategories relevant only to people in the publishing world.
Fiction and nonfiction are kept separate for hardcover books but
mixed for trade paperback and mass market. Also listed separately
are children's, religious, computer, and audio books. These lists
are compiled at 3,000 chains and independents and are enhanced by
statistical sampling. Nora Rawlinson, editor in chief of Publishers
Weekly, sees the proliferation of lists as a way to give publishers
information on the different types of books they specialize in. But
she also admits the plethora of lists gives more books
``best-seller opportunities.''

THE DEAD BABY MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ATUL GAWANDE 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One by one, between 1949 and 1968, each of the 10 children Marie
Noe bore died. One was stillborn. One died at the hospital just
after birth. And the others expired at home, just infants, in their
cribs, where Noe said she found them blue and either limp or
gasping.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, including some of the most respected pathologists of
the time, could find no explanation for the eight crib deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the medical community came to recognize that thousands
of seemingly healthy infants inexplicably died in their beds each
year, and they coined the name Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or
SIDS, for these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Eight unexplained deaths in one family do not sit easily. We
expect more from science, doctors and cops.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham
seemingly satisfied our expectations when she cited new medical
evidence to allege that Noe, now 70, had smothered the children
with a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science,'' Abraham told the Associated Press, ``has been
solving old, unsolved cases.'' She charged Noe with eight counts of
first degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's claim puzzled me. How did she determine the deaths
were homicide and not SIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SIDS is not really a disease but rather the name we've given to
one of the great medical mysteries of our time: Any sudden infant
death that remains unexplained after a complete post-mortem
investigation is defined as SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Typically in SIDS cases, a previously healthy baby is found dead
in bed. No cry is heard from the infant prior to its death. The
child may be found with clenched fists or frothy, bloodstained
fluid issuing from the nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Although 90 percent of SIDS deaths occur by six months of age,
older infants can die spontaneously and unexpectedly as well.
</P>
<P>
   One early SIDS theory that babies simply stop breathing has been
discredited. Two suggestive findings are that sleeping on soft
bedding and sleeping face down both increase a baby's risk of
sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   A successful campaign to get parents to put babies to bed on
their backs or sides has been associated with a 38 percent drop in
SIDS deaths over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps SIDS will turn out to be a kind of freak accident in
which babies, unable to turn over, are smothered by their own
bedding.
</P>
<P>
   The findings raise questions about how in the world you could
accurately distinguish suffocation from SIDS _ especially in the
Noe cases in which the original autopsies showed no marks of force,
and the corpses are probably now nothing but bone.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic pathologists and child-abuse experts I contacted
confirmed that there is no distinctive autopsy finding or new test
that could distinguish SIDS from homicide by suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   What was the basis for charging Noe? An official close to the
case who requested anonymity admitted that there was no evidence
that supported the charges of homicide. The doctors involved simply
reviewed the old medical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Had the previous pathologists missed physical signs of
suffocation? No, the official said. It appears that the critical
factor was the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Eight deaths in one family was highly suspicious, and Noe was
the only person present when each of the children died. (The
district attorney reopened the Noe cases after a March Philadelphia
magazine story about them.)
</P>
<P>
   In child-abuse cases, science often can only provide
circumstantial evidence. Occasionally, we doctors find convincing
evidence of abuse: cigarette burns, X-rays showing multiple
fractures of varying age, bruises that trace the outline of a coat
hanger, a stockinglike burn suggesting a foot plunged into and held
down in hot liquid.
</P>
<P>
   However, most cases do not come with such obvious signs. In
deciding whether to sic the department of social services on a
case, we have only vague indicators to rely upon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to guidelines used at Children's Hospital
in Boston, any bruise, facial laceration, or long bone fracture in
an infant is considered evidence of possible abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, doctors look for the parents to tell us much more
than any physical evidence can.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, my year-old daughter was playing unsupervised in
an adjacent room when suddenly, she screamed. My wife found her
lying on the ground, her right arm bent midway between the elbow
and the wrist as if she had an unnatural extra joint.
</P>
<P>
   As near as we could figure, it seemed she had tried to climb
onto our couch, our 2-year-old son had pushed her over, and her arm
had got caught in the slats.
</P>
<P>
   As she fell, the bones of the forearm broke in two. When I took
her to the hospital, I was grilled by three different people asking
me over and over again, ``Now, exactly how did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   It was, I knew, a suspicious story _ an unwitnessed fall
resulting in a bad fracture. The doctors were looking, just as I do
when I see young trauma victims, for any inconsistencies or changes
in the story.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for parents to feel self-righteous when doctors ask
questions as if they're cops, but as advanced as medicine has
become, questions are still our main diagnostic test for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I must have allayed any concerns. My daughter got a
pink cast, and I took her home without incident.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but think, however, that my social status played
a role in all this. As much as doctors may try to avoid it, when we
decide whether to involve officials in a case, social factors
inevitably play a role.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we know that single parents have almost double the
risk of being abusive, poor families almost 16 times the
likelihood. One-third of crack-using mothers are found to abuse or
neglect their children. (Race, by the way, is not a factor.)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Noe, these factors played to her advantage. She
was married, middle-class, respectable. But the fact of eight
deaths must mean something, right?
</P>
<P>
   As one coroner involved in the case said, repeating a maxim that
has gained currency among pathologists, ``One SIDS death is a
tragedy. Two is a mystery. Three is murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The real answer, however, is that science can't tell us what
happened beyond reasonable doubt. Bucking his colleagues,
Pittsburgh Medical Examiner Cyril Wecht says that multiple SIDS
deaths in one family do not automatically mean murder. The numbers
certainly make the Noe deaths suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   After all, experts now believe that losing one baby to SIDS does
not increase the likelihood that a family will lose another.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wecht points out, there have been cases of two and
three unexplained infant deaths in a family in which homicide was
ruled highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of SIDS babies have been wrongly accused in the past.
And most troubling, as I said before, we don't know what SIDS is in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   We may have lumped several different diseases together in
describing the syndrome. Perhaps multiple natural deaths in a
family are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although science often cannot prove even fatal child abuse, it
is not without its power. Confronted with the medical ``proof'' of
homicide, Noe admitted to suffocating four of her children. She
apparently couldn't recall what had happened to the others.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, however, is questioning the reliability of the
confession, obtained during an all-night interview. He says she
will plead innocent to the charges.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dan Burton and the Jimmy Carter effect
 &HT;    (EDS: This column, which normally would move on Monday, is
moving today because of the Labor Day holiday.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can think of few prospects less appealing than being treated
to a recitation of Dan Burton's sleepovers. Yet that intelligence
seems imminent. Word is widely about that this avidly unsought
information will soon surface in Vanity Fair magazine, and if not
there then in the Indianapolis Star or in other, as-yet unnamed
publications.
</P>
<P>
   There is suddenly a run on the sex life of the Republican
chairman of the House's Government Reform and Oversight Committee,
which has been investigating _ and investigating and investigating
_ Democratic political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Burton himself has acknowledged the bull market in his hanky
panky, tendering a pre-emptive confession in which he says he will
admit to whatever any publication gets right. The Indiana
congressman offers that he and his wife have been thrice separated,
one of those times to the brink of divorce. Burton seems to be
copping a plea that goes, ``Well, what's a fellow to do?'' It's a
chase-or-be-chaste world.
</P>
<P>
   Burton suspects the White House is behind his de-pantsing.
Clinton spokesfolk say no, but who can tell? Both sides have been
playing hardball with hand grenades. It would require no Clintonite
scheme to make Burton a target of skeptical curiosity. The
combination of Burton's low-road partisanship and moral high
dudgeon _ Burton dissed Clinton as a ``scumbag'' _ is Day-Glo spoor
to hypocrisy hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been atwitter for weeks _ memo to file: make
sure Republicans actually can twitter _ over reports that the
Clinton devils are preparing a purgatory of revelations about the
peccadilloes of the president's detractors. Storm shutters have
been going up at glass houses all over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If we are on the verge of an unwelcome contest in sexual gotcha,
the larger push for it will come from within the press itself than
from any White House pressure. There's precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon skipped town claiming, as his diehard fans still
do, that journalist enemies had set the impeachment hounds on him.
In truth, newspapers had overwhelmingly supported his re-election,
most came uneasily to the conclusion he had to go and the reporting
that did him in was provoked not by animus but by his own abuses of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the media set out to prove their even-handedness by
treating the new president, Democrat Jimmy Carter, as if he were a
parolee who hadn't checked in with his parole officer. He was
quickly the suspect at the center of fantastical misdeeds involving
a ``fugitive financier'' and other odd tales, none of which proved
true, and to boot, because he had campaigned saying he would never
lie to us, his every utterance was mined for traces of uncandor.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the sort may be brewing now, as media types blamed
for bringing Clinton low strive to establish their nonpartisanship
by shining their flashlights in the back seats of GOP cars in hopes
of catching the kids necking.
</P>
<P>
   Pray not, but especially with gossipy cable shows and Internet
sites aglow with attention to which they had been unaccustomed, we
may be in for more keyhole-peeping than the house dick in a
hot-pillow hotel.

 &HT;    
 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The presidents of the United States and Russia, who recently met
in Moscow, are both in trouble. Some have called their meeting a
lame-duck summit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, I believe the decision to meet was a sign of
responsibility. Dialogue must not be broken off, particularly at
such a difficult time.
 &HT;    Too bad the summit produced no tangible results. But the reason
for this failure is all too clear: Each man is politically weakened
because neither was able to engage in the kind of serious
self-criticism that was necessary.
 &HT;    It is also clear that both presidents bear a lot of
responsibility for Russia's plight. The West, and Bill Clinton in
particular, liked the Russian president, who had put an end to
communism and the USSR.
 &HT;    Yeltsin, in exchange for his reforms, expected mountains of gold
_ and, of course, ironclad political support. The West and Clinton
spoke of their support for democratic reforms and market
transition. In reality, as we now see, the democratic character of
those reforms was doubtful at best, and the so-called free market
has degenerated into a paper pyramid.
 &HT;    I doubt that no one was aware of this. Some in the West may have
hoped to benefit from a downwardly spiraling Russia in some way.
They now see that Russia does not suffer in isolation: Stock
exchanges throughout the world have taken some bad hits _ in part,
no one disputes, because of the Russian crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, many Westerners, both those who have gained and those
who have lost, are ready to pack their bags and leave Russia. They
think that Russia cannot be trusted.
 &HT;    Well, they had better look in the mirror and think again. After
all, it was they who thought Russia could be treated like a
streetwalker. True, they were encouraged to do so by the Russian
leaders themselves, who took the country through ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    Others, apparently including President Clinton, believe that
Russia should not now be abandoned to face its troubles alone. This
is wise, although the realization came too late, after years of
pushing Russia down the path that has taken it to the brink of the
abyss.
 &HT;    Many are afraid that Russia could collapse into chaos. This fear
is not without reason. But it is essential to understand that
cooperation with Russia is in the best interests of the West.
 &HT;    Sooner or later _ I would say, sooner _ Russia will have a new
leadership that will not meekly accept prescriptions from others
and will have to be treated with respect. It will take decisions
consistent with Russia's national interests, which does not,
however, mean it will choose to ignore the ``rules of the global
market'' or tear up its obligations.
 &HT;    Remember that the Gorbachevs, Clintons, Yeltsins and others come
and go while the people of Russia, America, France, Italy, Mexico
and other nations remain, with their own history, traditions, and
all their merits and drawbacks.
 &HT;    I do understand that today it might seem odd to speak of
relations of equality with Russia, torn as it is by the economic
and moral crisis. But the past seven years have demonstrated that
America's biggest mistake would be to try to exploit its position
now as the only superpower. Fortunately for everyone, including
Americans, the coming century will not be an ``American century.''
 &HT;    The situation is at a breaking point; it can't go on like this.
For the second time in six years the Russians' incomes have been
cut in half. A chasm is widening between the small group of ruling
oligarchs and the people, who no longer trust anyone _ certainly
not the president, not his candidate for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin; nor does the Duma have much credibility.
 &HT;    This is a political crisis: the collapse, the agony of the
ruling regime. No behind-the-scenes dealings, no attempt to mend
matters through some intrigue, can succeed. Neither the bankrupt
politicians nor the tired, out-of-touch president can now save us.
 &HT;    I insist that the only way out is through simultaneous early
elections of the president and the Duma, coupled with a referendum
to amend the Constitution in order to reallocate powers between the
branches of federal government. Yeltsin's voluntary resignation
would open the way to a compromise allowing the formation of a
government of national salvation, capable of coping with the
emergency.
 &HT;    The choice is now stark. If early elections are not held, the
crisis will be resolved by street protests. Even setting the date
for elections would calm people, who would see in it the prospect
to express their will by civilized means.
 &HT;    The alternative to a peaceful course of events is chaos. I hope
the president understands that and is aware of the danger
confronting us all. His era is over, but he has a great chance to
go down in history by moving quickly to call early elections. The
longer he and his entourage cling to power, the greater will be the
danger of the country sliding into total chaos.

support _ not in the shape of what would be a Western-style middle

winning the elections.

front, with the trust and support of the people, could lead Russia
out of our deteriorating crisis.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The presidents of the United States and Russia, who recently met
in Moscow, are both in trouble. Some have called their meeting a
lame-duck summit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, I believe the decision to meet was a sign of
responsibility. Dialogue must not be broken off, particularly at
such a difficult time.
 &HT;    Too bad the summit produced no tangible results. But the reason
for this failure is all too clear: Each man is politically weakened
because neither was able to engage in the kind of serious
self-criticism that was necessary.
 &HT;    It is also clear that both presidents bear a lot of
responsibility for Russia's plight. The West, and Bill Clinton in
particular, liked the Russian president, who had put an end to
communism and the USSR.
 &HT;    Yeltsin, in exchange for his reforms, expected mountains of gold
_ and, of course, ironclad political support. The West and Clinton
spoke of their support for democratic reforms and market
transition. In reality, as we now see, the democratic character of
those reforms was doubtful at best, and the so-called free market
has degenerated into a paper pyramid.
 &HT;    I doubt that no one was aware of this. Some in the West may have
hoped to benefit from a downwardly spiraling Russia in some way.
They now see that Russia does not suffer in isolation: Stock
exchanges throughout the world have taken some bad hits _ in part,
no one disputes, because of the Russian crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, many Westerners, both those who have gained and those
who have lost, are ready to pack their bags and leave Russia. They
think that Russia cannot be trusted.
 &HT;    Well, they had better look in the mirror and think again. After
all, it was they who thought Russia could be treated like a
streetwalker. True, they were encouraged to do so by the Russian
leaders themselves, who took the country through ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    Others, apparently including President Clinton, believe that
Russia should not now be abandoned to face its troubles alone. This
is wise, although the realization came too late, after years of
pushing Russia down the path that has taken it to the brink of the
abyss.
 &HT;    Many are afraid that Russia could collapse into chaos. This fear
is not without reason. But it is essential to understand that
cooperation with Russia is in the best interests of the West.
 &HT;    Sooner or later _ I would say, sooner _ Russia will have a new
leadership that will not meekly accept prescriptions from others
and will have to be treated with respect. It will take decisions
consistent with Russia's national interests, which does not,
however, mean it will choose to ignore the ``rules of the global
market'' or tear up its obligations.
 &HT;    Remember that the Gorbachevs, Clintons, Yeltsins and others come
and go while the people of Russia, America, France, Italy, Mexico
and other nations remain, with their own history, traditions, and
all their merits and drawbacks.
 &HT;    I do understand that today it might seem odd to speak of
relations of equality with Russia, torn as it is by the economic
and moral crisis. But the past seven years have demonstrated that
America's biggest mistake would be to try to exploit its position
now as the only superpower. Fortunately for everyone, including
Americans, the coming century will not be an ``American century.''
 &HT;    The situation is at a breaking point; it can't go on like this.
For the second time in six years the Russians' incomes have been
cut in half. A chasm is widening between the small group of ruling
oligarchs and the people, who no longer trust anyone _ certainly
not the president, not his candidate for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin; nor does the Duma have much credibility.
 &HT;    This is a political crisis: the collapse, the agony of the
ruling regime. No behind-the-scenes dealings, no attempt to mend
matters through some intrigue, can succeed. Neither the bankrupt
politicians nor the tired, out-of-touch president can now save us.
 &HT;    I insist that the only way out is through simultaneous early
elections of the president and the Duma, coupled with a referendum

 &HT;    HOW I SPENT MY BALTIC VACATION: Jamming with the Baltic Blues
Brothers
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia _ If you're a tall, blond, beautiful woman who is
tired of standing out in the crowd, come to Riga.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a pretty woman parade all day and into the night,
long-legged women in short skirts and high-heel shoes.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, alas, was wearing her dancing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I had found my way to a blues concert along the cobbled streets
of Old Town in this capital city of Latvia, pop. 800,000. Not far
away was Castle Riga, built by German knights in 1330.
</P>
<P>
   The language of Latvia is akin to German. ``Ja'' means yes, that
much I could understand.
</P>
<P>
   But the music this particular night was 100 percent American,
though more like '50s rock-'n'-roll to my ear than the blues. Good
drums, especially considering that the drummer, Artis, is only 14
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was the kid of the group. It turned out that the
bass guitarist, Paulis, was all of 10.
</P>
<P>
   The band billed itself as The Omi, which evidently means
something to Latvians that's lost on me. I dubbed them the Baltic
Blues Brothers instead.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the group were Kalvis, 15, rhythm guitar; Oskars, 18,
vocal and harmonica; and Martins, 17, lead guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Their music made me feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
   During a break, I got to talking with them and we hit it off.
They knew English and I knew the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Fats Domino,'' I said, and they
accepted me as one of them _ one of the few there who could
appreciate their music.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I couldn't help noticing while they played. That
there was not so much as a toe being tapped by the crowd gathered
in the open-air cafe where they were playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up with blues,'' Kalvis said. ``Our parents played the
records. But most of the people of Latvia just can't understand
this music.''
</P>
<P>
   When the music resumed I put the crowd to the test. But I was
the one who almost flunked.
</P>
<P>
   I must have asked a dozen women to dance. Not one would say
``Ja.'' Finally I found a partner. Obviously, I wasn't the first
American she'd danced with. But I well might have been the first
since VE Day.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to say that we were like Fred and Ginger. More like
Fred and Ethel is closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It was fun while it lasted. For a fact, Miss
Geriatrics outlasted me _ danced me right off my feet, she did.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I turned in early, while Riga continued to party.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night at my hotel, I was awakened by music floating up
from the streets and through the open windows of my room.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't blues in the night. This was like ghost music _ a
haunting melody.
</P>
<P>
   On the street corner below my window, I could see a young girl
playing a violin for coins from passers-by. She seemed hardly the
age of the bass guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Her music made me feel a long way from home.

   ``PRINCESS DIANA: FASHION STATEMENTS.'' From WWD. ``Princess
Diana absolutely was not a fashion leader,'' Georgina Howell says.
``But she used fashion as a language to get her message across to
her public, and I believe it made her one of the great
communicators of the century.'' Howell's new book, ``Diana: Her
Life in Fashion'' (Rizzoli), traces the late princess' changing
fashion tastes over her 16 years in the public eye and how Diana
would project her moods and desires through what she wore. A
report.

   ``Day five: strike cost update for September 2, 1998,'' screamed
the full-page advertisement by Northwest Airlines: ``$350 million
to the US economy and counting . . . `` If clever publicity wins
the public's hearts and minds, then Northwest's management, despite
laying off 27,500 of the company's 50,000 workers on the very same
day, have probably won.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,200 pilots who walked off on August 29 have lost almost
regardless of the strike's outcome. After all, the average American
worker's annual salary is around $28,200 for working 40 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the scathing question from the management's August 31
advertisement: ``$150,000 a year for 14 days of work per month. So
why are the pilots striking?''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' reply, scarcely heard against management's louder
voice, was that they were seeking to recover what they had given up
five years ago -- some $365 million in wages and other concessions
-- as Northwest flirted with bankruptcy. Having ``shared the
pain'', they now wanted to ``share the gain'' of their airline's
subsequent four years of record earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Others will conclude that the Northwest strike is part of a
pattern -- witness last year's strike against United Parcel
Service, and this summer's strike at General Motors -- in which
American workers are taking advantage of sustained economic growth
and a tight labour market to extract higher wages, to the eventual
detriment of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   They see similar evidence of workers' muscle-flexing in last
July's two-day general strike in Puerto Rico, designed to protest
against the privatization of the island's telephone company and the
job losses the unions assume will follow.
</P>
<P>
   They make a tempting argument. Unemployment at some 4.5 percent
of the workforce, is at its lowest for a generation; labor-force
participation, at just over 67 percent, is at a record high, thanks
to the creation of 11 million more jobs than there were five years
ago; and still the nation's employers, whether they are selling
software or hamburgers, complain they cannot get workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the argument is surely misleading. The tally of strikes
involving 1,000 or more workers last year reached 29, the lowest
since World War II and one-eighth the level of two decades ago.
This year, labor experts expect an even smaller total.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, union membership is stagnant at some 14 percent of
the workforce, compared with 35 percent in the 1950s. The
Employment Policy Foundation (EPF), a Washington think-tank,
calculates that if they are to keep their share of the workforce,
the unions will have to increase their present membership by
200,000 a year (which will also mean stopping average membership
losses of 110,000 a year).
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, says the EPF's chief economist, Kenneth Deavers,
there is no pattern of union activism: the strikes are all
``one-off events''.
</P>
<P>
   He may well be right. The cynical view of last year's strike at
UPS is that it had more to do with boosting the Teamsters' boss,
Ron Carey (since dismissed for corrupt practices), than securing
better terms for UPS workers. By contrast, the GM strike, which
lasted 54 days and cost $2.2 billion in lost sales, was a
straightforward battle by the United Auto Workers to slow the pace
of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Northwest dispute, some observers trace it not just
to the 1993 agreement (in which the pilots' wage concessions were
alleviated by the award of stock in the company and a seat on the
board) but to dislike of the abrasive style of Al Checchi, chairman
until last year, before his quixotic decision to run for governor
of California.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the union-bashers, if there is a pattern, it
is chiefly one of continued union decline. Bosses are no longer
easily intimidated; more small firms, which tend not to be
unionized, are being bred than big ones; and the economy's gravity
is shifting geographically to the union-hostile South and West, and
sectorally from manufacturing, the traditional stronghold of the
unions, to service industries which think them irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what do strikers win? Deavers and his colleagues
calculate that it will take a full-time employee of UPS five years
to recover what he lost during the strike; the part-timers will
never make up their losses. In a report released last month, the
EPF calculated that in 18 strikes between 1985 and 1996, lasting
between five and 70 days, most of the strikers would never recoup
their lost pay in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Should the AFL-CIO, the unions' umbrella organization, therefore
be downhearted? Not necessarily. Ron Blackwell, its director of
corporate affairs, argues that ``the pattern is fewer strikes but
better strikes'' which, by raising workers' wages, actually force
companies to take ``a high road to competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the AFL-CIO and its sympathizers can produce figures
to show that the average worker has lost out during seven years of
sustained economic growth. Only in the past two years, for example,
have wages begun to increase in real terms, and one study to be
released next week reckons that the real earnings of the median
worker last year were still 3.1 percent lower than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, over that same period the remuneration package for
the average chief executive doubled to a level 116 times that of
the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the unions are in decline and the economy
still seems robust, can labor still make its voice heard
politically?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can. As last year's inquiry into campaign finance
depressed business contributions to the Democrats, so the party
became more reliant on the support of the unions. This year, with
the Lewinsky saga gnawing at the party's reputation, the reliance
is even greater -- and will especially benefit Dick Gephardt and
President Bill Clinton's other opponents on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is one small puzzle. Why has Clinton, who last
year ordered a 60-day ``cooling-off'' period when American
Airlines' pilots threatened to strike, been so reluctant to make a
similar intervention in the Northwest strike (his transport
secretary, Rodney Slater, has merely been getting both sides to
give him their views)? After all, not only is the airline America's
biggest freight-carrier to Asia, but it is the only convenient air
access for big swathes of the mid-west.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical answer is that the Northwest board includes
Democratic luminaries: not just Checchi, but also Richard Blum, the
husband of California's Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely explanation is that, with Asian trade down and
with other carriers able to take up any slack, Northwest's absence
will have little effect on traffic between America and Asia;
whereas several Latin American and Caribbean countries pointed out
to Clinton the economic harm they would suffer if American Airlines
could no longer serve their region.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the times that many Americans will prefer the
cynical answer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- ``So how much have you lost?'' Not many people
were uncool enough to ask the question. All the same it hung in the
air in lunch-rooms throughout Silicon Valley as the news of last
Monday's stockmarket rout was digested along with the seared-tuna
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in Silicon Valley like to pour scorn on ``old
world, East Coast economics'', few places are as exposed to the
gyrations of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America's high-technology industry, firms in
the Valley have been at the heart of the bull market. Their
employees have participated in it directly. An unusually large
proportion of workers in the Valley receives share options as well
as salaries. Their private investments are heavily biased toward
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a sector that draws its strength from a strong dose of
optimism, high-tech firms have also proved particularly vulnerable
to the market's sudden loss of confidence. That gravity-defying
Internet shares such as Yahoo! and Excite should head earthward
when the market turns sour is not surprising, as one analyst drily
observed: ``they may be insulated from earnings, but not from
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But when ``safety stocks'' such as Microsoft, Dell and Cisco get
caught up in the general mayhem, a frisson of fear runs through the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   True, during the week the technology-rich Nasdaq index clawed
back some of the week's losses. But the share prices of many
technology firms are well down from the record highs of earlier
this year. Worse, American firms, giddy after Wall Street's
see-sawing, may cut spending on electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week there were signs that all was not well in
the nerve-center of high-tech America. Many of its inhabitants like
to believe that the magic land between San Francisco and San Jose
has discovered the secret of perpetual profit-free share-price
growth. The Valley, they argue, is a ``New Economy'' based on
knowledge, not goods, and is thus less exposed to unpleasant
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell a different story. It is true that the
region's software industry has produced much of the recent growth.
This sector, however, employs only one-third as many people as the
computer, communications and semiconductor industries together.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Valley's economy today depends more on exports
than it did -- particularly exports across the Pacific. Since 1991,
the region's sales of manufactured goods abroad have doubled,
reaching almost $40 billion in 1996. That makes Silicon Valley
America's top exporting region, ahead even of Detroit. Well over
half of those exports were shipped to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the more traditional Silicon Valley has been hurt
by an ``unprecedented convergence'' of three factors, as James
Morgan of Applied Materials termed it, when the world's largest
semiconductor-equipment maker announced layoffs of 2,000 people at
the end of August. These are economic turmoil in Asia, overcapacity
in the semiconductor industry and the shift toward low-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why the Valley job machine has slowed in recent
months. In the year to July 22,800 new jobs were created in Santa
Clara County, the heart of the region, compared with 53,000 in the
year to July 1997. At the same time, the unemployment rate has
edged up from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent although that is still
well below the American average.
</P>
<P>
   Equally sobering are the hints that the area's frenetic
venture-capital market may be pausing for breath. Some fear that
the process of financing start-ups has run out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unhealthy overfunding has led to a lack of the Darwin
effect,'' says Ann Winblad, a venture capitalist at Hummer Winblad,
who is a noted bear. Cynics exaggerate only slightly when they say
you have only to stamp ``Internet'' or ``.com'' on your business
plan to get a bucket-load of money. Many indifferent or easily
imitable ideas have found financing.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the supply of money is still flowing. In the
second quarter, venture capitalists made deals worth a record $1.25
billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But even before this week, the number of IPOs of American
high-tech companies was dropping. The Valley has shared in the
retreat: in the first half of 1998, only 15 went public, compared
with 39 in the whole of 1997 and 72 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The geyser of venture capital is sure to falter if a weak
stockmarket further reduces the scope for IPOs. Some think that the
Valley's larger listed companies can take up the slack by acquiring
more start-ups (a trend that has been growing). But that seems
unrealistic: in a bear market, the M&AMP;A business is bound to lose
some of its momentum. As one venture capitalist puts it: ``The
venture market is a lot like real estate. It will go through denial
a long time, and then eventually capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other venture capitalists say the difficulty of carrying off
listings means that firms will now have to demonstrate sound
fundamentals first. If so they will have to make their venture
capitalists' cash last longer. And that will call for decent
management, the Valley's scarcest resource.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for talent to run new companies, venture
capitalists have begun to spend more time looking for people than
finding money. Indeed, many cite a lack of managers as one of the
main symptoms of the amazing ease of raising capital. Some have set
up ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs to foster chief
executives. Despite their efforts, however, many start-ups are run
by less-than-stellar managers.
</P>
<P>
   Irrepressible confidence and unbounded optimism are essential
parts of Silicon Valley's unique business ecology. The question is
whether the coming slowdown will damage them for any length of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a modest pause may not be such a bad thing. It could
give Silicon Valley a chance to address the problems that threaten
its long-term ability to remain the world capital of high-tech: an
overburdened infrastructure, skyrocketing house prices and
increasing social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   The long boom has left the Valley under strain. Appalling
traffic morning and afternoon is costing businesses approximately
$3.5 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted resources.
Because they cannot afford to buy or rent a house in the Valley,
many workers have little choice but to commute, in many cases for
two hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   House prices have risen to an average of almost $317,000. In
smart places such as Hillsborough and Atherton, the average house
costs almost twice as much as in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate boom has also increased the gap between those at
the top and those who keep the offices clean and the entrepreneurs
fed. At $46,000 a year, Santa Clara County now has the highest
average wage in America, but it also has one of the highest rates
of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' some Silicon Valley veterans respond. Structural
problems have been around for a long time; they have not prevented
the region from prospering. There is as yet no exodus to other
high-tech hubs such as Austin, Boston or Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a declining quality of life threatens to drive
away the people the region most needs to stay competitive in the
``New Economy'': talented managers and young creative people
working in small software companies. Headhunters report that the
quality of life in the Valley is frequently an issue when they try
to hire qualified people.
</P>
<P>
   High rents around Palo Alto have begun driving graduate students
and faculty away from Stanford University, the cradle of Valley
entrepreneurialism, to other prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley elite appears worried too. In early October,
Joint Venture, an organization of businesses, governments and other
local groups, will publish ``Vision 2010,'' a plan for what the
Valley should look like in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although a soft landing might benefit the Valley, the danger is
of something more dramatic. At the moment few think that Silicon
Valley is heading for the kind of bust that happened 15 years ago
when the Japanese invaded the memory-chip market. But an economy
that depends so vitally on confidence can turn down sharply when
that confidence is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of submerged stock options alone should not be
underestimated. Over the past few years people have grown used to
spending far beyond their income, because they owned options that
seemed continually to grow in value.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist with Integral Capital
Partners, predicts that: ``There will be some kind of downturn for
no other reason than Silicon Valley needs to clean the pipes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The vertiginous fall of technology shares was an uncomfortable
reminder that the miracle may be fragile and that, even in a
high-tech paradise such as Silicon Valley, prosperity isn't

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- ``So how much have you lost?'' Not many people
were uncool enough to ask the question. All the same it hung in the
air in lunch-rooms throughout Silicon Valley as the news of last
Monday's stockmarket rout was digested along with the seared-tuna
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in Silicon Valley like to pour scorn on ``old
world, East Coast economics'', few places are as exposed to the
gyrations of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America's high-technology industry, firms in
the Valley have been at the heart of the bull market. Their
employees have participated in it directly. An unusually large
proportion of workers in the Valley receives share options as well
as salaries. Their private investments are heavily biased toward
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a sector that draws its strength from a strong dose of
optimism, high-tech firms have also proved particularly vulnerable
to the market's sudden loss of confidence. That gravity-defying
Internet shares such as Yahoo! and Excite should head earthward
when the market turns sour is not surprising, as one analyst drily
observed: ``they may be insulated from earnings, but not from
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But when ``safety stocks'' such as Microsoft, Dell and Cisco get
caught up in the general mayhem, a frisson of fear runs through the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   True, during the week the technology-rich Nasdaq index clawed
back some of the week's losses. But the share prices of many
technology firms are well down from the record highs of earlier
this year. Worse, American firms, giddy after Wall Street's
see-sawing, may cut spending on electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week there were signs that all was not well in
the nerve-center of high-tech America. Many of its inhabitants like
to believe that the magic land between San Francisco and San Jose
has discovered the secret of perpetual profit-free share-price
growth. The Valley, they argue, is a ``New Economy'' based on
knowledge, not goods, and is thus less exposed to unpleasant
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell a different story. It is true that the
region's software industry has produced much of the recent growth.
This sector, however, employs only one-third as many people as the
computer, communications and semiconductor industries together.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Valley's economy today depends more on exports
than it did -- particularly exports across the Pacific. Since 1991,
the region's sales of manufactured goods abroad have doubled,
reaching almost $40 billion in 1996. That makes Silicon Valley
America's top exporting region, ahead even of Detroit. Well over
half of those exports were shipped to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the more traditional Silicon Valley has been hurt
by an ``unprecedented convergence'' of three factors, as James
Morgan of Applied Materials termed it, when the world's largest
semiconductor-equipment maker announced layoffs of 2,000 people at
the end of August. These are economic turmoil in Asia, overcapacity
in the semiconductor industry and the shift toward low-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why the Valley job machine has slowed in recent
months. In the year to July 22,800 new jobs were created in Santa
Clara County, the heart of the region, compared with 53,000 in the
year to July 1997. At the same time, the unemployment rate has
edged up from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent although that is still
well below the American average.
</P>
<P>
   Equally sobering are the hints that the area's frenetic
venture-capital market may be pausing for breath. Some fear that
the process of financing start-ups has run out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unhealthy overfunding has led to a lack of the Darwin
effect,'' says Ann Winblad, a venture capitalist at Hummer Winblad,
who is a noted bear. Cynics exaggerate only slightly when they say
you have only to stamp ``Internet'' or ``.com'' on your business
plan to get a bucket-load of money. Many indifferent or easily
imitable ideas have found financing.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the supply of money is still flowing. In the
second quarter, venture capitalists made deals worth a record $1.25
billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But even before this week, the number of IPOs of American
high-tech companies was dropping. The Valley has shared in the
retreat: in the first half of 1998, only 15 went public, compared
with 39 in the whole of 1997 and 72 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The geyser of venture capital is sure to falter if a weak
stockmarket further reduces the scope for IPOs. Some think that the
Valley's larger listed companies can take up the slack by acquiring
more start-ups (a trend that has been growing). But that seems
unrealistic: in a bear market, the M&AMP;A business is bound to lose
some of its momentum. As one venture capitalist puts it: ``The
venture market is a lot like real estate. It will go through denial
a long time, and then eventually capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other venture capitalists say the difficulty of carrying off
listings means that firms will now have to demonstrate sound
fundamentals first. If so they will have to make their venture
capitalists' cash last longer. And that will call for decent
management, the Valley's scarcest resource.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for talent to run new companies, venture
capitalists have begun to spend more time looking for people than
finding money. Indeed, many cite a lack of managers as one of the
main symptoms of the amazing ease of raising capital. Some have set
up ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs to foster chief
executives. Despite their efforts, however, many start-ups are run
by less-than-stellar managers.
</P>
<P>
   Irrepressible confidence and unbounded optimism are essential
parts of Silicon Valley's unique business ecology. The question is
whether the coming slowdown will damage them for any length of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a modest pause may not be such a bad thing. It could
give Silicon Valley a chance to address the problems that threaten
its long-term ability to remain the world capital of high-tech: an
overburdened infrastructure, skyrocketing house prices and
increasing social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   The long boom has left the Valley under strain. Appalling
traffic morning and afternoon is costing businesses approximately
$3.5 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted resources.
Because they cannot afford to buy or rent a house in the Valley,
many workers have little choice but to commute, in many cases for
two hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   House prices have risen to an average of almost $317,000. In
smart places such as Hillsborough and Atherton, the average house
costs almost twice as much as in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate boom has also increased the gap between those at
the top and those who keep the offices clean and the entrepreneurs
fed. At $46,000 a year, Santa Clara County now has the highest
average wage in America, but it also has one of the highest rates
of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' some Silicon Valley veterans respond. Structural
problems have been around for a long time; they have not prevented
the region from prospering. There is as yet no exodus to other
high-tech hubs such as Austin, Boston or Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a declining quality of life threatens to drive
away the people the region most needs to stay competitive in the
``New Economy'': talented managers and young creative people
working in small software companies. Headhunters report that the
quality of life in the Valley is frequently an issue when they try
to hire qualified people.
</P>
<P>
   High rents around Palo Alto have begun driving graduate students
and faculty away from Stanford University, the cradle of Valley
entrepreneurialism, to other prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley elite appears worried too. In early October,
Joint Venture, an organization of businesses, governments and other
local groups, will publish ``Vision 2010,'' a plan for what the
Valley should look like in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although a soft landing might benefit the Valley, the danger is
of something more dramatic. At the moment few think that Silicon
Valley is heading for the kind of bust that happened 15 years ago
when the Japanese invaded the memory-chip market. But an economy
that depends so vitally on confidence can turn down sharply when
that confidence is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of submerged stock options alone should not be
underestimated. Over the past few years people have grown used to
spending far beyond their income, because they owned options that
seemed continually to grow in value.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist with Integral Capital
Partners, predicts that: ``There will be some kind of downturn for
no other reason than Silicon Valley needs to clean the pipes out.''
</P>
<P>
   The vertiginous fall of technology shares was an uncomfortable
reminder that the miracle may be fragile and that, even in a
high-tech paradise such as Silicon Valley, prosperity isn't
automatic.

MERYL STREEP'S NEW MOVIE HAS HER RECALLING EX-FIANCE'S FIGHT WITH
CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 &HT;     Includes a color slide of Meryl Streep in a scene from `One
True Thing.' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For Meryl Streep, her new movie, ``One True Thing,'' hit close
to home, perhaps too close.
 &HT;    Playing a woman with cancer in the film based on Anna Quindlen's
best selling novel, Streep was flooded with memories of ex-fiance
John Cazale, who died of cancer in the early 1980s.
 &HT;    Streep and Cazale met on the set of ``The Deerhunter'' (1978).
When he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Streep became his
caretaker.
 &HT;    Streep has never talked in-depth with the press about it and
it's obvious she still finds it difficult. ``It all lines up really
clearly,'' she says. ``I learned what really is important. I found
what is true and what's just stupid and meaningless and not worth
pursuing. It lined up for me at an early age. I'm sure that's why I
am strong today.''
 &HT;    On the set of ``One True Thing,'' Streep says she thought about
Cazale's fight ``on a day-to-day basis. And that was helpful to
me.''
 &HT;    With a life-or-death plot in the new movie, it's easy to see why
Streep thought of him.
 &HT;    In the movie, opening Sept. 18, it's a freezing night in
Princeton, N.J., and Streep's character is preparing to die. The
wind chill is 10 below. Snow is falling. And she is slumped over in
a wheelchair struggling to breathe.
 &HT;    They say that those who are about to die think about the
strangest things. For 12 hours, Streep thought about her shoes. She
figured death could be not proud. But why did it have to be so
unfashionable?
 &HT;    As a woman whose body is in the final stage of cancer, she had
to stand in dark brown slippery flats and inch her way toward her
character's version of heaven on earth: a Christmas tree in the
center of town filled with family and friends.
 &HT;    Getting there wasn't easy. Streep stood and wobbled. Extras
gasped because her pain looked real. When her knees buckled,
William Hurt, who plays her husband, involuntarily grabbed one arm
and lifted her into his arms.
 &HT;    Suddenly, Streep's entire body pitched forward like her bones
were turning to dust.
 &HT;    Renee Zellweger, who plays her daughter, couldn't take it
anymore, weeping uncontrollably. Those were unscripted tears. ``It
ruined me. Twenty times in a row, I just lost it,'' Zellweger says.
 &HT;    How good is Streep? The memories of watching her work makes
Zellweger tear up 12 months later in a Chicago hotel room.
 &HT;    For her part, the vibrant Streep vaults her body into a couch
and looks feisty during an interview when she starts whooping,
``suckers!''
 &HT;    This is what really motivated her: ``In my mind I was inching
toward that Christmas tree thinking, `Don't fall down.' I had these
extraordinary slippery shoes on. These horrible flats that didn't
have any grooves on the bottom. It was treacherous! The snow would
melt and re-freeze turning it into a solid block of ice.''
 &HT;    Of course, there were deeper, sad emotions in a cancer movie.
Streep's face turns angelic. The setting sun frames the beautiful,
regal 49-year-old when she says, ``This movie was not hard to act.
There are a lot of things that are hard to act.''
 &HT;    In ``One True Thing,'' Streep plays Kate, the perfect wife and
mother who spends her days cooking, sewing and throwing her husband
surprise parties much to the eye rolling, take-it-for-granted
attitude of her children.
 &HT;    Suddenly, she gets cancer. The bake sale is postponed. And
Zellweger, a self-absorbed New York City magazine writer, must move
home to pick up the pieces.
 &HT;    ``I fell in love with the book. I think this book got it right
about the confrontation between two generations of women,'' Streep
says. ``It's about stay-at-home mothers who didn't exploit any of
their larger ambitions. Of course, their daughters think they
wasted their lives. Their daughters don't see the invisible
contributions.''
 &HT;    Some might not see the invisible thread that connects Streep's
real life to her reel life.
 &HT;    But it's there. And the connection made her extremely sad. ``You
know what makes me sad?'' she says. ``Why is it that only in the
most extreme circumstances do you get down to saying what you need
to say to someone you love?
 &HT;    ``Why does someone have to be sick before they think about the
worth of their life and what they want to leave behind? I think
these are gorgeous thoughts to have on a daily basis,'' Streep
says.
 &HT;    A moment passes and when you think Streep will change the
subject she continues. ``For me, his (Cazale's) death has always
been something so private. I think making this movie is my way to
talk about it.
 &HT;    ``It's hard for me to talk about this in any context except with
people who were there and knew about it,'' Streep says. ``Talking
about it makes it smaller, and it had so much significance in my
life. It helped me focus on what to do with the rest of my life and
how to be in my life.''
 &HT;    Which brings her back to ``One True Thing.''
 &HT;    ``I just hope that people won't be afraid of seeing this movie.
I hope they don't think it's too sad. To those people, I want to
say, `Life is sad. Sometimes the sadness is what counts. It's what
makes you understand the whole thing,'' she says.
 &HT;    Streep also understands how to have a life.
 &HT;    Is she a different mother than her mother?
 &HT;    ``I finally gave up trying to be everything to all people after
about the third child,'' the mom of four says. ``I realized I just
couldn't make every deadline the way my mother had.''
 &HT;    The Oscar-winning actress notes that she could work more.
 &HT;    ``I just don't do as many movies as other people. It's my
choice,'' she says. ``I make all the decisions based on my
family.''
 &HT;    As a mom, she can be, well, motherly. ``I nag the kids to read.
I'm the one who says, `You don't know how lucky you are to have all
these opportunities afforded you.' But kids don't hear it. They
just live their life and basically they just want to watch TV.''
She pauses. ``Of course, I don't let them watch that much TV.''
 &HT;    When she's working, Streep's husband Donald Gummer, a sculptor,
takes over. Ask her the secret of her long-lasting marriage.
``Love. We know life is about change,'' she offers.
 &HT;    With ``One True Thing'' done, she is about to get back to work.
First, Streep stars in another fall film, ``Dancing at Lughnasa,''
already getting critical raves. She is also training to play a
violin teacher in Harlem in ``Fifty Violins,'' a role she got when
Madonna dropped out.
 &HT;    Clearly, she doesn't lack for work, unlike struggling peers.
And, Streep can't help but notice the trend of much younger
actresses co-starring with actors Streep's age and older.
 &HT;    ``I read Sharon Stone say that she is too old to play opposite
Mel Gibson, and she's 10 years younger than him. That makes me mad.
I don't know why people are perceived as done at a certain age,''
she says.
 &HT;    She tells a story about her hit film ``The Bridges of Madison
County'' which garnered Streep a Best Actress nomination. ``You've
got Clint Eastwood. He's 65. He's playing a 50-year-old man. I'm
playing a 45-year-old woman. I was 45 at the time. But the studio
said I was too old for the part.''
 &HT;    ``Clint finally had to say, `OK, I'll direct this movie, so I
can have the person who I want in the part.''' She groans. ``The
perception is that we're contemporaries, and Clint is 20 years
older than I am. It's very bizarre.''
 &HT;    And too complicated to talk about, since her children are about
to arrive from the mall.
 &HT;    Will she let her kids watch this movie? ``I think it would
really upset them to see their mom looking so ill.''
 &HT;    However, she took her mother to a screening. ``She found it very
difficult to watch, but at the end, my mom said, `That was a
helluva good movie.'''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Acting was in the cards for Elizabeth Pena.
 &HT;    ``My father's an actor-director-playwright and, besides, I went
to see a play when I was 8 years old and I was blown away by the
woman starring in the play,'' the effusive Pena says. ``I got
goosebumps when the play ended, and I was sobbing.
 &HT;    ``My mother came over, going `Baby, what's the matter?' I said,
`I want to be an actor.' And that's how it all began.
 &HT;    ``My father secretly rejoiced in it, but my mother _ who
actually now works at the Latin American Theater Ensemble _ thought
that if you're an actor you're a loser who will be insecure, judged
and broke. She felt acting was not a career, but I told her that
I'd incorporate business on to the show, that I'd make money from
it.
 &HT;    ``I have and I do, and I've done nothing but act since I was
19.''
 &HT;    Pena's credits include such features as ``Lone Star'' (1996),
``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' (1986), ``La Bamba'' (1987),
``Jacob's Ladder'' (1990) and ``Blue Steel'' (1990), the TV series
``Shannon's Deal'' and the cable TV movie ``The Second Civil War''
(1997). The Cuban-American actress returns to the big screen on
Sept. 18 in ``Rush Hour,'' an action-comedy with chopsocky
superstar Jackie Chan and funnyman Chris Tucker.
 &HT;    Chan stars as Inspector Lee, a Hong Kong cop who arrives in Los
Angeles to retrieve the Chinese Consul's kidnapped 11-year-old
daughter. Tucker plays James Carter, a reckless, self-centered
detective chosen for the make-work FBI assignment of distracting
Lee.
 &HT;    Pena is Tania Johnson, an LAPD explosives expert who finds
herself reluctantly helping Lee and Carter once they decide to
solve the case on their own. Of course, plenty of jokes, explosions
and Chan-style fights ensue.
 &HT;    ``I was interested in doing a Jackie Chan movie, and that was a
big attraction for me,'' says Pena, a petite woman who sports a
silky brown dress and short brown hair as she sits for an interview
in a suite at the Rihga Royal Hotel in Manhattan. ``With most of
your action heroes, you applaud, realize they've shot 250 people,
and then you're ready for them to shoot another one. That's a
little weird to me.
 &HT;    ``Jackie doesn't shoot a gun, and he actually doesn't want to
fight. To do an action movie that's Zen, that's a bonus.
 &HT;    ``I obviously didn't do the movie because Tania was the most
fascinating character I'd ever read in my life. I auditioned, got
the part, and after I got it, (director) Brett Ratner was open
enough to make some changes I needed.''
 &HT;    Pena, who turns 37 on Sept. 23, specifically requested that
Johnson not come across too girlish or too bitchy, as she'd been
depicted in the first script drafts. She wanted Johnson to hold her
own with Lee and Carter, and to carry and fire a gun.
 &HT;    ``I also wanted Chris to have to come to me to help him out,
which wasn't in the script,'' Pena says. ``When they did write it,
it was a phone conversation and I was off-camera.
 &HT;    ``I said, `This is the only opportunity to see Tania not at her
job, but in her house, hanging out, and to see that she's a female
who has a life.' I didn't want more dialogue: I just wanted Brett
to shoot my side of the conversation.
 &HT;    ``Brett was very cool, and he did it for me. So, add that to
getting a kick out of working with Jackie and Chris, and I was a
very happy camper on this film.''
 &HT;    Following ``Rush Hour,'' Pena rushed into two independent
features, ``Strangeland'' and ``The Pass.'' The actress describes
``The Pass'' as a black comedy road movie that allowed her for the
first time to portray a truly dark and mean-spirited woman.
 &HT;    ``Strangeland'' sounds, well, strange. It's a horror movie
that's the brainchild of Dee Snider, former lead singer of the rock
group Twisted Sister.
 &HT;    ``It's about Dee's character, who's into body piercing and
tattooing,'' Pena says. ``I'm not talking about a little nose ring,
but bones in your head.
 &HT;    ``Dee lures teen-agers into his house by using the Internet.
Basically, he keeps them captive and does all sorts of stuff to
them, but doesn't kill them.
 &HT;    ``What I liked in shooting it was that it wasn't gross. The
camera was not focused on the guy doing some horrible thing. The
horror comes from you watching the nail that's going to go into the
head or the reaction of the person observing something.''
 &HT;    Pena and Kevin Gage play a couple on the verge of divorce whose
daughter falls prey to Snider. And, to put it mildly, Pena's
character doesn't take it very well.
 &HT;    ``You don't know how a picture will be put together, but the way
we were making it was that somewhere in the middle you're suddenly
not sure who's the good guy and who's the bad guy,'' Pena says. ``I
know it sounds like a sick movie, but if they put out the film we
tried to make, it could be very exciting, very scary.''
 &HT;    To date, Pena counts ``Lone Star,'' ``Jacob's Ladder,'' ``Down
and Out in Beverly Hills'' and ``La Bamba'' as her best films.
``Lone Star,'' John Sayles' acclaimed multicharacter drama about
the denizens of a small Texas town haunted by past sins, remains
the actress's personal favorite credit.
 &HT;    ``It was a joy to actually have words you could speak, and the
words were beautiful,'' says Pena, who played a proud teacher.
``John's a wonderful director and it was a wonderful experience.
 &HT;    ``When it came out, I'd started shooting `The Second Civil War'
for Showtime and I found out I was pregnant. So, I decided to go
away for a year.
 &HT;    ``I ended up not riding the wave (of box-office and critical
popularity) for `Lone Star.' But the way I figure it, I'm going to
be in this business until they bring me in, I'm drooling, they give
me a cracker, show me a cue card and I go, `Uuuhhh, I can do this.'
 &HT;    ``So, I may have another break.''
 &HT;    Pena, who lives in Washington State with her husband, a
carpenter named Hans, and their 16-month-old daughter, doesn't know
what she'll do next. One offer on the table, though, intrigues her
tremendously.
 &HT;    ``I got the strangest proposition, which was to do a talk
show,'' she says, shaking her head in disbelief. ``I sat there and
went `What?' It's bizarre.
 &HT;    ``I said, `You're talking to me? You've seen my resume. Why in
the world would you want me to do a talk show?' They said, `Think
about it,' and I said, `There's nothing to think about. I don't
want to be Arsenio Hall. I like to act.'
 &HT;    ``Then I started to think about it. Maybe instead of being an
entertainment show, I could have people come in (as guests) and
read excerpts from books. I could introduce new artists.''
 &HT;    Pena laughs.
 &HT;    ``I proposed this to them, and everybody's yessing me,'' she
continues, obviously bemused. ``I don't know what it means, though,
because this is Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``If they let me do something different and interesting and they
pay me lots and lots of money, I might do it. I've been in this
business a long time, and I ain't rich yet.''
 &HT;    Pena may not yet be rich, but she's certainly respected by
filmmakers and audiences alike. Even her mother now approves of her
career choice.
 &HT;    ``About a year ago I went to a Cuban-Chinese restaurant in
Manhattan,'' she says. ``I'm sitting there about to open my
newspaper, I look up and I see a picture of me, autographed. But I
didn't sign it.
 &HT;    ``I go look at the picture, and the signature's in my mother's
handwriting. So, I think she's a little proud of me.''

SHAQUILLE O'NEAL DRIBBLES TWO BALLS: BASKETBALL AND ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Shaquille O'Neal 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1-inch Los Angeles Lakers center,
was born to be a basketball player. The question now is can he play
basketball and be an entertainer?
 &HT;    It's an issue that comes up often in the seemingly overlapping
world of sports and music and acting. ``Ya know, I think all
basketball players want to be rappers and all rappers basketball
players,'' he says in a telephone interview, his 2-year-old
daughter in the background.
 &HT;    ``But few sports stars have been able to make the jump to
Hollywood while they were still playing good basketball,'' O'Neal
says. ``I know that's a risk for me because if I make that
crossover, I have to do it very well. If not, I get blown out of
the box.''
 &HT;    While he's been touring this summer to promote his new album,
``Respect,'' this particular day finds him playing with his
daughter. ``Oh baby, now baby,'' O'Neal says in a soft-spoken
admonishment to Taahirah, looking up at her gentle giant dad.
 &HT;    ``You have to be softer with little girls,'' O'Neal says.
``Little boys can handle a little roughness. Taahirah has no
time-outs _ ever! She's still young, so I think you teach by
example.''
 &HT;    Sure doesn't sound like a tough athlete who piles up points by
pounding the boards and proving he's an immovable object. And his
soft voice shows no signs of a hardboiled rapper setting out to
grab a piece of the rap action.
 &HT;    But the big man _ 310 pounds and 20 inch neck _ hit the road for
a 12-city tour for his fifth rap album. Released on his TWIsM (The
World Is Mine) Records through a joint venture with A&AMP;M Records,
the album debuts Sept. 15.
 &HT;    Whose respect is O'Neal after anyway?
 &HT;    ``Everyone and anyone,'' O'Neal says, looking forward to trading
dunks for smash cuts. ``I want people to see me not as some
Superbowl rapper/basketball player, but as a legitimate rapper.''
 &HT;    It seems gaining respect is important to this multi talented
performer, attempting to meld his sports and entertainment careers
that so many sports figures shoot for, but few attain.
 &HT;    O'Neal has already appeared in three movies: ``Blue Chips''
(1994), a basketball-set story starring Nick Nolte; ``Kazaam''
(1996), in which he played the rappin' genie springing from a
boombox; and ``Steel (1997), the second movie with O'Neal as lead,
playing an armor-clad crime fighter battling bad guys.
 &HT;    ``Kazaam'' pulled in a modest $18.9 million domestically, while
``Steel'' did even less. ``I don't try to come out and make
millions the opening day. Only a few people can do that,'' O'Neal
says.
 &HT;    ``I just want people to go and enjoy themselves. I just want to
have a good time making them and give people a good product _ that
doesn't always happen,'' he says, ``but it's not for lack of
trying.''
 &HT;    He's also put considerable efforts into rap. His first album was
1993's ``Shaq Diesel,'' which went Platinum with 861,000 copies
sold, and produced a hit single, ``I'm Outstanding.''
 &HT;    In 1994, he wrote his memoirs, ``Shaq Attack.'' Add to that his
Shaq Attaq clothing line, multi million dollar endorsements and
directing debut in Nickelodeon's ``Cousin Skeeter,'' and you wonder
why is respect so important to this 26-year-old?
 &HT;    ``Cause it is. I don't want to disrespect people so my rappin'
words are always friendly and clean. I don't want mothers saying to
their kids `What did he say?''' Admittedly, O'Neal says he is not
the world's best rapper, ``but I've got some of the best on my
album.''
 &HT;    ``Respect'' showcases DJ Quik, Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz as well
as Fat Joe and Big Pun. ``If I couldn't flow with them even a
little bit, they wouldn't rhyme with me and would let me know.''
 &HT;    ``The Way It's Going Down'' with Brandy and Monica, Backstreet
Boys and Usher is a really good track, ``for both dance floors and
jeeps,'' O'Neal says. ``Show Me,'' about a search for true love
combines two lost loves of O'Neal. ``An old love and new one with a
rather famous person _ they both went bust.''
 &HT;    Anyone we know? ``Yeh, but I'll never say who. I'm not looking
anymore _ I'm off the shelf,'' referring to his domesticity with
lady love and mother to his daughter. O'Neal declined to say
whether he is married or identify the woman.
 &HT;    For all his time spent on a basketball court _ ever since his
dad put a basketball into his hands _ O'Neal also spent hours as a
teen-ager working on musicians' moves.
 &HT;    ``I used to get in front of the mirror and mock my favorite
artists: UTFO, Heavy D, Run-DMC and LL Cool J. I'm sure people
think of me first as a basketball player and that's OK, but I don't
want people to remember me just for that,'' he says.
 &HT;    Now, O'Neal's show biz profile is going up. While the No. 34
Lakers star had 208 offensive rebounds last season with a field
goal percentage of .584, O'Neal's music, movies and TV shows have
been put full-court as well.
 &HT;    As the Laker's $120 million man, he was No. 5 on Forbes' 1995
list of top earning athletes. The four above him then were Michael
Jordan, Mike Tyson, Deion Sanders and Riddick Bowe.
 &HT;    His appeal as America's approachable, winning gentle giant has
bought him two homes, one in upscale Manhattan Beach, Calif., and a
condo on tony Wilshire Boulevard plus four cars.
 &HT;    ``I love cars,'' is all he can say. He also has a personal chef
and trainer. Isn't it tough cooking for someone O'Neal's size?
 &HT;    ``Naw, I eat the same thing almost everyday,'' he says. ``I have
an omelette in the morning, tuna or fish for lunch and chicken for
dinner.''
 &HT;    What about slushing down some of his endorsements such as Pepsi
and Taco Bell? ``Yeh, I drink Pepsi, and I occasionally stop for a
Taco Bell grandito.'' He doesn't believe in dieting.
 &HT;    Growing up in Newark, N.J., to Army dad, Philip Harrison, and
secretary mom Lucille, ``who always cooked for the whole team,''
O'Neal says he always wanted to play pro basketball.
 &HT;    ``But my next dream was a professional rapper. Some days I
wanted to be Dr. J, other days I wanted to be LL Cool J.''
 &HT;    He attended Louisiana State for one year before being drafted in
1992 by the Orlando Magic in the NBA draft. In 1996, he signed with
the Lakers as a free agent.
 &HT;    So it's O'Neal's world. Why doesn't he take time off?
 &HT;    ``I have all the leisure time I want,'' O'Neal says. ``I'm in
control of my schedule unless I'm playing ball or doing a film.''
 &HT;    In fact, he admits he's watched his favorite movie, ``The Fish
That Saved Pittsburgh'' (1979), too many times to count.
 &HT;    ``See, I'll sit down and watch a movie or listen to some of my
favorite music.'' On the other hand, he says he doesn't really sit
still for all that long.
 &HT;    ``My parents were real hard workers. I love both of them very
much.'' Hard work and determination formed O'Neal's values of
today. At 14, he was working at McDonald's on an Army base until he
got the job of baby sitter for his four siblings.
 &HT;    ``My parents taught me to work hard and make something of
myself. I've always worked hard. And they told me to follow my
dreams _ don't let anyone tell you that you can't accomplish
something _ because you can.''
 &HT;    And he wants to bring his philosophy to the public. ``I'm
working on a book now and would like to call it `Dreamful
Attraction.' I always had dreams when I was a boy _ mystical type
dreams where you tell yourself you can do anything if you apply
yourself.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, O'Neal dreams of NBA playoffs ``but also that
I will have a good life with my family. Almost all of my dreams
have come true, but I've worked really hard for that.''

SUE COSTELLO, STAR OF NEW FOX SHOW, IS STILL A BOSTON GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

 Includes a color slide of Sue Costello and her dog in a scene from
`Costello' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 TV Guide (Canada)  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No matter how big a hit _ or nonhit _ the rookie FOX sitcom
``Costello'' becomes, it's a given that the show's bombastic star,
Sue Costello, isn't going to let the whole Hollywood thing go to
her head.
 &HT;    In fact, the way she tells it, she doesn't have to change a darn
thing. ``Remember Popeye?'' Costello says in that broad South
Boston accent. ``Me and him have the same philosophy: I am what I
am. That's why this show is perfect for me. I can just be myself
and be honest, and hopefully that's what viewers will want.
 &HT;    ``Sure, if the show is a bomb, then I guess it means people hate
me,'' she says. ``But there's no damn way I'm going to become a
different person, or some big Hollywood phony. Uh-uh, no sir.''
 &HT;    Working in Costello's favor is the fact her series, premiering
Sept. 8, is based largely on her own real life. On the show, she
plays Sue Murphy, a motor-mouthed 27-year-old bartender working in
the tough, working-class area of South Boston.
 &HT;    In real life, Costello grew up on the mean streets of South
Boston as part of a hard-working Irish-Catholic family, which is
also replicated on the show. One exception: On the TV version, Sue
Murphy's family _ belligerent parents Spud and Lottie (Dan Lauria,
Jenny O'Hara) and sluggish brother Jimmy (Chuck Walczak) _ spend
most of their time yelling at each other, albeit in a loving
fashion.
 &HT;    ``Even though the neighborhood and the family is very
dysfunctional,'' Costello says, ``you can see that I still respect
it and that's how I'm portraying it ... The family is a lot like my
own. The characters all have a little bit of every Southie I've
ever met.''
 &HT;    The blue-collar aspect of Costello's character is authentic.
Back in the old neighborhood, her mother was a laborer in the
maintenance department at the University of Boston, and her father
worked for the local carpenter's union.
 &HT;    As a kid, Costello says she felt ``different'' growing up,
primarily because she wanted to express her creative urges. Last
year, when she saw the Oscar-winning film ``Good Will Hunting,''
also set in South Boston, a lot of the old memories came back.
 &HT;    ``They did capture it,'' she says. ``He (Matt Damon) said in the
movie: `I didn't ask for this.' That made me cry, because it showed
the excruciating pain of being somebody who is creative in that
neighborhood.''
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, Costello was hell-bent on self-improvement and
enrolled in Salem State College. ``I went to night school, because
I didn't feel I was smart enough to go to day school,'' she shrugs.
``I was an English major, and I had to write a paper. So I gave the
paper to the English guy, and he asked me if I ever thought about
being a chef.''
 &HT;    Instead, Costello started taking acting classes: Her first role
was as a hooker in a college stage production. Soon after, she got
into stand-up comedy and found herself onstage at Caroline's, the
famous comedy club in New York.
 &HT;    It was around that same time that she began going to therapy in
order to discover more about herself (on ``Costello,'' her
character does the same thing, starting in the very first episode).
Therapy, she says, helped put her tough streetwise past into proper
perspective.
 &HT;    ``When I meet people,'' Costello says, ``still to this day _ and
this is after 10 years of serious, intensive help _ if I walk up to
somebody, a grown man, I say, `Hey, can I take him?' If I can take
him, I can hang around with him because then I won't be afraid. My
business manager? I figured, I can take him in a fight, I can hire
him.''
 &HT;    Costello moved to Los Angeles in 1994 and was subsequently cast
in roles on a movie remake of ``Spenser: For Hire'' and ABC's
police drama ``NYPD Blue.'' She also had parts on two pilots,
``Queens'' and ``Paulie Dodge,'' neither of which were picked up by
a network.
 &HT;    ``Those were pretty good shows and it was a great learning thing
for me, but they really didn't have anything to do with the way I
really am,'' she says.
 &HT;    The real payoff for Costello came with her very own show, which
meant she could finally just be herself. ``It's the best,'' she
beams. ``The absolute best.''
 &HT;    And like a good Southie native, one of the first things Costello
did after getting her own series was to go back home for a visit.
``One of the guys came out of the bar,'' she says laughing, ``and
he's like, `Sue, you told us you were going to be famous, but we
didn't think you really meant it!'''

Kings Island's largest investment since it was constructed for $35
million 26 years ago. (Tresslar, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The vacation talk that Bill and Hillary Clinton must have shared
recently came into my empty head unbidden like a random, uninvited
vision of hanky-panky in the Oval Office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I cannot, of course, vouch for the authenticity of any voices
that creep into my cranium that way, but, on reflection, the
special drawl and angularity of the words seemed to have an eerily
convincing ring to them. Listen: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill: Now, dear. . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary: Stop right there, Mr. Perjurybreath. I'll tell you
when, if ever, you can call me dear again. How dear was I to you
when you were being serviced by Moonica? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Monica. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: You call her what you want and I'll call her what I want. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Yes, dea. . .uh. . .Hillary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Now let's review the mess you've made. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Could I please say somethin' first? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: No, Mr. Pinocchionose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: (He looks at his watch and wonders why the phone doesn't
ring, but he simply sighs.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: (She sighs, too. Deeply. Then she stares at him. The look on
her face is one of disgust, tinged with puzzlement. For as long as
she's known this wonderful, fallible, smart, stupid man, she's
never been able to figure him out altogether. Now that she's got
him cornered and defensive and quiet, she thinks that maybe, just
maybe, if she stares at him long enough she'll be given some kind
of helpful revelation.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: (After 50 or 60 seconds, he coughs a little and clears his
throat. And he turns to stare out the window.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Damn you, Bill Clinton! You look at me when I'm not talking
to you! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: (His eyes meet hers. He blinks a wounded blink.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Now the fact of the matter is, Mr. Hotspringspants, you've
really gone and done it this time. You may have cooked your goose
as well as mine, to say nothing of the Democratic party's and the
whole institution of the presidency. You've lied to me. You've lied
to Chelsea. You've lied to Buddy. You've lied to Socks. You've lied
to the world. And _ AND, Mr. Cock and Bull _ you've lied to that
24-carat jerk Ken Starr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: I agree with you. He is a jerk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Don't you try to change the subject, Mr. Didn't Inhale. You
and I aren't going to agree on a thing here today. Not one hoodooed
thing. I don't want anything in common with you here today. In
fact, for the rest of the day I'm dropping Clinton from my name.
You will call me Hillary Rodham today. I knew I kept that name for
some good reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Now, let's don't be silly about this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Look who's talking about overreacting, Mr. Shuck and Jive.
One night I tell you I've got a headache and your reaction is to go
have a months-long affair with someone young enough to be your
waitress at McDonald's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Are you hungry? I'm starved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: Is that all you think about? Food? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: You got that right, Mr. Subpoenahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B: Hillary Rodham, I did some wrong things. I hurt you. I been
bad. Bad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H: When you should have been building a bridge to the 21st
century, you were building one to a 21-year-old. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On it went until it faded out of my noggin. Except for one last
snippet in Hillary's voice: ``If they impeach you, can I still be
first lady?'' &QL;
</P>

WHOLESOME PAX TV APPARENTLY FINDS A PARTNER IN RACY UPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We had such high hopes for Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   We thought it would be different: a network with a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   We were wrong. We were wronged.
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV, we learned a month before its premiere earlier this
week, was not above using anti-gay rhetoric in its marketing. Well,
we reasoned, at least its programming _ suitable for the whole
family _ would come as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   And it has _ until now. Because now it is being divulged by
industry people that Pax TV, in a reciprocal agreement, will run
some primetime UPN programming late at night in markets where UPN
does not have an affiliate. UPN will do the same thing for Pax TV
where Pax does not have an affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   This will only affect a handful of markets; Pax has 86 stations
and affiliates, UPN 187.
</P>
<P>
   Righteous Pax and racy UPN. Try coming up with a more
contradictory combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a corporate deal with UPN to carry UPN programming
from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. starting Oct. 5 (when UPN shows premiere),''
said Michael Collins, general manager of Pax-owned WYPX-TV in
Albany. ``I don't know what to tell you. It is a corporate
decision. It was done for the benefit of the network.''
</P>
<P>
   Family television. What a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV stated its idealistic mission long before it went on the
air Monday, but in the end it may turn out to be worse than any
other network for one reason alone: hypocrisy. At least the other
networks own up to the garbage they put on the air without copping
a holier-than-thou attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, unlike his network, is up-front.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface it certainly seems incongruous,'' Collins said.
``How can I say anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the programs shown on Pax _ mostly reruns like ``Touched
by an Angel'' and ``Highway to Heaven'' _ won't seem terribly out
of place elsewhere. But let's talk about the ``family programming''
Pax would air via UPN:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is ``Seven Days,'' one of the most violent pilots ever
aired, with planes crashing into the White House and frequent
gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   _ And ``Mercy Point,'' a sci-fi show where a severed head is
reattached in a scene reminiscent of ``E.R.'' _ only much bloodier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of, course, there is ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what Pax founder Bud Paxson thinks of his network airing
a show where Abe Lincoln makes a homosexual pass at a black
servant?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, these UPN prime-time shows would run late at night on
Pax TV. No kids will be watching, or at least should be watching.
</P>
<P>
   And don't take this as a knock on UPN: it is what it is, without
pretensions to the contrary like Pax.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a business decision, a good one for both networks. But
when you are a network like Pax TV, promoting yourself as all that
is wholesome and different from the rest of the dial, the move
comes across as crass.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is the same network whose top brass said they did
not mean to take a swipe at gays by denigrating ``alternative
lifestyles'' in a print advertisement. The UPN linkup is yet
another reminder that God and family aside, the bottom line at Pax
is the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Both networks declined immediate comment. Pax network
spokeswoman Nancy Udell did say that an announcement regarding UPN
and the fall could be coming soon. ``We can discuss this further
maybe next week,'' she said. ``Right now I don't have anything to
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV, no matter what its advertisements or mission statement
say, is just another network.
</P>

LAKE PLACID STRUGGLES WITH DISQUIETING REPORTS ABOUT ACID RAIN

<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Fran Betters still remembers the phone call
he got a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran fly-tier was sitting at his usual post, tying flies
in his store not far from Whiteface Ski Area, when the phone rang.
It was a worried customer from down south. He had just read a story
about acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Fran, he asked, are there any fish left in the Adirondacks?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fishing in certain parts of the Adirondacks has never
been better. On a recent drizzly day, Betters was busily tying
flies by the dozen as a steady stream of anglers wandered through
his shop. Outside under the overcast sky, several casters stood in
the Ausable River.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after the effects of acid rain were first spotted in the
Adirondacks, life is just about the same here. Sure, there are
occasional stupid questions, like the elderly woman who once asked
an atmospheric scientist: ``I remember seeing a lot of old barns
here. Did the acid rain destroy them all?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is no. Acid rain's effects are far more
subtle. While it hasn't had any apparent effect on tourism or old
barns, it's still there. Scientists say acid rain has helped kill
fish in more than 450 ponds and lakes and a number of rivers. It
also is credited with killing a number of red spruce trees at high
altitudes, where the acid burns away root hairs. It also ruins the
finish on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just rain,'' shrugs 15-year-old Brian Corrow, manning the
counter at the A&AMP;W snack bar stand outside Lake Placid, which
hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But most residents are not so dismissive. Especially in the face
of a federal report released earlier this month, saying fish and
trees are still dying. Although pollution from the Midwest _ the
main factor behind acid rain _ has been reduced, the report says,
it's not enough to prevent the damage from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   To people here, that makes acid rain one of the biggest problems
in the Adirondacks since the black fly.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain is not only found in the Adirondacks. Scientists say
it has killed stunted trees in New Hampshire, damaged evergreens in
Colorado and helped deteriorate Civil War monuments at Gettysburg,
Pa. It begins in the Midwest, as coal-burning plants send sulfur,
nitrogen and particulates into the easterly winds. When the air
masses hit the mountains of the East, the air condenses and rain
forms. During that process the sulfur turns into acid, although
scientists don't fully understand how it happens.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Clean Air Act of 1990 helped lower the amount of
acid rain that is created. For instance, in 1980, electric plants
nationwide put out 18 million tons of emissions. In 1995, that
number was down to 11.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's a drizzly, foggy day in the Adirondacks. Acidic drizzle,
presumably, which is entering lakes, ponds and streams around the
mountains, is lowering the pH to a level in which many fish cannot
live. Some high-altitude ponds are so acid-heavy the water cannot
even support algae.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the acidic fog is wrapping its tendrils around the
tops of peaks, damaging the roots of red spruce trees, and, slowly,
killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything about acid rain is clear, like the rich blue of
certain mountain lakes that signifies the complete loss of aquatic
life. It depends on which expert you talk to. And it depends where
you stop.
</P>
<P>
   Betters, the fly-tier, said he worries about acid rain but
hasn't seen its effect on the Ausable River, which is stocked by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Betters has been fishing here for more than 35 years. He's done
a lot of research on acid rain, and notes how Adirondack lakes were
acidic to begin with, how a single volcanic eruption fills the air
with more sulfur than any single coal-burning plant. Even feeder
streams are still filled with young brook trout, a sign that life
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected the streams at all,'' Betters said. ``We've
got better streams up here than we did 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not every angler agrees with him. Wayne Failing, a rafting and
fishing guide from Lake Placid, said he is worried about acid rain
and other water quality problems, like heavy metals in lakes that
make eating certain fish dangerous. He also is familiar with the
lakes that don't have fish in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a guide, it's my job to find out which lakes are the least
impacted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming up here for 50 years,'' said Gary Caudle of
Rochester, N.Y., packing his family into his truck after a morning
on the Ausable. ``I've seen most wildlife coming back, but I'm not
seeing nearly the amount of fish I used to. They're stocking it a
lot more, but it's not like I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, acid rain has been a political issue in Washington
and Albany. In the Adirondacks, most residents aren't privy to
legislative committee discussions and thick reports. They just know
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   C.V. ``Major'' Bowes, the owner of a lodge at Big Moose Lake, is
pretty sure acid rain made his daughter sick. But he can't prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   After one of his children complained of stomach cramps and
funny-tasting water, Bowes had his water tested. He found it
contained lead and copper. Apparently, the high acid content of
their water was dissolving the metal in their pipes. Now they treat
their drinking water with limestone to cut down the acid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been studied to death,'' he said of acid rain. ``The big
problem is getting someone to do something about it.''

DOOR-KNOCKERS ADD A WELCOME TOUCH OF YESTERYEAR

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The doorbell is a 200-year-old convenience.
Fashionable door-knockers, however, have been around since the
Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Door-knockers, which are an easy save on the knuckles, have a
simple, yet functional design, consisting of a hinged bar that is
repeatedly clapped against a metal plate, emitting a loud noise
that can be heard throughout the house. The shape of the knocker is
usually a vertical handle, loop or ring.
</P>
<P>
   Door-knockers were replaced by early door bells that operated by
either pulling a knob or turning a lever, before they gave way to
electrical door bells.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners most often select a door-knocker to go with the
period of the house. Door-knockers depicting an eagle were common
in the 19th century, as well as whimsical animal shapes and
mystical figures. Today they may reflect the homeowner's hobbies,
profession, region or family pet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common universal door-knocker motifs is the
pineapple, which has become a symbol for hospitality. Among the
most purchased designs is the urn shape or crest, featuring a
smooth surface in which to engrave one's surname, initials or
street number.
</P>
<P>
   Materials vary from the popular solid brass door-knocker to ones
hand-forged or cast iron, silver plated or with antique finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is common to see both a door-knocker and an electric
doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   Door-knockers are sold at most home centers and hardware stores.
Older, vintage models can be found at auctions and antiques shops,
and through museum and renovator catalogs. Prices vary from $15 for
a small solid brass variety at the hardware store to more than $100
for a reproduction. Depending on age, condition and uniqueness,
antique door-knockers can cost more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Be gentle and not heavy-fisted with a door-knocker. There's
actually an unwritten etiquette to observe when using one: two
knocks for the postman and three knocks to see the mistress or
master of the house.

SIT BACK AND SMELL THE COFFEE WARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GANNON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just in time for the Labor Day weekend's picnics
and beach parties, the U.S. government has informed millions of
formerly healthy Americans that they are fatties.
</P>
<P>
   Its edict on obesity moved 30 million unsuspecting Americans
into Lardville. It also succeeded in declaring wartime veterans who
smoked government-issued cigarettes suddenly guilty of ``willful
misconduct,'' putting them in danger of losing health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous purveyor of hamburgers is now a merchant of
death. ``To me, there is no difference between Ronald McDonald and
Joe Camel,'' says Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell. The Nation
magazine, generally known for its libertine spirit, has taken after
the ``soda barons'' and ``Caffeine, Inc.'' Why? ``Children can
become dependent on caffeine,'' the magazine warns.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have wondered what the health enforcers would target
after tobacco now have at least a partial answer: high-calorie food
and caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting the coercive nature of this crusade. The
Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that low-fat
activists ``hope to bypass the excruciatingly arduous and long path
that anti-tobacco advocates had to travel before warnings about the
hazards of smoking took hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wars on caffeine and fat are mirror images of the
anti-tobacco crusade, which serves as their guide. Both are
brimming with hysteria. ``Diet and lack of exercise kill as many
people as tobacco,'' warns Michael Jacobson, executive director for
the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The American Heart
Association warns that obesity is now an ``epidemic.'' These
dangerous substances are pushed by greedy industries. Their main
victims are children.
</P>
<P>
   A cover story in The Nation on April 27 fired every round in the
activist arsenal. ``Scientific research has linked caffeine to
anxiety, respiratory ailments, possible bone loss and other health
worries,'' the story warned. This dangerous threat is being pushed
by ``Caffeine Inc.,'' which is made up of ``soda barons,'' ``major
caffeine suppliers,'' and ``soda conglomerates.'' Their victims, of
course, are innocent children, lured into caffeine ``addiction'' as
they watch Saturday morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be a real dope not to understand where this is
heading. Starbucks spokeswoman Cheri Libby, fully awake and
smelling the Zeitgeist, told The New York Times, ``As a company we
don't market to teens. We have a lot of different types of profiles
of people who drink coffee. But we don't even track that segment.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear her teeth chattering.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is right to fear lawsuits, as is anyone who has anything
to do with manufacturing or distributing caffeine or high-fat
foods. The Center for Science in the Public Interest contends
restaurants should ``bear responsibility for obesity due to large
portion sizes'' _ just like taverns who serve their patrons one too
many martinis.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, provided a sneak preview of what is
shaping up to be the plaintiff bar's line of attack. ``McDonald's
and every other fast-food producer in America conspire against
me,'' he told his colleagues last month. ``They fill up the
television with ads that attract me to go and eat. They do studies
to try to determine my weakness. Am I not victimized by McDonald's
and Burger King? And, if I am victimized, are they not liable?''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm also raised the big question that Americans should now
ponder: ``Where does this end? If we don't hold people accountable
for decisions they make, does it end with tobacco? Does it end with
alcohol? Does it end with fattening foods?''
</P>
<P>
   I have no answer to that question, other than to say that when
personal responsibility becomes passe, public disorder is bound to
follow. And clearly, a society that treats coffee and hamburgers
with the disdain once reserved for heroin and pornography is in
serious disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Before the reformers are done, many of us will pine for the days
when we merely defined deviancy down.

CALIFORNIA LAUNCHES INTERNET JOB-LISTING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Backed by Richard Strauss' ``Thus Spake
Zarathustra'' on the sound system to underscore the importance of
the event, Mayor Willie Brown launched an Internet-based program
that has the potential to help millions of job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``CalJobs,'' a job-opening and resume-listing system at
www.caljobs.ca.gov that was launched Thursday for the California
Employment Development Department and can match workers with job
openings in the San Francisco area and statewide by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Users can log on and view job listings from private and public
organizations. Just the same, people seeking employees can post
their listings free of charge. The site does ask users to register,
giving their Social Security numbers and other personal data.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, the mayor said, is at the center of an expanding
job market in which CalJobs can be an extraordinarily useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years in Northern California, expectations
are that there will be 25,000 more jobs than there are people to
fill them, Brown said. ``We believe that everyone who is
employment-ready is going to have an option of one or two jobs that
they can contest for,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anywhere on the globe that prospect has
the potential of being a reality as is the case with those of us in
the San Francisco Bay area and particularly in San Francisco,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Development Department and its director, Ray
Remy, hosted the gathering at One Embarcadero Center's SkyDeck
Thursday to demonstrate the automated, easy-to-use labor exchange
system that lists jobs and resumes, using Internet technology to
share employment information.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows the public and agencies, including county
welfare departments, to access job information.
</P>
<P>
   Remy, who formerly headed the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce and was chief of staff for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
said he had heard complaints about government and CalJobs answers
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business colleagues said, `Why the heck can't government
deliver a product to more people with greater efficiency and why
can't they use technology and why can't government be more
customer-service friendly?' My response is we can, we have and it's
called CalJobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Remy said that savings is built into the system, as it reduces
office visits, and that those savings can now be spent helping
people without computer hardware or skills or on additional
counseling. CalJobs also has the potential to assist people with
the transition from welfare to work, Remy said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans for CalJobs to be presented in Spanish and the
state is working with the National Federation of the Blind to
assist visually-impaired people, Remy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves more people, it serves them better and it does not
cost anything, and we will be able to do it cheaper than we have
been doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Achtenberg, senior vice president of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, said employers support the new state system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ It started out as a straight trade, tools for
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Roop, a man worn thin by manual labor, offered up his
electric saw to the pawn shop clerk at a suburban strip mall along
Route 1 in Fairfax County. Outside in a battered pickup truck his
longtime companion, Cassandra Stewart, waited patiently. She needed
the money he would get for his saw to pay for medicine to ease the
pain of a chronic pancreas condition.
</P>
<P>
   But as Roop counted out the money he got for pawning his saw,
another problem loomed. A few months earlier Stewart had run out of
medicine and Roop had pawned his prized shotgun. If he didn't use
$8 from the money he got for the saw to meet his monthly payment on
the shotgun, he would lose the gun forever.
</P>
<P>
   Roop is puzzled. It's not supposed to be like this. It's
supposed to be like it was for his father, a blue-collar worker who
worked his way up to foreman, bought a house, raised a family and
prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a greedy person,'' Roop said. ``I'm just trying to
make a living. And I'm willing to work from daylight to dark. But I
just can't seem to get a toe hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Roop works full-time as a heavy equipment operator. At 33 he has
worked all of his adult life. He is up every morning at 5 o'clock
bursting to start work. In the afternoons, he is calling the office
every few minutes lining up a job for the next day. Until recently
Stewart worked too at a supermarket. But despite today's Tiffany
economy, men and women like Paul Roop find themselves struggling in
a bargain-basement world.
</P>
<P>
   Roop and Stewart, with whom he has lived since 1994, are part of
what the U.S. Department of Labor classifies as ``the working
poor.'' They are two of the nearly 7.4 million Americans who live
near the official poverty level _ $10,850 a year for couples,
$16,450 for a family of four _ but make too much to qualify for
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, economists say the ranks of men like Roop are
growing. When economists look at the U.S. economy they see a giant
poker game where a few have won most of the chips while everyone
else at the table is scrambling to win a hand just to stay in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter century, the incomes of those making more
than $100,000 have increased 30 percent while those making less
than $25,000 have seen their incomes shrink by 21 percent, when
adjusted for inflation, according to a study by the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite unprecedented economic growth, including the lowest
unemployment and inflation rates in decades, the poverty level of
the United States has remained almost immune to improvement in the
past decade. Today, 36.5 million Americans, 13.7 percent of the
population, live in poverty, even with modest wage gains in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent gain in wages is a welcome reversal of long-term
wage decline, but most working families are still playing
catch-up,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the nonprofit
Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the gap between the haves and have-nots can be
seen all too clearly along this ragged stretch of Route 1 where
Roop is literally going into hock.
</P>
<P>
   Route 1 cuts through the eastern edge of Fairfax County, one of
the richest counties in the United States. Between 1990 and 1996,
Fairfax County residents with annual incomes exceeding $100,000
increased an astounding 11.21percent, from 16.39 percent to 27.60
percent, according to Claritas, an economic research firm. But its
middle and working classes have not reaped the economic benefits
that its wealthier residents have.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Seay, owner of the pawnshop where Roop brings his
possessions, knows this only too well. Seay boasts that business is
so good in Fairfax County he only has to work two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   While statistics are difficult to come by, Dr. Robert Johnson of
the Credit Research Center at Georgetown University estimates that
the number of pawnshops like the one Seay operates have doubled in
the last 10 years. And most of that growth, he says, is in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in pawnshops that cater to people like Roop has been so
phenomenal that five chains are now listed on either the New York
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   And along with pawnshops have come check cashing outlets. Roop,
for example, cannot scrape together enough money to open a checking
account. He cashes his payroll checks at a check-cashing outlet for
a 2 percent fee. He pays his bills with money orders, 25 cents each
at a local convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, he has been operating heavy equipment
at $13.50 an hour, with no benefits. He switched companies last
week in order to get more hours, including overtime, to cover his
meager living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he worked for 13 years at Dyna Electric, getting
$15.50 an hour making traffic lights, a job he had held since
dropping out of high school. But he was laid off last December, two
weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has applied for a $7-an-hour job at a nearby Food Lion
grocery store, but her health and job history _ a series of
part-time and entry-level jobs _ have hindered her prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians argue over why such a vibrant economy
would at the same time increase the ranks of the working poor. They
cite the decline of unions, the erosion of the minimum wage, the
shift from manufacturing to service jobs, the globalization of the
economy through trade and immigration, technology's demand for
skilled workers, tax policies that favor the rich over the poor and
changes in family structures.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the economic and policy chatter in Washington
matters much to Roop. Every cent he and Stewart spend has
consequences. Even a 60-cent candy bar poses a budget dilemma.
That's why pawning his shotgun was such a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The .410 shotgun from Montgomery Ward was not expensive. And it
reaped only a $40 loan from the pawn shop. But to Roop, it was
special, a gift from his parents on his 15th birthday , and he had
used it to bag his first deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But medicine is more important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now with five $10 bills from pawning the saw, should he pay $8
to the pawn broker to hang on to the shotgun another month?
</P>
<P>
   He hands back one of the $10 bills to the pawn clerk. ``I don't
want to lose it,'' he would explain later. ``To me, it's worth a
million dollars.''

 &HT;    Which comes first, consumer blues or sluggish market
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists have a classic chicken-or-egg debate on which comes
first: consumer blues or a sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, number-crunchers have indexed, charted and plotted
consumer confidence as an indicator of whether we're headed for
good times or hell in a hand basket. But the underlying
rule-of-thumb could have as easily come from Dear Abby as an
economist.
</P>

   ``When you get too optimistic, you're vulnerable to
disappointment,'' said senior equity strategist Tim Hayes, who
studies the relationship of consumer confidence and stock market
trends at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. ``We tend to go with
the flow until the market reaches an extreme, then it reverses.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer sentiment is important because consumer spending
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   While it's tough to draw conclusions from history because of
wildly different economic and political factors, one thing's for
sure: ``There is a very high correlation between confidence and the
stock market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic
Forecasting Center of Georgia State University. ``When confidence
is high, as it is now, the decline can be absorbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence has soared in recent times, hitting a
29-year high in June. But financial and political unrest in the
United States and abroad has disenchanted consumers lately, putting
a dent in the confidence for two straight months.
</P>
<P>
   With the speculation that current market turmoil could be the
start of a bear market, monthly consumer confidence results will be
monitored like the daily drama of the Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The main measures of consumer confidence are put out monthly by
the New York-based Conference Board and the University of Michigan.
Launched in 1967, the Conference Board has the longest-running
tally of consumer confidence, measured in an index based on a poll
of 5,000 U.S. households. The survey asks questions about consumer
attitudes and buying plans.
</P>
<P>
   Past bear markets that have stuck around for a while were
ushered in by a lapse in consumer confidence. Confidence hit rock
bottom at the end of 1974. Granted, there wasn't too much to be
upbeat about in the middle of that nasty decline, which kicked off
at the start of 1973 and coincided with other confidence bruisers
such as Watergate, an energy crisis and rampant inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current environment bears no resemblance to the 1970s,''
observes John Williams, managing director of Equity-South Advisors,
an Atlanta-based venture capital firm. ``One of the most important
factors then was that the Soviet Union was in full force, and there
was always potential for nuclear confrontation. That had a huge
impact on psychology of the United States, and the whole investment
front was colored by that.''
</P>
<P>
   If consumer confidence rides the ups and downs of market
conditions, it certainly is strapped to job security, a far greater
driver of sentiment than what's happening on Wall Street, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've weathered social shocks, political shocks and economic
shocks, and consumer confidence generally bounces back within a few
months,'' said Lynn Franco, associate director at the Conference
Board. ``Unless it really hits consumers in term of jobs, stock
market declines won't have a major impact on confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Equity-South's Williams isn't so sure: Dips in the stock
market are more likely to steer consumer confidence today because
of the larger pool of investors, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, markets reacted to changes in consumer confidence
because savings and consumption patterns would drive investors to
the industries where consumers were spending, Williams said. ``With
45 percent of the public allocating money to mutual funds, that
pattern is reversed. What was the cart is now the horse.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The psychology of Baby Boomers
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists are wondering whether the stock market's recent
gyrations will lead to a significant decline in consumer spending.
As a baby boomer, allow me to make this prediction: No.
</P>
<P>
   If our parents were still the dominant force in the economy, I
would be worried about a collapse in consumer spending. Americans
born in the 1920s and 1930s tend to be conservative with their
money because they lived through the depression that followed the
1929 market crash. No matter how wealthy they grew in later years,
they never forgot the taste of those stale bread and ketchup
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   These early experiences shaped their attitudes about using
credit, hopping jobs and spending money. For the most part, they
became the coupon-clipping smart shoppers who paid off their
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   But their children were influenced by very different economic
forces. The 76 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 grew
up in a much more affluent time. Born into families that were
growing richer and better educated, they developed an upbeat
outlook about money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the affluence of the 1960s wasn't the primary influence
on boomers' financial habits. In fact, it was the wild inflation of
the next decade that made them eager to borrow and spend freely.
</P>
<P>
   If you bought your first house in 1978, your parents might have
been worried about the inflated price and outrageous mortgage rate.
Yet, it turned out you were wise to buy because housing prices just
kept going higher. In Atlanta, the people who bought homes in
intown neighborhoods in the 1970s and 1980s made killings on them
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And if you bought Coca-Cola stock in 1981, your parents might
have scolded you for risking money in a dicey market. But if you
ignored their advice and hung on to your stock, you were right
again. Your shares soared in value.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: spending is good. In the long run, asset
appreciation will make your purchases pay off.
</P>
<P>
   To increase their spending ability, boomers learned to embrace
debt and make it work for them. Every time they took out a
home-equity loan to expand their house, they ended up profiting
because of rising real estate values. Whenever they bought stock on
margin, they positioned themselves to reap gains in the great bull
market. When they hopped from one job to the next, they typically
ended up getting raises.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bulk of boomers are in the heavy-spending decade of the
life cycle. Economists say our spending peak is reached at 46, an
age when money is flying out the door for mortgage payments, cars,
teenagers' clothes, tuition, furnishings and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   This is very good news for the world. Why? Because the primary
economic problem today is overcapacity. Too many factories are
making too many cars, clothes, toys and other products. To keep the
global economy from falling into a depression, somebody has to keep
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now that's a job for my generation. Unlike our parents who
might take the recent turbulence in financial markets as a signal
to reduce spending, we are searching for bargains in the stock
market and good deals on bigger cars.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Federal Reserve Board pushes down interest rates,
we'll get home-equity loans to spruce up our houses. When 30-year
mortgage rates slip to 6 percent, we'll call the Realtor and start
shopping for a bigger place. And we'll continue working long hours
so we can keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Our motto has always been, ``When the going gets tough, the
tough go shopping.'' Now the world can count on us to do what we do
best: spend.

ULSTER PEACE MAY BE CLINTON'S GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ History may decide that peace in Northern Ireland was
primarily due to President Clinton and was his finest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it means that a lot of us called it wrong. When Clinton
first made friendly gestures to Sinn Fein, the political branch of
the terrorist Irish Republican Army, critics assumed the president
had embarked on another of his cynical maneuvers designed to
placate Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and the Irish-American
community _ and not much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as political analyst Brian O'Duffy of Belfast
University has said, it proved to be the start of a highly skillful
and subtle policy of bringing Sinn Fein into negotiations without
alienating Northern Ireland's Protestant majority.
</P>
<P>
   There were many dicey moments when the whole intricate structure
threatened to be blown away _ literally, by the bombs of the IRA
and Protestant paramilitary gangs. But last month when a small
breakaway IRA band, calling itself the ``real'' IRA, planted a bomb
that killed 28 people in the town of Omagh, the whole Ulster
population turned on the perpetrators in fury, and they were forced
to claim the attack had been an ``error.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crucial moment of change. It meant that the Catholics
and Protestants alike had come to believe in a realistic prospect
for peace and dearly wanted it. Twenty-four hours before Clinton
arrived in Northern Ireland this week, Sinn Fein appointed one of
its top leaders to sit on the so-called decommissioning committee,
which was set up under the peace settlement to supervise the
disarming of paramilitaries including the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Sinn Fein had steadfastly rejected disarming until
British troops were withdrawn from Ulster. After Omagh, it could no
longer resist public pressure in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton wasn't alone in bringing about the historic
movement toward peace in a land where violence has been endemic for
centuries and even in its latest phase has gone on for nearly 30
years, causing more than 3,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rapturous welcome that the crowds gave him demonstrated
their belief that his role in cajoling and twisting arms was vital
and decisive, as was that of his representative on the spot, former
Democratic Sen. George Mitchell of Maine. U.S. influence is
probably greater in Ireland, north and south, than anywhere on
earth and the two Americans used it for all it was worth. Clinton's
exceptional rapport with British Prime Minister Tony Blair also
played a big part.
</P>
<P>
   Without Clinton, the efforts to get a peace settlement would, at
best, have been one of those near-misses Ireland has experienced in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was all a happy accident. Maybe the president was a
cynic at the start who didn't really think his initiative would get
off the ground. But what counts are the results. So let the rest of
us admit once and for all that we were wrong and that Clinton got
it right.

FAMILY STAYS ON COURSE DESPITE CANCER, STORMS ON BAJA VOYAGE  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS WERE SENT THURSDAY TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Not a day went by that Monte Berget, beaten down by
radiation treatment and lying exhausted in the gray recliner,
didn't think of the catamaran docked in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Odysseus.
</P>
<P>
   His family had bought the white sailboat the summer of 1996 and
set a date of Aug. 5, 1997, to move from their Chandler, Ariz.,
home to San Diego. There, they would live on the boat and prepare
for the 2,500-mile journey _ south from San Diego around Baja
California to La Paz, Mexico, across the Sea of Cortes to Mazatlan
and back, ending in San Carlos, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just before Christmas, less than a year before they were
supposed to leave, came the news.
</P>
<P>
   Berget was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of
throat cancer, and the weeks in the gray recliner began.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mouth was all scarred and burned up,'' Berget said. ``I had
a hole burned through my shoulder. They come as close to killing
you as they can without killing you because that's what kills the
cancer. It's dark and you hurt and you're discouraged and
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Maureen, wavered briefly, she said. She feared her
husband would not survive. She didn't know if he would be strong
enough for the trip. At the very least, she decided, the family
could live on the boat and take short trips out of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   For Monte, he never thought about if he would go. He only
thought of when.
</P>
<P>
   Two things kept him going: his faith and looking ahead to the
boat trip. ``I said God didn't do this without a reason, and if you
don't believe that you'd be very bitter because I never smoked,''
he said. The boat trip was something he'd been aiming at for years,
a voyage that promised to be equal parts adventure and family
bonding.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-foot boat had replaced a small sailboat, sold a few years
earlier for the start-up capital for their business. Monte had
dreamed of another boat and sailing around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other family members weren't so enthusiastic. So they
compromised. They'd take a shorter trip _ the 1997-98 school year _
and stay closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Monte came through the difficult surgery and radiation
treatment, and on the date they had planned to leave all along,
they headed to San Diego. They had three months to get the boat
ready.
</P>
<P>
   There was interior remodeling _ one cabin was being converted
into a bathroom for the girls and new windows and hatches were
needed, among other things. And they needed supplies _ 72 rolls of
paper towels, 700 cans of food, spare parts, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Dana, who turned 16 on the trip, and Lexi, who was 11, were
being home-schooled for the first time and missed their friends.
And they went from living in a large home to living in about 500
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The first three months weren't easy, Maureen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a standing joke that their mom was the toughest teacher
that they would ever imagine having,'' Monte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no joke,'' Dana added.
</P>
<P>
   The day the catamaran left San Diego was one of the best days of
Monte's life.
</P>
<P>
   And once the adventure moved into Mexico and the girls met other
``boat kids'' their own age, attitudes improved. Mazatlan was the
best, the girls said.
</P>
<P>
   Dana met up with her church youth group there, where they helped
with a vacation Bible school, painted churches and built benches,
and she showed them around Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything in Mazatlan. They had a Dairy Queen,
Domino's, Baskin-Robbins, a mall,'' Dana said.
</P>
<P>
   The family made lots of friends, from the families who lived on
boats to the villagers who traded their fresh tortillas for school
supplies from the Bergets.
</P>
<P>
   Days were filled with studying, exploring islands, swimming,
fishing, stargazing and hanging out with friends. Life on the boat
was a slow-paced change from life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions to the slow pace were two crossings made
during severe storms.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from La Paz to Mazatlan would mark the family's first
crossing. At about 250 miles, the trip would take about 48 hours.
They waited for a good weather window of 72 to 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said (their crossing) was boring,'' said Lexi,
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergets' trip was another story. The ``light and variable''
forecast, for both crossings, turned into heavy winds and heavier
seas. The family experienced winds of 35-45 mph with gusts up to 57
mph. Waves crested at 12 to 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing turned them into a team, and though they were
scared, they all took care of the boat and each other. The girls
had to help stand watch through the night. They worried as they
shone flashlights on their dad who was hanging off the back of the
lurching boat to secure broken equipment. On the return trip,
Maureen made the girls wear their life jackets to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us had been in seas like that. They never balked at
it,'' Maureen said. ``It's the middle of the night. It's not
convenient and we say, `Would you please come out and get wet and
cold for three hours?' We just all said a prayer when we anchored
and we were all together. We were all completely soaked and yucky
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were alive and the boat was floating,'' Monte added.
</P>
<P>
   Lexi and Dana downplayed their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like something that comes along with it, the
responsibility of knowing you are going to have to do something
like that,'' Lexi said.
</P>
<P>
   The family took a few trips back to Arizona for follow-up
doctor's appointments and to check in on the business. They ate
turkey for Thanksgiving on the boat and decorated it for Christmas,
although they spent the actual Christmas holidays in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They returned permanently in June. The Bergets plan to make
another trip, probably sometime after Dana finishes high school,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls are back in public schools. They enjoy showing the
trip pictures to their old friends and keep in touch through e-mail
with their new friends around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For Maureen, slowing down drew her closer to her daughters, she
said. It's a good reason to say no more often now, spend time with
her family and admire the sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played games. We don't do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte was grateful for the time. His cancer is in remission, but
he knows that his cancer has a higher-than-average rate of
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're glad to be there and you're really glad to share that
with your family and you appreciate it more,'' he said. ``Some day,
we will be sitting down for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, and
it might be five years or 15 years from now, and they'll say, `That
was a really cool trip.' It was a great year.'' &QL;

DELAYS TAKING TOLL ON AMERICA WEST  
 (EDITORS: STORY CAN BE UPDATED WITH FRIDAY STOCK ACTIVITY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Flight delays and cancellations, which America West
Airlines blames on labor struggles with mechanics, is taking its
toll on the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wall Street walloped the airline's stock Thursday
after the company announced it expected a shortfall in
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   America West shares fell 5|, or 28 percent, to 14[ in extremely
heavy trading. Nearly 2.6 million shares changed hands, about seven
times its daily average. The stock, which was as high as 30 in July
but has gradually fallen during the market swoon, is now near its
52-week low of 123/16.
</P>
<P>
   William Franke, America West Holdings Corp. chairman, said in a
statement that he did not expect the company to reach the 61 cents
per share earnings that analysts had predicted for the third
quarter because of poor July and August performances by the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   American West's results could equal 40 cents per share, Franke
added, which would match earnings a year ago. Third-quarter results
will be announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Goodmanson, America West president and chief executive
officer, cited the labor troubles in explaining unsatisfactory
on-time performance for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   America West's on-time arrival rate was 64.9 percent in July,
which was last among the top 10 airlines. The leader, Southwest
Airlines, had an 83.9 percent on-time arrival rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protracted and difficult negotiations the airline has had
with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents
some 450 line mechanics, are negatively impacting the airline's
operating and financial results,'' Goodmanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters spokesman Patrick Lacefield said there is no organized
slowdown by America West mechanics, but mechanics are just doing
their jobs to ensure that aircraft are safe before being put back
into service.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the airline's operations, Lacefield said, are
tied to its decision to outsource some maintenance to contractors
whose work often has to be corrected by America West mechanics,
leading to delays.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing was done to cut costs and it's not clear that it has
done that, Lacefield said. What it has done is raise questions
about whether the carrier is placing the movement of airplanes
above safety, he said, a charge the airline has denied in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The airline paid the largest fine in U.S. airline history, $2.5
million, in July after the Federal Aviation Administration
discovered safety violations. The FAA is continuing to monitor
America West.
</P>
<P>
   Lacefield said Thursday's announcement is a vindication for the
America West mechanics, but they don't want it stop there. They
want the company to bring the maintenance work back in-house, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said flight delays and
cancellations are hurting earnings because America West must shift
passengers onto other airlines and often has to provide meal
expenses and hotel stays.
</P>
<P>
   To address the operational problems, America West has added 100
mechanics and plans to hire 20 more. It also has increased its
overnight repair stations to 13 from four, boosted its spare parts
inventory and added two spare aircraft, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not comment on whether the mechanics were engaging in
a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between America West and the Teamsters are to begin
again next week, Lacefield said, and outsourcing is the key issue
for the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, a Paine Webber analyst, said there is no question
in his mind that flight cancellations are maintenance related, but
it's unclear the exact source of the maintenance delays. Some may
be the result of mechanics working strictly by the book and some
may be due to a lack of parts or increased FAA scrutiny, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed that senior management didn't recognize
the extent of the problems earlier,'' Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the earning shortfall, analyst James Higgins of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette pointed to the labor troubles and the
FAA oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is operational, related to slowdowns by
maintenance workers who are in contentious contract negotiations
with the company, plus a far more smothering presence of the
Federal Aviation Administration on the `property' than we had
understood,'' Higgins' report said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts are maintaining their buy rating for America
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lowered estimates to reflect what we know at this
point about the outlook, but confess little confidence over the
next couple of quarters,'' Higgins said in his report. ``Beyond
that, we feel more comfortable that, if the domestic economy
continues to grow modestly, this company will reassert what we
believe had been an improving earnings trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins noted that the current scenario is reminiscent of an
operations-related shortfall in 1996. &QL;

has been a controversial player in the international efforts to
transform Russia from a lumbering centrally planned economy to an
agile western-style market economy. But despite $25.5 billion in
IMF loan commitments and billions more made by the World Bank and
the government of Japan, Russia's economy remains deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow isn't the only borrower at the IMF loan window these
days. Since the Asian economic crisis began last summer, the
organization has made $36.1 billion in loan commitments to South
Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Though it plays a crucial role in nursing global economic
health, D.C., the IMF is shrouded in secrecy that the organization
assiduously maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some questions and answers about the IMF:
</P>
<P>
   Q) What is the International Monetary Fund?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF opened for business in 1945 after 29 countries signed
a treaty to promote monetary cooperation among nations as a way of
encouraging world trade. The idea was that trade would increase if
it were easier to convert one nation's currency into another.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was a direct response to the Great Depression of the
1930s when the world economy plummeted in part because nations
placed severe restrictions on the exchange of domestic and foreign
currencies. This made trade practically impossible. In fact,
trading became so cumbersome that some governments resorted to the
barter system, exchanging one cargo for another.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What does the IMF do?
</P>
<P>
   A) One of the IMF's main missions is helping member nations
suffering from payment imbalances, as Russia is now. This problem
crops up when a nation doesn't take in sufficient foreign currency
from exports, tourism and financial services to pay for what it
imports.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, the country has to borrow money from banks to
make up the difference. If a country borrows too much and fails to
correct the causes of the imbalance, currency speculators such as
banks and international corporations may lose confidence in the
government's ability to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Speculators may sell the nation's currency in an
effort to exchange it for more stable currencies, causing its value
to plunge. In Russia, the ruble declined in value from 16 cents in
June to around 5 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the IMF loaned Russia $4.8 billion to restore investor
confidence by bolstering foreign currency reserves and closing a
budget deficit. However, President Boris Yeltsin's administration
apparently used most of the sum to prop up the ruble. This effort
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone and wasted that money to buy up rubles of banks
that wanted to get rid of them, and the money has ended up out of
the country,'' said Charles Gaddy, a Russian economics expert at
the independent Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokesman Vasuki Shastry says: ``Dollar for dollar, there's
no way we can account for what happens to the money when we give it
out to a member country. The money is fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q) Where does the IMF get its money?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF has 182 member nations, each of which contributes
funds that are loaned to nations in need. The amount of a nation's
contribution depends on the strength of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the United States, with the world's richest economy, has
contributed the most to the IMF, about $36 billion, or 18.14
percent of the total in the IMF bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Islands in the Pacific make the smallest
contribution, $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also asks member nations to make new contributions when
its reserves are low. For example, last December the IMF requested
new contributions because of its loans to slumping Asian nations
and Russia. The U.S. share came to $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, other top donors to the IMF are
Germany, Japan, France and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Do IMF members have equal status?
</P>
<P>
   A) No. Member nations have voting power in direct relationship
to the size of their financial contributions. Because it is the
biggest donor, the United States has the most votes and the biggest
clout within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Who runs the IMF?
</P>
<P>
   A) The head of the IMF is Michel Camdessus, a French economist
and banker, who has held the post of managing director since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-member executive board appoints the managing director and
advises on which loans to make. The IMF, based four blocks from the
White House in Washington, has a staff of 2,600 from 110 countries
with offices in Paris, Geneva, Tokyo and the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What are typical terms of an IMF loan?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF imposes strict rules on borrowers: They must agree to
repay the money within a specified time and they must agree to
reform those economic policies that created the problem in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The loans typically are disbursed in installments tied to
progress in making the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms can cause political instability. In Indonesia,
rioting broke out shortly after that nation adopted strict IMF
austerity measures last year. The unrest eventually toppled the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Russia, the Yeltsin administration agreed to cut
government spending, an action that exacerbated the financial woes
of the average Russian because many government workers and
pensioners are not being paid.
</P>
<P>
   To ease financial hardships on the average Russian, the
legislature has suggested softening the austerity measures. Western
governments, meanwhile, are pushing for greater belt-tightening
with a formula of high interest rates, reduced government spending
and more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What sparked Russia's recent economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A) A political dispute over economic reforms between
reform-minded Yeltsin and reform-cautious legislators, coupled with
Russia's partial default on domestic debt, exploded last month in a
sweeping loss of investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the collapse of Russian financial markets, a
steep devaluation of the ruble and a spike in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Q) How is the IMF responding to Russia's problems?
</P>
<P>
   A) In 1995 and 1996, the IMF approved about $14.3 billion in
loans to Russia. The money was supposed to bolster Russia's foreign
reserves, help it ride out a balance of payments problems and
attract foreign investment by building investor confidence,
according to Shastry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian economy is faltering and the IMF has become
Russia's lifeline. It is ``virtually the only source of major
external funding in sight,'' said Keith Bush, a Russian economics
expert at the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The organization approved $11.2 billion in new loans in July,
$4.8 billion of which the Russian government already exhausted in a
failed effort to support the plummeting ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russians want to use the next installment of IMF funds, $4.3
billion, to pay workers and pensioners and to pay down the
country's debt. The IMF hasn't yet agreed to release the sum,
pending a review of the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also has provided Russia with expertise for establishing
institutions and services essential for market-based economies such
as central banks, currency convertibility and tax collection
systems.

TALK OF THE TOWN: PRAIRIE DOGS HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - It is a sight that has delighted millions:
prairie dogs perched on their hind legs, their forepaws hanging
limp against their coarse fur, peering off into the distance, then
letting out a sharp bark and disappearing into their burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Another adorable sight to most humans, another bark in the
inscrutable background noise of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Con Slobodchikoff, a biology professor at Northern Arizona
University, hears much more.
</P>
<P>
   After listening for 12 years, and recording these sounds for
constant replaying, Slobodchikoff thinks he has deciphered a
language in this chaotic chatter.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks these prairie dogs are ``talking'' with a lexicon that
has the equivalent of nouns, verbs and adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have different wordlike sounds for every species of
predator,'' Slobodchikoff said. ``In the lab, we have identified
the `word' for ferret, and also for great horned owl. We had
figured out the call for red-tailed hawk, human, coyote and
domestic dog. This summer, it looks like we will identify `words'
for a cat, a deer and an elk.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitch, volume, and frequency are plotted on sonograms. For
example, a hawk is a single note, a yip, at a high frequency.
Different predators also result in different behavior by the
prairie dogs. Coyotes and domestic dogs result in multiple calls
from several prairie dogs. With humans, usually only one prairie
dog at a time will call.
</P>
<P>
   To test his theories, Slobodchikoff has humans walk through the
prairie dog town wearing different colors of clothing, acting
threatening or peaceably, running or walking. Stationed in an
above-ground blind in the middle of the community, the researchers
have been lucky enough to record the sounds when a predator passed
by. Otherwise, they have fashioned cardboard cutouts of predators
and rolled them around.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow researcher, Kathy Frederickson, a doctoral candidate at
the University of Nebraska at Omaha, had a friend go out one day
and fire a shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ever came out again and he was wearing the same
clothing, they would give out two or three calls, and they were
gone, and they would stay underground for hours,'' she said. ``They
remembered this guy months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Vervet monkeys of East Africa were the first species documented
to have distinct aural descriptions of predators. They are known to
make different sounds depending on whether the predator is an eagle
or other bird, a leopard or a snake.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been left to scratch their heads over other
animal sounds. The well-known mournful baritone of whales, for
example, could mean anything from ``I miss my Mommy'' to ``Good
krill ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made the prairie dog experiment unique is that
Slobodchikoff has been able to identify that the animals are
``speaking'' about predators and nothing else. Prairie dogs also
partake in ``social chatter,'' but that is not part of the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out in the field, we can associate the calls with whatever
predators are out there, so that is like a Rosetta stone for us,''
Slobodchikoff said.
</P>
<P>
   That it is the prairie dog that is the center of this research
seems like some kind of cosmic justice.
</P>
<P>
   The prairie dog is arguably the most hated animal in North
America. It has been shot, drowned, and poisoned nearly into
oblivion, losing 98 percent of its former range.
</P>
<P>
   To many ranchers, prairie dogs are varmints with no reason to
live. They tear up the grasslands and cattle are known to break
their legs when they step into prairie dog burrows.
</P>
<P>
   After numbering 5 billion in North America, two of the five
species, the Mexican and Utah, are listed as either endangered or
threatened. Another species, the black-tailed, has been proposed
for listing.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodchikoff, who works with another species, Gunnison's
prairie dog, hopes that his research will help the prairie dog, and
other animals, get more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really pushing the envelope of what we thought animals
could do,'' he said. ``If these animals have this ability to
communicate, other animals probably have it, too. If that is true,
it raises an ethical issue about how animals are treated. It might
force us to reassess the way we treat animals, like they are little
robots that you can get rid of like a pile of leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Pennsylvania Center
for Bioethics, said, ``The Catch-22 of animal research is the more
research we do about animals, the more we find that they are
similar rather than unlike us. The more the gap closes, as science
shows that there isn't much of a gap, the harder it gets for us to
feel as though we can treat nature as our dominion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now that pigs are smarter than we thought. It's made
some people vegetarians, but not a lot. I still eat meat. I don't
consider them (cows and pigs) my moral equivalent. I don't think if
it was between a prairie dog and a human being that I would flip a
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Slobodchikoff has heard a lot of criticism, but says, ``I just
say to people I am not denying that we are special. Look at what
we've done with our world.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is not arguing that a school of fish could
build the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   There are other larger issues to tackle, such as the possibility
of becoming the real Dr. Dolittle.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodchikoff has begun working with John Placer, an NAU
computer-science professor in an attempt to assign probabilities
for what sounds might mean and then establish patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible domestic animals have some kind of
communication with one another,'' Slobodchikoff said. ``Down the
line, we might be able to decode that language, and maybe through
computers, actually allow people to have a conversation with their
pets.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a long way from the fidgety rodent squeezed into the
corner of a burlap bag being held tightly by Sarah Long, who
recently received a master's degree in biology from NAU.
</P>
<P>
   The prairie dog was about to get a number and letter painted
onto its sides with indelible dye, and was barking a flurry of
high-pitched yelps.
</P>
<P>
   What's he saying? she's asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Long answered. ``Probably something
unprintable.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA NEVER STOLEN FROM MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL WARDER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This Labor Day weekend in Sacramento, California
begins to celebrate the Gold Rush and the drive to statehood. It
will be a two-year observance, leading up to the Sesquicentennial
in 2000. The weekend events also will usher in a statewide debate
on the history of the Golden State. Some Chicano activists will
allege that the United States ``stole'' the Southwest, including
California, from Mexico. A reasonable look at the history gives lie
to these assertions.
</P>
<P>
   California statehood really began with the 1848 Treaty of
Guadalupe-Hidalgo signed by the United States and Mexico. By this
act, America increased its territory by two-thirds, including
California and the land of six other Southwestern states, while
Mexico was cut in half. In the history of our two countries, this
surprisingly little-known treaty is a staggering event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge amount of territory involved in the treaty,
only about 80,000 Mexicans lived in the whole Southwest.
Furthermore, Mexico exercised little control over the territory. It
was a country in turmoil. From 1821, the end of Spanish rule,
through 1847, Mexico endured 50 military regimes, five
constitutional conventions, three constitutions and most of the 11
different terms of leadership under the tragic president and
general, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the political instability, the racial and ethnic
cleavages in the Mexico of this era are important to understand.
When Santa Anna ended his last term in 1854, it marked the end of
the rule of the conquistadors' descendants, those of Spanish
descent born in what was then called New Spain. Called
``criollos,'' this group ruled Mexico after the overthrow of Spain
in 1821. Prior to that, from 1521, Spaniards ruled directly under
the authority of the crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish language and Catholic faith, perpetuated by the
Spaniards and criollos, prevailed by conquest over the various
Indian dialects and religions. The revolution in Mexico that began
in 1810 was against Spain. It was led by the criollos with strong
support from the Indians and the growing numbers of ``mestizos,''
those Mexicans of mixed Spanish and Indian ancestry. Their battle
cry was ``Death to the Spaniards! Long live the Virgin of
Guadalupe!''
</P>
<P>
   It was not ``Yankee go home!'' nor an Aztec war cry.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause for the Mexican-American War was a $3
million debt to America for damages done by Mexicans to Americans.
The government of Mexico had agreed to pay, but was repeatedly in
default. But perhaps the real motivator was America's desire for
California. The Mexican government spurned a cash offer of $25
million. President James K. Polk and others believed that if the
United States did not acquire California, Great Britain or others
might, since Mexico was unable to govern it.

   Mexico drew first blood in an attack on American troops in
disputed territory in Texas and the war was on. Less than two years
later, American troops entered Mexico City and the treaty was
signed. Despite winning the war, America paid $18 million for the
territory. The United States also lost 13,000 lives, largely due to
disease. And the rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Our constitutional democracy, the rule of law, private property
rights, freedom of religion, and the other characteristics of
American government have been enormously appealing to our neighbors
to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 150 years, the moral and legal authority of the
United States to govern the acquired territory is, by any
reasonable measure, unassailable. The treaty was, on balance, a
good one for all concerned. Californians should be proud of their
history and the creation of a place that so many have found so
attractive.

THE GREAT ALL-AMERICAN SHADOW HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the bulging Mark McGwire is Casey at the Bat, Sammy Sosa
is Chico Escuela. Escuela, the fictitious baseball player created
on Saturday Night Live by Garrett Morris, was famous in mock
interviews for saying, ``Beisbol been berry, berry good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   All season Sosa has played a powerful yet deftly deferential
tenor to Mark McGwire's bass. McGwire is on the verge of breaking
Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs. Sosa, just behind McGwire, is
also on pace to surpass the hallowed, 37-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Sosa who was once a shoeshine boy in the Dominican
Republic, has expanded his thanks from his sport to America itself.
When asked in general about Maris's record, Sosa has said: ``I
didn't have it in my mind to break the record. But if it happens,
God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the possibility of getting the record first, he
said, ``If I get it first, God bless America. It's a beautiful
country.'' When asked if McGwire reached the record first, Sosa
said, ``I still love America.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about being swamped with media requests, Sosa said:
``I'm just having fun. I'm ready to take care of people. That's why
I love America. It's a beautiful country.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, the 29-year-old Sosa has said he wants the
34-year-old McGwire break the record first. ``Mark McGwire is the
man,'' he has said what seems to be a thousand times. ``I'm just
another kid.''
</P>
<P>
   This humility may mask a mind worthy of a doctorate in American
sociology. The last time a dark-skinned man threatened to replace a
white icon in the home run books was when Hank Aaron supplanted
Babe Ruth as the all-time home run king.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, as Aaron closed in on Ruth's 714 home runs, he received
enough hate mail and death threats to require federal protection
for his daughter and make him a prisoner in his hotel room on road
trips. Aaron should have been the stuff of American rags-to-glory;
he came from a family where his mother could not afford a baseball
bat.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron's intelligence and serious critiques of racism in
baseball made him a target rather than an icon. Aaron broke Ruth's
record in 1974 and finished his career with 755 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sad time,'' Aaron has said. ``I don't think
about it much because of all the things I had to go through. My
kids had to suffer.... That period left some very bad and deep
scars on me.... It was pure racism.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, another black man is challenging the
white icons. The way Sosa is dealing with it, it is as if he knows,
instinctively or otherwise, that America remains a delicate place
for a dark athlete, a place where the grinning of Willie Mays and
Magic Johnson, the neutered politics of a Michael Jordan, even the
tattoos of Dennis Rodman are preferred to the insights and candor
of an Aaron or a Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if he knows it is critical to issue consistent
concession speeches to an America that needs to view white athletes
as men and black athletes as kids. A good example: The majority of
professional basketball and football players are African-American,
yet the players who are seen as mature enough to be groomed for
coaching and management are overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Surely America has matured enough not to visit a black athlete
with the hell it rained down on Aaron. Aaron, now in his mid 60s
and an executive in Atlanta, said three years ago, ``This is a new
generation of people, and I think I've been appreciated more by
this generation than I was by the generation before.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks will reveal how much a new generation
appreciates dark athletes as well as how it receives the increasing
numbers of foreign-born athletes who excel on US soil. At this
moment, old distinctions punctuate the air.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was flatly proclaimed an ``American hero,'' by columnist
Randy Harvey of the Los Angeles Times. He was called an
``all-American hero'' by anchor Jane Robelot of ``CBS This
Morning.'' The Denver Post called McGwire ``the great American
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, despite his bowed posture at the Statue of Liberty, has
not been so received. A computer search of major national
newspapers found no stories in which he was been called an
``American'' hero even though he is ahead of Maris's pace. The
closest he has come to icon status in newspapers is an open
question from Jon Heyman of Newsday. In a column that quoted
several people who wondered why Sosa's story is not yet seen in
colors of red, white, and blue, Heyman asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``If this guy isn't a true American hero, then who is?''
</P>
<P>
   Until America answers the question, Sosa must play the game by
the current rules. Mark is the man. Sosa is the kid. Sosa has
recognized that America has not yet grown up. For all the times
Sosa has said ``God bless America,'' he understands that the best
chance for a black athlete to be blessed by America is to find a
way to accept being called ``boy.''

PATAKI MAY HAVE NO RIVAL LIKE A DEPUTY SPURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betsy McCaughey Ross _ who holds an unusual dual role
as both the Republican lieutenant governor and the front-running
Democratic candidate for governor _ has been having a bad summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, her boss, the current governor, George W. Pataki,
cut off her Associated Press news-wire service. This, after taking
away most of her other state perks.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, her deputy campaign manager quit _ the fourth
senior campaign staffer to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, while unveiling her six-point health-reform
proposal at a Manhattan senior citizens' center _ billed in advance
as a major policy address _ the center's director walked in,
exclaimed, ``Nobody told me there would be all these cameras,'' and
kicked them out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Thursday, she announced she would have little money for
TV ads in these last two weeks before the primary, because her
husband _ multimillionaire Wilbur Ross, who has almost
singlehandedly financed her campaign _ is tightening his purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey (pronounced McCoy) Ross _ 49, a Ph.D., and a former
fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute think-tank _ has
been derided by pols and the local press for running a sloppy
organization, for switching parties, even for being an attractive
blonde. (A Village Voice headline last month called her the ``wonk
with a wiggle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she is widely seen as having the best chance of
winning the four-way Democratic primary Sept. 15, and thus going
toe-to-toe with Pataki, the man who fathered her political career.
All told, it is shaping up to be the strangest New York governor's
race in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki tapped her as his running mate in 1994, mainly because he
needed a woman to lure female voters _ and because she had recently
written a much-lauded critique of President Clinton's health-reform
plan in The New Republic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted, in an interview late last month, that she probably
would not have entered politics had Pataki not approached her. ``I
was writing a book about constitutional law _ that's my field _ and
I was very happy doing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once tapped, she made the mistake of taking her post seriously.
She recalls the night Pataki's aides asked her to be his running
mate. At the end of the chat, she said, ``I'm going to take my
laptop home and write my acceptance speech.'' One of the aides
said, ``We'll write the speech.'' She said, ``No, I'll write it.''
She finally prevailed, but, looking back, she said, ``That was the
time for them to decide they didn't want an independent-minded
person.''
</P>
<P>
   In office, she kept writing policy memos to Pataki, and grew
more frustrated when he kept ignoring them. The bigger the fuss she
kicked up, the more Pataki's aides leaked word to the press that
she was ``unstable,'' a ``ditz.'' It did not help when her own
staffers deserted her in droves, saying she was ``impossible to
work for,'' calling them at all hours, ``screaming and screeching''
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, she quit the Republican Party, joined the
Democrats, and announced her candidacy as governor.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross said the idea came to her six months earlier,
when she brought a bill to the state senate, requiring HMOs to pay
for any care a doctor says is needed. ``Every single Republican
voted against it, every Democrat voted for it,'' she recalled.
``When I walked out of the chamber, I knew I was going to change
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   She has since lambasted Pataki in ever-more-caustic terms and
labeled herself a ``progressive liberal,'' which some of her former
think-tank colleagues find at odds with her previous stances,
though she insists she hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York needs a serious problem-solver, an expert,'' she says
in her stump speeches. ``I'm not a career politician. I'm a mother,
a health-care expert, an educator.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant (who is working for no
candidates in this race), thinks she has the correct line. ``She
has the advantage in a Democratic primary being the only woman in
the race, but she also needs to focus on gender issues that make
women come out and vote for her,'' he said. HMOs and education are
such issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``she has to get this word out in the media''
_ which she has not yet done and, it seems from Thursday's
announcement, may not do.
</P>
<P>
   The point may be moot. Pollster John Zobgy has Pataki winning
about two-thirds of the vote in November's general election, no
matter which Democrat runs against him.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's poll shows McCaughey Ross leading her opponents in the
primary with 24 percent of the vote, against 14 percent for the
runner-up, Peter Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, and
single digits for the other two candidates, Brooklyn district
attorney Charles Hynes and former state transportation commissioner
James Larocca.
</P>
<P>
   But half the Democrats polled are undecided. ``There's
terrifically low interest in this election,'' Zogby said. Without a
decisive media campaign, any fires lit between now and Sept. 15
won't be ignited by McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $2.6 million she has raised in this campaign, over $2
million comes from her husband, the senior managing director of the
Rothschild finance firm. Village Voice columnist Wayne Barrett
reports nearly all the rest has come from Ross's business
associates. None of this money can be spent without the personal
approval of Ross _ ``suggesting,'' Barrett chides, ``just how
foolish Wilbur thinks voters would be to trust Betsy with the $71.5
billion-a-year checkbook controlled by a governor.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross chafes at this suggestion. ``I studied accounting
at Columbia, I was a bank officer at Chase Manhattan at age 24, I
know finance in and out,'' she said tersely in an interview after a
recent candidates' debate. ``Put me in a room with these three guys
to talk about finance,'' referring to her primary opponents, ``and
I'll rub them in the dirt... I am not a hack. I'm a serious
scholar. I won the National Magazine Award, I got a post-doc from
the (National Endowment for the Humanities). I take ideas
seriously. I do my homework.''
</P>
<P>
   That, to some of her newly fellow Democrats, may be part of the
problem _ she's too much the academic, not enough the politician.
She practically says so herself. Asked why she hasn't raised much
money outside her husband's pockets, she shrugged and laughed,
``I'm a policy wonk.''

TOWN MANAGER THRIVES ON DOUBLE DUTY IN MAINE COMMUNITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; VINALHAVEN, Maine _ On her first visit to her new lighthouse
home after being named Vinalhaven's town manager, Susan Lessard
brought her mother and grandmother to see the place.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilly November day in 1993, and nothing seemed to work
properly _ not the heat, not the odd cistern-well water system, not
even the telephone. On remote Brown's Head _ a rocky promontory on
a largely uninhabited stretch of Vinalhaven island _ the three
women seemed a long way from help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you, I'd call your former boss in Fayette and ask
for your old job back,'' her mother advised.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard said she intended to stay in Vinalhaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' her mother said, ``the first thing you need to
do is find a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Lessard _ divorced since 1987 and still
single, by choice _ is thriving here.
</P>
<P>
   She claims to be the only town manager in the country whose job
requires that she live in a lighthouse. She's an islandkeeper _
tending not only the light but to the needs of Vinalhaven's 1,300
year-round residents.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, male or female, would find the job forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   The wind howls over Penobscot Bay so ferociously that her home _
a three-bedroom Cape attached to the lighthouse _ has to be bolted
to the rocks beneath to keep it from blowing away. Getting to the
town office in winter often means spending an hour chiseling ice
off the 32 treacherous steps on the steep incline from her driveway
to the house.
</P>
<P>
   And managing the needs of this fishbowl of a community _ a small
island town 15 miles from the mainland _ is all-the-more daunting
because, as Lessard observes, when the last ferry for the mainland
leaves at 4:30 p.m. in summer (3:15 in winter), ``no one can go
anywhere else to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   With her 6-foot frame and huge shock of long, curly red hair,
Lessard isn't intimidated by much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in not having `can't' in your vocabulary,'' said
Lessard, who came to Vinalhaven from a town manager job in Fayette,
Maine, near Augusta. ``I never found anything I couldn't do or
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that serves her well in this hard-working
community, where lobster boats, bait shacks, and fuel docks line
the harbor. More than 75 percent of the population is
self-employed, mainly in the lobster industry, and locals pride
themselves on finding unpretentious ways to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lessard, many folks work two or more jobs. The gourmet chef
and owner of the only year-round restaurant serves as safety
officer in the fire department. A local producer of Broadway plays
works at a fish-processing plant. Many lobstermen also care for
somebody's landholdings. And employees of the local grocery store
double as quasi-bank tellers, cashing islanders' checks after
banking hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Lessard's case, her two-fer job _ tending the lighthouse and
managing the town _ was Vinalhaven's innovative answer to the
problem of how to keep down the manager's salary and also make sure
that the Brown's Head Lighthouse, automated by the Coast Guard in
1987, would be well-maintained and accessible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard still is responsible for operation of the light
and the tower. But Lessard lives in the lighthouse year-round,
maintaining the building and grounds, which includes 6 acres of
mossy forest, a rocky beach, and a picnic area. Her job includes
mowing the grass, whacking weeds, landscaping, and picking up
debris that washes onto the beach.
</P>
<P>
   In other communities, town managers might shun this sort of
manual labor. But it is vintage Lessard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's hands-on,'' says Bodine Ames, town janitor, who also is
a case worker for the local social service agency. ``When the
surplus food truck arrives, she's the first one there to help
unload it. And the road crew loves her; when she wants to talk
about their problems, she takes them homemade muffins.''
</P>
<P>
   The let's-all-pitch-in approach seems tailormade for Vinalhaven.
Locals joke that the island is ``15 miles and 40 years'' from the
mainland. Not that they're uninterested in the Internet, which is a
popular diversion, but islanders say they identify more with the
values and simplicity of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Vinalhaven's appeal, Edward ``Pumpkin'' York, who
manages bait for the Vinalhaven Lobster Co., puts it this way: ``On
the mainland, there's just too much going on. Here, it's peaceful.
Quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The town has no mall, no theater, no laundromat, no gas station.
What it has are a handful of stores, a lot of friendly people who
always wave at each other, and 65 square miles of scenic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   As several locals observe, life in Vinalhaven revolves around
``the boat,'' as the ferry service is known _ actually two, 17-car
ferries that make six round-trip excursions daily from Rockland,
Maine. Much of Lessard's time is spent helping people figure out
how to get what they need to the island.
</P>
<P>
   One recent controversy involved the town dump, a landfill that
was overrun with rats and needed capping. But traditional capping
would have meant barging clay and loam through waters filled with
lobster pots and unloading them on cramped downtown docks, which
would have wrought havoc on the lobster industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard's answer was to cap the dump with local granite, at the
same time that she began a vigorous recycling program, including a
lively swap shop at the dumpsite. Locals were asked to pay $1 for
every bag of refuse that had to be trucked off the island by ferry.
</P>
<P>
   This meant some ferry passengers had to travel with the refuse
trucks. But now the town has gone from 9.5 percent refuse recycled
to 60 percent, and the dump, covered with local blue-gray granite,
is a showplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my `Mission Impossible,''' Lessard says proudly. ``Now
people say it looks like an Earthworks.''

 &HT;    Smaller investors in the market for the long haul
 &HT;    By Shelia Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irving Fordham is still planning a big Christmas for his family
.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the 40-year-old father of two has nearly $60,000
invested in the stock market, which last week had the
second-biggest plunge in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: Fordham is letting it ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know investing in financial securities is the best thing for
my family in the long term and my retirement, so these small
fluctuations don't impact my spending habits,'' said Fordham, a
systems engineer at Siemens Energy &AMP; Automation in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham is a typical individual investor. Like many Americans
who own stock, he is in the market for the long haul, and he wasn't
panicked by the recent end to what had been a joyride for
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased interest in stocks by individuals who have
wanted to get in on the unprecedented market appreciation of recent
years, less than half of Americans own any stock. According to an
April 1998 survey by Hart-Teeter Research, 48 percent of adults in
the United States said they have $5,000 or more invested in mutual
funds or stocks. That's up from 40 percent in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 Federal Reserve study on consumer finances found that 41
percent of Americans have direct or indirect stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Individual ownership of stock is usually passive, often through
employer 401(k) or profit-sharing plans. Few individual owners of
stock are active traders or even aware how their holdings fare
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham, for example, watches financial news regularly and reads
his quarterly statements, but you won't find him scouring the
Internet for the latest stock quotes or burning up the phone lines
to a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, individual investors constitute a relatively
minor portion of the overall trading activity,'' said Richard
Wines, senior managing director of Georgeson &AMP; Co., a shareholder
analysis firm. He estimated that on a typical day, individuals
account for less than 10 percent of trading activity. Institutions
account for about 45 percent and the rest is done by arbitragers
and specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals are ``less likely to be following stocks closely.
They can't monitor the stock as thoroughly as a professional,''
Wines said. ``Most are pretty long-term holders. The vast majority
sit on their portfolios forever and probably have a turnover rate
of 20 years _ a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   As much attention as the market gets in the news, the actual
workings of stock trading remains a mystery to most individuals.
Most Americans simply don't understand how trading works, said Lee
Jenkins, a broker with Raymond James Financial in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Given the market woes of last week, Jenkins said individuals
will probably be even less likely to trade actively. ``The stock
market is not a one-way street going up, and people have learned
that over the last few weeks,'' he said. ``It probably will scare
people off. ''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said most of his clients are what he calls investors for
life. ``They will always invest because they have goals they are
trying to achieve either for themselves or the next generation. To
them its a stewardship issue. You should always make your money
work for you.''

MEMO TO LEGISLATORS: YOUR PRESENCE IS NOT REQUIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Sept. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An e-mail sent to Paul Harris, a member of the Virginia House of
Delegates, elicits an automatic response: ``I will be out of the
office from 3/17/98 until 1/12/99. The 1998 Session has
adjourned.'' I had forgotten: Virginia is one of the 42 states
where legislative sessions are kept short and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In healthy democracies, legislatures do not stay in session
year-round. They convene briefly, deal with the people's business,
and adjourn. The shorter their sessions, the more likely they are
not only to govern well, but to be genuinely representative.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire House of Representatives, for example, may
meet for a maximum of 45 days, and is required to end its yearly
sessions no later than June 30. That is a schedule that fits most
peoples' lives. As a result, New Hampshire is governed by a true
citizen-legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the 400-member House comprised _ take a deep breath _
veterinarians, social workers, psychotherapists, property managers,
office managers, mechanics, foresters, clerks, clergymen, chefs,
carpenters, business managers, auto dealers, ambulance owners,
construction workers, pilots, administrative assistants, salesmen,
journalists, bankers, accountants, police chiefs, executives,
nurses, firefighters, consultants, education administrators,
engineers, small business owners, government employees, homemakers,
and teachers, as well as retirees, students, volunteers, the
self-employed, people in real estate, insurance, utilities, quality
control, marketing, lumber, public relations, security, the shoe
industry, and the military _ and a handful of lawyers. That is
about as perfect a microcosm of society as any political system is
likely to produce. And since New Hampshire legislators do not have
individual offices and are paid a grand total of $100 a year, the
great majority of them run for office for the most admirable of
reasons: because it is an honor to serve.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Massachusetts, by contrast, the Legislature never
adjourns, and members are paid a lavish salary _ $46,410 to start,
plus thousands more in ``leadership'' bonuses, expense allowances,
and mileage per diems. Not surprisingly, very few Bay Staters can
even contemplate running for office, while those who do tend to be
political careerists. Most Massachusetts legislators list
``legislator'' as their occupation. Many are also lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any surprise that the state whose legislature closely
resembles the public has a reputation for limited and efficient
government, while the state ruled by lawyer-politicians is known
for its overbearing bureaucracy and intrusive rules? Is it any
wonder that New Hampshire has the lowest tax burden in America,
while Massachusetts has the sixth-highest?
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Massachusetts legislators responded to a statewide cry
for reform by promising to end their formal sessions by July 31 in
election years. As reforms go, it wasn't much: They intended to
remain in (ital) informal (unital) session for the remaining five
months of the year. But at least their power to cause mischief
would be restrained. During informal sessions, the rules prohibit
roll calls, which are required to float bonds, seize land by
eminent domain, and override gubernatorial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature kept its word in 1996, the first election year
after the adoption of the new rules. But in 1998, dozens of members
are demanding that the promise be broken. Not because there is an
emergency that demands their attention, but because acting Gov.
Paul Cellucci had the audacity to veto half of a last-minute, $400
million porkbarrel spending bill that should never have been passed
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a conflict between their hunger for pork and their
solemn promise, legislators are doing what legislators (in
Massachusetts) do best: breaking faith. Senate President Thomas
Birmingham now says he is ready to reconvene the Senate ``in a
nanosecond'' for the purpose of overriding Cellucci's vetoes. A
slew of House members led by Democrat James Marzilli of Arlington
are clamoring for their chamber to do likewise. ``This is not an
attempt to subvert the rules of the House,'' says Marzilli as a
justification for subverting the rules of the House. ``These vetoes
threaten the very stability of life in our commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, House Speaker Thomas Finneran has resisted the pressure.
But then, Finneran has always been one of the few politicians in
Massachusetts to acknowledge the danger of permanent legislative
sessions. ``I don't think it is healthy for us to be here 12 months
a year,'' he has said. ``It distorts the process. It distorts our
judgment.... We get cute. We play with the calendar and we use that
calendar for purposes that are inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Finneran's honor will hold and the Legislature will
not break the rule it so recently adopted. But sooner or later, the
urge to cheat will prove irresistible. Only a law mandating limited
sessions _ or better still, a constitutional amendment _ can put an
end to the delusion that legislating has to be a year-round,
nonstop endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   That e-mail reply from Delegate Harris makes me envy the
citizens of Virginia. How civilized it must be to live in a state
where lawmakers have real jobs and real lives _ where they don't
hang around the statehouse all year, trying to find ways to keep
themselves busy.

FIEFDOMS FOIL ON-LINE UNITY AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``disaster.'' A ``shambles.'' The George Bachrach
congressional campaign? No, a $60 million Harvard computer plan
that has stumbled badly.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, like many other large organizations, has been trying to
standardize its computer functions. The university is
decentralized; the policy of ``each tub (school) on its own
bottom'' not only means that business school grandees luxuriate in
a members-only gym while education school staffers grovel for
quarters behind the seat cushions of their 1978 Toyotas _ it also
means that each school has a separate computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Something called Project Adapt (not an acronym, but a ``slogan
for change,'' according to one principal) was supposed to change
all that. President Neil Rudenstine commissioned the project when
he asked a simple question _ how many people work for the
university? _ and couldn't get an answer. In some organizations,
that answer could be called up with a few keystrokes. But not at
the World's Greatest University, where some of the back-office
computing systems are more than 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been reorganized at least once and is well
behind schedule, partly because of institutional resistance; top
bureaucrats bridle at the notion of channeling tens of millions of
dollars away from teaching and research. Staffing Adapt has been a
huge headache. In the middle of a nationwide high-tech boom,
Harvard has had trouble hiring and keeping techies. (Computer
czarina Anne Margulies left her job in May, and her slot in the
provost's office has not been filled.) There's more money to be had
in the private sector, and the cachet of working at WGU goes only
so far. Remember the rallying cry of Harvard's clerical union?
``You can't eat prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a crossed finger attends the project's putative July 1999
completion date. Margulies, now an executive vice president at the
lobbying firm of McDermott/O'Neill, allows that Adapt ``is a very
difficult project to implement,'' but remains bullish on its
prospects.

   Who is Nick Negroponte and why are people saying those awful
things about him?
</P>
<P>
   Nick, longtime boss of MIT's smoke and mirrors factory, the
Media Lab, needs no introduction here. But my playful joshing over
the years pales in the face of invective soon to be published by
L.J. Davis, author of ``The Billionaire Shell Game.'' The book is
an account of the short, happy, and painfully expensive life of
``interactive television,'' a faddish technology promoted at
various times by media giants like Time Warner, and the lab. Davis,
a contributing editor at Harper's magazine, heaps abuse on such key
players as cable baron John Malone and Time Warner's Gerald Levin,
but he reserves special scorn for Negroponte.
</P>
<P>
   A sampler: ``Arrogant crackpot ... a highly flexible notion of
the truth. ... When it came to curbing his tongue and moderating
his ego, Nicholas Negroponte had a problem'' Davis openly questions
Negroponte's qualifications to work in mass media: ``It did not
seem to occur to him, as a man accustomed to wealth and comfort, he
might know remarkably little about the daily experiences of 90 per
cent of the human race.'' The last chapter of ``Shell Game'' is a
hilariously irreverent look at the Media Lab's 10th-anniversary
celebration in 1995.

   The best book I read this summer? ``Revere Beach Boulevard,'' by
my friend Roland Merullo. It's well written, it's a terrific
thriller, and it's set in Roland's hometown of Revere. (Roland's
first novel, ``Leaving Losapas,'' which I loved, is set in both
Polynesia and ... Revere.) Merullo's now a card-carrying member of
the Berkshire literary mafia (charter members: Elinor Lipman,
Jonathan Harr, Madeleine Blais et al.). But he writes beautifully
about both Revere and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cliffhanger. When the cavalry arrives on Page 312 _ well,
I won't give the ending away. ``Boulevard'' is Volume 1 of a
planned Revere Beach trilogy. It's every bit as good as Ernest
Hebert's superb ``Dogs of March,'' and I hope Roland does for
Revere what Hebert did for the fictional town of Darby, N.H. _ put
it on the literary map.

CHANNELING THE FORCE OF NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Ever look at some complex geological formation
and think that nothing so intricate could ever be created by a
human hand? Ursula von Rydingsvard's art may make you think again.
Von Rydingsvard, who ranks among the foremost living American
sculptors, is the subject of a show at Dartmouth's Hood Museum, an
exhibition of work of such mind-boggling intricacy that Nature
herself might be envious.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve pieces make up the entire show. Von Rydingsvard works big
and bigger, and while the display spreads over three large
galleries, it comes close to feeling cramped. The works are rich
with allusions _ to archeology, architecture, landscape, tools,
utensils, and the human form _ yet they are tantalizingly elusive,
impossible to categorize as either ``abstract'' or
``representational.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Rydingsvard has stayed remarkably loyal to a single material
_ cedar, which she cherishes for its softness and malleability, its
readiness to respond to her hand and her circular saw. On the fine
20-minute videotape made during her 1996 residency at the Rhode
Island School of Design and now showing in the Hood galleries, she
talks about her wood of choice. ``It doesn't resist you,'' she
says. Oak, she says disparagingly, does. She likes the neutrality
of cedar as well, its lack of flashy grain, knots, or pronounced
color, and she praises the neat rectilinearity of 4X4's. The tape
shows her crawling over a studio's worth of them, drawing on the
timbers with graphite, telling her burly helpers where to cut. When
she speaks, she gestures not only with her hands, but her torso,
too, adding her weight to her words.
</P>
<P>
   Her physical involvement with making her sculpture echoes in the
results, which bear many anatomical references, generally oblique.
From certain angles _ and von Rydingsvard's works demand that you
view them from all possible perspectives _ you'll see a craggy
profile, gaping jaws, a yearning arm, or the imprint of an entire
body emerging from wood that has been stacked, laminated, and then
eroded to create those complex textures. Giacometti is an influence
here. Her bruised and bruising surfaces are related to his dreamy,
gouged-out figures. In their ruggedness and anonymity, von
Rydingsvard's works are also related to the headless tribes of
another great contemporary woman sculptor, Magdalena Abakanowicz.
In the idea of the body's imprint on nature, they're kin to Ana
Mendieta's ``earth-body'' sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of biography is in order. Born in Germany to Polish and
Ukrainian parents, von Rydingsvard, now 56, spent her early years
in German refugee camps before her family emigrated to America in
1950. She studied art at several US universities, including
Columbia, where she earned an MFA in sculpture in 1975, the year
she also began using the cedar that was to become her signature.
She met Minimalists including Carl Andre and Sol LeWitt; she
traveled, taught, and began an impressive string of commissions and
solo shows. She developed a style that combined the incremental
repetitions of Minimalism with the seemingly chaotic gestures of
Abstract Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Formative years spent in bleak erstwhile army barracks left its
mark on her sculpture. In his beautiful essay in the Hood show's
catalog, Martin Friedman writes that ``a particularly vivid
childhood memory she has is of a spoon suspended from a string her
mother tied around her neck so she would not lose it. She not only
ate with it, but wore it to the Polish kindergarten in a nearby
barracks and while playing outdoors.'' Variations on spoons later
turned up in works including the 1987 ``Paul's Shovel,'' a tall,
totemic piece that gazes down at you from the wall where it hangs.
As with all von Rydingsvard's work, it juxtaposes the large and the
little. The shovel's outsize bowl is adorned with cutouts that have
the daintiness of paper doilies.
</P>
<P>
   Von Rydingsvard's works are slow, static, and stately; you never
lose the sense that they're made by hand, laboriously, over long
periods, the artistic equivalent of geological time. The earliest
piece in the show, the 1976 ``Untitled (cones),'' is an ensemble of
nine roughly conical cedar shapes, evenly spaced in three rows of
three, looking as if they're about to launch into a formal court
dance in which they'll retain their spatial relationship to one
another. The rounded cedar planks curve together at the tops, like
tulip buds about to bloom, or ball-gown skirts, or crumpled paper
bags. Irregular bulges in the wood suggest some force inside,
trying to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cone piece, the 1992-93 ``Krasavica'' is composed of
vessel shapes. In this case it's a string of five, opening at the
top, clinging to one another for support, scarred with deep
vertical ruts. As with other von Rydingsvard works, these could
equally be small objects _ baskets or bowls _ blown up to heroic
proportions, or giant hunks of topography scaled down. The
topographical aspect is particularly strong in the interiors,
craters filled with intricate shapes that might have been carved by
thousands of years of wind and water.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Zakopane,'' von Rydingsvard approaches architecture. A
22-foot-long wall of planks, the piece has a row of sagging,
udderlike shapes at the bottom and a top that looks like flying
buttresses in search of something to hold up. It is a mournful
presence, made of wounded wood, evoking medieval choir stalls along
a nave or Shakespeare's ``bare, ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet
birds sang.''
</P>
<P>
   The commanding 1989 ``Lace Mountains'' is a freestanding wall,
all gnarled forms until the ends, which are neatly flattened, as if
someone had sliced off a hunk of a mountain range to move it
inside. The squared-off ends create that most essential Minimalist
structure, the grid. Unlike, say, the rational, pristine geometry
of another notable woman sculptor working in wood, Jackie Ferrara,
von Rydingsvard's grids are rough and romantic. They're closer to
Chuck Close's handmade paper pulp grids, where faces fight their
way through to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Von Rydingsvard subtracts more than she adds. She does, however,
often blacken the wood with graphite, accentuating its contours and
making it look charred, which contributes to its overall weathered
effect. Less often, she adds whitewash, so the wood looks
snow-dusted. In ``Maglownica,'' named for the board traditionally
used by Polish women to batter rough linen sheets into softness,
she stretches dried, translucent cow intestines over a tall plank
that leans against the wall. Painful-looking protrusions from under
the taut membrane make it look about to tear.
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of contradictions contribute to the continuing hold von
Rydingsvard's sculptures maintain over the viewer's imagination.
The works are gawky, yet graceful; looming, but also detailed.
Among the many virtues that make the show well worth the trip to
Hanover, there's one that few art exhibitions can boast: Because of
all that cedar, it smells wonderful.

CIVIL RIGHTS MEMOIR DETAILS THE SIMPLE ACTS OF COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WALKING WITH THE WIND 
A Memoir of the Movement 
By John Lewis, with Michael D'Orso 
Simon and Schuster, 496 pp., illustrated, $26 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass was right when
he wrote that without struggle there is no progress, John Lewis's
life symbolizes at once a man's route to self-actualization and a
nation's steps, however awkward, toward social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 58, a poor black boy from Troy, Ala., who is now a
Democratic congressman from Atlanta, &UR;  &LR; endured punctured ribs, a
cracked skull, tides of scorn, and streams of indignities during
the marches, sit-ins, and protests that defined what we call the
civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the
Movement,'' with writer Michael D'Orso, brings that hazy period
into focus for a digital age, with nauseatingly vivid accounts of
the beatings captured on grainy black and white footage and
telecast routinely in Black History Month. It is superbly written,
with Lewis's searing honesty showing through.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those accounts, Lewis's book illuminates further by
magnifying a movement through the eyes of one of its
observer-participants, a student leader who believed the
Gandhi-inspired philosophy of nonviolence, ahimsa, and applied it
like balm to soothe the sting of Birmingham Sheriff Bull Connor's
lead-packed batons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence does beget violence, but the opposite is just as
true,'' he writes, describing a 1960 protest in a Woolworth's in
downtown Nashville. ``Hitting someone who doesn't hit back can last
only so long. Fury spends itself pretty quickly when there's no
fury facing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's own reflections on his life and the movement cast him in
the role of the purist for whom human rights was sacrosanct. He
never deviated from prescribed rules of conduct that governed
everything from what the student protesters could say and do right
down to the clothes they could wear.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis details clashes between the feisty youth of his generation
and the seasoned warriors who had pushed the civil rights agenda to
the fore &UR;  &LR; of the nation's consciousness. The students acknowledged
that those older folks had sacrificed, yet they believed that
drastic conditions called for drastic measures. Even the advice of
Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP attorney who &UR;  &LR; had helped craft
arguments that had defeated segregation in Brown v. Board of
Education, was rejected by the Lewis-led Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lewis writes, recalling a statement in response to Marshall's
advice that the students use the courts to achieve social justice,
``There are times in history _ and this was such a time, I said _
when more immediate, more dramatic means are called for, when the
people themselves must be asked to put their own bodies and hearts
and spirits on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   His earliest experience advocating for others in the face of
authority came when he protested the consumption of the chickens
his father and mother had raised on their farm in Troy. He recalls
mornings at age 5 when he would open the doors of the henhouse to
feed them and set off a chorus of cackling. Eventually, he said,
the birds would quiet and stand before him, watching and seemingly
listening to him talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something magical, almost mystical, about that
moment when those dozens and dozens of chickens, all wide awake,
were looking straight at me, and I was looking back at them, all of
us in total, utter silence,'' Lewis wrote. ``It felt very
spiritual, almost religious. I could swear those chickens felt it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fights he had with his parents over killing and eating the
chickens would mirror their conflicts over whether the boy they
sent off to Nashville's American Baptist Theological Seminary to be
a preacher had been spoiled, seduced by this movement. ``You went
to school to get an education,'' Lewis's mother, Willie Mae, wrote
after he had been arrested during a Nashville protest. ``You should
get out of this movement, just get out of that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hung on in ``that mess,'' and his travels from his birth
in a modest shotgun house to Capitol Hill tell the tale of a nation
witnessing assassinations _ John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King
Jr., Robert F. Kennedy _ and legislation, including the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Those deaths signaled to Lewis the demise of the civil rights
movement. But he remained focused on justice and the effort it
requires, and his book makes clear that his optimism is still
burning.

GODSMACK'S RECIPE FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Godsmack _ remember the name, because you'll be hearing it
again. It's the title of an Alice In Chains song, but also the name
of a Boston-area band that is ready for prime-time. Whenever they
play a show, it immediately sells out through word-of-mouth
popularity. The music is a cross between Metallica, Tool,
Aerosmith, and Alice In Chains, sporting a heavy punch that blends
retro hard-rock with an industrial edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what makes Godsmack is that we take a lot of little
bits and put them together. We take the aggressiveness of rock and
add a pinch of industrial sounds to it. We think it makes a very
cool recipe,'' says singer Sully Erna, whose group has released a
self-titled album that is starting to fly out of the stores. It's
on Republic Records (distributed by Universal), which also had
success with British rockers Chumbawamba.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, it was who could play the guitar the fastest.
Now, it's who can come up with the coolest noises,'' says Erna,
whose group incorporates processed vocals and radio edits into a
basic framework of raw guitar leads, grinding drum grooves, and
in-your-face lyrics about dealing with crumbling relationships. The
music is fiery, gritty, and exceptionally well produced, given that
the album was recorded for just $2,600 at New Alliance Studios in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show you that you don't need to spend $50,000 for a
producer and $150,000 to do the record. Half the records that are
made for that money don't sound that good anyway,'' says Erna, who
grew up outside of Boston and loved both Aerosmith and the Sex
Pistols as a kid. He was later part of such area groups as Meliah
Rage and Stripmine, before forming Godsmack three years ago. Other
members include drummer Tommy Stewart, guitarist Tony Rambola, and
bassist Robbie Merrill. They're managed by Paul Geary, Extreme's
former drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Godsmack has received a big boost from radio station WAAF-FM
(107.3), which has aired such Godsmack tunes as ``Keep Away,''
``Whatever,'' and ``Moon Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Erna knows why Godsmack fans come to see the the band. ``They
want to get their aggressions out. They're told what to do at home
and in school, but at shows, they don't want to be told what to
do,'' he says. ``And we respect that.''

   &UR; A Bonnie night:  &LR; Bonnie Raitt ended a whirlwind Boston stay
with a gig at Harborlights Sunday night _ her second sold-out show
of the weekend there. She had local friends of all sorts joining
her _ harpist Jim Fitting, fiddler Johnny Cunningham for ``A Thing
Called Love,'' and singers Catie Curtis and Peter Johnson (who knew
Raitt from her Radcliffe days in the '70s) for John Prine's ``Angel
from Montgomery.'' Raitt also spoke glowingly of Harborlights (she
regretted that she had never played there before) and thanked
promoter Don Law not only for running it, but for his social
concerns. ``He donates a lot of money that people don't know about
it,'' she said, referring especially to the campaign to stop
handgun violence. Raitt kept her own social concerns alive during
the weekend, attending events for the Conservation Law Foundation
and the ABCD, while still finding time on her off night (Saturday)
to party at the Rhythm &AMP; Spice club in Cambridge.

<P>

<P>
   Aerosmith update: Ever wonder what happened to the canceled
Aerosmith date at Great Woods last month (caused by the burns to
drummer Joey Kramer when his car caught fire at a Scituate gas
station)? It now looks as if the group will defer any appearance
until New Year's Eve at the FleetCenter, a source says.
Nevertheless, more Aerosmith recorded product is coming our way
sooner _ a double-CD of live tracks, ``A Little South of Sanity,''
due Oct. 20 (culled from their previous two tours, not this one).
And note that A-smith's latest single, ``I Don't Want to Miss a
Thing,'' is the group's first-ever No.1 hit. Sad that it had to
come from such a sappy, Diane Warren-penned tune, rather than
something more suitable to the band's rock legacy.

PORTFOLIOS MORE SMOKE-FREE SINCE START OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

   Are Fidelity's Marlboro Managers finally kicking the habit?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, even as the anti-smoking fervor has
grown, no one in the world made a bigger bet on Big Tobacco than
Fidelity's fund managers. But since the start of the year the giant
Boston money manager has been significantly cutting back its
tobacco holding.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues at the world's biggest mutual fund
company, this could be good news for the antismoking crowd and bad
news for the tobacco companies and their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis done for us by the Carson Group, a New
York consulting firm, tobacco as a percent of Fidelity's entire
portfolio fell to 1.6 percent by the end of June, the latest
numbers publicly available, from 2.7 percent at the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts have come across-the-board.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., the world's largest cigarette maker, was
Fidelity's No. 1 holding at $9 billion at the first of the year,
but has fallen to No. 5 in its portfolio. Fidelity cut its Big Mo
holdings by 20 percent, unloading $2.3 billion in stock in the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff has been even more dramatic in RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp., maker Joe Camels. Fidelity has cut its RJR holdings by 57
percent this year, or about $900 million. Fidelity has also reduced
its stake in UST Inc., maker of Skoal and Copenhagen chewing
tobacco, by 13 percent this year, and cut its stake in General
Cigar and Consolidated Cigar Holding by half or more, according to
the Carson Group.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the sales, however, Fidelity remains the largest
holder of Philip Morris (6.6 percent) and second largest
shareholder of RJR (5.1 percent). But a little historic perspective
shows just how broad the realignment has been.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago we looked at Fidelity's tobacco holdings and found
that fully three dozen of its funds counted tobacco in their top 10
holdings at the time. Eleven funds had Philip Morris or RJR as
their No. 1 holding; another 13 funds had one of them as their
second-largest holding.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's own mutual fund guide tells a different story today.
By the end of June, only 12 funds included either Philip Morris or
RJR among their top 10 holdings. Only one Fidelity fund, the tiny
Food &AMP; Agriculture select fund, has tobacco as its top holding;
only two funds have tobacco as a No. 2 holding. The $4.7 billion
Retirement Growth, which lists both Philip Morris and RJR among its
top holdings, probably is the Fidelity fund with the heaviest
weighing in tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Fidelity's stake in General Electric was just half
that of Philip Morris; at the end of June, G.E. was Fidelity's
largest holding at $10.4 billion while the Philip Morris stock was
worth $6.3 billion. While it has been selling tobacco, Fidelity has
been loading up on stocks like Microsoft Corp., Associates First
Capital Corp., McDonald's Corp., Time Warner Inc., Lucent
Technologies Inc. and America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks, dogged by all the usual worries, have been weak
all year, particularly RJR, which has lost 38 percent this year.
Philip Morris is down 5 percent, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is
up 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco retains much of what originally made it so
attractive to Fidelity and other value investors. Philip Morris,
for instance, sells for about 13 1/2 times next year's earnings
compared to 23 1/2 for the S&AMP;P index. In addition, the company
raised its quarterly dividend last month by 10 percent, boosting
its yield to 4 percent, the highest of the 30 stocks in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Lowell, editor of the Fidelity Investor, a newsletter,
believes Fidelity's decision on tobacco stocks is driven less by
political correctness than the analysts inside the big fund company
changing their outlook for the sector. But Lowell says he would be
surprised to see Fidelity continuing to sell off tobacco because
the sector is a good defensive holding in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't stop drinking, smoking or eating when things get
bad,'' Lowell says. ``It's the common man's antidepressant.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, as usual, declined to talk to us about its position in
tobacco, saying it does not discuss individual stocks.

ROCK, ONCE EXPORTED TO LATIN AMERICA, RETURNS WITH TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commerce with Latin America, the darling emerging market helped
along by NAFTA, is predicted to dwarf trade with Europe and Asia
combined within 15 years. We give them McDonald's and Windows, they
give us sugar, coffee, bananas, and ... rock and roll. Say what?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has tossed the cultural Frisbee of
rock music south of the border, cultivating large followings in
places like Mexico City, where a Black Sabbath concert recently
drew thousands of Mexi-metalheads. That's to be expected. The
world's citizens love American rock. But nowhere do they love it
more than in Latin America, where they've turned it into a
boom-erang.
</P>
<P>
   Starting about 10 years ago, Latin American rock bands began
hurling their rock back at America _ bigger, brighter, and better,
in many cases. This wasn't the syrupy Spanish pap we were used to
avoiding on AM radio stations. This was rock: hard-core, complex,
virtuosic, experimental. The lyrics spoke of political and social
movements that made Kurt Cobain's troubles look bo-ring. Where
American rock seemed mired in selfish suburban angst, Latin rock
seemed outwardly political, angry, and pumped. It came out sounding
real, and Americans, especially second- and third-generation
Latinos longing for sounds to define their experience, embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   The rock en espanol movement comes to Boston next week in full
force as two of the hottest acts take to area stages. The Mexican
band Mana (mah-NAH), the top-selling Latin rock band in the world,
originally was to play the Roxy, but is now booked at the larger
Avalon for Wednesday, as part of its 36-city American tour.
Newcomer Bloque (BLO-kay), a Colombian band that describes its own
music as ``psychotropical funk,'' plays tonight at the House of
Blues in Harvard Square and Sept. 19 at the Middle East Cafe in
Central Square, Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic sales of rock en espanol have increased fivefold in
just five years, according to Maribel Shumacher, vice president of
Warner Music's Latin American division. She credits changing
demographics and boredom with the usual American rock for this.
Tracking sales proves difficult, because organizations such as
Soundscan have not traditionally paid attention to the genre.
Shumacher's claims, however, are backed by preliminary numbers from
the Recording Industry Association of America, and by the creation
of the Latin rock/alternative category for the Grammy Awards last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Shumacher oversaw one of the first Latin rock tour in the States
in 1988, and says interest was minimal. But since that time, it has
become the music of choice for many Americans craving something new
_ and not just Latinos. Howard Stern _ notoriously critical of
Mexican music when Selena died _ recently featured the Mexican
rock-rap group Molotov (sort of the Mexican Beastie Boys) on his
show. Accused by a conservative Mexican newspaper of ``polluting
Mexico'' with its ``harmful and offensive ... nasty musical
production,'' the controversial Molotov was a natural for Stern.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many compare America's blossoming affair with rock en
espanol to the British invasion, when bands like the Beatles and
the Rolling Stones dominated the American music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a commercial standpoint, it's comparable to the British
invasion of the '60s,'' Shumacher said. ``Why? Because people want
to hear something new and fresh. It's fascinating. I'm going to be
bullish about this, but that's because I'm in the thick of it, and
I know. I was at Mana's show in LA a couple of weeks ago, I was
incredibly impressed because it was the first time I saw a 70-30
breakdown. Thirty percent were Anglos _ I mean real Anglos. What
does that say to me? That this stuff is crossing over. It's slowly
catching on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there could ever really be a mainstream crossover of
music in a language most Americans can't understand, Shumacher was
prepared with an answer: ``Let me ask you this. Do you enjoy
instrumental music? Do you understand more than half of the words
Green Day sing? No. But do you get the general meaning? Yes. I
mean, I love Alanis Morissette, but I don't understand 50 percent
of what she says. And it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the artists: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mana
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the rock en espanol movement is Mana, a
quartet from Mexico with a leonine lead singer named Fehr, whose
vocals are sometimes uncomfortably similar to Sting's. (Don't tell
Fehr. The comparison really upsets him.)
</P>
<P>
   Mana's music is melodic, and draws on Mexican folk music and
reggae as often as on the Police. The group's lyrics speak of
social problems such as teen pregnancy and drug addiction. The band
has used earnings to start its own environmental watchdog group,
Selva Negra (Black Forest).
</P>
<P>
   Mana is credited with starting the Latin rock movement. Though
other groups, like heavy metal group Enanitos Verdes and Miguel
Mateos, both from Argentina, have been around since the early
1980s, Mana was the first Latin rock band to land an album on the
Billboard Top 200, where last year's ``Suenos Liquidos'' debuted at
No.67. It has been certified gold twice in the States, selling more
than 500,000 copies. A previous album, ``Cuando Los Angeles
Lloran,'' also went gold in 1995, and was nominated for a Grammy in
the Spanish pop category; this was before the Latin rock category
was added. Internationally, Mana has sold more than 10 million
records. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bloque
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bloque is the newest band on the scene; its debut album will not
be in stores until October. Made up of members of Carlos Vives's
Colombian band, Bloque released an announcement explaining that its
music is ``the result of something unique ... searching. Searching
the garbage can where all Colombian music has been thrown away for
decades ... Our music fills the immense black hole that was created
by the media revolution in the '60s ... while Colombian people were
busy trying to learn to dance to the sound of the (expletive) Beach
Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting music _ political, angry, danceable, brilliant _
is unlike anything yet recorded in the rock genre, a fact that got
the attention of David Byrne, who signed the group to his Luaka Bop
label. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Fabulosos Cadillacs
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Buenos Aires band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs last year was the
first band to win the Grammy in the Latin rock/alternative
category. Some say their album, ``Fabulosos Calaveras,'' won
because Mana's ``Suenos Liquidos'' came out two weeks too late to
be considered. But the band's horn-heavy ska-punk could have won
regardless. After all, no one in rock has a high, trembling voice
as imploring as that of lead singer and accordionist Gabriel
``Vincentio'' Fernandez Capello.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians who frequent Euro clubs will recognize Los Fabulosos
Cadillacs from their hit ``Matador,'' a dancy anthem about Victor
Jara, a young Chilean folk singer who was murdered in a military
coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillacs, who won an MTV Video Music Award in 1995, have
collaborated with artists from Ruben Blades to Debbie Harry. Spin
magazine said flatly that the Cadillacs were changing ``the future
of rock 'n' roll'' and Rolling Stone has called them ``rock en
espanol's most viable crossover dream.'' They toured this year with
the neo-swing band Cherry Poppin' Daddies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soraya
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A brooding young Colombian guitarist, composer, and singer now
known only by her first name, Soraya is marketed as a Colombian
act. She is a powerful songwriter with introspective, poetic
lyrics, and her acoustic folk-rock sound is something like a
melding of Sarah McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, and Carole King. Her most
recent album, ``Wall of Smiles'' has been compared with King's
``Tapestry.'' Unlike many Latin rock acts, Soraya has chosen to
release her albums in Spanish and English, making her popular in
England and Germany, and landing her English singles on US rock
radio. Her songs have even been piped over speakers in a Pizzeria
Uno in Dedham. If the Lilith Fair ever sees fit to add a Latina
act, this would be the one. &QL;

LIEBERMAN SETS TONE FOR PRESIDENT'S PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6, 1998)  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Of course Joe Lieberman was right the other day,
so long as you understand that what the Connecticut
senator-moralist had to say was far more diagnostic than
prescriptive.
</P>
<P>
   Judging others is risky business, including in scripture, but
the proper course is therefore to judge conduct rather than people.
It should not be to excuse it in order to avoid playing God with
the person.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's contributions on the Senate floor extend well beyond
the application of a word, immoral, to President Clinton's sexual
encounters in the workplace with an intern less than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first serious words from a serious Democrat since
the president admitted that he had indeed had what the rest of us
would call sex with Monica Lewinsky and had lied in denying it
until cornered by facts and legal process.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's words stand in important contrast to those of
another New Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, who
pronounced her faith in Clinton shattered. Last week, I'm told, she
began the weekly private luncheon of Senate Democrats with a
lengthy tirade against the president for the damage he has done to
his party's prospects this year and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As such, what Feinstein said involved what Clinton's conduct
meant to her and by extension to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   What Lieberman discussed, beyond his own personal anger and
disappointment, was what Clinton's conduct as currently established
means to the country _ not to him, but to us, reaching the higher
plain on which responsible decisions about what to do can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's contribution was also personal in the best sense of
the word. Other than the president himself, there has been no more
articulate New Democrat in recent years, able to explain the
emerging ideology's critical marriage between opportunity and
personal responsibility. As fellow ex-presidents of the Democratic
Leadership Council, Clinton and Lieberman are not close friends,
but they go way back, to when Lieberman's first insurgency campaign
against a big shot state senator succeeded in 1970 with the
volunteer assistance of a certain student at the Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke for a lot of people last January, myself
included, when he said that he believed the president's clear and
explicit denials _ not merely of crimes but of the underlying
affair itself. He and others believed them both in the absence of
any direct evidence to the contrary and as the embodiment of the
presumption of innocence that should guide responsible people in a
tabloid culture whose abysmal standards blur the distinction
between fact and allegation.
</P>
<P>
   But that belief demands an outcry when one of the denials turns
out to have been not only false but intentionally so. And the
underlying conduct cannot be shielded by privacy. In addition to
close study of Lieberman's speech, Clinton would also learn much
from a stunning speech by Senator Edward Kennedy at Harvard seven
years ago as his own life was changing. In it, Kennedy, without
even acknowledging the tabloid culture, recognized how what may
seem private can become legitimately public.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to underscore how Lieberman built his comments
on the assumption that the Lewinsky matter is what we're talking
about here. Anything more, obviously, and the damage is mortal _
politically, legally, and morally.
</P>
<P>
   On that assumption, however, Lieberman constructed a wall
between his moral condemnation and such extreme steps as
impeachment hearings and resignation from office; he doesn't use
words like ``unjust and unwise'' lightly. He was also careful to
build another wall between ScandalRama as played around here and
the ``time and space'' the president must have to do his job and
for his sin to be both acknowledged as very serious yet seen and
judged in broader context.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in a critically important phrase that I didn't see
quoted anywhere in the press, he said that on the basis of the
basic facts as they are now known, what is called for is ``some
measure of public rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the impact of Lieberman's comments has been
considerable, both publicly and privately. In public, it has
overnight become the Democratic standard, a stance worthy of the
problem presented that is not self-centered or election-centered,
but country-centered.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, they have also served as a warning to partisan
Republicans that ``unjust and unwise'' responses that offend the
Constitution's high standards can also be opposed effectively from
principled ground.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, they have reached his pal, the president, as the
words of no other pol have. They can both help Clinton to overcome
his remaining, human problems with pique and denial, to then say
more to the country, and then to be in position to deal maturely
with a public rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   The report from Kenneth Starr must still be received; it must
contain no new bombs beyond whatever salacious sex details Starr
feels compelled to disclose; and Lieberman has no problem at all
with an accompanying White House refutation that is based on
evidence and law.
</P>
<P>
   But then, assuming that's it, it is time for trustworthy people
in both parties (aided by some new Clintonian ambassador) to settle
this case in a way that joins legitimate condemnation with
proportionate response.

REEBOK LOSES ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the high-stakes marketing bonanza of professional sports,
Reebok International Ltd. is again fighting to get what it paid
for.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it &UR;  &LR; spent $1.5 million for a product placement in the
popular movie Jerry McGuire, only to see the spot fall to the
cutting room floor. Reebok's suit was settled out of court. In
1992, the Reebok Vector appeared on the US basketball team's
warm-ups, but the US Olympic Committee permitted players who had
contracts with Reebok's competitiors to cover up the logo. &UR;  &LR; Reebok
officials are still fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Reebok's marketing coup of securing the endorsement of
tennis star Venus Williams was diminished on the world stage of the
US Open in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took the court Thursday wearing the logo of another
company _ in clear violation of Reebok's exclusive contract with
her, one that industry observers value at $2 million. She had
little choice. Williams faced major fines if she did not wear the
logo of the tournament's sponsors, the Canadian software
manufacturer Corel Corp. and the Women's Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   While Reebok's Vector still appears on her outfits, the
company's investment in exclusivity has been diluted. To the casual
observer, that may seem trivial. But in the highly competitive
world of sports endorsements, exclusivity is paramount. This is
especially so at the US Open, where players under contract with
Reebok's archrivals, Nike and Adidas, do not have to wear the
additional logo because their endorsement deals were signed before
Corel became a tournament sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It some respects, this harkens back to the '92 Olympics when
we outfitted the basketball players _ the Dream Team _ and the US
Olympic Committee decided they could cover up the logo at the
awards ceremony,'' said David Fogelson, Reebok's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is described by sports marketing experts as among the
most desireable athletes currently available to companies seeking
to burnish their brand names by attaching them to rising stars. The
great demand for her is magnified by the fact that her father,
Richard, her coach and manager, has forestalled major business
deals in the hope of keeping Venus and her sister Serena focused on
their tennis skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a hot property,'' said Bob Williams president of Burns
Sports, in Chicago. ``They've been very slow to accept any deals at
all and Reebok did tremendously well to sign her.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams' contract with Reebok requires her, in effect, to
wear only its logo. Her contract, according to Fogelson, states
that she may wear other logos only when she wears outfits with
sleeves &UR; .  &LR; But Williams has no other endorsement agreements, and
her seven US Open outfits, supplied by Reebok, are all sleeveless.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at the US Open, Williams was required by the
Women's Tennis Association to wear the Corel/WTA logo. Industry
sources say Corel paid $4 million for the deal, which expires at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in the face of fines threatened by the WTA _ and at
risk of creating a controversy that might overshadow her play _ she
wore the Corel/WTA logo on the left shoulder strap of a stunning
lime-green tennis outfit. As Williams moved about the court, in
taped clips of her performance and in photographs moved by the
print media covering the event, the Corel/WTA logo appears in sharp
contrast with the distinctive Reebok Vector.
</P>
<P>
   According to WTA officials, because agreements between Nike and
Adidas predate the WTA's agreement with Corel, the Women's Tennis
Association has allowed other stars _ like Steffi Graf, Monica
Seles and Martina Hingis, to name a few _ to play without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the concern, and this is a major issue for us,
going forward,'' said Joseph Favorito, director of communications
for the WTA, who said the tour has recently talked to Adidas and
FILA about the situation, and will sit down at the US Open next
week with officials from Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tour will name a new title sponsor next year,
Favorito said, ``it is a good time to deal with this situation once
and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Reebok, Fogelson said what Williams wears along with the
rest of the five outfits Reebok has designed for the rest of the
tournament is entirely up to her. The company appears to have made
its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't seek to make an issue out of it, the WTA did when
they went to Venus and Richard (Williams) and said they were going
to be fined,'' Fogelson said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Venus, she said in her post-match interview Thursday that
the brouhaha had not been a distraction. Would she continue wearing
the Corel/WTA patch, she was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``You all have to talk to Reebok,'' she said.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ After coming under fire for the first time
during the Vietnam war, I lit up a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   On another patrol, a Marine was killed by a booby trap on a
jungle trail 100 yards behind me. Twenty of us had walked right
over that device without setting it off. Time to spark a match.
Inhaling on that death-bearing cig seemed to offer the promise I'd
walk out of the infernal mudhole alive.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the grunts on the front lines smoked, but it wasn't
the Marine Corps that led me to pick up the habit. I'd put the
blame on those wily VC in black pajamas hiding in the treetops. Not
agents of Joe Camel, but they served the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, the source of the cigarettes was a wonder to behold.
They fell out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The resupply choppers came in with four main goodies: mail,
ammo, C-rations and free cigarettes in sample packages of four. You
could scoop up as many of these slender little boxes as you wanted.
Very satisfying after ham and lima beans from a can.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about this after reading that more than 8,000 veterans
had filed disability claims for smoking-related injuries because
they picked up the habit in the heat of battle. Only combat-zone
veterans could apply. The claim rests on the fact that free
cigarettes landed in Vietnam, Korea and all over the theater of
operations during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 legal opinion from Mary Lou Keener, general counsel for
the Veterans Administration, concluded that veterans had the right
to make such claims. Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs
estimated there could be as many as 2.5 million claims of this
nature filed over the next 10 years. The costs of smoking-related
compensation would be in the billions of dollars. In a kind of
preemptive strike, VA officials moved to snuff out proposed
legislation moving through Congress that would have made good on
these claims.
</P>
<P>
   The VA won through a slippery maneuver _ tacking an amendment
banning the war-smoking claims on a pork-barrel highway funding
bill which sailed through Congress. I don't like the underhanded
method by which this was done, but I do think it was the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   I can't conclude that the federal government has encroached on
my liberty by allowing the tobacco companies to give away
cigarettes to the troops. Quite the opposite. Free cigarettes
raining down on us enhanced our ability to do the dirty job.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking and war are deeply intertwined. Before a battle you
smoke to calm your nerves. After the battle you smoke in the face
of grief. Between battles you sit around with four or five other
guys smoking and telling dirty jokes and complaining about some
arrogant lieutenant waving his insane arms in your direction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time there is no battle. You hump the hills for days
without a shot fired. You sit for long hours in the hot sun with
nothing to do. So hot you must have a smoke. Or maybe the monsoon
rains just swept in. Aahhh, how refreshing, the fiery tip giving
off a little warmth in the midst of a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are at peace and in need of an enemy. Thus a war on
cigarettes, once the ally of the soldier. To some extent a just
war. The nicotine delivery system is a nasty number.
</P>
<P>
   The war on cigarettes is looking much like the war in Vietnam:
long, protracted, and in the end, likely a lost cause. Well, not
quite. In the '50s half the nation's adults puffed away. Today
about one-quarter smoke. An amazing victory, but not good enough
for the zero-tolerance zealots determined to extinguish every
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   For them, it is total war.
</P>

LYNCH, TOMLIN MIX FUN AND FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as investors could use a few laughs coming off a volatile
week on Wall Street, Fidelity Investments has unveiled a new ad
campaign that includes humorous skits with Peter Lynch, once
Fidelity's star fund manager, and comic Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   While other mutual fund companies, most notably Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., have used spokesmen to put a human face on financial services,
the use of Lynch as a corporate pitchman marks the first time
Boston-based Fidelity has done so.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fidelity, it also marks the first time Tomlin has
ever pitched a product or service for anyone.``This campaign is a
real departure,'' said Stephen Cone, Fidelity's new president of
customer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the themes Lynch highlights in ads created by Boston
agency Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos is, ``Know what you own and
know why you own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent Fidelity ad campaigns, this one is less about
selling products and more about educating customers in Lynch's
``fundamental principles of responsible investment,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the new ads is to convince people that Fidelity is
more than just the world's largest family of mutual funds with
nearly $700 billion in managed assets, it's also ``an overall
solution to their investing needs,'' Cone suggested.
</P>
<P>
   By teaming Lynch and Tomlin, Fidelity can create ads that are
``memorable and engaging _ ads that break through the clutter,''
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping Lynch as Fidelity's spokesman makes sense. &UR;  &LR; Given his
fame as a former money manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund, he
evokes Fidelity's glory days.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tomlin, presumably some of her biggest fans are the same
baby boomers who are investing heavily for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been a fan of Peter's for 15 years,'' said Cone of his
decision to use Tomlin. ``She'd been dying to meet him for a long
time. There's a natural chemistry between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an independent
newsletter that tracks Fidelity, said he thought Tomlin's humor
might play better in TV ads than her faith in Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her belief in the company may be less valuable than her comic
relief, given the market's current climate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several ads in the new Fidelity campaign were specifically
designed to run during times of temporary market downturns.
</P>
<P>
   One such TV ad finds Lynch wired up on a jogger's treadmill with
Tomlin cast as a nurse giving him a stress test.As the treadmill
begins to buck up and down, causing Lynch's test readings to
fluctuate wildly, Lynch says, ``This reminds me of the stock
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Tomlin: ``It can just shoot up without warning .... And
then fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five percent or more,'' Lynch says. ``Four times since
1970. Fidelity can help you better prepare for the market's ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are asked to contact their financial advisers or visit
Fidelity's Web site. Those who do may be sent such Lynch inspired
tracts as ``Investing in Volatile Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   A second series of ads shows Lynch, but not Tomlin, talking
about ``the Fidelity difference.'' In these ads, he discusses how
diligently Fidelity checks the companies it invests in and how it
picks its analysts as carefully as it picks its stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The themes that Lynch espouses in TV and print ads will be fully
``integrated'' at every point of contact that Fidelity has with its
customers and potential customers, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   People who call Fidelity's 1-800 number will hear phone
operators reading from a Lynch script. Those who visit Fidelity's
Web site will also be treated to much Lynch imagery and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Fidelity spent $85.7 million on TV, radio, print, and
billboard ads, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York
firm that tracks spending. While Cone would not confirm those
numbers, he said Fidelity will spend about the same on ads this
year as it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   After using so many different ad themes in recent years, how
long will Fidelity stick with the Lynch-and-Tomlin comedy duo?
</P>
<P>
   All Cone would say is that plans call for Fidelity to use these
ads for the rest of the year and the early part of 1999.

Cafe Tacuba
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico's Cafe Tacuba made headlines from the New York
Times to Newsweek when it performed in Central Park. Observed
Newsweek: ``a whole world of music crammed onto one stage ... what
held this glorious mishmash together was a single, driving
principle: Cafe Tacuba rocked.'' The Miami Herald has called Tacuba
``one of the best bands in rock, period.'' It's true. This group
has mastered the American alternative and hip hop idioms, and
remains fearless about folding in lounge, polka, funk, and Latin
American classics such as ``Ojala Que Llueva Cafe,'' a merengue
made famous by Dominican composer and singer Juan Luis Guerra. It
reached a wider audience in 1992 by playing at the Los Angeles
``Lollapalooza'' and this year opened for Santana. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shakira
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Soraya, Shakira is a one-name singer, composer, and
guitarist from Colombia. But that's where the similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   Shakira (Isabel Mebarak Ripoll), 21, has been recording
professionally since she was 13. At 19, Shakira released ``Piez
Descalzos,'' an album of sophisticated and mature pop rock songs
reminiscent of Natalie Merchant; it went platinum in Mexico,
Colombia, the States, and Venezuela, selling 900,000 copies in
Brazil alone. Her anguished alto moves across octaves in the style
of Sinead O'Connor and Alanis Morissette, without being as
annoying. Her guitar-playing is deft and determined, and her
compositions experiment with rhythms from Latin America and the
Middle East (her father is Lebanese). Because of her celebrity,
Colombia declared her a goodwill ambassador to the Vatican, where
she met Pope John Paul this year. He received her warmly, in spite
of the lyrics of her song ``Se Quiere, Se Mata,'' about a woman who
dies after an illegal abortion. Shakira's much-awaited new album,
``Donde Estan los Ladrones?'', was released this month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   La Ley
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Led by a 30-year-old singer, Alberto Cuevas, who spent 10 years
in Montreal, La Ley is the first rock band from Chile to make it
big on the rock en espanol scene, and the first to experiment with
hypnotic techno sounds. La Ley comes at rock from the INXS/Duran
Duran school, with a bit of a Depeche Mode sensibility. Cuevas, a
graphic artist who wears black nail polish and designs the band's
album covers, resents his original band being labeled a ``Latin
American act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be seen as citizens of the universe, and not be
prejudged because we are Latin Americans,'' he said from Santiago,
where he lives. ``I think all Latin rock bands are hoping to do in
America what American music did in Latin America in the '50s. We
didn't know what you were saying, but it didn't matter. The music
spoke for itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Aterciopelados
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the few woman-fronted rock en espanol bands,
Aterciopelados is quickly gaining on groups like Mana and the
Cadillacs. Lead singer Andrea Echiverri is considered by many
critics to be the best singer in the genre, period. With much of
her body pierced and with in-your-face feminist lyrics, Echiverri
has disproved the former industry assumption that there was no room
for women in the machismo world of Latin rock. Watching her
sold-out shows, it's hard to believe that women were literally
booed from Latin rock stages as recently as the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   From a wealthy Colombian family, Echiverri comes at her
rebellious stance from a debutante's background. Under her lead,
the band was nominated for the Latin rock Grammy last year, along
with four all-male bands. More than any other female artist to
date, Echiverri has revolutionized the rock en espanol revolution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Molotov
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wildly popular throughout Latin America, the rock-rap band
sounds a lot like the Beastie Boys _ and about a million other
American copycats. What sets them apart is language _ Spanish _ and
culture _ Mexican. With two bassists who rap, the group is loud,
crude, curses a lot, and, when it attempts to rap in English, shows
its heavy imitation of misogynist American faux-gangstas like Snoop
Dog. In the land musically defined by corny balladeers like Luis
Miguel and Alejandro Fernandez _ who still appear onstage in velvet
mariachi outfits _ these nasty boys with the baggy pants have
caused quite a stir, something like the early days of Madonna, when
the Christian Coalition was out in full protest. Interesting from a
historical but not necessarily musical point of view.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other bands
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are literally hundreds of rock en espanol bands. Here are
some of them:
</P>
<P>
   Madita Vecindad y Los Hijos del Quinto Patio, famous for its
song ``Pachuco,'' is one of the first Mexican bands to document the
downside of urban life in Mexico City; lead singer Roco howls
through lyrics about police brutality; the group has used its
popularity to raise money for Indians in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta Venegas is a classical pianist from Tijuana who took up
the accordion and then made it rock; as the former keyboardist for
the punk band Tijuana No, Venegas has gone solo in a big, feminist
way. She, along with fellow Mexicana rocker Ely Guerra, have begun
a Mexican version of the Lilith Fair, called De Diva Voz (In the
Diva's Voice).
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's Fito Paez is the only singer on the scene doing
moody rock operas, and has been compared to David Bowie. Andres
Calamaro is another Argentine solo artist; he looks like Bob Dylan
with a stylist, and turned a childhood filled with military horrors
into a successful rock career; his new debut album, called ``Alta
Suciedad,'' is a word play on ``high society'' that comes out
meaning ``high trash.'' Argentina's Soda Stereo was a
U2-sound-alike that broke up recently but still has some nice discs
out there; and Todos Tus Muertos is one of Argentina's top
speed-metal slam bands.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be excluded from the rock en espanol roster are acts from
Spain. Heroes del Silencio is a pure thrash-metal band whose lead
singer sounds like a thundering Satan on speed.
</P>
<P>
   Several American rockers have come out with their own rock en
espanol projects. Lysa Flores is a guitarist and singer from Los
Angeles who dresses like a mariachi girl and proceeds to crank the
distortion and wail like Janis Joplin; her music and acting were
featured in the film ``Star Maps.'' King Chango is one of the
hottest new Latin rock bands, made up of New Yorkers with
Venezuelan roots. Puerto Rico's best-known rocker is former Menudo
member Robi Draco Rosa.

`FIRELIGHT` IGNITES SMOLDERING PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FIRELIGHT 
Directed and written by: William Nicholson 
Starring: Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane, Kevin Anderson, Joss
Ackland, Lia Williams, Dominique Belcourt 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality and brief strong language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few period dramas reach into the present as compellingly as
``Firelight,'' William Nicholson's impressive follow-up to
``Shadowlands.'' Its themes, especially that of surrogate
motherhood, could have been lifted from Thursday's headlines. Yet
the thing that ultimately makes ``Firelight'' persuasive is
Nicholson's ability to transport us to its Victorian world and the
conventions of the 19th-century novel _ from its insistence that we
go along with some blatantly convenient plot twists to its ability
to make the physical environment seem a metaphor for the moral
universe.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's an impressively wrought piece, handsomely mounted
and vibrantly acted, starting with its central character, Sophie
Marceau's impoverished Swiss governess, Elisabeth. She agrees to
bear an anonymous English landowner's child and then hand the baby
over, abandoning any future claim to it. In exchange, the
Englishman agrees to pay her father's debts. The deal is
consummated in convincingly stilted fashion, yet we're asked to
believe they could have enjoyed it under less strained
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The governess doesn't forget the child. She keeps a journal,
complete with delicate watercolors, in which she maintains a
one-sided dialogue with the daughter who doesn't know her. Seven
years and one whopping coincidence later, she applies for a
governess's job at a remote manor in Sussex, only to find that the
spoiled brat she's supposed to govern is her daughter. It seems
that Stephen Dillane's agonized lord of the manor, Charles, needed
an heir he couldn't expect from his wife, who has lain paralyzed
and comatose since a riding accident.
</P>
<P>
   Into this ``Jane Eyre''-like world is thus introduced maternal
pining, but Elisabeth has been sworn to silence as a condition of
keeping her job, whose loss, given her feelings, would be
unthinkable. Clapping a lid on her yearnings, she sets about
relating to the ill-mannered little girl, named Louisa, whose
existence has a visual analogue, a gazebo in the center of an
artificial lake, to which Louisa rows when she wants to brood
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth finally breaks through Louisa's antisocial sullenness,
as the conflicted Charles stands by nervously. His anxiety is
deepened by the conduct of his spendthrift father, a neat reversal
of the usual alignment of responsibilities. Dillane's earnest,
sober, responsible son wrings his hands over the heedless
extravagance of his hedonistic father, played by Joss Ackland with
mischievous yet shrewd high style and a world of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Except when the lordly wastrel is onscreen, airily indulging
this folly or that, the mood is dark and heavy and cold with
foreboding. How things can be put right is anything but apparent,
quite apart from parenting issues and the concealed blood
relationship between mother and daughter. Newcomer Dominique
Belcourt touchingly reveals the pain behind Louisa's unruly
behavior and the vulnerability. But ``Firelight'' is French actress
Marceau's showcase and will usher her decisively into the world of
English-speaking prestige films, thanks to Nicholson's superior
craftsmanship.

`QUEEN OF NICE' HOPES TO STEAL CROWN FROM TV MATRIARCH OPRAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She once rivaled Oprah Winfrey for the throne of
daytime talk shows, but the royal title that has stuck with Rosie
O'Donnell after two years is ``the queen of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is nice indeed, but it doesn't always mean ratings. ``The
Rosie O'Donnell Show'' has slipped from its powerful debut two
summers ago, with ratings down more than 20 percent from last year
(due largely to an increase in Jerry Springer's audience). Tuesday,
a tweaked ``Rosie'' will switch from WCVB-Ch.5 at 10 a.m. to
WBZ-Ch.4 at 4 p.m., which is Winfrey's time slot on Channel 5,
pitting the two daytime divas against each other for the crown in
this market. (WBZ's rights to the show actually begin Monday, but
it is showing US Open tennis that day, so it intends to show
Monday's show Tuesday at 3.)
</P>
<P>
   The show is a key part of WBZ's strategy to improve its local
news ratings, hoping that O'Donnell will pull more viewers to its 5
and 6 p.m. newscasts, which now trail channels 5 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Take away the numbers and the cutthroat nature of the TV
syndicate market, however, and you'll find a relative newcomer who
says she admires the matriarch Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, it appears, wears her title well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer not to be against her,'' O'Donnell said, ``not
because she is the reigning queen but because I really like her
show. I can't compete with somebody who inspired and continues to
inspire me.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was ``Oprah,'' in particular O'Donnell's first
visit, for a segment on female comedians, that drew attention to
the up-and-coming stand-up comic. O'Donnell appeared three times on
``Oprah'' before she had a show of her own. For many years,
O'Donnell hung in her office a photograph taken in 1987 of the two,
on which Winfrey had scribbled the message, ``I can't wait to see
how bright your star will shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her streetwise New York wit melded with an open-armed
cheeriness on her show, O'Donnell hasn't faded in the public eye.
Among her roles are stand-up comic, Rizzo (in a six-month Broadway
run of ``Grease''), movie actress, MC for the Tony Awards, and
single mother _ and she still is considered a woman of the people.
Her well-known crush on Tom Cruise, for instance, as well as her
affinity for kids have infused the talk-show host with ahuman
quality. ``When they see me at McDonald's, people don't seem to be
shocked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention her show's craft segment, which will become a
mainstay this year because of its popularity. The Long Island
native revealed she has her own ``craft room'' in her house and
likes to paint by number and build birdhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come and they go, `Whose room is this?' And I go, `It's
mine,''' O'Donnell said in her usual tough and brassy voice. ``I
don't know what they think _ that I live in a garage and only work
on cars on my day off?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell will loosen her show's format a bit this fall,
broadening the segments that seemed to have clinched her appeal
among her audience, many of them at-home parents. She'll be
interviewing youngsters for the Kids Chat segment, inspired by Art
Linkletter's ``Kids Say the Darndest Things.'' She'll also have
room for longer celebrity interviews and more human interest
stories.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that won't change on her show is her nicety. Even
with the crisis in the White House, offensive Clinton jokes will
remain off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it a show that your kid can watch and you don't
have to explain to them about stains on a dress,'' she said. ``I
try to make it an hour of escapism, an hour of TV that moms who are
at home can kick back and relax and not have to worry about the
ills of society.''
</P>
<P>
   As she points out, she's not really that nice off the show. Her
stand-up routines poke adult-humor fun at the president and O.J.
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's labeling her the queen of nice was ``only in direct
response to the show in relation to Jerry Springer,'' she
explained. ``When they were comparing me, the only other shows on
the air, except for Oprah, were downtrodden humiliation festivals,
not exactly a celebratory, nice atmosphere. I think, in comparison
to those shows, I am the queen of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Donnell went on the air in 1996, she naively suggested to
Warner Bros. that her show air in the hour before ``Oprah,''
O'Donnell recalled. ``That would be a great two-hour chunk for
people who are home to get some positive moments and some
spirituality and some humor all in one.'' She pauses. ``But that's
not how the syndication business works.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more competition is in the works, with other syndicated
talk shows hosted by Donny and Marie Osmond and by Roseanne coming
to TV this year.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at 36, O'Donnell has bigger challenges ahead. In three
years she turns 39, the age at which her mother died of breast
cancer. Losing her mother as a child, she said, has made her own
children _ Parker, 3, and Chelsea, nearly 1 _ the focus of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell (Parker) she died when I was 10, and he looks up in the
sky and says, `She's with God in heaven,''' O'Donnell said.
``Sometimes he waves. I go, `What are you doing?' He says, `I'm
waving to your mommy.' I say, `Aw, honey ...' He's a heartbreaker,
that kid.''

   She knows that being overweight will put her more at risk as a
candidate for breast cancer, so she has been consulting a physical
trainer to help her exercise regularly. The trainer has convinced
her to air her progress on the show as a way to inspire others and
motivate herself. ``39 is approaching,'' O'Donnell said. ``I want
to get myself into a more healthy approach to defy those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to see O'Donnell at the grocery store, wheeling
one of her kids in the shopping cart's kiddie seat. She has often
mentioned the food-shopping bit in other interviews, but she
insists that it's not to boast. ``Food shopping to me is not
writing it down on paper,'' she said. ``You have to go in the
aisles and see, is there a new cereal or _ look, there's new Oreo
Cereal!
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be credited with this, but people are always
shocked about it and I don't know why. I don't think there's
another choice for me to live.''

ALTERNATIVES TO DIVIDENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, September 7, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a divorced 67-year-old woman who's concerned about
making a wrong move investing. I need to supplement my Social
Security income of $550 a month. I have $60,000 I would like to
invest, and a further $10,000 that I will keep liquid. I have been
doing some research on no-load direct investing in individual
stocks. I've checked on Exxon Corp., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Texaco,
Home Depot, and Boston Edison. My major concern is that I need the
dividends to live on, or I'll use up my bank account. My money is
now making only 4.33 percent in a special savings account. I know I
can do better. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.G., Rochester Hills, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can certainly do better than 4.33 percent, but not
necessarily with a portfolio of the stocks you mention.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five issues you cite, the only one with a dividend stream
in excess of what you're now getting is Boston Edison, which is now
called BEC Energy. This stock has a current yield of 4.7 percent.
The others don't come close, with Texaco at 3.2 percent, Exxon at
2.4 percent, Procter &AMP; Gamble at 1.4 percent, and Home Depot at a
near-negligible 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All are well-established companies, with good prospects for
raising dividend levels in the future. But they are also companies
in the large-cap sector of the stock market _ the big national
companies whose shares have been among the driving forces in the
big gains in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   So while there's the positive prospect of dividends rising,
there's also the unpleasant prospect of your principal value
falling should the market take a further tumble.
</P>
<P>
   If you go in this direction, take only a modest step, perhaps
putting $10,000 in BEC Energy. By no-load investing I assume you
propose to buy a few shares through a broker and then enroll in the
company's dividend reinvestment plan, which in the case of BEC will
allow you to add up to $5,000 per quarter to your position.
</P>
<P>
   As for the additional $50,000, I would look for an investment
with a higher yield and lower risk. At the very conservative end of
the spectrum, you could pore over the nation's highest CD rates
(discussed in the next question) or look for one of the
better-yielding mutual fund money market accounts, where you will
find yields of 5.25 percent to 5.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you wanted to take on a little risk in exchange for a
still higher yield, you could look to a no-load mutual fund such as
Vanguard GNMA, which is yielding 6.44 percent as this is written.
</P>
<P>
   But you should understand a lot about such funds and their
risks. GNMA, or ``Ginnie Mae,'' funds invest in portfolios of
government- guaranteed mortgages. While there's no credit risk in
these investments, they are quite volatile when interest rates
change _ and even when people think interest rates may change.
</P>
<P>
   When interest rates rise, the share value of these funds falls,
sometimes substantially. The reverse happens in a falling
interest-rate climate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's going to be a bumpy ride. But the good news is
that the interest checks keep rolling in steadily. If you have the
patience to stay with such a fund for many years _ I'm talking
about a decade or more here _ you'll see it pay off in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   You should not put money in such an investment if you think you
might have to cash out at an inopportune time; invest only as much
as you're willing to leave there through thick or thin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I would move that last $10,000 into a mutual fund money
market, since this would give you the same liquidity as the bank
savings and a higher yield.
</P>
<P>
   If you took my most aggressive suggestion _ $10,000 in BEC
Energy, $50,000 in Vanguard GNMA, and $10,000 in a money market
fund _ you could expect a total annual yield of $4,215. That's
$1,184 more than you're now getting. This would bump your returns
up from the current 4.33 percent to an average portfolio yield of
6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where do you find a CD at 6 percent plus, such as you have
mentioned in recent columns?
</P>
<P>
   M.A., Chelsea, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Entering this week, one-year CDs with interest rates from 6
percent to 6.05 percent were available at Atlanta Internet Bank in
Georgia; Cross County Bank in Delaware; and Providian Bank in Utah.
Five-year CDs at the same institutions ranged from 6.35 percent to
6.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These figures, along with a number of other categories, are
available in the Sunday business section of The New York Times, and
are drawn from information supplied by Bank Rate Monitor and
Veribanc Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If you're investing a substantial amount of money, tracking
these can be rewarding, since the national average for one-year CDs
was 4.95 percent; for five-year CDs it was 5.23 percent. The
figures are published in the Consumer Rates feature, and include
toll-free telephone numbers of the institutions with the top rates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. No doubt some editorial shrinkage occurs in your columns that
affects my understanding. For example, take an attached column.
Since IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s, etc., started just before my
retiring, I have difficulty understanding how the conservative
gentleman in the article could amass nearly $1 million with the
limited contributions allowed. Could the GNMAs have possibly been
that good? Perhaps I missed something?
</P>
<P>
   A.G., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're certainly right that it would be tough to amass a $1
million IRA over a couple of decades simply by making the $2,000
maximum annual contributions. But you are also allowed to roll
qualified retirement plans over into an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at retirement many people are given an option of
taking annuity payments or a lump sum. If they chose the latter,
they roll the proceeds over into an IRA to avoid immediate
taxation. Such sums, of course, can be very substantial, and thus
account for the seven-figure IRAs that sometimes crop up in the
column.
</P>
<P>
   As a curiosity, I calculated what return would be necessary to
generate a $1 million IRA beginning in 1981 when the deductible IRA
was approved by Congress. Counting on nothing but regular $166.66
monthly contributions, the answer came out to 32.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I get information about the Stein Roe Young
Investor's fund? I am planning for a grandchild's college.
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Spurger, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can reach Stein Roe by calling 800-338-2550. It's an
excellent fund, and especially good as a gift to young investors
because of its excellent reports designed to be read and understood
by very young owners.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes most of its investments in companies that are
likely to interest younger investors _ Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, and
William Wrigley Jr. are among its top holdings, but so are FNMA and
Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an all-stock fund, it is most appropriate if
your grandchild is about 5 or younger. This is because you'll want
to give a stock fund at least 10 years to perform. If your
grandchild is 7 or older, you might want to consider a balanced
fund, which divides its investments between stocks and fixed-income
holdings.

LIEBERMAN SETS TONE FOR PRESIDENT'S PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6, 1998)  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Of course Joe Lieberman was right the other day,
so long as you understand that what the Connecticut
senator-moralist had to say was far more diagnostic than
prescriptive.
</P>
<P>
   Judging others is risky business, including in scripture, but
the proper course is therefore to judge conduct rather than people.
It should not be to excuse it in order to avoid playing God with
the person.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's contributions on the Senate floor extend well beyond
the application of a word, immoral, to President Clinton's sexual
encounters in the workplace with an intern less than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first serious words from a serious Democrat since
the president admitted that he had indeed had what the rest of us
would call sex with Monica Lewinsky and had lied in denying it
until cornered by facts and legal process.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's words stand in important contrast to those of
another New Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, who
pronounced her faith in Clinton shattered. Last week, I'm told, she
began the weekly private luncheon of Senate Democrats with a
lengthy tirade against the president for the damage he has done to
his party's prospects this year and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As such, what Feinstein said involved what Clinton's conduct
meant to her and by extension to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   What Lieberman discussed, beyond his own personal anger and
disappointment, was what Clinton's conduct as currently established
means to the country _ not to him, but to us, reaching the higher
plain on which responsible decisions about what to do can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's contribution was also personal in the best sense of
the word. Other than the president himself, there has been no more
articulate New Democrat in recent years, able to explain the
emerging ideology's critical marriage between opportunity and
personal responsibility. As fellow ex-presidents of the Democratic
Leadership Council, Clinton and Lieberman are not close friends,
but they go way back, to when Lieberman's first insurgency campaign
against a big shot state senator succeeded in 1970 with the
volunteer assistance of a certain student at the Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke for a lot of people last January, myself
included, when he said that he believed the president's clear and
explicit denials _ not merely of crimes but of the underlying
affair itself. He and others believed them both in the absence of
any direct evidence to the contrary and as the embodiment of the
presumption of innocence that should guide responsible people in a
tabloid culture whose abysmal standards blur the distinction
between fact and allegation.
</P>
<P>
   But that belief demands an outcry when one of the denials turns
out to have been not only false but intentionally so. And the
underlying conduct cannot be shielded by privacy. In addition to
close study of Lieberman's speech, Clinton would also learn much
from a stunning speech by Senator Edward Kennedy at Harvard seven
years ago as his own life was changing. In it, Kennedy, without
even acknowledging the tabloid culture, recognized how what may
seem private can become legitimately public.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to underscore how Lieberman built his comments
on the assumption that the Lewinsky matter is what we're talking
about here. Anything more, obviously, and the damage is mortal _
politically, legally, and morally.
</P>
<P>
   On that assumption, however, Lieberman constructed a wall
between his moral condemnation and such extreme steps as
impeachment hearings and resignation from office; he doesn't use
words like ``unjust and unwise'' lightly. He was also careful to
build another wall between ScandalRama as played around here and
the ``time and space'' the president must have to do his job and
for his sin to be both acknowledged as very serious yet seen and
judged in broader context.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in a critically important phrase that I didn't see
quoted anywhere in the press, he said that on the basis of the
basic facts as they are now known, what is called for is ``some
measure of public rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the impact of Lieberman's comments has been
considerable, both publicly and privately. In public, it has
overnight become the Democratic standard, a stance worthy of the
problem presented that is not self-centered or election-centered,
but country-centered.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, they have also served as a warning to partisan
Republicans that ``unjust and unwise'' responses that offend the
Constitution's high standards can also be opposed effectively from
principled ground.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, they have reached his pal, the president, as the
words of no other pol have. They can both help Clinton to overcome
his remaining, human problems with pique and denial, to then say
more to the country, and then to be in position to deal maturely
with a public rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   The report from Kenneth Starr must still be received; it must
contain no new bombs beyond whatever salacious sex details Starr
feels compelled to disclose; and Lieberman has no problem at all
with an accompanying White House refutation that is based on
evidence and law.
</P>
<P>
   But then, assuming that's it, it is time for trustworthy people
in both parties (aided by some new Clintonian ambassador) to settle
this case in a way that joins legitimate condemnation with
proportionate response.

REEBOK LOSES ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the high-stakes marketing bonanza of professional sports,
Reebok International Ltd. is again fighting to get what it paid
for.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it &UR;  &LR; spent $1.5 million for a product placement in the
popular movie Jerry McGuire, only to see the spot fall to the
cutting room floor. Reebok's suit was settled out of court. In
1992, the Reebok Vector appeared on the US basketball team's
warm-ups, but the US Olympic Committee permitted players who had
contracts with Reebok's competitiors to cover up the logo. &UR;  &LR; Reebok
officials are still fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Reebok's marketing coup of securing the endorsement of
tennis star Venus Williams was diminished on the world stage of the
US Open in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took the court Thursday wearing the logo of another
company _ in clear violation of Reebok's exclusive contract with
her, one that industry observers value at $2 million. She had
little choice. Williams faced major fines if she did not wear the
logo of the tournament's sponsors, the Canadian software
manufacturer Corel Corp. and the Women's Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   While Reebok's Vector still appears on her outfits, the
company's investment in exclusivity has been diluted. To the casual
observer, that may seem trivial. But in the highly competitive
world of sports endorsements, exclusivity is paramount. This is
especially so at the US Open, where players under contract with
Reebok's archrivals, Nike and Adidas, do not have to wear the
additional logo because their endorsement deals were signed before
Corel became a tournament sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It some respects, this harkens back to the '92 Olympics when
we outfitted the basketball players _ the Dream Team _ and the US
Olympic Committee decided they could cover up the logo at the
awards ceremony,'' said David Fogelson, Reebok's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is described by sports marketing experts as among the
most desireable athletes currently available to companies seeking
to burnish their brand names by attaching them to rising stars. The
great demand for her is magnified by the fact that her father,
Richard, her coach and manager, has forestalled major business
deals in the hope of keeping Venus and her sister Serena focused on
their tennis skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a hot property,'' said Bob Williams president of Burns
Sports, in Chicago. ``They've been very slow to accept any deals at
all and Reebok did tremendously well to sign her.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams' contract with Reebok requires her, in effect, to
wear only its logo. Her contract, according to Fogelson, states
that she may wear other logos only when she wears outfits with
sleeves &UR; .  &LR; But Williams has no other endorsement agreements, and
her seven US Open outfits, supplied by Reebok, are all sleeveless.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at the US Open, Williams was required by the
Women's Tennis Association to wear the Corel/WTA logo. Industry
sources say Corel paid $4 million for the deal, which expires at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in the face of fines threatened by the WTA _ and at
risk of creating a controversy that might overshadow her play _ she
wore the Corel/WTA logo on the left shoulder strap of a stunning
lime-green tennis outfit. As Williams moved about the court, in
taped clips of her performance and in photographs moved by the
print media covering the event, the Corel/WTA logo appears in sharp
contrast with the distinctive Reebok Vector.
</P>
<P>
   According to WTA officials, because agreements between Nike and
Adidas predate the WTA's agreement with Corel, the Women's Tennis
Association has allowed other stars _ like Steffi Graf, Monica
Seles and Martina Hingis, to name a few _ to play without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the concern, and this is a major issue for us,
going forward,'' said Joseph Favorito, director of communications
for the WTA, who said the tour has recently talked to Adidas and
FILA about the situation, and will sit down at the US Open next
week with officials from Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tour will name a new title sponsor next year,
Favorito said, ``it is a good time to deal with this situation once
and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Reebok, Fogelson said what Williams wears along with the
rest of the five outfits Reebok has designed for the rest of the
tournament is entirely up to her. The company appears to have made
its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't seek to make an issue out of it, the WTA did when
they went to Venus and Richard (Williams) and said they were going
to be fined,'' Fogelson said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Venus, she said in her post-match interview Thursday that
the brouhaha had not been a distraction. Would she continue wearing
the Corel/WTA patch, she was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``You all have to talk to Reebok,'' she said.

COUNTER INFLATION BY ADDING MORE TO RETIREMENT POOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 47 years old and we wish to retire at
age 65 with a monthly income stream of $4,600. Our projected
monthly income from Social Security will be $2,000. Our investments
consist of these IRAs: $24,516 in Vanguard Index 500, $8,259 in
Vanguard Balanced Index, $8,940 in Vanguard Equity Income fund,
$22,957 in MFS Emerging Growth, and $37,324 in MFS Investors Trust
funds. We also have a $10,000 taxable CD. Is our portfolio properly
diversified, and how much should we save monthly to achieve our
future goal?
</P>
<P>
   J.T., Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At first blush, it appears that you wouldn't need to add
anything. If we project 10 percent average annual portfolio growth
-- and despite the horrors of the markers in the last week, that
still seems to me to be a reasonable long-term assumption -- your
pool would reach $622,727 over the course of the next 18 years.
That would be more than enough to be reinvested in fixed-income
holdings and produce the desired income.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, all of that is before considering inflation. Let's assume
that over the years the Social Security payments will be adjusted
to reflect the effects of inflation, so that means what you'll be
looking for is the equivalent of $2,600 monthly in today's buying
power, or the equivalent of $31,200 a year. If we project future
inflation at 3 percent, that would require a $53,115 annual income
stream; at 4 percent, the number jumps to $63,205.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, in addition to an income stream in retirement, you'll
want to have some additional funds invested to counter the effects
of inflation in the later years of retirement. So from my point of
view, to be comfortably on track toward a secure retirement, the
goal should be somewhere north of $1 million. To achieve a $1
million pool over the next 18 years would require monthly additions
of $659 to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio, it seems solid enough. I can't find a fund
called MFS Investor's Trust; perhaps that's only a part of the
name? But if this is a fund which is largely dominated by large-cap
stocks, I think you would want just a bit more diversification,
since MFS Emerging Growth would then be the only holding outside
the large-cap arena. If it was my portfolio, I'd establish 10
percent positions in a health care sector fund, and in a small cap
fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am an older woman, aged 80, and I have been getting by with
CDs. But with interest rates going down and my rent going up, I
could use a little extra income. I have a fairly large CD coming
due and I would like to put a little of it -- maybe $10,000 -- to
generate a little more money for rent increases and living
expenses. I have a friend who has money in Salomon Brothers Fund. I
don't know exactly what it is, but she has got more than 16 percent
interest. It must be a managed fund, and it has to be bought
through a brokerage firm. I also enclose a flier I got in the mail
from Atlas Balanced fund. What do you think of that?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., La Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I would give both of these suggestions a pass.
Salomon Brothers Fund is a closed-end fund, which means it's a fund
with shares traded on the New York Stock exchange rather than
through direct purchases and/or sales by the fund company. That
means that when people are leery of stocks -- which constitute
almost all of the assets of this fund -- the shares will tend to
bring less than their inherent value. Entering this week, they sold
at an 11.49 percent discount from net asset value. Moreover, that
16 percent wasn't exactly interest -- it represents the amount paid
out in a combination of dividend and capital gains distributions in
the past year. With stock funds, the lion's share of such
distributions represent capital gains, and these are factors you
can't count on -- some years, when the markets are sour, there may
be none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Balanced, a small and relatively new fund, divides its
assets among stocks and bonds, but again, it's the stocks that give
it the kick in strong markets, or which can give you a kick you in
the pants when the markets go bad. The statistics in the brochure
look nice, but they don't reflect a lot of current history:
According to Lipper Analytical Services, the two Atlas Balanced
funds produced year-to-date returns of 1.91 percent and 1.52
percent through Aug. 28. (There are two classes of funds, with
different sales charges, and accordingly with different results.)
Anyway, the bottom line is that these investments might do great
things for you, but they might also produce little income and even
losses. You can't pay the rent on that. The only kind of funds that
might be attractive to a person in your situation would be
something like a Ginnie Mae fund, which is one that invests in
government-backed mortgages. But the best you could except from
such a fund is an income stream of about 6.5 percent, which would
mean $650 a year income on a $10,000 investment. Entering this
week, the nation's best rates on one-year CDs are slightly higher
than 6 percent. The question I'd ask you is whether an extra $4.16
a month is sufficient to warrant the additional trouble, and
sufficient to offset the additional risk? For most people, I think,
the answer would be no.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a single 35-year-old female. I purchased a home in 1990,
and suddenly became disabled in 1995. I now have an income of only
$1,300 per month. I have these IRAs: $18,000 in Vanguard Index
Value, $14,000 in Vanguard Health Care, $11,000 in Vanguard Index
500, $12,000 in Vanguard Wellington, and $6,300 in Vanguard
Wellesley. I also have taxable accounts of $3,000 each in Vanguard
Windsor II and Health Care, and a $7,000 money market account. What
do you suggest I now do, since I have such a low income. Are my
present investments wise. If not, where might I do better?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., La Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the IRA portfolio has been well established, by and
large -- provided that you expect to allow the accounts to grow for
many years. As a disabled person, you can qualify for early
withdrawals without penalty (although you would still have to pay
the taxes on the withdrawals). If you think it's likely that you
will have to call on some of this money in the relatively near term
-- by which I mean a significant level of withdrawals in the course
of the next decade -- I think I would look to move to a more
conservative balance. This would begin with a reduction of the
Health Care position, which now constitutes 22.1 percent of the IRA
portfolio and a whisker more of your total savings. That's a high
level for a sector fund, and while these positions are likely to be
the strongest for you over the course of many years, they also
represent the riskiest part of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore unless you're confident that you're likely to leave
the IRA accounts alone for 10 to 15 years or even longer, I would
reduce the Health Care position in the IRA to about $6,300, or 10
percent of the total portfolio. If you think you're likely to be
making withdrawals in the near future, you might do well to move
the money that came out of Health Care into Vanguard GNMA; if you
think there's a possibility of some intermediate-term withdrawals
but you don't know when they're likely to come, I suggest you put
the money into Vanguard Wellington until the time comes when you
anticipate withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other accounts, my guess based upon your limited
income is that your crying need is a steady stream of cash. Both
for that reason, and because of the risk element in the two stock
funds, I suggest that both the Health Care and Windsor II positions
be sold, with the proceeds going into Vanguard GNMA. If you
achieved a 6.5 precedent yield there and 5 percent returns from
your money fund, the yields on these two investments would add a
little more than $60 a month to your income stream.

OPPOSITION FORCES GIRD FOR CRITICAL STRUGGLE IN MEXICAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILPANCINGO, Mexico _ With gubernatorial elections scheduled in
the southeastern state of Guerrero next February, things seem
headed for a crucial confrontation _ electoral if possible, armed
if need be.
</P>
<P>
   The election likely will be decided between Guerrero's two
dominant political parties: the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and the center-left Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   While the PRI has ruled Mexico's third-poorest state like a
corrupt political fiefdom for the past 70 years, the PRD has
chipped away at the PRI's hegemony since the opposition party was
founded 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Saul Lopez, who heads the PRD contingent in the
Guerrero state legislature, it's time for a real change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you that whatever happens, we will win. People
are fed up with the PRI. If they (PRI) try to steal the election,
it will blow up in their face,'' he said. ``The options are clear:
either the PRD wins, or there will be war. That's not blackmail,
that is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   With a growing leftist guerrilla movement now operating in the
Guerreran countryside, Lopez's boast is not idle.
</P>
<P>
   While he does not predict a PRD victory, Florencio Salazar Adame
agrees that the PRI can no longer wield the ruthlessness it used
to.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar _ who heads the PRI faction in the legislature _ wants
to build a kinder, gentler PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of crushing the opposition, using brute force at times,
Salazar says it is time to learn to live with the PRD and even to
begin negotiations with the guerrillas now attacking police
stations and army troops throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar hopes to win his party's gubernatorial candidacy for
February's elections over hard-line, traditional PRI elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to a renovative current within the Guerrero PRI,'' he
said. ``We are not tied to caciques, political cliques or economic
interests. We want transparency within the government,'' he said.
Caciques are rural PRI political bosses, often with the power of
life and death over peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant changes being made within the PRI, and
that is good. I think we are living in a delicate situation,
because if the elections are not completely transparent, things are
ripe for an explosion of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific coastal states of Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas are
Mexico's poorest and home to the country's two active insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista National Liberation Army has been locked in a
seemingly endless peace process with the Mexican government since
the insurgents attacked four Chiapan cities in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca and Guerrero are the back yard of the Popular
Revolutionary Army (EPR) and its recently announced offshoot, the
Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People (ERPI).
</P>
<P>
   The EPR went public in June 1996 on the first anniversary of the
massacre of 18 unarmed peasants who were killed by the Guerrero
state police. In August 1996, the EPR launched a coordinated attack
on army barracks and police stations in Oaxaca and Guerrero, in
which dozens of police officers, troops and guerrillas died.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Mexican army surrounded a platoon of guerrillas in
a village schoolhouse in El Charco, southeast of Chilpancingo,
killing 12 and arrested several more.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the ERPI announced it had split from the EPR,
which was considered bureaucratic, centralized and docile. The ERPI
claimed to have taken with it virtually the entire EPR organization
in Guerrero and planned to boost the pace of action.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh round of attacks on the police and soldiers throughout
Guerrero in recent months suggests the ERPI is serious.
</P>
<P>
   David Spencer, writing in the August issue of Jane's
Intelligence Review, said the guerrilla violence in Guerrero's
countryside has reached levels ``that have not been seen since the
beginning of the conflict'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero is a perennially poor and restive state that has
nurtured rebellion since its namesake, Vicente Guerrero, helped
launch Mexico's war of independence from Spain in the early 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Acapulco is Guerrero's economic motor and home to nearly
one-third of its population. In contrast to the glitter of the
tourist hotels lining the beach, most of the rest of the state
lives in abject poverty or relies on subsistence farming or growing
copra, dried coconut meat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 percent of the state's people are illiterate;
nearly 50 percent of the children show some signs of malnutrition.
Crime is rampant and more than 620 activists from peasant
organizations, student groups and opposition political parties like
the PRD have been killed in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Years of heavy-handed, corrupt rule in Guerrero have bred a deep
cynicism among many here toward the PRI. Many more have lost faith
in electoral politics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   PRI politicians will never change, asserted Maximo Gomez Munoz,
a parish priest from Atoyac who can quote Karl Marx as well
scripture and is known informally as the guerrilla priest.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Salazar wanted to reform the Guerrero PRI, Gomez said
flatly: ``It's a lie. Until they resolve the peasant situation
here, it must be a lie. What they want is to keep peasants
dependent on the state to maintain their power.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the PRD wins in Guerrero in February, Gomez said,
unless the PRD also wins the Mexican presidency in 2000, real
change will be frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be violence if the February elections return PRI
hard-liners to the Guerrero governor's mansion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Gomez said. ``The people have never been violent,
it's always been the government. It's time they decided to defend
themselves.''

AUGUST GAMES ARE A CLASSIC WASTE OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the college football season opened last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there was only a handful of games, most of them assorted
``classics,'' such as the Pigskin and Kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   They were also games in August, which count on regular-season
records, albeit with an asterisk attached, since they are
``exemption'' games.
</P>
<P>
   Again in case you missed it, here's what happened. Nebraska beat
Louisiana Tech, Colorado State beat Michigan State, Southern
California beat Purdue, and Florida State beat Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the real news. The official opening of the 1998
college football season will occur Saturday _ in September, not in
August.
</P>
<P>
   A season that some administrators argue is already too long has
been stretched even longer by the glut of preseason games. First
there was one, then there were two. This year the number rose to
four, which is four too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone is going to have them, we ought to have a 12-game
schedule,'' said Florida State coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they are played to aid good causes, such as the coaches' and
athletic directors' pension funds and the Black Coaches
Association. But the risk-reward issue is way out of whack here.
Ask Nebraska first-year coach Frank Solich how he felt when he saw
his new quarterback, Bobby Newcombe, go down with what could have
been a serious knee injury against Louisiana Tech. Or ask Bowden
how he felt when he saw All-America wide receiver Peter Warrick go
down with a leg injury in Monday's Kickoff Classic. Ask Michigan
State coach Nick Saban and Purdue coach Joe Tiller how they feel
about being 0-1 before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and losses are part of football. But college football
in August should not be a part of the landscape, just as college
football on Monday and Thursday nights should not be part of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new multimillion-dollar extravaganza known as the
Bowl Championship Series in place this season; with ABC controlling
all four of those bowls and dictating that bowl games will now be
played after the traditional Jan. 1 end of the season, why not play
in August?
</P>
<P>
   Why not play in June or July then? Why not play on Sunday,
Monday, and Thursday nights?
</P>
<P>
   Greed is the motivating factor. There are bigger ratings in
prime time than on a Saturday afternoon. ABC has a Monday night
football package it wants to sell, so why not tack on a college
game in August and one in January as part of the deal?
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the same college presidents and officials who
argue that a Division 1-A football playoff would make the season
too long were strangely silent about the issue of adding games and
playing them on different nights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But now legislation is on the books which will eliminate these
preseason games in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens. If the season is going to get longer, extend it
with meaningful postseason games that will determine a national
champion rather than with meaningless and dangerous exhibition
games in August that are forgotten almost as quickly as they are
played.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Irish Rose?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Notre Dame has yet to play a game, here's one thing you
can guarantee. If the Irish win enough games to get into the BCS
(nine will probably do it), they will almost certainly be heading
to Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Jan. 1 as long as there is a slot
open.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rose Bowl resisted joining the Bowl Alliance for
years, fearful of losing its guaranteed draw of a Big
Ten/Pacific-10 matchup, it has also lusted after Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   So write it down as a mortal lock right now. If Notre Dame has
enough wins to become eligible for the BCS and either the Pac-10 or
Big Ten champion makes it to the national championship game in the
Fiesta Bowl, Notre Dame will play in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A prevent defense
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd of more than 65,000 expected for Saturday
night's game at West Virginia against Ohio State, Mountaineer
officials have beefed up security to an all-time high, with dozens
of law enforcement officers from local, county, and state agencies
making sure everything goes smoothly. The game against the No. 1
Buckeyes is being called the biggest in West Virginia history ...
It's still too early, but Colorado State's win over Michigan State
last week has some people projecting CSU to go 14-0. Fiesta Bowl
officials would squirm if a marquee team like Florida State or Ohio
State is left out of the game because of the new selection process,
which puts a heavy emphasis on number of victories ... Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch has taken out a $3 million injury insurance
policy. Couch, who some feel is the best quarterback in college
football, had a $1 million policy last season ... If you are
wondering why some people are skeptical of Kansas State, check out
its nonconference schedule, which includes Indiana State, Northern
Illinois, and Northeast Louisiana ... Penn State coach Joe Paterno
starts his quest for win No. 300 Saturday when the Nittany Lions
play Southern Mississippi in their opener. A win _ and that's
hardly a sure thing _ would mean Paterno would get the milestone
next week against Bowling Green ... Notre Dame has an interesting
first month of the season. The Irish open Saturday at home against
Michigan and then play Michigan State, Purdue, and Stanford, all of
which beat them last season, as did Michigan ... West Virginia
could become the first Big East team to finish in the Top 5 since
Miami in 1992. Beating Ohio State Saturday would go a long way
toward achieving that goal ... Oklahoma, once a football
powerhouse, could be in for an unprecedented fifth consecutive
losing season ... Houston, which once made a habit of playing its
home games in the dreary Astrodome, will play all of its home
gamees on campus for the first time since 1949. Wonder if new
athletic director Chet Gladchuk had anything to do with that ...
How would you like to be a Rice fan? The Owls have gone 7-4 the
past two seasons _ which is great for them _ and didn't even go to
a bowl game ... Rutgers is 0-0 and has already lost. Both starting
wide receivers are out for the season with injuries. With a 2-20
record the last two years, coach Terry Shea may not be around much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Encouraging? Naturally
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a good trend in college football. According to an NCAA
survey, of the 112 Division 1-A schools, 73 are now playing on
natural grass surfaces ... Texas Christian has backed out of a
three-game series with Nebraska. Why? The Frogs don't think they
can compete with the Huskers. Normally, such a breach of contract
would warrant a $100,000 penalty, but Nebraska athletic director
Bill Byrne waived the fee. TCU officials say they hope to get
Nebraska back on their schedule when they are more competitive ...
There are fans and then there are fans. But who's going to top
Southern California follower Giles Pellerin, who is 91 years old
and has seen 787 consecutive Trojan games, home and away, since
1926? Pellerin has seen everey UCLA-USC and every Notre Dame-USC
game ever played, as well as all 26 of the Trojans' Rose Bowl
appearances ... New USC coach Paul Hackett broke a precedent with
the win over Purdue. The last six USC coaches had lost their
debuts.

MAYE SET TO GO AFTER A LONG WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ When he set out from his home in Valley Cottage,
N.Y., to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, Brian Maye
could not stop worrying about the delicate neck surgery he faced on
that cold morning of Jan. 26. As he and his father, William, made
the 6 a.m. drive down the Palisades Parkway, Maye's fear and
anxiety mounted with each mile that brought them closer to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how tightly he shut his eyes and his heart to it all,
Maye could not escape the lingering image of what his doctors were
prepared to do to him.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind's eye, Maye could see the scalpel slicing into his
flesh, drawing a bead 2 inches long across the base of his neck ...
doctors poring over the opening in his neck to remove a damaged
cervical disk ... the insertion of an anonymous donor's disk,
withdrawn from a bone bank ... and the cervical fusion of bone and
metal plate, surrounded by a protective metal cage.
</P>
<P>
   Maye shuddered at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   How could he go through with it?
</P>
<P>
   He had already been through so much as a linebacker at Boston
College. A knee injury in the third game of the 1995 season against
Michigan truncated his junior year, though he received an extra
year of eligibility as consolation. A dislocated elbow in the
eighth game of the 1996 season prematurely ended what was supposed
to be his redshirt junior campaign. And just when it appeared
things couldn't get any worse for him, Maye was one of 13 players
implicated in a gambling scandal and suspended for the final three
games of '96.
</P>
<P>
   Declared ineligbile by the NCAA for four additional games at the
start of the 1997 season _ the stiffest suspension served by any of
the five BC players allowed to return to the team _ Maye was set to
make his comeback for his fifth year of eligibility last Oct. 4
against Georgia Tech. Because of the lingering disk problem, Maye
sat out the season but was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility
by the NCAA as a medical redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if neck surgery was too steep a price to pay in
order to play for the Eagles again. After he tossed and turned the
night before, Maye realized on the ride to the hospital that he
wasn't prepared to go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad,'' Maye told his father, ``turn the car around.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Maye did. For the next two weeks, Brian sought his
family's counsel on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all just said to make sure it's something you want to do
and you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself,'' Maye said.
``But I just couldn't live with the decision. I just said, `I'm not
going to beat myself up for the rest of my life by not coming
back.' So, yeah, I'm glad I made my decision, you know _ or
reversed my decision, I should say _ to have surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, Maye began his long journey back by riding to the
hospital and undergoing neck surgery. Successful neck surgery. It
has enabled Maye to don his No. 46 jersey for full-contact
preseason workouts. He will make his first start in two years as
the middle linebacker in Saturday's season opener at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it ironic? Not necessarily. I just look at it as the first
game I've played in a while,'' said Maye, who will finally start
against the Yellow Jackets after all. ``I don't see any irony in
the year before. I'm just going to treat it as any first game of
the season, but this one will just be bittersweet to get back on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be emotional,'' he added. ``It's not like
I'm going to get choked up or something before the game. It's just
nice to be back playing, you know? It's been kind of of a long
journey to get where I am right now. So everything culminates on
Saturday when I go out there for the first play.''
</P>
<P>
   The way BC coach Tom O'Brien figures it, Maye has ``had so much
bad luck there's going to be nothing but good luck for him this
fall.'' Maye certainly hopes that will be the case, but he doesn't
necessarily believe his luck has been all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been lucky in some regards,'' said Maye, who was
voted a cocaptain by his teammates. ``When you put things in
perspective, then you don't feel sorry for yourself at all. I've
had some bad luck, but I could be a lot worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   What could possibly be worse? ``A hell of a lot, man; just look
around,'' he said. ``I'm happy, you know? I'm here and I'm playing
and I've got a second chance. I had successful surgery and I'm back
here with a lot of guys I enjoy being with and playing the game
that I love to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to come back was really tough,'' he added. ``Did
I want this enough to go through neck surgery, (wearing) a neck
brace for a couple of months, then rehab and'' _ he broke into a
chuckle _ ``all the `sixth-year' jokes?''
</P>
<P>
   Maye has heard them all. Yadda, yadda, yadda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (BC trainer) Steve Bushee gets in one a week on him,''
said senior running back Mike Cloud. ``After practice, Bush-man
comes in and says, `Freshmen report for treatment at 7:30.
Upperclassmen report at 8. And our sixth-year player reports at
8:30.' It's just jokes like that. Some people call him the
`player-slash-coach' because he's so old. There's another joke,
people say, `By the time he graduates, he'll be coaching his
kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Don McPherson spoke to the team recently during preseason
camp, O'Brien introduced him as a former Syracuse quarterback who
started for the Orangemen in 1987 and joked, ``Brian, you probably
played against him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say it in a witty way, there's some that are funny,''
said Maye, one of four 23-year-old players on the team. ``But if
it's just like `Blah, blah, blah _ what are you, like, 35 years
old?' That's not funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Maye just shrugs it off now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' he said, ``but like (Scott) Mutryn said the
other day in the paper. He was saying when you give up football,
you give up your youth almost. I just thought how it was so true. I
mean, I figure if I'm not sitting here talking to you right now,
I'm probably in a suit and tie commuting into the city. Now I'll be
playing football and having fun. This was where I was hoping to be
after making the decision. It took me two weeks (after the initial
reversal), but it was a solid decision. And so when we went back to
the hospital, there was no turning back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Or now.

HE'S TOAST OF ST. LOUIS, BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Anthony's Bar sits diagonally across the street from
Busch Stadium, and there is a big red ``59'' sitting in the front
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been putting those numbers up there since 45,'' reports Mike
the Bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to St. Louis, ground zero for the assault on Roger
Maris's record.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Farnen, Steve Melnick, and Bernie Plassmeyer are sitting at
the bar, nursing their Buds. And well they should, because each of
them draws a paycheck from the King of Beers. They all work in that
nebulous world where sales, advertising, and marketing mix, and
they are celebrating the end of another working day doing what they
always seem to be doing these days. They are talking about Topic A,
and in these parts, that does not mean the over/under on how many
days Yeltsin can hold on to his job or the dollar damage attributed
to Hurricane Earl. You know darn well what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Opening Day?'' Farnen is saying. ``Remember in the
ninth inning when (Delino) DeShields was up and the crowd was
begging him not to swing, praying he'd walk so Mark would get up
with the bases loaded? Remember how they cheered when he drew that
walk? And then Mark did it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a box with 30 or 40 people,'' adds Plassmeyer, ``and
when he hit that ball, everyone rushed forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you a bit on the obtuse side, Mark McGwire got off
to an appropriate start in 1998 by hitting a ninth-inning
game-winning grand slam on Opening Day to beat the Dodgers. And
now, 58 home runs later, he is on the verge of zooming past Maris,
perhaps putting the home run record well into the 60s. And these
good baseball fans are having a hard time digesting it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to do it,'' says Melnick. ``We all know that. The
question is, will people care what happens after he hits 62?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, they will,'' declares Farnen. ``That last ball will be
the record. It will be very valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Osantowski needs to be heard. He's a lawyer from Detroit
whose business is concluded but who can't get out of town until
Saturday because of the Northwest Airlines strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a baseball fan, but not so much since the
strike,'' he says. ``But I'm following this. And I can tell you
that there is a resurgence of baseball interest in Detroit because
of this, and only this. You listen to talk radio and that's all
they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the interest is off the scale. The story is Mark
McGwire. The Cardinals won, 14-4, Wednesday night. Pitcher Kent
Mercker hit a grand slam. Nobody cared. The only two at-bats that
mattered were McGwire's last two, when he hit a pair of
out-of-the-strike-zone baseballs a total of more than 900 feet for
home runs No. 58 and 59, leaving him two shy of Maris's record set
in 1961. He is now a good two weeks ahead of schedule. A five-game
homestand _ three with Cincinnati and two with Chicago and You Know
Who _ began Friday night (Sept. 4), and it is not inconceivable
that McGwire, who has hit six home runs in his last eight games and
four in his last two, could have the record by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game is incidental to the McGwire at-bats. The Cardinals are
20 1/2 games behind the Astros in the National League Central. The
games are nothing more than an excuse for McGwire to get his rips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the last time we cared about who won or lost was a
while back when we had a doubleheader with the Mets,'' Farnen says.
``If the Cards had won, they'd be 5 1/2 back in the wild-card race.
But they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now who cares? What's going on here is food for the soul of any
legitimate baseball fan, and every member of this Budweiser Trio
says he qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are good baseball fans,'' maintains Farnen. ``Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' assures Melnick. ``We've suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid,'' says Plassmeyer by way of validation, ``I
caught a foul ball hit by Darrell Porter.''
</P>
<P>
   They can hardly believe you can have this much fun when your
team is 20 1/2 games out of first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fantastic,'' says Farnen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three reasons why this is so great,'' offers
Melnick. ``One, it's history. Two, the fact that he hits them so
far. And three, (Sammy) Sosa is still so close to him (with 56
homers). It's a real race. That really adds to the drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Cubs slugger, Farnen conjures up a sick scenario
that suggests he might have been a Red Sox fan in another life.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this?'' he begins. ``You know that McGwire hasn't
hit one this year against Cincinnati. So Sosa keeps up. Then he
comes in here on Monday and Tuesday, tied at 60, and there's the
Cardinal pitching _ Jeff Brantley! _ and those guys let Big Mac
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion gets hooted down and the boys return to the general
business of praising McGwire and toasting baseball, St. Louis, and,
of course, the mother ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more thing,'' says Farnen as he heads out the door. ``This
sure is helping Budweiser.''

IN '61, MARIS GOT THE RECORD _ AND LOTS OF ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Roger Maris were alive today, he might be smiling. Happy that
a record that has hung around his neck like an albatross since 1961
might soon belong to someone else. Grateful that by relinquishing
it, he could be judged strictly by what he accomplished in a
12-year career. And the heck with the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   When Maris died in December 1985, it was generally assumed that
his record of 61 home runs in a season was unsurpassable _ just as
Babe Ruth's record of 60 had been considered unassailable when he
set it 34 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, thanks to a rush by Mark McGwire, the home run feats of
both Ruth and Maris are on the verge of being obliterated. The
Cardinal slugger has 59 going into a Labor Day weekend series in
St. Louis against Cincinnati. And right behind him is Sammy Sosa of
the Cubs with 56.
</P>
<P>
   It's exciting. And it's also a lot different from the home run
chase by Maris and Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle (who wound up with
54) in 1961. One obvious difference is that the fans have embraced
both McGwire and Sosa, who are drawing adoring crowds and
transfixed TV audiences wherever they perform.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like this in 1961 when 27-year-old Roger Maris came
out of the pack and wound up hitting his 61st homer in the season's
162d and final game, one more than Ruth had hit in a 154-game
season.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the 6-foot, 203-pound Maris suspect that he would be
tormented by a hostile media, unforgiving fans who conisdered him
an unworthy successor to the Babe, and a commissioner more
concerned about protecting his good friend than acknowledging
baseball history. Maris was caught in the crossfire, and his epic
quest became an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a people's choice to break Ruth's mark, it was
Mantle, the sublime center fielder who was in the midst of a Hall
of Fame career. Maris was dismissed as the interloper, despite the
fact that he was on the way to his second straight American League
MVP Award and would go on to make seven World Series and All-Star
Game appearances.
</P>
<P>
   If Mantle and his fans weren't enough of an obstacle, there was
commissioner Ford Frick, an old crony of Ruth's. On July 19, 1961,
Frick declared that unless Ruth's record were equaled or surpassed
in 154 games, any mark achieved in the remaining eight games added
because of expansion would be accompanied by an asterisk. Maris had
58 homers after 154 games and did not get No. 60 until Game 158.
</P>
<P>
   His 61st, off Red Sox rookie righthander Tracy Stallard,
provided the only offense in a 1-0 Yankee victory. Maris celebrated
at the time, but that didn't obscure the anxiety and vilification
he had endured, graphically manifested in a dramatic loss of hair.
In fact, he never received his due. He went to his grave with that
cursed asterisk compromising his place in the record book _ it
finally was removed in 1991 by commissioner Fay Vincent, long after
it could do Roger Maris any good.
</P>
<P>
   Maris's life might have turned out differently if he'd followed
another path out of Fargo, N.D., where he grew up. An all-state
halfback in football, he was courted by the University of Oklahoma.
But once there, he changed his mind and returned home. Baseball was
his true love, and he excelled at the American Legion level. That
earned him a tryout with the Cleveland Indians. Maris eventually
signed for a $5,000 bonus and a promise that he would get $10,000
more.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly, according to one source, he became a player who
would not blend into the crowd. In his first minor league camp, he
refused assignment to Class D but said he would accept a spot in
Class C _ with Fargo. Maris eventually got his way and responded by
hitting .325 with nine homers. Then came another stormy battle as
he argued for _ and received _ promotion to Class B. At the age of
22, he was in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland and Kansas City, his first two major league
clubs, Maris was at best considered a prospect. He lasted only a
year and a half in Cleveland; ditto with the Athletics, who many
suspected of being tantamount to a Yankee farm club. Whatever the
reason, the Yankees took note of Maris's power _ 28 homers with
Cleveland and KC in '58 _ and acquired him after the 1959 season
for first baseman Kent Hadley and shortstop Joe DeMaestri.
</P>
<P>
   Maris arrived in New York with a flourish, hitting 39 homers
with 112 RBIs as he led the Yankees to their 10th pennant in 12
years under Casey Stengel, a performance that earned the right
fielder MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Maris's improbable quest for immortality was the centerpiece on
a team that won 109 games, cruised to another pennant, and bashed a
record 240 homers in the process. The lineup included bona fide
sluggers like Moose Skowron, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, and John
Blanchard. But all paled next to the M&AMP;M Boys, Maris and Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   They waged a personal _ and historic _ battle, exploiting the
diluted pitching that was the byproduct of the addition of two
expansion teams, as is the case with McGwire and Sosa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The season began inauspiciously for Maris. After 10 games,
according to Mantle's account to writer Mickey Herskowitz, Maris
was hitting .161. He was struggling, and by April 26, Mantle was
ahead in home runs, 7-1. But a trip to an eye doctor seemed to work
wonders. By mid-July, Mantle's lead had been cut to two, 35-33, and
the M&AMP;M Boys then took turns at the top.
</P>
<P>
   As the season wore on, so did the pressure. The media horde
grew, though not nearly to the dimensions of the McGwire-Sosa
legions. By Sept. 13, Maris was ahead, 56-53, and everybody figured
it would be a dogfight to the finish. But Mantle was forced out by
a hip injury and dropped out of the derby. The spotlight was solely
on Maris. There was now no peace for him. In contrast to the
outgoing, fun-loving Mantle, he was shy, virtually colorless _ in
fact, there were rumors of a rift between the two even though they
were roommates. There was no question as to which side the publc
took. Maris was booed by Yankee fans, which deeply hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was there every day,'' recalls Jack Lang, former
baseball writer for the Long Island Daily Press, who covered the
Yankees. ``From the fans who would cheer for Mantle to the writers
who might be in the clubhouse asking questions for an hour after
the game ... Maris wasn't too fond of this, but I can think of only
one time when he wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Fishel, who was the Yankee public relations man at time,
said to me that in retrospect, he should have protected Roger more.
But it was 1961. It was different. There weren't the national media
or the cameras around. Columnists came early. Players stayed and
answered questions until the writers left.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resentment toward Maris was intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were letters that said Maris shouldn't even be mentioned
in the same breath with Ruth,'' says Lang. ``It's funny. Almost
nobody was pulling for Maris. But everybody is pulling for McGwire
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantle said in his book, ``All My Octobers,'' that Maris was not
prepared for the fame that came with the record chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came almost overnight to Roger, who never wanted to be a
special person,'' wrote Mantle. ``No player ever accomplished so
much and enjoyed it so little. As he closed in on the record, the
buildup engulfed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was uncomfortable in the spotlight. While Ruth had reveled
in it, he was too nervous to enjoy the cheers and unable to ignore
the boos that came when the cheering stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris had his own definition of trouble, Mantle wrote. ``He said
trouble meant the reporters who were coming in waves, the strangers
who wouldn't leave him alone, and the great players of another era
who wanted to protect Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having 58 homers through 154 games, Maris was openly
defiant of Frick's declaration that the Ruth chase was over. ``As
far as commissioner Frick is concerned, I have only one game left
to break the record,'' he said. ``But as far as I'm concerned, I
have eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll consider it a record if I hit No. 60 and No. 61 in the
162d game. Any homers I hit now will be just fine and dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit No. 59 in Game 155, then tied Ruth with No. 60 off Jack
Fisher of Baltimore in No. 158. The Associated Press reported,
``Roger Maris blasted his 60th home run of the season Tuesday night
but it came four official games too late to officially tie Babe
Ruth's 34-year-old record in 154 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher stills remembers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up, and in the middle of my delivery, I decided to
take a little bit off,'' he said in an ESPN interview earlier this
week. ``And when I did, all the ball did was just run up there. As
soon as I let it go, I knew I was in trouble. It was one of those
you'd like to run down there and catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the last game of the season, the finale of a
three-game series against the Red Sox, the quset was complete.
Maris reached Stallard for a 360-foot solo shot into the
right-field stands in the fourth inning. The ball was caught by Sal
Durante of Coney Island, who turned it in and received $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a premonition that he might do it,'' said Ralph Houk,
the Yankee manager at the time, who in later years as Red Sox
manager called it one of the classic moments in his career.
``Stallard threw fastballs, changeups, and sliders. Stallard was
the type a batter like Maris could get under and hit. I was happy
because it was a real good homer _ no fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   But no joy, either.

<P>
   Bud Goode may understand more about the importance of the
running game in the National Football League than any man alive.
Certainly he understands more about it than any 75-year-old,
136-pound man alive, and what he understands is statistically
proven and simple to follow.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, in the NFL you run or you die.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other ways to put it, but that's as valid as any
law of the NFL jungle. A year ago, for example, seven of the 12
playoff teams had a 1,000-yard rusher, three of the four teams in
the conference championships ran more than they passed, and of the
seven teams that ran more than they threw, six reached the playoffs
(only the Tennessee Oilers coming up empty) and four (Kansas City,
San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and the Giants) won their division.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical aberration?
</P>
<P>
   Well, consider that the same was true for the losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when we ran more than we passed we won every game,''
said New Orleans Saints president and general manager Bill
Kuharich. ``That's why (head coach Mike) Ditka wants to run the
ball. Last year, we're 0-3 and 9-point underdogs at home against
Detroit and they've got Barry Sanders. We beat them, 33-17. How?
They threw four interceptions. We ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get the ball on the 20, run some, and then have to
punt, it's all right if you stop them on defense. Now you get the
ball back near the 50. Then you run some and kick a field goal.
That's how Tampa played. They'd start a drive at the 20. Next time
it would be the 35 or 40. Then it's a touchdown drive. That's the
way Mike played in Chicago. We want to play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's the way everyone wants to play, and for good
reason. Two of the league's worst teams last year, Indianapolis and
Arizona, threw far more than they ran, with the Colts passing 523
times to 450 rushes, while the Cardinals were ridiculously out of
balance with 602 passes and 395 runs. If they'd listen, Goode would
be happy to tell them that's no way to play winning football.
</P>
<P>
   Goode knows better because he's been crunching the NFL's numbers
longer than anybody and understands what they mean. He has been
advising the likes of Bill Parcells, Ditka, Chuck Knox, Chuck
Fairbanks, and Raymond Berry right up to Norv Turner and Steve
Mariucci since 1960. At one time he was a consultant to 16 teams.
In fact, when the Patriots lost to Ditka's Bears in the 1986 Super
Bowl, Goode was a statistical adviser to both teams, leaving him
and his television in a precarious position that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the cat at the set every time either team did wrong,''
he joked.
</P>
<P>
   A Hollywood writer and public relations man by trade, Goode was
once the head writer for Groucho Marx's ``You Bet Your Life,'' but
over the past 30 years has led a double life. Around the same time
he was analyzing the Nielsen ratings in Hollywood, NFL coaches
began betting their futures on the accuracy of his statistics.
Through the years one of the things he's learned should comfort the
Patriots as they enter a new season faced with an old problem _ the
absence of a proven running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on 30 years of selling advice to teams, one thing is
clear,'' Goode said this week from his home in Studio City, Calif.
``Number of rushes is more important than average per rush. The
quantity is more important than the quality. In contrast, the
passing game's importance is more one of quality than quantity. You
must have enough of a running game to control the clock and make
first downs. You need to be able to protect a lead to win in the
NFL. You do that by running.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A satisfied customer
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O ne of Goode's newest clients is Mariucci, who first began
paying attention to his numbers when he was the quarterbacks coach
of the Green Bay Packers. Almost without fail, those numbers have
indicated the same thing year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Throw if you want, but in the end winners run the football.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mariucci took over the 49ers last season, he did a
remarkable thing for a disciple of Mike Holmgren's West Coast
passing game. Holmgren had already adapted the offense to both the
present day and the Wisconsin winters and Mariucci took it another
step. He ran more and he ran more physically, trading in Bill
Walsh's traps and finesse runs for Holmgren's power oriented
running game that features aggressive zone blocking with linemen
coming off the ball and backs picking a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci put in a similar running game but more important he
insisted on using it more than they ever had in San Francisco. He
had the Niners run the ball nearly 100 times more than they threw
it (523 to 432), the first time that had happened in San Francisco
since 1984. Although some observers thought the 49ers ``slipped''
to 12th in total offense (a run-plus-pass stat Goode said means
nothing because ``it compares apples with bananas''), the fact was
they finished 13-3, reached the NFC Championship Game, averaged
more yards per catch than anyone in the NFL, and had their first
1,000-yard rusher (Garrison Hearst) in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was the result of losing Jerry Rice in the opening
game and having quarterback Steve Young sustain a concussion the
same afternoon. But Rice, Young, and a savage Tampa Bay defense
weren't the only factors in the decision. There was Bud Goode and
his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always trends in football,'' Mariucci said this
week. ``The West Coast offense has lasted longer than most, but now
rush zones (zone blitzes) are prevalent, so some of the West Coast
thinking has been altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protections we've used in the past don't hold up against
zone blitzes, so the trend in the NFL is back toward the run. If
you can run it more than 30 times, you win 90 percent of your
games. That's a statistical fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud showed me that the next most important stat after points
scored is number of rushes plus completions. Rush 31 times and
throw 20 completions, you're number is 51. If your number is higher
than theirs, you win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incomplete passes are not good. It's much better to run three
times and punt than throw three incompletions and punt. You use up
a couple of minutes running as opposed to 15 or 18 seconds. That's
that much less time for a (Drew) Bledsoe or a (Brett) Favre to beat
you. It's like riding time in wrestling. It's so important to be on
top, to have possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s it was pass to set up the run for the 49ers and
other teams adopted it. It was not 3 yards and a cloud of dust. It
was finesse. But with the advent of the zone blitzes, expanded
coverages, and situational substitutions, today you're forced to
throw `hot' (to a receiver reading a blitz and breaking off a route
hopefully at the same time the quarterback expects him to) a lot
more than in the '80s. You don't want to do that. So we've had to
adjust and run more to control those blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of all of us on offense that would rather throw
the ball better than anyone else because there's a certain amount
of excitement and sophistication and glamour that comes with that,
but what's best for the team is controlling the clock, not setting
passing records. I'd like to rush 30, 31 times a game. If you get 3
1/2 to 4 yards a run you got your 115-120 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the last 10 or 20 Super Bowl teams, they all
had great defenses and darn good running games. Very few teams who
throw it almost every down get there. That (1984) Miami team with
Dan Marino may be the one exception. Generally, if you're throwing
that much you're behind, so while my personality is `let's wing it
around,' I feel have to be like water and take the shape of the
container I'm in. To be a good team in the NFL today, you've got to
be able to run.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they were thinking
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   T hat being the case, why did the Patriots let one of the best
backs in the NFL go to the division rival New York Jets? Why did
owner Bob Kraft, who has paid the (over) price time and again both
for his team and for his players, refuse to match Martin's $36
million free agent offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in our best interest,'' Kraft said at the time he
announced the offer would not be matched. ``There's always another
running back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, as several analyses of recent running back
production showed Kraft before he made the decision. One pointed
out that of the eight most productive backs in NFL history after
three seasons, six averaged fewer yards per carry in their fourth
year. In other words, they had begun to slip, often because the
physical demands of the job had taken a toll, as Kraft feared might
have started to happen with Martin.
</P>
<P>
   That there is always an abundance of new running backs is also
clear. Four were drafted in the first round this year and that is
pretty much the norm. So you can always get a running back.

 UNDATED: ... running back.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Miami has been trying to establish a running game since
Jimmy Johnson arrived in 1996 and has failed despite drafting four
running backs, including this year's first-rounder John Avery.
Considering Johnson is one of the best judges of talent in the
game, at a time when more and more teams are trying to run the ball
and searching for someone to do it, is there always another Martin
out there may be the more relevant question.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition season there didn't seem to be in Foxborough,
where No. 1 pick Robert Edwards was limping much of the summer and
The Runners Shaw (Sedrick and Harold) seldom got farther than their
height (2 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposed with that slowdown is Martin's past production. He is
one of only four backs to gain 1,000 yards and catch 30 passes in
each of the last three seasons. Since 1995, roughly 80 percent of
Bledsoe's handoffs had gone to him. And since his arrival in the
NFL, Martin had been responsible for a greater percentage of his
team's rushing yards (79.2 percent) than anyone other than
Detroit's Barry Sanders (84.7).
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, coach Pete Carroll insists the Patriots will run
more than ever this year, Martin or no Martin, because Bud Goode's
stats prove it's the rushes that are important, not the average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, we're going to run the football,'' Carroll said.
``The running game is not a second thought this year. Zone pressure
has allowed defensive coaches to attack your pass offense more.
When you throw, you're exposing yourself to an array of pressures
today, so the run is called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to create enough balance to keep defenses
base-oriented at least, so they aren't attacking you all the time.
As long as you're running the football, you're making them play it.
Curtis was a great player for us but even 2-yard runs can be
efficient plays if you're stubborn about running it. The way
defenses are presented today, you've got to play your running
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Martin, can a team newly committed to the run move the
ball with the efficiency he showed the past three seasons? The
Patriots have contended all along they can because young backs tend
to gain yardage and if Edwards and the Shaws can combine for
something near what Martin produced, they say everything will be
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the fact is teams with a 100-yard rusher win 70
percent of the time and teams with a 300-yard passer win 35 percent
of the time. That's teams with a 100-yard rusher, not teams that
rush for 100 yards. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In search of go-to guy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   S o while Goode says it is number of carries rather than average
per carry that is the true barometer of success, a team generally
needs one back it can count on to win consistently. All four teams
that played in the conference championships, for example, had
1,000-yard rushers and seven of the 12 playoff teams did as well.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Kansas City used the approach New England is
considering, having four backs rush for 350 yards or more but no
one for 600. That made the Chiefs only the sixth team in NFL
history to win a division title without a single back rushing for
more than 600 yards. On the upside, the last team to do it in a
five-team division was the 1986 Patriots, but that team was knocked
out in its first playoff game and didn't return to the postseason
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That trend seemed to apply across the board. According to STATS
Inc., only two teams using the Chiefs' rushing approach repeated as
a division champion and one, Dallas, added Tony Dorsett, who rushed
for 1,007 yards in his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   While someone will replace Martinthis season, neither Edwards
nor Sedrick Shaw has shown he can do the things Martin did while he
was rushing for 3,799 yards and averaging 4 yards a carry. What is
worse is that history does not support the idea that they will.
</P>
<P>
   After Jim Nance rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 1966 and
'67, the Patriots did not have another 1,000-yard rusher for 10
years. After Sam Cunningham did it in 1977, the wait was six years.
And After John Stephens rumbled for 1,168 yards in 1988, it was
five years before the next 1,000-yard rusher appeared in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   So if one studies history, the picture of the year following the
loss of a 1,000-yard rusher is often bleak. In the past 25 years,
121 runners have rushed for 1,000 yards (including the same runners
only if they moved to a different team, thus Sanders would count
once not eight times, while John Riggins would count twice, with
the Jets and Redskins).
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 times did a replacement rush for 1,000 yards the year
after, with the Los Angeles Rams making a habit of it. In 1986,
Eric Dickerson broke the 1,000-yard mark. The next season, Charles
White did the same and a year later Greg Bell gained 1,000 in place
of White.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, a team that has done little right, actually has
immediately replaced a 1,000-yard rusher with another twice, in
1983-84 and 1995-96. Perhaps the greatest was replacing William
Andrews, who gained 1,000 three times in four years, with Gerald
Riggs, who did it three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But these are clearly the exceptions. If it as easy to replace a
back like Martin as the Patriots suggest, why did it take 28 years
to find a replacement for Nance, the only two-time 1,000-yard
rusher in Patriots history before Martin?
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight backs, who, like Martin, have rushed for 1,000
yards in each of their first three seasons (Dorsett, Sanders,
Dickerson, Andrews, Terrell Davis, Earl Campbell, John Brockington,
and Ottis Anderson), most took years, not months, to replace. While
the Rams didn't miss a beat after Dickerson's departure, and the
same was true in Atlanta when Andrews's knee injury finished him,
the other four left a hole their teams did not quickly fill.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, it was five years after Campbell before a back
rushed for 1,000 yards. The same was true in Dallas after Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   The news was worse for the Cardinals, who had only one
1,000-yard rusher in the next 10 years after letting Anderson go
(to Parcells's Giants). And don't even ask what happened in Green
Bay after Brockington left because the Packers had just one
1,000-yard rusher in the next 20 years. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best of intentions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F inding a running back is one thing. Finding a running back
like Curtis Martin is quite another. So what can the Patriots do
this season with Martin gone? According to Goode and the people who
listen to him, they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offseason, everyone says they want to run the ball
more,'' said Johnson. ``Once the season is over they study all the
statistics and invariably the teams who won the highest percentage
were the ones who ran the football. Then the next season starts and
some of those teams see they can't run and the easy thing is to
fall back and start throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the zone blitz has really put more of an emphasis on
running because you can't make a living now with three wide
receivers. The best way to hold them out of that is running the
football and there are hidden stats that come from doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can run, you play better defense. You have better
field position. You have less turnovers. I'm not a high-risk
offense man. That doesn't fit my style. Our defense and special
teams will give us field position and turnovers and the way to
exploit that is to run the ball. In the past we've said we'd run
and ended up with four wideouts. Not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Dolphins plan to do then is run. Just like the Patriots
and everyone else, including the guru of the passing game, new New
England offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting an attitude about it,'' said Zampese, who when
he first took the job mentioned Martin as one reason he left
Dallas. ``There's no question defenses have caught up with passing
offenses in general. Primarily they've done it with blitzes and
linemen dropping off with zone dogs (blitzes).
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you don't want to get into a pass rushing contest.
Nowadays you'll get your quarterback killed if all you do is throw,
so we do want to run it more. But most of your runs come in the
fourth quarter, when you have a lead. That's when your true ability
to run comes out. Otherwise, all you need is the perception that
you can run it and you will.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're not yet convinced, ask Giants quarterback Danny
Kanell. Earlier this week when he and his teammates arrived at
their practice facility, coach Jim Fassel had put a chart on the
locker room bulletin board. On it was a simple message:
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were 9-2-1 last year when they rushed for more than
100 yards. When they rushed for less than 100, they were 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that and you realize how important it is in this
league,'' Kanell said. ``You have to be able to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The same will be true for the Curtis-less Patriots. Despite the
odds against them in the first year without their favorite Martin,
the Patriots know what Bud Goode knows.
</P>
<P>
   They run or they die.

REVOLUTION HAPPY AS THEY FOLLOW ZENGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Zenga was the most demonstrative of players on the field
and polemical off the field during his professional goalkeeping
career. As a coach, Zenga is exacting and intense, but so far, he
is transmitting confidence and serenity to his team _ as he did
when he was a player.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has been coaching the Revolution for less than a week, and
the team appears to be responding to his direction. The Revolution
have outscored opponents, 4-1, in the last 135 minutes, including a
2-0 victory over the New York/New Jersey MetroStars Wednesday,
which kept them in Major League Soccer playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution defense remained poised, and the team retained
its overall organization against the MetroStars. They trail Miami
by 6 points with four games remaining _ against Columbus (Sept.
12), Tampa Bay (Sept. 19), at Chicago (Sept. 23), and the
MetroStars (Sept. 26) _ in the race for the fourth and final
Eastern Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always changes things when you have a new coach,'' said
Edwin Gorter, who has returned to his starting midfield position.
``He arrived and he tried to find something positive. We knew we
weren't mathematically out of it, but we only had about a 10
percent chance. We were just playing for pride. We were fed up with
losing. And we scored first, which we hadn't been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution withstood early MetroStars assaults and took the
lead on Joe-Max Moore's 20-yard bending free kick off the underside
of the crossbar in the 31st minute. Gorter's goal in the 36th
minute gave the Revolution their first two-goal lead in the first
half since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 38, has not attended coaching courses. He played for
disciplinarians in Italy, but his uninhibited nature made him seem
anything but coaching material. His style is much different than
that of former Italy national team coach Arrigo Sacchi, who valued
his system of play above the players and had little patience for
personalities such as Roberto Baggio, GianLuca Vialli, and Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   The image Zenga is projecting as a coach is far from
stereotypical. He has donned a golf shirt in the Tampa heat, a
long-sleeved dress shirt in East Rutherford, N.J., both times with
a baseball cap worn backward.
</P>
<P>
   But his knowledge of the game is advanced far beyond anything
that can be generated in formal coaching courses. Certainly, Zenga
has defensive expertise, judging by his remarkable record with
Italy _ 39 shutouts and only four games in which he allowed more
than one goal in 58 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And the Revolution players have responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter knows what he is talking about,'' defender Richard
Goulooze said. ``He has been a goalkeeper on the top defensive
teams in the world. Almost everything he says about defense is
right. Defending looks easy, but you are always reacting to the
other team's movements and you have to do it as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had looked hopeless, and as Walter said, we had no
personality on the field. All of a sudden, everyone can play. Our
outside players were staying with their runners, and that makes it
easier for everyone. We proved we are a good team. We weren't
panicking out there.''

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN NOT ALONE, OPPOSITION PUSHES ALTERNATIVE PM
CANDIDATES
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0905.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Communist party and other opposition Duma factions
have agreed to negotiations with the Kremlin, seeking to avoid
another confrontation with President Boris Yeltsin over the
creation of a new government. While the Communists agreed to seek a
compromise, they say they will continue to oppose Yeltsin's choice
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Chernomyrdin and three figures who have emerged
as possible compromise candidates to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, acting prime minister
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet-era bureaucrat who headed the natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, Chernomyrdin went on to serve as Yeltsin's prime minister
from December 1992 until March this year, when he was fired for
failing to fix the economy. Now he's back and struggling to form a
government amid economic turmoil. So far, he has failed to satisfy
the interests of the Communists, Russia's powerful tycoons and
Western leaders like President Clinton, who visited Moscow this
week urging Russia not to abandon democratic and free-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62, mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   The powerful boss of Moscow, who like Chernomyrdin has
aspirations to succeed Yeltsin as president. Luzhkov has emerged as
the leading alternative to Chernomyrdin. A nationalist who enjoys
strong popularity in Moscow, Luzhkov has distanced himself from the
Kremlin during the current crisis. Promotion to prime minister
would give him the nationwide visibility he needs to win the
presidency, but it also would expose him to intense criticism as he
inherits Russia's financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   YEGOR STROYEV, 61, chairman of the Federation Council
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster head of Russia's upper house of parliament,
Stroyev largely has served as a go-between for the Kremlin and the
Duma. Opposition parties have promoted him as an alternative
candidate for prime minister because of his dispassionate
reputation, but others question whether he has the guile and
resourcefulness to succeed in the job. A Soviet-era economist, he
represents the interests of Russia's provinces, whose governors sit
on the federation council.
</P>
<P>
   YURI MASLYUKOV, 60, former trade and industry minister
</P>
<P>
   A Communist, Maslyukov was brought last month into the reformist
government of ex-prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko as a token in an
attempt to broaden political support for that short-lived
government. In Soviet times he was a director of Gosplan, the
mammoth state economic planning committee. He went on to become a
Duma member and has strong ties to some of Russia's largest
industrial firms. If Yeltsin were to choose a Communist as prime
minister, Maslyukov is considered the most likely candidate.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  They'll go as far as QB Steve McNair is ready to take
them. Is McNair ready to move to the next level? Thigpen (from
Pittsburgh) and draft choice Dyson were added to give Tennessee a
solid group of receivers with Willie Davis and Chris Sanders.
Offensive line is just adequate. Defense plays Fisher's gambling
style and features SS Blaine Bishop, who just might be the best in
the league at his position.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Bengals ranked 28th in total defense last year,
which is why almost all of their offseason focus was on that side
of the ball. They used their two first-round picks on LBs Spikes
and Brian Simmons and picked up Randolph from the Giants, Clyde
Simmons from Jacksonville, and Bankston from Arizona. However, the
biggest change will be at QB, where O'Donnell beat out Jeff Blake.
Boomer Esiason lit a fire under this team in the second half of '97
before departing for TV. Can O'Donnell do the same?

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook:  &LR; The Chiefs had the best record in the conference last
year thanks to a terrific defense that should be even better with
the acquisitions of McGlockton and O'Neal. When McGlockton wants to
be, he is the best defensive lineman in the league. O'Neal is near
the end of a great career but still a dominant pass rusher. Offense
will be conservative and attempt to feed off the defense. The
retirement of Marcus Allen leaves a huge gap. Donnell Bennett looks
like his successor. Offense lacks big-play capability, but defense
and special teams should be outstanding.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; WR Marcus Nash, DT Marvin Washington, WR Justin
Armour, CB Tito Paul.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The most dominant unit on any team in the NFL last
season was the offensive line of the Broncos, including in the
Super Bowl where it, along with the brilliant running of Terrell
Davis, controlled Green Bay. However, that offensive line underwent
some changes. Its best player, left tackle Gary Zimmerman, retired,
and starting guard Brian Habib left for Seattle in free agency. The
replacements don't figure to be as good. Defensively, the Broncos
will blitz and blitz some more. At home, they are nearly
unbeatable, which is why they should again figure in the playoffs.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; RB Ricky Watters, C Kevin Glover, G Brian Habib, LB
Darrin Smith, LB Anthony Simmons, RB Ahman Green.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The heat is on Erickson and he knows it. If he
doesn't get to the playoffs this year, he almost certainly won't be
back. This is a good team. The Seahawks and Ravens could be the
most improved teams in the AFC. QB Warren Moon needs to have a big
year. Watters will make the running game more dangerous. WR Joey
Galloway is explosive. Offensive line is good enough and defense is
solid with Cortez Kennedy, Sam Adams, and Michael Sinclair.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; CB Eric Allen, S Anthony Newman, CB Charles
Woodson, T Mo Collins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Raiders may be on the way back but they're not
there yet. Offense should be dynamic with QB Jeff George, RB
Napoleon Kaufman, WR Tim Brown, and TE Rickey Dudley big weapons.
Defense still cannot stop the run. They have improved the team at
the corners with Woodson, the real deal, and Allen, but the rest of
the group is questionable. The Raiders will have to put up a lot of
points.

<P>
   &UR; New faces: &LR;  QB Ryan Leaf, RB Natrone Means, T John Jackson, G
Aaron Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Same deal as Raiders. Good on offense, with rookie
Leaf, who played the exhibition season like a franchise player,
making a huge difference. Chargers have improved the offensive line
with acquisitions of Taylor from Green Bay and Jackson from
Pittsburgh. Big back Means returns from Jacksonville. But on
defense, they just don't have it. LB Junior Seau is terrific, but
he is not Superman.

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN NOT ALONE, OPPOSITION PUSHES ALTERNATIVE PM
CANDIDATES
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0905.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Communist party and other opposition Duma factions
have agreed to negotiations with the Kremlin, seeking to avoid
another confrontation with President Boris Yeltsin over the
creation of a new government. While the Communists agreed to seek a
compromise, they say they will continue to oppose Yeltsin's choice
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Chernomyrdin and three figures who have emerged
as possible compromise candidates to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, acting prime minister
</P>
<P>
   A Soviet-era bureaucrat who headed the natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, Chernomyrdin went on to serve as Yeltsin's prime minister
from December 1992 until March this year, when he was fired for
failing to fix the economy. Now he's back and struggling to form a
government amid economic turmoil. So far, he has failed to satisfy
the interests of the Communists, Russia's powerful tycoons and
Western leaders like President Clinton, who visited Moscow this
week urging Russia not to abandon democratic and free-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62, mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   The powerful boss of Moscow, who like Chernomyrdin has
aspirations to succeed Yeltsin as president. Luzhkov has emerged as
the leading alternative to Chernomyrdin. A nationalist who enjoys
strong popularity in Moscow, Luzhkov has distanced himself from the
Kremlin during the current crisis. Promotion to prime minister
would give him the nationwide visibility he needs to win the
presidency, but it also would expose him to intense criticism as he
inherits Russia's financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   YEGOR STROYEV, 61, chairman of the Federation Council
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster head of Russia's upper house of parliament,
Stroyev largely has served as a go-between for the Kremlin and the
Duma. Opposition parties have promoted him as an alternative
candidate for prime minister because of his dispassionate
reputation, but others question whether he has the guile and
resourcefulness to succeed in the job. A Soviet-era economist, he
represents the interests of Russia's provinces, whose governors sit
on the federation council.
</P>
<P>
   YURI MASLYUKOV, 60, former trade and industry minister
</P>
<P>
   A Communist, Maslyukov was brought last month into the reformist
government of ex-prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko as a token in an
attempt to broaden political support for that short-lived
government. In Soviet times he was a director of Gosplan, the
mammoth state economic planning committee. He went on to become a
Duma member and has strong ties to some of Russia's largest
industrial firms. If Yeltsin were to choose a Communist as prime
minister, Maslyukov is considered the most likely candidate.

 &HT;    KUWAITIS WARILY WATCH U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ, QUESTION ITS
INTENTIONS
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ Billboards in this modern, rebuilt capital
warn the people of this oil-rich nation not to forget their POWs --
the more than 600 thought to be held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like incongruous
war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile city.
</P>
<P>
   And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight from
Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond the border of their
two countries, posing a constant threat. And, they closely followed
recent reports that the United States is allegedly changing its
strategy for keeping Hussein in check.
</P>
<P>
   But they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the
deserts protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the
740,000 Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers --
are just tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises.
</P>
<P>
   They have played host to Hussein's invasion and then Desert
Shield, Storm and Sabre. They stocked up on gas masks when last
year's Desert Thunder looked like another war-in-the-making. Their
newspapers report on the ongoing ``Intrinsic Action'' exercises
that keep American and Kuwaiti troops in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that, unless the United States is serious about
knocking Hussein out of power, they would rather avoid the huge
military build-ups that have raised regional blood pressures in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like they are in for a quieter United States, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Compare today to last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Hussein closed the door on United Nations weapons
inspections in eight of his palaces. The U.S. aircraft carriers and
troops of Desert Thunder swooped into the region. With American
officials saying that diplomacy will not work without the threat of
force, the build-up continued until a U.N. agreement diffused the
crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hussein went further in cutting off all new
inspections. But the United States has not increased its forces in
Kuwait. Instead, it awaits action from the U.N., which is holding
Iraq under the weight of crushing economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis look on with concern, but also a case of what might be
called build-up fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much sure about the solid position of the United
States vis-a-vis Iraq,'' said Sulaiman Majed Al-shaheen(CQ),
under-secretary of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our friends in the United States realize . . . that when
Saddam Hussein says a word, we find that there is an alert, a
warning, the moving of carriers to the gulf. Suddenly, we find that
everything becomes so calm,'' Al-shaheen said. ``That game costs
that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, there is the accusation, whether it be right or
wrong,'' he added carefully, ``that the United States comes to the
(Persian) Gulf only to show and not to take actions.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Al-shaheen said, unanimity on the U.N. Security Council
will ensure that Iraq is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   He does not hold the United States responsible for removing
Hussein, and said he is not worried about reports that the United
States is going for a lower-profile policing of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports gained momentum last month after Scott Ritter,
leader of one of the U.N. inspection teams, quit his job, while
accusing the United States of taking the teeth out of the program
that is supposed to find and destroy Hussein's chemical and
biological weapons ``of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's comments prompted Congressional criticism, with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sounding out about a ``weak
response'' to Hussein's latest violations and Senate leaders saying
they would investigate the Clinton administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright denied
discouraging inspections or that the United States' overall policy
has changed. The U.S. goal, she said is still to keep economic
sanctions on Iraq until it gives up its weapons and until Hussein
complies with other U.N. requirements, including the payment of
reparations for war damage.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked the U.N. not to even consider
lifting the sanctions until Iraq complies with the inspections,
prompting Hussein to threaten new, unspecified retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been different tools used at different times,''
said a state department official. ``We're not being as militaristic
this time . . . this time we're not playing his game, we're playing
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   February's crisis was diffused when U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan traveled to Baghdad and secured an agreement with Hussein.
But, there had clearly been little support in the Arab world for
U.S. military action and France and Russia, members of the security
council, were hesitant. With this latest defiance, Hussein seems to
have snubbed all those countries and Annan -- not just America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. troops patrol and train in the desert, which
sometimes reaches a baking 140 degrees. Officials say the current
contingent is enough to strike Hussein, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great experimentation ground for new ideas,'' said Sgt.
Brian Goodknight(CQ), 42, who is based at Fort McPherson in
Georgia, and supplies the training equipment. ``We know we have to
employ heavy combat units to answer the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Collins, an expert in political military studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
the new policy emphasis does not mean the United States has given
in to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, a retired U.S. Army colonel, said U.S. policy has
been poorly spelled out by a president distracted by a domestic
scandal and a host of other foreign policy problems -- from North
Korean missile testing to the Russian economic and political
crisis. That will make allies doubt the strength of America's stand
against Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Clinton administration should work harder to
unseat Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That would sit well with many Kuwaitis. They are fond of
Americans and grateful for their war effort -- the Kuwaiti
government built the new $30 million U.S. embassy as a gift and
named a luxury apartment building after former President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But, many say that America is using the Hussein threat to keep
its troops in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States wanted to get rid of Saddam, they could
with one finger,'' said Khaled Al-hassan(CQ), a 31-year-old Kuwaiti
soldier headed with his wife for a vacation in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks President Clinton is mainly interested in keeping oil
prices low, and pre-occupied with both Monica Lewinsky and Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hamani Al-khatan(CQ), 25, said that seven years after
the Iraqi invasion, she does not like to dwell on Hussein's
continued threat.
</P>
<P>
   But while she and her country have moved on and rebuilt their
prosperous daily lives, despite him, she said ``my mind works all
the time. In the heart and mind, we have a problem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seems as if the Fourth of July fireworks have only sputtered out
and here it is Labor Day, the last hurrah of summer vacation. This
weekend, summer goes out with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   For some among us, that bang may be the sound of collision.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you've heard it all before, read it all to the point,
perhaps, of boredom _ wear your seat belts, don't drink and drive
etc., etc. Nag, nag, nag. Still, there are some out there who just
don't get it. I became painfully aware of that fact a couple of
days ago while watching a young woman race by in a car with two
kids standing up in the back peering out the rear window. Nice
view, maybe their last, if Mom has to smack the brakes and they go
flying toward her and the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for seat belts and child restraints is not a
government urge to curtail your freedom or impose restrictions on
your children; the reason is public safety. If you do not wear a
safety restraint in a moving automobile, you are not only at risk
yourself but a threat to someone else _ maybe me.
</P>
<P>
   In a sudden stop _ such as occurs when you plow into another car
_ the belt restrains you during deceleration, otherwise the car
would stop and you'd still be hurtling along at whatever speed.
Hurtling, that is, until you hit something _ the windshield, the
pavement, or perhaps a properly restrained person up front.
</P>
<P>
   Air bags are great, most of the time, but without belts they
don't help much, can be dangerous, directing your unrestrained body
into something unyielding. The belts position you for the bag to
save your face.
</P>
<P>
   The belt also restrains a driver when the car is going out of
control _ skidding, perhaps. Instead of merely hanging onto the
steering wheel to keep from being tossed about, you can actually
attempt corrective action and perhaps succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things to remember this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ That so-called ``package shelf'' under the back window of your
car isn't; the moron who thought that up ought to be sent to
Singapore for proper caning. Things piled on the ``shelf'' cut down
on rear visibilty and, in a collision or sudden stop, are missiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting in a dither because the car in front of you is driven
by a mope isn't likely to speed up the mope _ but it may raise your
blood pressure. Tailgating, honking, and repeated flashing of
lights will only serve to increase your risk, not his speed. If you
control your rage, you are less likely to fall victim to someone
else's rage.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a driver, exercise some discipline within the car. Bring
stuff to amuse the kiddies, and be firm about disturbing behavior _
sibling quarrels, yelling, etc. That goes for adults, too; yells of
any sort can sound like a dire warning and trigger the wrong
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the Golden Rule _ that ``do unto others'' stuff is
the real McCoy. Empower yourself by giving the other driver a
break, surrendering the right of way when appropriate or letting
somebody into the line of traffic. Friendly behavior is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   _ On long trips, stop at least once an hour and get out of the
car. Sitting for hours on end behind the wheel increases fatigue,
dulls your senses and, we now know, increases the risk of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your eyes moving. Check way ahead, check the rear and
side mirrors frequently. Get your passengers involved; note out
loud what you see ahead and what you're doing about it _ they may
join in and point out hazards or traffic changes that you somehow
are missing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alcohol will not sharpen your wits, keen your senses, or
improve your reaction time. It makes you talk funny and act stupid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relying solely on your brakes to slow the car will result in
excessive brake wear and in some cars on a warm day may induce
brake fade _ as in the brakes fade away _ with unpleasant results.
Your car's transmission isn't there just for acceleration. Use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reserve your time in the car for driving _ reading, eating,
drinking, or primping while underway will not help your driving,
but it will make those with whom you share the road nervous.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are stopped by a law enforcement officer, roll down the
window, keep your hands in plain view on the steering wheel, and
tell your passengers to keep their hands visible and their mouths
closed. Be polite; it's your holiday, but he or she is working and
may not be having a great day. Your good nature now could cut down
on your grief later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your brain engaged at all times. In short, smarten up,
lighten up, buckle up, and enjoy the ride.

 &HT;    PARENTS RACE THE CLOCK IN FIGHT TO FREE DAUGHTER FROM PERUVIAN
PRISON

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The kind of call any parent would dread woke Rhoda
Berenson from a deep slumber one Friday evening in early December
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The woman on the other end said she was from the U.S. State
Department. Berenson's daughter, Lori, had been arrested in Peru.
The charge, she thought, was terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A second call -- this one even more disturbing -- came three
days later over a crackling line, 4,000 miles away, from a panicked
Lori.
</P>
<P>
   She said only four things: The charges were ``preposterous.''
She needed a lawyer. She wanted shoes and underwear. And, her
American Express card must be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was all some kind of misunderstanding,'' explains
Rhoda Berenson, 55, speaking in the patient tones of someone who's
told the story before. ``That the U.S. government would quickly
sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 998 days ago, as Berenson's number-minded husband,
Mark, quickly makes clear during an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the lives of the gregarious, middle-class college
professors has had more intrigue than a James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter was indeed arrested Nov. 30, 1995, at the tender
age of 26. She was accused of being an upper-echelon member of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or MRTA, a violent Marxist
group that was reputedly planning to kidnap members of Peru's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons hired two attorneys: Thomas Nooter, who
successfully defended a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing,
and Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But it did little good.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons call the secret military trial that followed their
daughter's arrest ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to challenge evidence or cross-examine witnesses, Lori
was found guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996 by a hooded judge she
never saw.
</P>
<P>
   Their hazel-eyed baby who grew up to sing and play clarinet was
sentenced to life in the notoriously grim Yanamayo prison, perched
on a wind-swept plain high in the frigid, inhospitable Andes of
southeastern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that powerful people have raised concerns over
a flawed judicial system: President Clinton, former President
Carter, and, most notably, Peru's former prime minister, Javier
Valle Riestra.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that a hard-nosed Peruvian president has, so
far, been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori paints a disturbing picture of the
woman he calls ``Comrade Lucia,'' a rebel mastermind who helped run
the safe house where guerrillas had trained for their attack on the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons admit that their daughter had become somewhat of a
stranger as she stumbled toward adulthood, but insist she is not,
and never was, a terrorist, even if she had associations with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the New Yorker was part of a terrorist body or
simply a left-leaning do-gooder is no longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The burning question today is whether Lori received due process
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Berenson's plea for a new trial in a civilian court was
turned down by the Supreme Military Tribunal on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Their last and only hopes are an appeal before the Organization
of American States, or that a more-conciliatory Peruvian government
will have a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   At stake: nothing less than their daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Helene Berenson was raised along with an older sister,
Kathy, in a spacious but nondescript apartment in the Gramercy Park
section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She was a straight-A student at the LaGuardia High School of
Performing Arts, who often volunteered at soup kitchens and blood
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Lori was everything a parent could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to study anthropology at the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which led to two study trips
to El Salvador at a time when Central America's civil wars were in
full swing.
</P>
<P>
   She became keenly interested in the roots of conflict, poverty
and inequality, so much so that she dropped out of school in 1989
to move to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   She also became increasingly distant from her family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to her parents were sporadic, arriving every month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed she would eventually go back to school,''
Rhoda Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lori moved to Peru in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She obtained accreditation letters from two left-leaning U.S.
publications and told her parents that she hoped to write about the
effect of widespread poverty on Peruvian women.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture the Berensons have of their daughter through
letters and phone calls --observer, traveler, journalist -- is very
different from the one that emerged after Lori's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian authorities say they have evidence of a 1994 meeting in
Ecuador between Lori and rebel leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini --
who helped invade the Japanese ambassador's house in Lima and died
when it was retaken in April 1997 -- and that it was on his orders
that she agreed to help attack the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say she never knew the man.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial was secret, it's hard to make an independent
assessment of any of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What has become clear, however, is that Lori may have been her
own worst enemy during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the proceeding, Lori was led before television
cameras to make a public statement, which is customary in terrorism
trials. Her eyes looked wild; her hair unruly. Shouting, she
appeared angry and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a crime to worry about the subhuman conditions in
which the majority of this population lives, then I will accept my
punishment,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say her appearance was a set-up, that the
government riled Lori by holing her up with a wounded inmate prior
to her appearance. She had no comb, and was forced to yell because
there was no microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But it was like waving a flag before a bull: the judge gave her
life, even after prosecutors requested a 30-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Lori was convicted under a special judicial system created by
Fujimori in 1992 as part of his crackdown on terrorist groups such
as MRTA and Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
   Peru holds some 4,000 political prisoners accused of supporting
various rebel groups, in turn accused of having killed more than
30,000 people since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   With a 97 percent conviction rate, the system's been criticized
by human rights groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori's trial didn't meet international standards,'' said
Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington
D.C. ``Lori was never allowed to put on a proper defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Lori bides her time in a 6-foot by 10-foot cell in one of
Latin America's harshest prisons. Just last month, the Paris-based
International Federation for Human Rights demanded the facility be
closed due to inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At 12,000 feet, the Yanamayo prison rarely gets above 40
degrees, a temperature made worse by the icy winds that whip off
Lake Titicaca. Meals, and a bucket of ice-cold water daily, are
disbursed through a hatch in the cell's door. Lori sleeps under
eight blankets, and is allowed outside only an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a month, either Mark or Rhoda Berenson makes the
4,000 mile, two-day trek to the prison -- located some 525 miles
southeast of Lima -- where they're allowed an hour with their
daughter, who's always separated from them by a screen. Each trip
costs $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   They generally bring more than 60 pounds of food and toiletries
with them at a time, and through the months they've learned the
idiosyncracies of prison guards: No pen caps or shoe laces; shampoo
must be poured into clear, plastic bags so it is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Once the guards forced Mark Berenson to unwrap hundreds of Halls
cough drops so that they could be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people usually count the grapes we bring in,'' he said.
``You never know what they're going to make you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Berenson said that during her most recent visit, on Aug.
22, she received a note from her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe in violence. I have never been a member of
the MRTA. I do believe in the ideals of justice and equality,'' it
read in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, say the Berensons, it's not her spirit -- but her
physical health -- that has them so worried.
</P>
<P>
   Lori has chronic laryngitis and talks in a raspy, Lauren
Bacall-like voice. She once had strep throat for seven weeks. She
suffers from digestive problems and her hands are swollen and
discolored.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Berenson's high-profile campaign to get their
daughter a new trial has taken on new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal before the OAS could take from two to seven
years,'' Mark Berenson said. ``We don't have that long, because
Lori doesn't have that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Berenson, who says he's 56 going on 100, recently left his
job as a statistics professor at Baruch College, where he has
taught since 1964, to devote more time to Lori's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only 168 hours in a week and I need to concentrate all
of them on Lori,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, the Berensons e-mail updates on Lori's case to more
than 1,000 groups and individuals. Every three months, they mail
updates to another 1,000 or so people.
</P>
<P>
   This summer they led dozens of activists in protesting Fujimori
as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel; this week they'll start calling
members of Congress to ask them to limit U.S. aid to Peru, which
totaled $104 million last year, unless Lori's case is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The determined couple whose only previous protests have been
against the Vietnam War admits that a series of sudden ups and
downs have left them on an emotional roller-coaster this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In June, then-Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra suggested a
pardon for Berenson. But, Fujimori swiftly rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Peru have said that Fujimori's dug in his
heels and that little movement in this case is expected until he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to some recent political maneuvering, Fujimori, who
won a second-term in 1995, may seek a third term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Berensons, it looks like they may be the
ones who will have to dig in their heels. And they say they're
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider my daughter a hostage, and, as a father, I'll do
all I can to free her because I'm frantic,'' Mark Berenson said.
``She's the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last
thought I have before going to sleep.''

CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR RIDES THE `WEDGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- At the Democratic National Convention of
1884, Edward Bragg of Wisconsin nominated Grover Cleveland for
president, saying of the delegates: ``They love him most for the
enemies he has made.'' As governor of New York, Cleveland made
enemies in Tammany Hall, a den of pariahs for ``reform'' Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies are useful in politics. As governor of California, Pete
Wilson has made plenty, a roster of which would agitate any GOP
gathering: civil rights leaders, the California Teachers
Association, nearly the entire professoriat of the University of
California, and every liberal editorialist and columnist in the
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours of his last legislative session, the man they
call Pete ``Wedge Issue'' Wilson paused between signing and vetoing
bills to discuss his eight years here. He talks in an earnest,
lightly profane patois based on two formative experiences, Yale
University and the US Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dedicated liberals don't like me, largely because I have
been successful. Nothing excites enmity quite like succeeding,''
says the governor who sponsored ballot questions ending affirmative
action and cutting off aid to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wedge issues are issues that liberals want to duck. It's `Oh,
you dirty guy, you're talking about this issue that I don't want to
talk about,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want some wedge issues? Slavery was a wedge issue. And
women's suffrage was a wedge issue. All these things that some
people don't want to talk about are wedge issues. And of course,
the worst thing in the world to do is to say that the emperor is,
in fact, buck-ass naked and say that preferences and quotas are
what they are, which is a form of racial discrimination practiced
against new victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson celebrates a wedge that separates opinion-molders from
other Californians. ``If I'm supposed to be this mean-spirited,
crabbed guy who is so hard-hearted, believe me, on an anecdotal
basis, travel with me,'' he suggests. ``The day doesn't go by that
people don't come up and say `Thank you for insisting that this
money be spent so that my kids can be in a class of 20 students.'
And the union fought me on that.''
</P>
<P>
   When California revived after the recession of the early 1990s,
Wilson's plan to improve schools clashed with the CTA, ``which has
become a very militant union, a trade union. God, I'd rather deal
with machinists. They admit they're a union.'' To reduce class
size, ``I was very heavy-handed, using the budget to get the
votes.'' This year, he used similar tactics, holding out for $3.6
billion ``of honest tax relief.'' Democrats in the Legislature
called it extortion. Wilson's reply: ``Too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and
Senate President John Burton of San Francisco did win a tax break
for low-income renters and even an increase for welfare recipients.
``There are some people who can't work. They can't,'' Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose poll numbers have gyrated since 1990 enraged
Californians when he broke a promise not to run for president,
which he did poorly, quitting in 1995. Today, ``liberals are not
happy, but overall the results are pretty good. I mean, my
favorable to unfavorable now is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   In four months he'll be back in private life. ``I honestly don't
know what I'm going to do. I'm not being coy. I just can't answer
it,'' says the self-described ``policy wonk'' who'll probably run
for president again.
</P>
<P>
   Even in apolitical California, governors define their decades.
In the 1950s, Pat Brown was, as Wilson once called him, ``the
master builder.'' In the 1960s and 1970s, Ronald Reagan and Jerry
Brown left distinctive marks. Wilson reigned in the 1990s and is
unsure of his epitaph, but offers, ``If you're looking for a
consistent theme in a stylistic way, even my enemies have said:
`He's a tenacious son of a bitch, and he generally wins.'''

CBS FACES ISSUES IN RETURN TO THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The operative word for CBS's $4 billion return to the NFL is
patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiffany network goes up against well-established
heavyweights in Fox and ESPN/ABC, and CBS Sports President Sean
McManus concedes as much. He is just asking for patience. And with
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   His ``NFL Today'' studio team consists of Jim Nantz, former 49er
Brent Jones, future Hall of Famer Marcus Allen, and former San
Francisco coach George Seifert. Surrounded by three rookie network
talents, the burden falls on Nantz. After a disappointing Winter
Olympics performance, it's unclear if Nantz can sway viewers from
Chris Berman or James Brown, the hosts of ESPN's and Fox's pregame
shows, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will be scrutinized and picked apart,'' Nantz said
recently. ``I'm not afraid of that. I expect it. This is network
television. I just hope people give us a chance to grow together as
a team before judging us against the other shows.''
</P>
<P>
   As the symbol of CBS Sports, Nantz has other larger issues to
worry about. Some good, some bad.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment the business side of CBS's return to the
NFL, and go with one basic assumption that not too many hardcore
football fans turn off a game based solely on the announcers. They
will turn down the volume, maybe, but turn the picture off? Never.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point? ``Monday Night Football.'' No one is complaining
that Frank Gifford will not work the Patriots game in Denver. The
game will still lure about a 750,000 viewers in Boston alone. That
doesn't mean Gifford is a bad guy. It's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS has assembled some of the best NFL play-by-play/analysts
in the country. Greg Gumbel and Phil Simms are solid; as are Verne
Lundquist and Randy Cross. Kevin Harlan and San Wyche will probably
have the most fun, while Gus Johnson, one of the best young
play-by-play men in the business, will shine with Steve Tasker, the
former Buffalo Bills All-Pro special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   A problem, however, is that the group of hardcore fans has
remained constant over the last three years. The numbers tell the
story.
</P>
<P>
   National ratings for the regular season have dropped from 12.9
in 1995 to 11.6 last season. During that same period, playoff games
have also dropped from 22.1 percent to 19.2. The Super Bowl, the
granddaddy of all programming, has even taken a hit, from 46
percent in 1995 to last year's 44.5. Each rating point is
equivalent to 980,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with fewer viewers, television executives, saddled with an
almost $18 billion NFL debt, are forced to ask advertisers to pay
more for the networks' astronomical television rights packages.
Many are balking.
</P>
<P>
   The networks were asking advertisers for as much as a 20 percent
increase; that didn't sit well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers are going to dig in,'' Tom DeCabia, senior vice
president at the Paul Shulman Co., told Broadcasting &AMP; Cable.
``Every client is telling every buyer out there that they overpaid
and that we are not going to fix their mistake. If that was what
they wanted to do, that was their business. But it is only worth X
amount to me. I love a Lexus, but I'm not going to pay $100,000 for
a $40,000 car.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts contend that while there are plenty of
companies that want to reach the young male demographic offered by
the NFL, few are going to pay more than an 8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what P.T. Barnum said, ``There's a sucker is born every
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS sales president Joe Abruzzese told Broadcasting &AMP; Cable in
June that the network had sold nearly half its ad inventory at
between 15 and 20 percent increases.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that a third of those sales were by companies new
to either CBS's AFC games or the NFL. In addition to deals with
General Motors, Volkswagen, Anheuser-Busch, Honda, Staples, and
American Express, CBS said the new money comes from Southwest
Airlines and a $14 million-deal with NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Even still, the chase for viewers, a perennial issue, is even
more pressing, largely because the networks, and particularly CBS,
is counting on its affiliates to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame shows matter not only for programming but for
advertising revenue, nationally as well as locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be very satisfied if our show is as well-produced and
polished as Fox's was and ESPN's was in their first year,'' McManus
told reporters. ``We are starting at a disadvantage as the new guys
on the block.''

NEW OFFENSE, SAME DEFENSE FUEL PATRIOTS' HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The spin on Route 1 is that the Patriots
have a suitable replacement for Curtis Martin, and they've solved
the right cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably they were the team's two major problems when training
camp began at Bryant College back in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The spin is that the newly installed Ernie Zampese offense is
taking hold. A little more of this and a little bit of that, and
presto! _ the second-coming of the Super Bowl champion Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The spin may be accurate. Five exhibition games certainly helped
the perception that they might be on their way. But the Patriots'
play also indicated that they need to show more.
</P>
<P>
   A good team? Yes. A Super Bowl team? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team has more depth than last year's team,'' said
vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier. ``I think the
players we drafted have all stepped in and have been able to take
the duties we needed them to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The key for Grier, however, is that the players understand Pete
Carroll's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it for me,'' said Grier. ``The players understand Pete.
They know his system now. There's no more questioning of the
system. You have to understand that a lot of these players only
knew one way because they'd had only one coach in their
professional careers. Now they understand they can have success
with a new style and philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Five exhibition games didn't really answer the question of who
will replace Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw, the second-year back out of Iowa, is getting the
starting nod for the opener in Denver Monday night, but No. 1 pick
Robert Edwards (18th overall), who returned from the MASH unit in a
24-7 win over Philadelphia to run for 38 yards on 15 carries,
showed signs he may eventually work his way into the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite averaging 3 yards per carry against Philadelphia, the
Patriots decided to commit to the running game. In the final two
exhibition games, the Patriots ran 84 times.
</P>
<P>
   The running game will have to be effective because if it isn't,
it'll all come down upon the shoulders of quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Having played under offensive coordinators Ray Perkins, Larry
Kennan, and Zampese (and three different quarterback coaches),
Bledsoe is now trying to adjust to his third offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   It took Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman two years to perfect the
system, but the scheme is similar to the one Bledsoe used at Walla
Walla (Wash.) High School with his father, Mac, who got the system
from Washington State head coach Mike Price _ who later coached
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Bledsoe was in a different style for the
first five years of his professional career. Now, he must go back
to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   While Bledsoe seemed to master the short stuff after five games,
he'll be looking for his first long ball Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll come,'' said Bledsoe, who threw his only touchdown pass
of the exhibition season Saturday against Philadelphia, a 3-yard
toss to Troy Brown. ``I'm not worried about it. I'd rather get
these bad throws out of my system now rather than when it's for
real.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reason the Patriots will be a playoff team and possibly
get back to the Super Bowl is their defense.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, it had become one of the best in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell created an exciting unit
that used its speed and gimmickry with blitzes to befuddle
opponents. The emphasis in the exhibition season was to shut down
the opposition using their base defense. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, the Patriots will throw in some of their zone
blitzes in which they'll let their safeties or their linebackers
loose.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually they're hoping to see the real Tebucky Jones
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were criticized for not taking North Carolina
defensive lineman Vonnie Holliday with the 22d pick in the first
round, but Carroll and Grier wanted a big corner who could cover
the Keyshawn Johnsons of the league. With their third-round pick,
the Patriots might have gotten a player who's every bit as good as
Holliday in Greg Spires from Florida State, who will start out
rushing the passer on third down.
</P>
<P>
   So it won't be Jones at right corner, yet. It will be Chris
Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Canty has decided to take things more seriously in terms of
conditioning and learning the position. He now has the complete
respect of his teammates and coaching staff, and he will get the
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I need to worry about the position anymore,''
said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Canty will be tested constantly because few will dare throw to
Ty Law's side. And with the blitz packages that the Patriots show,
their safeties and linebackers will often get to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is basically together for the third straight year.
It should be one of the toughest defenses to run against with
middle linebacker Ted Johnson and excellent run-stoppers such as
emerging defensive tackle Chad Eaton, veteran defensive tackle
Henry Thomas, and defensive end Ferric Collons. It should also be
tough to pass with Chris Slade, Willie McGinest, Tedy Bruschi, and
now Spires all considered top-of-the-line pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   If the running game remains effective and Bledsoe continues to
be a 3,500-4,000-yard passer, and if Canty, and eventually Jones,
plug that right corner spot, the Patriots appear to have an
excellent shot to win their division for a third straight season
and raise havoc in the playoffs.

 McGWIRE, SOSA MAKE BASEBALL A HOT COMMODITY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the Going to the Game store, Mark McGwire's
St. Louis Cardinals jersey is moving faster than a baseball smacked
out of the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   At Copeland's Sports, Chicago Cubs hats like the kind worn by
the Cubs' Sammy Sosa are flying off the hat racks quicker than you
can say Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have rekindled a national interest in
major-league baseball not seen since before the 1994 baseball
strike drove so many fans away. Their pursuit of Roger Maris'
single-season record of 61 home runs has rejuvenated baseball card
sales, game attendance, television ratings and baseball
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Associated Press poll showed that 46 percent of people
queried have had some level of increased interest in baseball
because of the attempts by McGwire and Sosa to surpass Maris' mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a baseball fan,'' said Gareth Steen, a student from
Dublin, Ireland, who works at Copeland's Sports. ``But it's very
interesting to watch the reaction to those two guys. The whole
country's watching.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire jerseys are the hottest-selling item at Going to the
Game, which specializes in sports merchandise. And while a few
Cardinals hats were still in supply, there were no Cubs headgear.
</P>
<P>
   ``His jersey was $65 _ and have been selling since the start of
the season. Then, suddenly, mysteriously, there was a price
change,'' sales clerk Brian Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The jersey now goes for $75.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire wears number 25 on his jersey, but he's No. 1 in the
hearts of collectors. As of Thursday, he led Sosa in the home-run
derby 59 to 56 and has been the season-long favorite to top Maris'
record.
</P>
<P>
   As he has inched toward the mark, McGwire's jersey is not the
only item that has gone up in price.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 1985 Topps rookie card, which pictures him as a member
of the U.S. Olympic team, is a major focus of the home-run mania
that has taken the country by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been flying, actually,'' said Darren Yamashita of
Dave's Dugout, a sports card and merchandise shop in Albany, Calif.
``We recently bumped them to $150 from $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is the man around here. But a lot of people are
looking for Sosa cards, too. We never sold Sosa before the home-run
chase. The craze is not just Mark McGwire. People are buying cheap
Sosa cards.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're buying other players' baseball cards, too, Yamashita
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, baseball cards in general are doing very well
this year,'' he said. ``It's the best year since before the
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Peters of MVP Baseball Cards in St. Ann, Mo. _ about 15
miles from McGwire's home park in St. Louis _ can attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   He said he fields 100 calls a day from people all over the
country asking about that McGwire rookie card, which he sells for
$175 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out of them,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since McGwire's been here over a year, I've sold 15. They've
been tough to get a hold of. No one wants to sell them. But there's
a lot of interest in Sammy Sosa, too, particularly the 1990 Leaf
card. It books at $25 but sells for $50 to $75. It's really
underpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   Even tougher to find are McGwire-autographed items. McGwire is a
reluctant signer and doesn't sell autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold an American League ball about four to five weeks ago
for $100,'' Peters said. ``I imagine now it would go for between
$150 to $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also is feeding America's baseball fever. The
Internet carries Cardinals radio broadcasts through the Cardinals'
Web site, www.stlcardinals.com, or at
broadcast.com/sports/baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' World Wide Web site links to a site that allows
viewers to watch a video of each of McGwire's homers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you clearly have one of the all-time greats in your
industry, the accomplishment does have a halo effect on all the
teams, even if he doesn't play for your team,'' said San Francisco
Giants Vice President Larry Baer. ``Michael Jordan's career was
good for basketball; good for everybody. What's happening with
McGwire and Sosa has captured the imagination of casual fans.''

SMARTEN UP, BUCKLE UP, ENJOY THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seems as if the Fourth of July fireworks have only sputtered out
and here it is Labor Day, the last hurrah of summer vacation. This
weekend, summer goes out with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   For some among us, that bang may be the sound of collision.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you've heard it all before, read it all to the point,
perhaps, of boredom _ wear your seat belts, don't drink and drive
etc., etc. Nag, nag, nag. Still, there are some out there who just
don't get it. I became painfully aware of that fact a couple of
days ago while watching a young woman race by in a car with two
kids standing up in the back peering out the rear window. Nice
view, maybe their last, if Mom has to smack the brakes and they go
flying toward her and the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for seat belts and child restraints is not a
government urge to curtail your freedom or impose restrictions on
your children; the reason is public safety. If you do not wear a
safety restraint in a moving automobile, you are not only at risk
yourself but a threat to someone else _ maybe me.
</P>
<P>
   In a sudden stop _ such as occurs when you plow into another car
_ the belt restrains you during deceleration, otherwise the car
would stop and you'd still be hurtling along at whatever speed.
Hurtling, that is, until you hit something _ the windshield, the
pavement, or perhaps a properly restrained person up front.
</P>
<P>
   Air bags are great, most of the time, but without belts they
don't help much, can be dangerous, directing your unrestrained body
into something unyielding. The belts position you for the bag to
save your face.
</P>
<P>
   The belt also restrains a driver when the car is going out of
control _ skidding, perhaps. Instead of merely hanging onto the
steering wheel to keep from being tossed about, you can actually
attempt corrective action and perhaps succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things to remember this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ That so-called ``package shelf'' under the back window of your
car isn't; the moron who thought that up ought to be sent to
Singapore for proper caning. Things piled on the ``shelf'' cut down
on rear visibilty and, in a collision or sudden stop, are missiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting in a dither because the car in front of you is driven
by a mope isn't likely to speed up the mope _ but it may raise your
blood pressure. Tailgating, honking, and repeated flashing of
lights will only serve to increase your risk, not his speed. If you
control your rage, you are less likely to fall victim to someone
else's rage.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a driver, exercise some discipline within the car. Bring
stuff to amuse the kiddies, and be firm about disturbing behavior _
sibling quarrels, yelling, etc. That goes for adults, too; yells of
any sort can sound like a dire warning and trigger the wrong
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the Golden Rule _ that ``do unto others'' stuff is
the real McCoy. Empower yourself by giving the other driver a
break, surrendering the right of way when appropriate or letting
somebody into the line of traffic. Friendly behavior is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   _ On long trips, stop at least once an hour and get out of the
car. Sitting for hours on end behind the wheel increases fatigue,
dulls your senses and, we now know, increases the risk of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your eyes moving. Check way ahead, check the rear and
side mirrors frequently. Get your passengers involved; note out
loud what you see ahead and what you're doing about it _ they may
join in and point out hazards or traffic changes that you somehow
are missing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alcohol will not sharpen your wits, keen your senses, or
improve your reaction time. It makes you talk funny and act stupid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relying solely on your brakes to slow the car will result in
excessive brake wear and in some cars on a warm day may induce
brake fade _ as in the brakes fade away _ with unpleasant results.
Your car's transmission isn't there just for acceleration. Use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reserve your time in the car for driving _ reading, eating,
drinking, or primping while underway will not help your driving,
but it will make those with whom you share the road nervous.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are stopped by a law enforcement officer, roll down the
window, keep your hands in plain view on the steering wheel, and
tell your passengers to keep their hands visible and their mouths
closed. Be polite; it's your holiday, but he or she is working and
may not be having a great day. Your good nature now could cut down
on your grief later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your brain engaged at all times. In short, smarten up,
lighten up, buckle up, and enjoy the ride.

 EAST  
 
 1. New England Patriots
<TEXT>
<P>
   Head coach:  &LR; Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record:  &LR; 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; RB Robert Edwards, RB Harold Shaw, FB Tony Carter,
FB Chris Floyd, DE Greg Spires, CB Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Class of the division. Deepest roster. Franchise's
best defensive unit in years, perhaps ever. Might lead league in
creating turnovers with solid defensive blitz package that will be
very effective against most opponents. QB Drew Bledsoe will have to
carry the offense. Will look to establish the pass to set up the
run, which will be limited. Special teams improved. Kicking game
excellent with punter Tom Tupa and kicker Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Bledsoe; RB Sedrick Shaw; FB Carter; WRs
Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson; TE Ben Coates; LT Bruce Armstrong;
LG Max Lane; C Dave Wohlabaugh; RG Todd Rucci; RT Zefross Moss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Ferric Collons; LT Chad Eaton; RT Henry
Thomas; RE Willie McGinest; LLB Todd Collins; MLB Ted Johnson; RLB
Chris Slade; LCB Ty Law; RCB Chris Canty; FS Willie Clay; SS Lawyer
Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Special teams:  &LR; K Vinatieri; P Tupa; KR Derrick Cullors; PR
Troy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Miami Dolphins
</P>
<P>
   Head coach:  &LR; Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record:  &LR; 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; G Kevin Donnalley, RB John Avery, CB Patrick
Surtain, DL Kenny Mixon, FS Brock Marion, LB Robert Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook:  &LR; J.J. says this is the best team of his three years in
Miami. Defense much improved, with additions from the draft. Like
the Patriots, Miami has a suspect running game. Johnson brought in
a new offensive coordinator and changed the entire approach to the
run. Key is still QB Dan Marino and keeping him healthy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Marino; RB Karim Abdul-Jabbar; FB Stanley
Pritchett; WRs Charles Jordan and O.J. McDuffie; TE Troy Drayton;
LT Richmond Webb; LG Mark Dixon; C Tim Ruddy; RG Donnalley; RT
James Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Mixon; LT Tim Bowens; RT Daryl Gardener;
RE Jason Taylor; LLB Jones; MLB Zach Thomas; RLB Derrick Rodgers;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Special teams:  &LR; K Olindo Mare; P Klaus Wilmsmeyer; KR Avery; PR
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. New York Jets
</P>
<P>
   Head coach:  &LR; Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record:  &LR; 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; RB Curtis Martin, FB Keith Byars, G Todd Burger, C
Kevin Maewae, LB Bryan Cox, T Jason Fabini, DE Anthony Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook:  &LR; Jets are still thin talentwise. Parcells thinks his
team will run the ball better than a year ago with the addition of
Martin and some new offensive linemen. Special teams will be
outstanding, as they were a year ago. Defense is the problem.
Linebackers are good, but the rest of the unit isn't. Glenn Foley
will start at QB.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Foley; RB Martin; FB Jerald Sowell; WRs
Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet; TE Kyle Brady; LT Jumbo
Elliott; LG Burger; C Maewae; RG Matt O'Dwyer; RT Fabini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Rick Lyle; LT Jason Ferguson; RT Ernie
Logan; RE Pleasant; LLB Mo Lewis; MLB Pepper Johnson; RLB James
Farrior; LCB Aaron Glenn; RCB Otis Smith; FS Kevin Williams; SS
Victor Green.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Special teams:  &LR; K John Hall; P Nick Gallery; KR Glenn; PR Leon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Buffalo Bills
</P>
<P>
   Head coach:  &LR; Wade Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record:  &LR; 6-l0.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; QB Rob Johnson, FB Sam Gash, QB Doug Flutie, WR
Kevin Williams, G Joe Panos, LB Sam Cowart, FB Jonathan Linton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Bills could be the surprise team of the division.
Depends on if Johnson (acquired from Jacksonville) is as good as
they think he can be. New offensive coaching staff and a change in
system. Bills will throw the ball more downfield. No outstanding
WRs. Couldn't run the ball well last year. Lost LB Bryce Paup and
CB Jeff Burris to free agency. Bruce Smith and Ted Washington will
have to come up big on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Johnson; RB Antowain Smith; FB Gash; WRs
Quinn Early and Andre Reed; TE Lonnie Johnson; LT John Fina; LG
Ruben Brown; C Dusty Ziegler; RG Panos; RT Jerry Ostroski.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Phil Hansen; LT Washington; RT Sean
Moran; RE Smith; LLB Sam Rogers; MLB John Holecek; RLB Gabe
Northern; LCB Ken Irvin; RCB Thomas Smith; FS Kurt Schulz; SS Henry
Jones.

<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   5. Indianapolis Colts
</P>
<P>
   Head coach:  &LR; Jim Mora.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record:  &LR; 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces:  &LR; QB Peyton Manning, CB Jeff Burris, CB Tyrone Poole,
OL Tom Myslinski, WR Torrance Small, LB Jeff Herrod, WR Jerome
Pathon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook:  &LR; Colts will go as far as rookie QB Manning takes them.
Team in a major state of transition. GM Bill Polian and head coach
Mora are new and making changes. Offense could be decent. Have some
weapons in RB Marshall Faulk and WR Marvin Harrison. Defense is
weak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Manning; RB Faulk; FB Zack Crockett; WRs
Pathon and Harrison; TE Ken Dilger; LT Tarik Glenn; LG Steve
McKinney; C Jay Leeuwenburg; RG Tony Mandarich; RT Adam Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Al Fontenot; LT Bernard Whittington; RT
Ellis Johnson; RE Dan Footman; LLB Steve Morrison; MLB Herrod; RLB
Elijah Alexander; LCB Burris; RCB Poole; FS Jason Belser; SS Robert
Blackmon.

 &QL; 
 &UR; 1. Pittsburgh Steelers
</P>
<P>
   Head coach: &LR;  Bill Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record: &LR;  11-5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces: &LR;  CB Dewayne Washington, T Chris Conrad, WR Hines
Ward, CB Deshea Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Offensively, should be as good or better than a year
ago. They think their running backs, led by Jerome Bettis, could be
their best group in years. Team will rise or fall with QB Kordell
Stewart. The defense is questionable up front but LBs and DBs are
strong. Should win 10-plus games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Stewart; RB Bettis; FB Jon Witman; TE
Mark Bruener; WRs Charles Johnson and Will Blackwell; LT Will
Wolford; LG Roger Duffy; C Dermontti Dawson; RG Brenden Stai; RT
Justin Strzelczyk.

   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Nolan Harrison; NT Joel Steed; RE Kevin

ROLB Carlos Emmons; LCB Carnell Lake; RCB Washington; SS Lee

</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Jacksonville Jaguars
</P>
<P>
   Head coach: &LR;  Tom Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record: &LR;  11-5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces: &LR;  LB Bryce Paup, C Quentin Neujahr, RB Fred Taylor, S
Donovin Darius, RB Tavian Banks, WR Elvis Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Coughlin's main goals are to stop the run (Terrell
Davis wore them out in the playoffs) and run the ball better.
``We've improved ourselves in both of those areas,'' Coughlin said
this week, ``and we've upgraded our overall team speed.'' Draft
choices Banks from Iowa and Woodard from N.C. State are the two
burners on offense. Banks is a playmaker. QB Mark Brunell is still
the key.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting offense:  &LR; QB Brunell; RB James Stewart; FB Daimon
Shelton; TE Pete Mitchell; WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell; LT
Tony Boselli; LG Ben Coleman; C Neujahr; RG Rick Tylski; RT Leon
Searcy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting defense:  &LR; LE Jeff Lageman; LT John Jurkovic; RT
Renaldo Wynn; RE Tony Brackens; LLB Bryce Paup; MLB Bryan Schwartz;
RLB Kevin Hardy; LCB Aaron Beasley; RCB Dabe Thomas; SS Travis
Davis; FS Chris Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Special teams:  &LR; K Mike Hollis; P Bryan Barker; KR Reggie
Barlow; PR Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Baltimore Ravens
</P>
<P>
   Head coach: &LR;  Ted Marchibroda.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1997 record: &LR;  6-9-1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New faces: &LR;  QB Jim Harbaugh, CB Rod Woodson, RB Roosevelt
Potts, CB Duane Starks, WR-KR Pat Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Outlook:  &LR; Might be the surprise team in the league. Drew raves
from opponents during the exhibition season. Great along the line
of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. Addition of Harbaugh and
his infectious feistiness has put some zip into the offense. Front
seven on defense, headed by outside linebacker Peter Boulware and
inside backer Ray Lewis, can play with anyone in the league.

   ND-MARIS-HOMETOWN (Fargo, N.D.) _ While most of the country is
gripped by irrepressible excitement as Mark McGwire of the St.
Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs move ever closer
to the magic number, people in Fargo are wrestling with more
complicated feelings. They are grateful for the sudden flood of
recognition being paid their cherished hero, but achingly aware it
is more of a requiem than a coronation. It's not just that Roger
Maris, who died in 1985 of lymphatic cancer, was one of their own.
It's also that people from this modest prairie town are moved by
some of the sadder particulars of the Maris story: that he felt
hounded by reporters and denigrated by those who did not want him
to break Babe Ruth's 60-run record in 1961. By Pam Belluck.

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The labor market rebounded in August
as GM workers returned following the strikes' settlement. The
unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent. Payrolls rose by
365,000 jobs, in line with forecasts. Workers' average hourly
earnings, a gauge of business costs, rose half a percent, or 7
cents, after having increased 0.2 percent during July. By Sylvia

   CORPUS-CHRISTI-TOURISM (Corpus Christi, Texas) _ After a
decades-long dependence on natural gas and oil, Corpus Christi,
Texas, was sent reeling when energy prices tumbled during the
1980s. So it decided to spend millions of dollars to build a
tourism industry. A handful of other cities have fashioned
successful tourism industries in recent years through a combination
of vision and good luck, including Branson, Mo., now a country
music capital; Tunica, Miss., which opened casinos; and Sedona,
Ariz., whose rocks and crystals lure hordes of tourists seeking
spiritual growth or physical healing. But in a manner befitting its
status as a socially conservative city, Corpus Christi has gone
about its pursuit of tourists in a methodical manner, spurning
casino gambling and hiring consultants to help point the way. By
Edwin McDowell.

<P>
   It is hard to pity Bill Clinton, whose libidinous waste of
political capital takes the throw-away culture to new depths. But
the spectacle of Clinton in Moscow this week does arouse a kind of
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, doing his best to urge good sense upon a country
that seems committed to nonsense. And yet he could not escape the
suspicion that his leadership is faltering, nor the humiliation,
during his press conference with Boris Yeltsin, of questions about
his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the president does, however well-intentioned, seems
bound to fall under the shadow of Monica Lewinsky. And, because of
Americans' special attitude toward their leaders, it is hard to see
how Clinton can ever hope to break free into the light.
</P>
<P>
   Leading America is harder than leading most countries, and not
just because of its size and power. The president must contend with
a sort of national schizophrenia: Americans want to be led, but
they do not want to be led too much.
</P>
<P>
   One side of America tries to do away with reliance on leadership
by individuals: it checks and balances the president, denying him
even basic powers like the right to appoint his own cabinet freely;
it constantly reminds its chief executive that it aspires to be
ruled not by men but by laws.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, another side of America yearns for
leadership, and its elections are more about individual character
than those of most democracies. While some Americans created a
constrained presidency, others flirted with the idea of drafting
Washington as America's very own King George.
</P>
<P>
   The yearning for leadership, moreover, requires that presidents
do more than merely take the lead in policy. Often personal bearing
matters just as much.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, a poll asked Americans to name the
greatest president since 1800; and although first place went
inevitably to Lincoln, the runner-up was James Garfield, whose main
achievement was to show courage as he lay dying from an assassin's
wound.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan are remembered
as great presidents less for what they did than for what they
symbolized: by youthful vigor or by grandfatherly confidence, they
made Americans feel good.
</P>
<P>
   Now and again, often quite mysteriously, there is a move to
recruit an outsider into the presidency -- someone who seems the
perfect ``leader'' because he fits the national mood. Eisenhower
was swept to power on this kind of sentiment, and Ross Perot was
swept part-way.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his own experience of national adulation, Colin
Powell compared himself to a ``blank screen that people have
projected their fondest image on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the temptation to pity Clinton. The talk that his
leadership is failing seems in one sense unjustified: after all,
even in his worst Lewinsky moments the president's grip on policy
is firmer than Reagan's, his capacity for decisions surer than
Jimmy Carter's.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when the Lewinsky scandal surfaced, Clinton's
administration has led the effort to contain Asia's financial
crisis and to guard the domestic budget surplus from irresponsible
Republican tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But these efforts do not protect Clinton from his critics. For
the talk of failing leadership is not really about the president's
lack of policy achievements in his capacity as the head of
America's government. It is about the manner in which he has
conducted himself as America's head of state.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, no amount of energetic policy-making can restore
Clinton's lost authority.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Clinton presidency therefore over? There is one chance,
albeit a small one, that it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has found, rather to its own surprise, that it adores a
princess who was an adulterer, an anxious bulimic; a princess who
lacked the self-control and dignity traditionally required of the
royal family, but who knew how to empathize.
</P>
<P>
   America, likewise, may find that it can love a president who
causes pain but redeems himself by feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   In times of war or crisis, people want the security of strong
leaders: Churchill, Roosevelt. In times of peace and prosperity,
people see no need for the sacrifices that strong leaders demand of
them. They want fuzzy figureheads: Princess Diana, Tony Blair,
perhaps even Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of months or so, the polls will reveal
whether Americans can indeed forgive Clinton. But, either way, the
prospects for American leadership do not look good.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may decide that they cannot respect a man whose morals
are as fuzzy as those of Clinton: in which case, the president's
clout will be diminished, and (barring impeachment or resignation)
the world will be saddled with an ineffectual American executive
for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, Americans may decide that Clinton's personal
comportment is forgivable. This may seem to hold out the
possibility of more vigorous American leadership: a president with
decent poll ratings can hope to push important measures through
Congress, such as a replenishment of the IMF's coffers or
entitlement reform.
</P>
<P>
   But this hope may well be disappointed. For Americans'
acceptance of Clinton would reflect a complacent sense of security,
a delusion that the world is free of challenges for which strong
leadership is needed. This dreamy kind of optimism cannot sustain
American leadership for long.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a reminder of an uncomfortable truth about the
Clinton presidency which is often overlooked. To a great degree,
Clinton's failings are those of his country.
</P>
<P>
   His generation has grown up in peace and prosperity; it has
little appetite for traditional authority; it wants to lead the
world only if this can be done with little sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   All these attitudes suffuse Clinton's style of government. He is
a mix of computer-age wonk and Oprah-age sympathizer; he has mocked
traditional conceptions of presidential dignity by answering
questions on television about his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Lewinsky scandal, Clinton was more a seminar
chairman than a leader. If Americans stick with him, they will be
signalling an unwillingness to stomach anything more robust than
that.

WITH MARTIN GONE, PRESSURE ON EDWARDS, SHAW, TO MAKE GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ On Robert Edwards's first carry last
Saturday night against the Eagles, the back took a handoff from
Drew Bledsoe and _ a nanosecond later _ was hammered for a 3-yard
loss. A lineman had missed his block and it was Edwards who paid
for the sin.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, it was Edwards who circled out of the
backfield and caught a pass _ on his fingertips _ from Bledsoe,
even though two Eagles were lined up and ready to hammer him.
Edwards got hammered, indeed, but he held onto the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held onto that pass,'' said New England fullback Tony
Carter. ``That's what you look for in a rookie _ that he's going to
be hard-nosed.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, as so it will go this season with the Patriots and
their running backs. Hit or miss, hit a hole when a hole is there,
or get hammered when a block is missed.
</P>
<P>
   On one play in that first quarter, Edwards slithered off left
tackle but Carter missed his lead block and Edwards was stopped for
no gain. On another play, Edwards went right, made a nifty cut, and
ran inside a seam for a 9-yard gain. Hit or miss. Miss (a block)
and be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just won't know that until we're done with the season,''
said Bledsoe, when asked how much the Patriots will miss Curtis
Martin in 1998. ``It just depends on how well we do up front and
how well Sedrick (Shaw) and Robert (Edwards) do carrying the
load.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so intertwined, just as Bledsoe's reply was intertwined.
Whether the line blocks well will determine if Shaw and Edwards run
well.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was last season with Curtis Martin, and the year
before, and the year before that. Even when Martin was gaining his
thousands of yards, the Patriots' ground game still was not
consistent. Few outside the locker room at Foxboro Stadium would
argue that the New England running game was dependable, that it
absolutely could be counted on to get those 2 yards on third and 2
and that 1 yard on fourth and 1. Remember first and goal against
the Packers last season?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to finish last season without Curtis so we knew (what
it took from the team),'' said Bledsoe. ``The good thing was, we
went into this year knowing we didn't have him. So we were able to
make a contingency plan and get other guys involved right from the
start. Whereas last year you're counting on one guy and then he
goes down and then all of a sudden you're scrambling. This year we
know what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Edwards has potential. The rookie has a similar body
and style to another running back from Georgia _ yes, the Broncos'
Terrell Davis _ and some even see a hint of another powerful
Georgia running back, Herschel Walker. Edwards is tough, has hands,
and may be a good running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played well (last Saturday),'' said Carter, who
conceded he kept a close eye on the rookie because he may be
blocking for him all season. ``He hit the ball into the holes and
that's what you're looking for. He looked like he's going to stick
it up into the hole and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   What Carter likes about Edwards ``is that he's strong and he
makes guys miss. He runs with power and he used good leverage, and
those are all things that show he's going to be a good running
back. He's got speed, too, so he's got the big-play potential, but
he's also a guy who can hit it up between the tackles when he has
to go inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as impressive as his style, Carter said, was Edwards's
mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty cool out there. That's what I'm saying. I'm sure
his heart was beating pretty good the first couple of plays, but
then he settled down and realized it's the same game no matter
where you play it, high school or college or here.''
</P>
<P>
   For center Dave Wohlabaugh and the rest of the line, it will be
a learning experience as the backs learn about the line and the
line learns about the backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a real extreme contrast in backs, like if you go
from Sedrick Shaw, who's running downhill and he's hitting the line
hard or Curtis Martin, who was making cuts in the backfield, then
it's different. But now we have two backs who are really similar;
they're a little different here and there, but I don't think it's a
big difference in their styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shaw and Edwards, he went on, ``seem to hit the holes
really hard, and then try to make something happen after that. They
seem similar. That's what you hope for, anyway; hit the hole and
hope to get 4 (yards), and then if you get more than that, it's a
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth _ at least for the early part of the season _ the
expectations for the New England running game are minimal. Just let
the running game be good enough so that there is merely a semblance
of balance between running and passing, so defenses can't load up
against the Patriots' passing game, their strength, and ignore a
weak running game. Just be good enough to keep defenses slightly
honest. Anything more, at least early on, would be a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always get better,'' said Wohlabaugh, when asked to
reply to the many critics of the New England running game. ``You're
always trying to get better but, at the same time, we've gotten
progressively better every game. That's what preseason really is
for. But we've made strides while knowing that we can get better.
We at least have established a benchmark to go from.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the questions about the Patriots' running game is the
fact that the defense is so good that, except when New England is
playing the very best teams, it will have the luxury of bringing
along its running game. The Patriots will not be behind, 21-0, in
the first half, so they seldom will have to abandon the running
game completely just to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the exhibition season, as coach Pete Carroll conceded,
there was concern because the Patriots could neither pass nor run.
Drew Bledsoe and his receivers were learning yet another new
offensive system and against the 49ers and Vikings, the learning
process was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first couple of (exhibition) games, it didn't look
like we would be able to hit anybody in the throwing game,'' said
Carroll. ``But Drew's into it now. It took a few weeks to get
going, and I feel much better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Patriot fans should take the long view about this
offense and this running game. The offense is in much the same
position as the defense was at the start of last season _ learning
a new system _ and the Patriot defense didn't finally jell until
December.
</P>
<P>
   New England has a workmanlike back in Shaw and a rookie with
potential in Edwards, and expectations among Patriot fans and
around the NFL are so low that the most likely scenario is this:
the Patriot running game will be a surprise, possibly even
surprisingly good.

</P>
<P>
   Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, Ingrid
Bergman had to walk into Humphrey Bogart's in Casablanca. And ever
since, Casablanca has been a romantic place somewhere out there in
the imagination of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Casablanca, the biggest city and main port of
Morocco, is intensely romantic _ faded, languid and vaguely
decadent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you ask residents, they will most often tell you that
their city is just another disagreeable metropole with too many
people and too many cars and that you'd be far better off setting
out for the more authejtic Morocco _ Marrakesh and Fez, say.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Casa, as they call it, seem hardly to notice that
they are living in an Art Deco museum, with some austere French
Colonial buildings mixed in. To them, the muezzin's soulful call to
prayer is as ordinary"as the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And the(daily tide of veiled women and desert tribesmen, and
others in tatters, jeans and the latest designer stuff barely
merits a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, which was a small town when the French made it the
commercial capital of their protectorate in 1912, is clearly not
ancient. And it is not entirely Moroccan in body and qoul. But none
of that makes it mundane.
</P>
<P>
   It is a whitewashed city of sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants
with bazaars where you can bargain for carpets and hand-painted
plates or just lose yourself among sacks of spices, baked sheep's
heads and Hermes knockoffs. And if you like to rock, Casablanca has
a club for you.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring modern legend is that Bkgie never set foot in
Casablanca (the movie was shot in Hollywood). But his latest
biographers, A. Sperber and Eric Lax, say it isn't so. According to
them, Bogie dropped by in 1943, siortly after the Allied landing in
Morocco and the release of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   $But there has never been a Rick's. The Hyatt Regency Hotel has
tried, with its Casablanca Bar, a wicker and mahogany refuge with
ceiling fans. But the real Casablanca, just outside, is a lot more
exciting.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ben M'Sik Theater Festival takes place Sept. 3 to 15, with
companies from 28 countries, including France, Italy and England.
Tickets will range from about $2.35 to $4.70 (at the rate of 8.4
dirham to the dollar), and can be bought at the performance sites,
including the Moulay Rachid Theater, Avenue Akim Allam; phone
(212-2) 70-23-49.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the festival, Dar America, the American cultural
center, at 10 Place Bel-Air, will present two performances of
``Stuff as Dreams Are Made On,'' a one-man adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Tempest,'' by Fred Curchack, a University of Texas

   The WAFA Bank has collected 500 modern Moroccan paintings and
rotates them through the gallery at its headquarters at 163 Avenue
Hassan II. The gallery, which also shows foreign art, is open daily
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco architecture of Casablanca is so plentiful that you
don't have to work at seeing it. A relaxed way to take in some and
enjoy the street life is to stroll east along Mohammed V Boulevard
from the Place des Nations Unies in the heart of the city, by the
Old Medina with its landmark clock tower, wandering off on side
streets when the fancy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn down the Rue Mohammed Qori, for example, and you'll find
the Rialto Theater, whose interior has been renovated in modern
style. It presents first-run films and live performances in its
1,000-seat auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   At the Place Mohammed V, the post office, the police prefecture
and the Palace of Justice are examples of the neo-Mauresque style
of French architects in the 1920s and 1930s, rich with arches,
columns and tiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the north end of the quiet, thickly wooded League of Arab
Nations Park on Boulevard Hachidi is Paul Tornon's Sacred Heart
Cathedral, closed for years, but a towering 1930s Art Deco wonder
of soaring stone spires that El Greco might have dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's great visual delights is the corniche, the
oceanfront boulevard that looks out on the freighters and derricks
in the port, the remains of an old fortress, the towering Hassan II
Mosque, nightclubs, hotels and miles of beaches and rolling surf.
</P>
<P>
   At the vast, somewhat scruffy public beaches, packed with
humanity, young men gallop along the water's edge chasing soccer
balls. The few women sit together chatting, fully clothed. But at
private beach clubs like the Miami, which charge a few dollars to
enter, the standard is more Monaco than Mecca, and foreigners and
less traditional Arab women take the sun in bikinis by half a dozen
sparkling swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Casablanca's two main bazaars comes close to the
teeming maze of passageways of the one in Marrakesh, with its snake
charmers and medicine men. But the one in the walled Old Medina,
which dates from the 18th century and is across from the Hyatt
Regency, is a working market with lots of practical goods, like
bargain shirts and shoes, and gives a peek at the daily life of
ordinary Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar in the New Medina, which is merely about 65 years old
and is in the Habous neighborhood, 10 minutes or so by taxi south
of Place des Nations Unies, is a real tourist center, unnaturally
spic and span and orderly, with stacks of brass trays, ceramics and
rugs. It is mostly souvenirs, but some shops offer antique jewelry,
old knives and occasionally, a memorable rug.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints about Casablanca is that it has no
museums. But the Hassan II Mosque, opened only five years ago,
comes pretty close to filling that gap. Its angular minaret,
visible throughout the city, soars 60 stories and its interior is a
tour de force of craftsmanship: walls and ceiling covered with
mosaic tiles, intricately carved wood and stucco.
</P>
<P>
   Three-story-high Venetian crystal chandeliers _ among the few
imports in the mosque _ are virtually swallowed up beneath the
180-foot-high vaulted ceiling, one of the high-tech features. It
slides open and, when the wind picks up, the two halves are quietly
closed by computers.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque also shoots a laser beam of light nearly 20 miles
toward Mecca, and has electrically warmed marble floors. There are
several tours daily for visitors.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Room rates often turn out to be negotiable, and some of the
least expensive hotels are charming.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Idou Anfa, with 220 rooms in plain, European modern,
at 85 Boulevard d'Anfa, (212-2) 20-01-36, fax (212-2) 20-00-09,
makes up in efficiency what it lacks in ambiance. Though the
switchboard is not geared for computers, there is cable television
in every room. Views from the high floors sweep across the city to
the sea. Doubles are $86.
</P>
<P>
   Out at the beach, 15 minutes from downtown, double rooms at the
51-room Hotel de La Corniche, with its angular Art Deco concrete
and marble and gold trim, cost $58; (212-2) 36-10-11, fax (212-2)
39-11-10.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The Hotel Bellerive, on the ocean drive, a few doors
from Hotel de la Corniche, is an Art Deco gem with 35 commodious
rooms with high ceilings, 14 of them with small sitting areas
looking out to sea over a terrace cafe, a park and a good-sized
pool. Doubles are about $45; (212-2) 39-14-09, fax (212-2)
39-34-93.
</P>
<P>
   Across Place des Nations Unies from the Old Medina is the
80-year-old Hotel Excelsior, at 2 Rue el Amraoui Brahim, (212-2)
20-02-63. It has 60 rooms and a lovely curving stairway leading up
from the dark-wood lobby. The rooms are large and clean, but expect
no frills except breakfast in doubles for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Royal Mansour at 27 Avenue de l'Armee Royale,
(212-2) 31-30-12, fax (212-2) 31-48-18, offers spacious doubles
from $225 and a five-room suite from $3,570. Managed by the French
Meridien chain, this 182-room hotel boasts a spectacular arched
entrance, a soaring pillared lounge and mosaic-tiled corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 251-room Hyatt Regency, on the Place des Nations
Unies, (212- 2) 26-12-34, fax (212-2) 22-01-80, doubles start at
about $230. The rooms are big, with contemporary furnishings, and
amenities include a pool and a fitness center.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best Moroccan food is served in Arabian Nights-style
restaurants, with colorful inlaid tiles, filigreed stucco and,
sometimes, fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Menus feature tagines, stews of lamb or chicken with olives,
prunes, lemons and onions; incredible pastries called pastillas,
stuffed with cinnamon, pigeon and almonds and topped with powdered
sugar; and the national dish, couscous _ steamed cracked-wheat
semolina, usually with raisins and chickpeas, and piled high with
lamb, chicken or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of these restaurants is Al-Mounia, at 95 Rue du
Prince Moulay-Abdallah, (212-2) 22-26-69. There, dinner for two
with a bottle of Moroccan wine is about $65.
</P>
<P>
   In the same price range is the excellent Ryad Zitoun, at 31
Boulevard Rachidi, (212-2) 22-39-27. The restaurant features the
simple rose-colored walls typical of Marrakesh rather than the
ornate local style.
</P>
<P>
   For about $45, two can dine on grilled shrimp and fillets of
local fish under the ceiling fans of the Taverne du Dauphin, at 115
Boulevard Houphouet-Boigny, within sight of the main entrance to
the port; (212-2) 27-79-79.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of Restaurante Au Petit Poucet, with its white
tablecloths, crystal sconces and gauzy curtains in the shade of one
of the arcaded sidewalks downtown at 86 Boulevard Mohammed V, boast
that Antoine de St.-Exupery was a regular when he flew airmail
around North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fixed lunch and dinner menu, with soup, a choice of
steak, chicken or fish, dessert and a cocktail for an astounding $9
each; (212-2) 27-54-20.
 &UR; NIGHT LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things get pretty quiet in downtown Casablanca by 10 p.m. or so.
But the hot spots on the Corniche _ the playground of well-to-do
Moroccans, other Arabs and Europeans _ don't even open until near
midnight. Most nights at most places, the pricey drinks _ $7.50 for
a beer, $11 for the best scotch _ are the only admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clubs, L'Armstrong, is a paneled and raw-brick,
slightly hard-to-find subterranean room at 41 Boulevard de la
Corniche, (212-2) 39-76-56. The music is rock-n-roll, country,
blues or jazz, whatever the singing manager, Albert Cohen, can
arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The Fandango, at the Rue de la Mer Egee-sur La Corniche, (212-2)
39-85-08, and Le Cafconce, at 10 Rue de la Mer Adriatique, (212-2)
94-42-33, are pleasantly decorated villas with soft lighting and
the easy feel of a friend's home. If Bogie were operating in
Casablanca today, the Fandango might be his place.

</P>
<P>
   Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, Ingrid
Bergman had to walk into Humphrey Bogart's in Casablanca. And ever
since, Casablanca has been a romantic place somewhere out there in
the imagination of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Casablanca, the biggest city and main port of
Morocco, is intensely romantic _ faded, languid and vaguely
decadent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you ask residents, they will most often tell you that
their city is just another disagreeable metropole with too many
people and too many cars and that you'd be far better off setting
out for the more authentic Morocco _ Marrakesh and Fez, say.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Casa, as they call it, seem hardly to notice that
they are living in an Art Deco museum, with some austere French
Colonial buildings mixed in. To them, the muezzin's soulful call to
prayer is as ordinary as the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And the daily tide of veiled women and desert tribesmen, and
others in tatters, jeans and the latest designer stuff barely
merits a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, which was a small town when the French made it the
commercial capital of their protectorate in 1912, is clearly not
ancient. And it is not entirely Moroccan in body and soul. But none
of that makes it mundane.
</P>
<P>
   It is a whitewashed city of sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants
with bazaars where you can bargain for carpets and hand-painted
plates or just lose yourself among sacks of spices, baked sheep's
heads and Hermes knockoffs. And if you like to rock, Casablanca has
a club for you.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring modern legend is that Bogie never set foot in
Casablanca (the movie was shot in Hollywood). But his latest
biographers, A. Sperber and Eric Lax, say it isn't so. According to
them, Bogie dropped by in 1943, shortly after the Allied landing in
Morocco and the release of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been a Rick's. The Hyatt Regency Hotel has
tried, with its Casablanca Bar, a wicker and mahogany refuge with
ceiling fans. But the real Casablanca, just outside, is a lot more
exciting.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ben M'Sik Theater Festival takes place Sept. 3 to 15, with
companies from 28 countries, including France, Italy and England.
Tickets will range from about $2.35 to $4.70 (at the rate of 8.4
dirham to the dollar), and can be bought at the performance sites,
including the Moulay Rachid Theater, Avenue Akim Allam; phone
(212-2) 70-23-49.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the festival, Dar America, the American cultural
center, at 10 Place Bel-Air, will present two performances of
``Stuff as Dreams Are Made On,'' a one-man adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Tempest,'' by Fred Curchack, a University of Texas
drama professor. Information: (212-2) 22-14-60.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9 at 8 p.m., the jazz duo of Tom Wolfe on guitar and
Rick Condit on saxophone will play at La F.O.L. (Lay Charities
Foundation), 16 Avenue Moussa Ibn Noussair, (212-2) 26-67-51.
Condit, a former soloist with the Stan Kenton Orchestra, and Wolfe
are American college professors. Free; contact Dar America.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Over the years, we have spent the year-end holidays sightseeing
London, cruising on board the Mississippi Queen, seeing the
Rockettes perform in New York City and cheering on the Northwestern
Wildcats in Pasadena, Calif., during one of their two Rose Bowl
appearances in half a century. Wherever we go during the holidays,
we find other mature travelers who also choose to celebrate the
season on the road.
 &HT;    The lure of a holiday trip is not the same for everyone. For
some mature travelers, it's a way to let succeeding generations
develop their own Christmas customs. For other travelers, family
members may be few or far-flung.
 &HT;    For especially large families, central destinations such as
Nashville's Opryland can offer a place to gather without hassle or
stress. And, of course, for the inveterate traveler, it's a way to
see favorite places in a new way _ all dressed up for the season.
 &HT;    Now is the time to book holiday tours or cruises. Because of
their growing popularity, people who wait too long to make
reservations are likely to be disappointed.
 &HT;    Travel company catalogs feature holiday tours to places such as
Branson, Mo., San Antonio, Texas, Williamsburg, Va., the Christmas
markets in Germany, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Vienna,
Austria. Other possibilities include Kenya wildlife safaris and
Caribbean, Mediterranean or Pacific cruises.
 &HT;    Here is a sampling of great places and tours for your holiday
trip:
 &HT;     _ Saga Holidays,  which packages tours just for those 49-plus,
has a special Christmas in London tour for singles and a Danube
River Christmas cruise. Also on its menu of holiday destinations
are old favorites such as Palm Springs, Calif., and San Antonio,
Texas. Many of its trips do not require a single supplement.
 &HT;    The London tour features a walking tour of Dickensian London,
Christmas Eve with caroling and an evening at the theater. The
price, which includes round-trip airfare, is $2,149 from New York
or $2,349 from San Francisco. For more information, call (800)
343-0273.
 &HT;     _ Holland-America  offers 11 different itineraries for holiday
cruises ranging from seven to 16 days, with new ports of call at
Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala; Hualtulco, Mexico; and Virgin Gorda and
Tortola, British Virgin Islands.
 &HT;    Holiday cruises feature caroling, an international crew choir
and a visit from Santa. Seven-day Christmas cruises, double
occupancy, start at $1,381. Call your travel agent or

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Walt Disney World in Orlando is the grand prize of American
tourism. But a vacation there does not come cheaply.
 &HT;    Adding up the cost of admission tickets, parking, eating and a
couple of T-shirts, the average family of four can spend $360 per
day in the land of Mickey and Minnie. And that's before factoring
in the cost of hotel accommodation, car rental and air fares.
 &HT;    ``It can be a very expensive vacation,'' says Bob Sehlinger, the
author of ``The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 1998,''
(Macmillan, 1998; $15.95), a jampacked 742-page bible for
Disney-goers.
 &HT;    ``We're geared for travelers who really want to get their
money's worth,'' he says. ``My average readers are very organized
and button-down. But they're intimidated by the destination. It's
twice as big as Manhattan, with four major theme parks and three
minor ones. They want to be in control before they set foot in the
place.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger, who's been authoring this guide since 1985, has
become an expert on planning a vacation in Walt Disney World. He
extols the merits of traveling during low season, which runs from
September to mid-December, except Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    He ranks all the hotels _ both inside and outside ``the World,''
as it's known. Accommodations outside the park may lack Disney's
magic, he contends, but they almost always give better value.
 &HT;    Sehlinger rates Disney's full-service restaurants. He gives
strategies for those with small children, honeymooners, couples and
single travelers. And he gives specific itineraries for touring
each park within Walt Disney World.
 &HT;    ``Our research methodology is very unique,'' Sehlinger says of
himself and his staff. ``Most of us come from business backgrounds
and about half are MBAs. We use a scientific approach and do
sophisticated survey work. And we've worked on queuing theory.
That's another way of saying that there's got to be a better way to
go through this place than standing in the sun all day.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger's guide is a statistical marvel. He's figured out down
to the minute how to beat the crowds with early admission, how to
cope if a line proves to be too long and when and where to eat.
 &HT;    He's also figured out, based on the number of people standing in
line at a given attraction, how long a wait will be. At ```Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids' Movie Set Adventure Playground,'' a line of 100
people means a 20-minute wait.
 &HT;    At ``New York Street Backlot,'' 100 people in line signifies
almost no wait, because this attraction can process people faster.
 &HT;    ``We had a platoon of researchers with stopwatches who hung out
inconspicuously and monitored line lengths,'' Sehlinger explains.
``We produced flow charts of how the traffic was moving, how it
dispersed and what it did during the course of the day.''
 &HT;    ``We had a test group and a control group who started at the
same time,'' he adds. ``The control group had never been to the
park before and toured according to their own plan. Their only
instruction was to see as much as was humanly possible in a single
day.''
 &HT;    When Sehlinger compared groups, he discovered that on a day when
the park has an average to high attendance of, say, 40,000 people,
the group using his plan at the Magic Kingdom spent three hours and
10 minutes less time standing in line than the other group.
 &HT;    ``People feel a lot of pressure to maximize their time,''
Sehlinger says. ``In some cases, they're almost obsessive about
squeezing value out of their vacation.''
 &HT;    While conceding that having and using such a rigorous plan is
not as necessary in low season, Sehlinger says, ``The bottom line
is that the place is large and overwhelming and Disney is
hyperorganized. If you go, you have to have a plan. If you don't,
whatever spontaneity you have is going to be lost standing in a
line.''
 &HT;    A visit to Disney World with the family is often not a relaxing
vacation. Sehlinger notes that many people tell him they need a
vacation after their vacation to recover.
 &HT;    ``It's important to get your butt out of there during the hot,
crowded part of the day,'' he advises. ``Take a nap, swim, eat.
People think that they have to see a theme park from opening to
closing, and they hit the wall after two or three days. They're
just flat wiped out and not having much fun.''
 &HT;    But for all of Sehlinger's organizing, there are the naysayers _
those who contend that such planning and strategizing are the very
antithesis of a vacation.
 &HT;    Sehlinger admits there are the ``type Bs.''
 &HT;    ``They stop and enjoy the architecture and people-watch,'' he
says. ``They draw the line, no pun intended, at standing in a queue
for hours and hours. That's how my sister goes. She never uses a
plan and she loves the atmosphere. Being there is good enough for
her.''
 &HT;    But for the readers who write to him ``with a certain amount of
rebellion and glee when they circumvent regimentation,''
Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

inconspicuously and monitored line lengths,'' Sehlinger explains.
``We produced flow charts of how the traffic was moving, how it
dispersed and what it did during the course of the day.''
 &HT;    ``We had a test group and a control group who started at the
same time,'' he adds. ``The control group had never been to the
park before and toured according to their own plan. Their only
instruction was to see as much as was humanly possible in a single
day.''
 &HT;    When Sehlinger compared groups, he discovered that on a day when
the park has an average to high attendance of, say, 40,000 people,
the group using his plan at the Magic Kingdom spent three hours and
10 minutes less time standing in line than the other group.
 &HT;    ``People feel a lot of pressure to maximize their time,''
Sehlinger says. ``In some cases, they're almost obsessive about
squeezing value out of their vacation.''
 &HT;    While conceding that having and using such a rigorous plan is
not as necessary in low season, Sehlinger says, ``The bottom line
is that the place is large and overwhelming and Disney is
hyperorganized. If you go, you have to have a plan. If you don't,
whatever spontaneity you have is going to be lost standing in a
line.''
 &HT;    A visit to Disney World with the family is often not a relaxing
vacation. Sehlinger notes that many people tell him they need a
vacation after their vacation to recover.
 &HT;    ``It's important to get your butt out of there during the hot,
crowded part of the day,'' he advises. ``Take a nap, swim, eat.
People think that they have to see a theme park from opening to
closing, and they hit the wall after two or three days. They're
just flat wiped out and not having much fun.''
 &HT;    But for all of Sehlinger's organizing, there are the naysayers _
those who contend that such planning and strategizing are the very
antithesis of a vacation.
 &HT;    Sehlinger admits there are the ``type Bs.''
 &HT;    ``They stop and enjoy the architecture and people-watch,'' he
says. ``They draw the line, no pun intended, at standing in a queue
for hours and hours. That's how my sister goes. She never uses a
plan and she loves the atmosphere. Being there is good enough for
her.''
 &HT;    But for the readers who write to him ``with a certain amount of
rebellion and glee when they circumvent regimentation,''
Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

QUIET MARTIN COPES WITH NOISE OF THE CITY _ AND HIS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ He always thought there were too many sirens
screeching through the air and echoing off miles and miles of
pavement. Too many busy people, transmitting nothing but attitude
as they walked too fast on the sidewalks. Too many angry faces
behind him in traffic, peering over steering wheels and leaning on
horns because he ... because he ... well, he wasn't sure what he
had done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembers the time he was in his car in Manhattan waiting
for a red light to turn green, which is what any decent driver
would do. Except the guy behind him didn't understand why he wasn't
moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stopped at a red light,'' Curtis Martin says, ``and
there's this beeping at me to go through it. I'm like, `It's too
busy, too ``rushy'' over here; they don't even stop for red
lights.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was a couple years ago, long before the running back's
paychecks began to say something that he never expected: New York
Jets. Martin used to hate New York. He is a peaceful man, so much
so that he doesn't even watch football when he isn't playing it.
Ask him about his most memorable plays and he'll tell you about a
great one that they draw up each night 'round about Broadway. It's
called ``Beauty and the Beast.'' He tells you that ``the animation
is incredible; it's my favorite. It's between that and `The Lion
King.'''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic could say that Martin, the former Patriot, had a $36
million reason to come here and be screamed at in traffic. But that
would be ignoring Martin's demeanor as well as the fact that the
Patriots offered him a $20 million contract in March. No, Martin
did not come here to be yelled at by an accountant from Queens or a
small-business owner from the Bronx. He came here anticipating
that, when he runs through the traffic of linemen and linebackers
on NFL fields, he would once again hear the familiar shouts of a
New Jersey loudmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me to be a north-south runner, taught me to hit the
hole, to take what you can get and don't always try to make
everybody miss,'' Martin says of the man who, you get the feeling,
could hold his own in a Road Rage Debate. ``He told me to run
through people, break arm tackles, and don't get tackled by one
man. Just a lot of different things that he instilled in me. When
I'm going on the field sometimes I can hear his voice saying,
`Curtis', cursing at me or whatever and saying, `Do this! Do that!'
A lot of times it just rings; his voice rings in the back of my
mind when I'm out there running sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   And when contract time came in New England last winter and
spring, Bill Parcells rang up Martin's agent, Eugene Parker, and
said he wanted the quiet man from western Pennsylvania to play in
noisy New York City. Or so Martin thought. New York was such a blur
to him that he hadn't even considered that 40 minutes away from the
city lies a mellow community near the Jets' training and practice
facilities. Martin lives five minutes away from Hofstra University.
Most of the time, it's quiet. The noise? He can deal with that. He
recently went back to Manhattan to see the energetic ``Bring In Da
Noise, Bring In Da Funk'' and to have dinner at a restaurant owned
by pop singer Puff Daddy. So there's always enough noise. And when
he's at work, he can always count on the noise brought by that loud
Jersey guy, Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he thinks of it, ``I'm really enjoying New York now.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odd couple reunion
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, isn't it, that these men would like each other so?
Parcells knows the history of running backs, the mannerisms of
running backs, and the psyche of running backs. The only running
backs Martin knew were Walter Payton and Tony Dorsett. The only
thing he knew about Parcells before he met him in 1995 was that,
``I used to play with his New York Giants on those old Nintendo
games when I was a kid. The defense was always dominating on that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin wasn't even a football fan growing up in Pittsburgh. The
only reason he liked running outside as a youngster was the
enjoyment he got from ``juking'' his friends and taunting, ``You
can't catch me'' in games of ``Tag.'' One time he couldn't juke
like he wanted and a persistent little girl chasing him caused him
to lose his balance in the rain and bang his noggin on the
concrete. He earned a cut over an eye for that move. That's far
from a classic running back story. You think the gruff Parcells was
hard on Terry Glenn, whom he tried to insult by calling him
``she''? What would he have said if he heard that Martin story?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not a real big football fan,'' Martin says. ``I
watch a lot of tapes and films for my job. But I'm not big on
sitting down and watching other teams play. I'm not into stats and
all that. I wasn't a fan of too many other sports, either. When I
was younger, I was just into ... I think I was a fan of women.
Girls. You know?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as a teenager. When you want to dress nicely and all
that, going through those stages. I was just a little knucklehead.
Thankfully, I have changed my ways from back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of his closest friends now is a woman. Her name is
Toni Braxton. She's a famous singer. But, Martin reminds, ``She's
not going to be blocking for me on Sunday (against the 49ers).''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Parcells gushed about the great Earl Campbell
saying, ``Now, there was a man among boys.'' And: ``You give me one
guy and let me coach him; that's the guy; I loved him.'' And:
``Some of these guys now, you tackle them three times they're out
for a month. That's the truth.'' The coach breathes football, often
researching the game's factoids in his spare time. Parcells has
researched so much that he knows there is no formula to being a
great running back. So if he has a guy who cringes at noise, loves
``Beauty and the Beast'' and reads Bibles more than playbooks, it's
no problem. As long as that man is capable of rushing for 3,799
yards and 32 touchdowns in only three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at that position,'' Parcells said of running back,
``it is by far the least predictable because there is no prototype.
It's just results. Some guys can do it and some guys can't do it.
Who is the prototype running back? I don't think you can say
physiologically this guy is the guy. There are some: the Gayle
Sayerses, the O.J. Simpsons. But then there are Tony Dorsetts and
Barry Sanderses and Jim Browns. All shapes and sizes of guys who
have been successful at that position. There is just some innate
ability to run the ball in traffic; some innate instinct that a lot
of them have and most of them don't have. When you see a player
that has it, it's really fairly obvious to you.''

 HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.: ... obvious to you.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin is just under 6 feet and has been the same weight, 205
pounds, since his junior year in college. Earlier this week he
planned to go home and eat a huge meal featuring green beans,
collard greens, potato salad, yams, fish, and either banana pudding
or peach cobbler. After all that, he knows he won't be able to gain
a pound. In many ways, he doesn't fit the part of the punishing
runner. But his coach is smart enough to know it doesn't make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically like a guy who, what I would call, has a Delco
look; built to last. Know what I mean?'' Parcells said. ``I like
those kind of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin doesn't look that way. Neither does another slightly
built runner Parcells mentioned while speaking of his favorite
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at him and say, `This guy's going to play?','' the
coach said of former Raider and Chief Marcus Allen. ``I remember,
it was in 1982 in Tampa. We're down there at the Combine looking at
players: Terry Kinard, Darrell Green, Richard Dent. I remember the
whole group of guys ... You tell me 15 years later (Allen's) still
going to be playing? Any scout who tells you they knew that is
hallucinating. No one knew. You just look at him you say, ``This
guy is high cut, he's going to take a lot of hits, he's slender ...
He could just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin can just do it, too. The Patriots can tell you about
that, but maybe not as candidly as they should. The statistics that
Martin was never into tell you that he averaged 4 yards a carry
during his Patriots career. What the stats don't tell you is that
he was a constant threat to run the field. The Patriots don't have
anyone like that now. Parcells does. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strictly business
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My contract had been an issue for two or three years prior to
me coming here, so uh, when that time came around, I just said,
`I'm going to pray about it. If I'm to be here, I'll be here. If
I'm not, I'll be elsewhere,''' Martin is saying.
</P>
<P>
   He knows New Englanders are interested in his story. He knows
many of them are asking themselves, ``Why New York?'' Many of them
don't even have an inexplicable horn-blowing-at-red-light story to
explain their dislike of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I just didn't imagine playing anywhere else but
New England. I thought it was the team I would play for the rest of
my life,'' he says. ``Parcells, he was the only other coach I would
consider playing for.''
</P>
<P>
   But why leave New England? And what of the stories coming out of
Foxborough, Mass.? Stories of the Patriots not being able to talk
to you personally when they needed to?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had left things to my agent by that point,'' Martin says.
``It was already very late in the game. I was praying about it and
always believed someway, somehow things would work out because, you
know, my faith is in God. It wasn't the factor of money or anything
like that. I mean, I played there for three years making basically
the minimum and performed at a fair level. I never conditioned my
play to my salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the situation here came up, my agent said, `Curt, I want
you to chill out and relax. You don't need to talk to anyone right
now. Just play the background and I'm going to work on a few
things.' I have nothing against anyone. We were just in the middle
of handling business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Pete Carroll or Bobby Grier or Robert Kraft?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he says. ``I hope they don't feel that way, either.
Sometimes change is a good thing. Change is a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And his former teammates?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm close to a lot of people. Jimmy Hitchcock was my roommate,
but he's gone now. Sam Gash was my boy, also. Ty Law, Lawyer
(Milloy), Willie McGinest, Chris Slade, all of them; they're all my
boys. Shawn Jefferson, Terry Glenn, Drew (Bledsoe). They're all
cool. I miss those guys. We operated as a team, a family. We were
building a family.''
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe it will be weird playing against them next month at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he says, ``it won't be weird; it will be fun. Like when
Parcells came down last year and we faced him, it was like playing
against your brother. You want to go out and take it to a whole,
other level.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Source of inspiration
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, Martin will get a chance to do just that. After a
one-year break, he will be back with Parcells. The coach promises
that Martin will not run the ball 30 times per game, although
Martin says he wants to touch the ball as often as possible. Guess
who put that hunger in him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it started when I had something like six carries for 4
yards against Denver (in '95),'' Martin says, smiling now. ``I
didn't get the first down on a fourth-and-1, and I think he was mad
at me. He sat me on the bench the next game and I was there
thinking, `I can't sit on the bench. That's just not me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself that if I got a chance again, I wasn't going to
lose yards. I knew I would have to get those fourth-and-1s, even
though (Steve) Atwater popped me pretty good to keep from getting
it. But it was miserable sitting on the bench. I think Parcells
knew it would tick me off and inspire me. He knew what I was
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended that season with five consecutive 100-yard games. He
learned how to run like Parcells wanted. He also maintained that
ability he had when he juked eager children in Pittsburgh. Now he
just wants to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mentality is, `I can deal with a hit, can you?' That's how
I approach defenders. They're bigger than me. It's their job to hit
me. But I feel like I'm going to make them miss. And if they don't,
I want to hurt them as much as they hurt me. It's war.''
</P>
<P>
   You look at the man as he says this, strong words coming from
his mouth like soft music. The two don't fit. But neither do New
York and Martin. Or Parcells and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells says great running backs have all told him one thing to
tell blockers. ``They tell me, `If you can just keep (the defender)
there and let me get running, then I'll deal with what's the
traffic pattern,''' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   And we already know Martin can handle himself in traffic, on the
field or in the City.

DENVER WILL AGAIN HITCH UP ITS WAGON AND RIDE DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER -- The exhibition against Green Bay was done, a lively
game for an exhibition, and now Terrell Davis was at his locker,
saying strange words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still go some kinks in our offense,'' said the Broncos'
running back as the media gathered. ``We've got things we need to
iron out. Our offense did some good things but we're still not the
team we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it been only seven months? Only seven months ago, Terrell
Davis had punished the Green Bay Packers. Only seven months ago,
the Broncos' offensive line had left Gilbert Brown a mere panting
blob of a defensive lineman and had sent Reggie White to the
sidelines and to safety from the relentless surges of Denver right
tackle Tony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But that was seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't run the ball that much in this game,'' said Davis
after the exhibition, saying more strange words, because if the
Denver Broncos don't run the ball much, they will not be back in
the Super Bowl. John Elway or no John Elway. ``I thought we'd run
the ball more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but worry not until there is reason because Davis _ after
his strange words _ spoke the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're saving me for the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be the strangest sensation of all for Davis, watching
and waiting and sitting and waiting and waiting some more for his
number to be called. Davis, after all, is a running back, a very
good running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting itchy,'' he said. ``I'm a running back and ...
just by nature I like to go out there and run the ball. When you
don't run the ball, sometimes you sit back and you just can't wait
for the regular season to start because then I know I'm going to be
running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A few lockers away, tight end Shannon Sharpe was taking this all
in. Sharpe thought back three years ``when this low-round running
back came to camp that nobody had ever heard of,'' but ``I knew
real soon that Terrell was a runner. I can know why he's itchy.
Terrell just loves to run ball and he gets frustrated when he's not
running.''
</P>
<P>
   And so does the Broncos' offense. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Details, details
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A book signing was held last week in Denver, and it was an
event. Terrell Davis's autobiography ``TD: Dreams in Motion,'' was
being released in conjunction with the opening of the season and
Broncos fans, as usual, could not get enough of their team or
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis not only is the reason Denver escaped its big-game loser's
image but also was responsible for one of pro football's greatest
ironies _ for 13 years John Elway had strived mightily to win a
Super Bowl and, in San Diego last January, Elway finally reached
the pinnacle. But it was primarily Davis, and not Elway, who won a
Super Bowl for John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   So every detail of that Super Bowl win remains huge in Denver.
Every detail.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis forgot to take medication for his migraine
headaches before the Super Bowl? Huge. Terrell Davis's migraine was
so severe at the end of the first quarter of the Super Bowl that he
couldn't see? Huge.
</P>
<P>
   Literally. He couldn't see the Packers, he couldn't see the
holes he was supposed to run through, he couldn't see the crowd, he
couldn't see the scoreboard? Huge. Terrell Davis there on the
sidelines at Qualcomm Stadium, sucking oxygen, all the while
praying to God, ``Let there be light?'' Huge. Terrell Davis's sight
gradually returning in the locker room at halftime? Huge.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Packers nor the millions watching the game knew the
details. But what became even better known in the second half was
how huge a running back Terrell Davis is, but even moreso how huge
his presence is to his team. He was physical, he was bruising, he
was slithering, he was banging, he was sliding, he was punching, he
was immense.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was his nightmare _ a migraine at the Super Bowl.
The second half was his and the Rocky Mountains' dream _ a Super
Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to Terrell,'' said Sharpe. ``No two ways about
it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the zone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a running back and his offensive line been so in
synch as were Davis and the Denver line in the fourth quarter of
the Super Bowl. Jones, the right tackle that day but now Denver's
left tackle, said he had never experienced such a feeling in
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in synch is when you're in a stadium as loud as that and
the guy next to you can't hear you and you can't hear the guy next
to you,'' he said, ``but you can feel the way he's thinking and he
can feel what you're thinking. It's like going into a place
blindfolded, but you can see what the person next to you is seeing,
and feel what he feels ... without talking.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so intangible, so ephemeral, so mystical, almost, ``because
a lot of lines have been together as long as we've been, and a lot
of backs have been running behind those lines, and still you won't
see what we were like in that fourth quarter of the Super Bowl,''
said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So much of it can be credited ``to our work habits, because when
we go on the field _ every day, mind you _ everything is done at
full speed. Everything we do in practice, technique-wise, is done
at full speed. All the time ... and the coaches are on our butts
when it's not. And when the game comes, the game is the most easy
thing for us. We see that we're so much quicker than our opponents.
We beat our opponents to the punch all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, but such offensive line cohesion is wasted if
the running back is a plodder, a dancer, a horizontal guy who goes
more for the sidelines than upfield.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said Jones, ``what we have going for us is Terrell
Davis. When an offensive lineman is coming to Denver, the first
thing he's told is that No. 7 (Elway) don't get hit _ if No. 7 get
hit, you don't have a job _ so that's always first on our mind,
protecting No. 7. Then we go on to the next thing, which is to let
Terrell have fun, to let Terrell do his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the thing about Terrell,'' he continued, ``is that Terrell
is the kind of back that runs downhill. Terrell always come at you.
Terrell always put pressure on the defense, and, eventually,
Terrell knows that the defense is going to crack. And then Terrell
is going to break a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones smiled again.

   Tom Nalen, the Broncos' center from Foxborough, Mass., and
Boston College, said Denver's offensive line ``doesn't have the
most talented bunch of guys, that's for sure. But we're an
aggressive offensive line and we stick up for each other. That and
we know we've got to pass the ball if we're going to run the ball
and we've got to run the ball if we're going to pass the ball and
so we know we've got to pass block and we've got to run block.''
</P>
<P>
   Nalen paused.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... and, of course, we've got Terrell back there behind us
running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has it come together for an offensive line better than it
did in last January's Super Bowl for the Broncos, especially in the
final quarter. Quarterbacks win Super Bowls, defenses save Super
Bowls, running backs run to glory in Super Bowls, but seldom, if
ever, can it be said that an offensive line is the reason a team
wins the Super Bowl. But Denver's offensive line _ with Davis
exploding through the holes _ won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play-calling was such that we were really able to wear out
Green Bay,'' said Nalen. ``And that was all through the first three
quarters, setting us up for that last quarter. The thing is we had
a lot of good plays that really tired them out; you know, a lot of
running plays. We wore them down and then we were able to feed off
how they looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even seven months later, Nalen recalls ``I had the most fun
playing in that game ... especially in that fourth quarter, when we
had destiny in our own hands. We came through.''
</P>
<P>
   And Terrell Davis came through the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked, said Nalen, ``is how well our wide receivers block,
guys like Ed (McCaffrey) and Rod (Smith). All our receivers are
coached to block on running plays and that helps a lot because once
Terrell breaks through the first few yards, there's virtually no
one behind there because the receivers are blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   But the thing ``that you can't forget,'' said Nalen, ``is that
Terrell makes all of us look pretty good.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Period of adjustment
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver offensive line of 1998 is in flux _ three players
in new positions _ and Davis, for his part, said ``it's going to
take a while'' before the unit gels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I go back and watch the films, I'm sure that I'm
going to learn that (new right tackle) Harry Swayne does this a
little different or that (new right guard) Dan Neil does a little
something else when he's in there,'' said Davis. ``It's probably
going to take a game or two to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played with the same five guys the last three years,''
Davis continued. ``So this will be a different line for me to get
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line _ of all football positions _ is more than a
sum of its parts. The very good lines, as Denver's was last season,
have a true chemistry that allows each member to know instinctively
what the player to his right or left will be doing once the chaos
begins after the ball is snapped. The best offensive lines exude
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm thinking is that after a few games that we'll both be
learning who's doing what and what's working,'' said Davis. ``I'm
thinking that after we come back and watch (films of) a few games,
and I see the techniques they're using, and they see what I'm
doing, that we can adjust to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry _ the real Chemistry _ can be learned from study.
Chemistry _ the football chemistry _ seldom can be learned merely
from study. It's obvious when it's there, but football coaches are
like alchemists when it comes to developing chemistry on their
teams, or at certain positions. It's more a mystery than a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting offense (in the exhibition against Green Bay)
wasn't very good,'' said coach Mike Shanahan. ``The starting unit
only had four first downs (in a half). But take my word, we'll be
more consistent when we'll be going against live bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan now is faced with tweaking his beakers so that
chemistry can return to the offensive line, now that Gary Zimmerman
has retired from left tackle for good and two newcomers are on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big question for me,'' said the coach. ``I can brag and
say we've done some good things in pass protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches can mix equal parts talent, practice, study, and film
work, add a touch of success and chemistry can happen _ as was
evident last season with the Broncos' offensive line. But many
times the chemistry doesn't take, so observers will likely be able
to decide if the 1998 Broncos will be like the 1997 Broncos simply
by focusing on the chemistry _ or lack thereof _ of the offensive
line. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New season, same expectations
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe said Davis is no different from last season, even if
Davis now has $57 million coming to him as the result of a new
contract. ``I had him down to my house in Atlanta for a week over
the summer and I gave him my car for the week,'' said Sharpe, ``and
everything was cool ... same old Terrell. He hasn't changed at all.
And I got my car back at the end of the week, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Any dents?
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe laughed. ``No dents ... and even if there was, I wasn't
worried because I know Terrell's got all that money now and he
could buy me another car.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Davis is the same running back he was last season,
there is apprehension in Denver because new pieces have been added
to the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put '97 out of my mind already,'' said Davis. ``I'm the
person who looks forward to challenges. I don't ever try to look
back and say, `Let me try and do the same thing I did last year.'
If I do the little things like block, take care of my assignment,
and run as hard as I can and protect the ball, then everything else
will come around.''

   IRELAND-CLINTON _ DUBLIN, Ireland _ President Clinton turned
today from the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's
thriving economy, holding it up as the prize of peace. ``I hope
that success will whet your appetite for working together,'' the
president said. Ireland, with the highest economic growth rate of
any country in Europe, is a ``truly astonishing'' model for other
nations, Clinton said at a reception for Ireland's business and
political leaders at the Royal College of Surgeons. Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and his role in
brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out to Northern
Ireland the same promise of prosperity. (Roughton, Cox News

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor

Although Chernomyrdin's crisi plan would supposedly strengthen the

President Clinton made tanatmount to Russia receiving Western aid.

wealthiest men in Russia, and among the closest to the Kremlin
inner circle that surrounds President Boris Yeltsin. He is believed
to have engineered the re-appearance of Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
publicly stated this week that Yeltsin should resign if a strong
government cannot be formed soon. A look at Berezovsky and the
other so-called oligarchs, who many believe are Russia's real

   KUWAIT-IRAQ-$ADV05 _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait Billboards in this
modern, rebuilt capital warn the people of this oil-rich nation not
to forget their POWs -- the more than 600 thought to be held in
Iraq. A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like
incongruous war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile
city. And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight
from Iraqi occupation. Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond
the border of their two countries, posing a constant threat. And,
they closely followed recent reports that the United States is
allegedly changing its strategy for keeping Hussein in check. But
they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the deserts
protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the 740,000
Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers -- are just
tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises. (Kaplow, Cox News

   IMPEACH-HYDE _ WASHINGTON _ Henry Hyde still vividly remembers
the most frightening day in his life. In 1945, he was a 20-year-old
Navy ensign skippering an amphibious boat in the South China Sea.
The boat was tied up to a grounded freighter when a typhoon struck
and ``the sky and the ocean turned solid green. The waves, man,
they were 25 feet high. I was slapping against the freighter like
this _ slap, slap, slap,'' he says, his hand hitting the desk. You
thought you were going to die any minute. My knees turned to
water.'' ``Are we going to make it?'' his worried crew asked.
``Sure, sure, we'll be fine,'' Hyde reassuringly replied. Now, half
a century later, he appears equally calm in turbulent political
waters. As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the
Chicago-area Republican is poised to take center stage in the most
politically charged event since Watergate _ weighing evidence in a
possible impeachment proceeding against President Clinton.
(Morehouse, Cox News Service 1800).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LEGAL _ WASHINGTON _ The authors of the U.S.
Constitution wrote that impeachment _ a formal accusation that a
public official is unfit to serve in office _ should result from

high crimes and misdemeanors? (Morehouse, Cox News Service 650).

   CLINTON-DEMOCRATS _ WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope that President
Clinton's reputation won't hurt his efforts to raise $18 million in
big contributions at ``unity events'' in August through October.
They're depending on him to help offset similar efforts by the
Republican party. The chief House GOP fund-raiser, Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, says the GOP has already raised more than $17 millio
toward its goal of $37 million in big gifts during the same period.
Both parties are getting a lot of those funds from favor-seekers
giving the kind of ``soft-money'' contributions that would be
outlawed under a campaign finance bill that Sens. McCain and
Feingold promise to bring to the Senate floor for a vote between
Monday Sept. 7 and Friday Sept. 11. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   FBN-SAINTS-HAZING _ DAYTON, Ohio _ A little less than two weeks
ago, some 30 veteran players of the New Orleans Saints shocked not
just the NFL, but a lot of folks in general when they ended their
training camp with a brutal 1 a.m. hazing incident that battered 5
rookies, including Andy McCullough, a Dayton-area prep star. Two
players ended up going to the hospital. All the players _ who had
pillowcases tied over their heads _ were severely beaten with
fists, kicks and socks that had been filled with coins. Some
rookies hid in terror and one ran to get security. The incident
finally ended when security arrived, just as a player slammed
through a third-floor window. That player made a few comments after
the incident, but has said nothing since. And all other players
until now have closed ranks and refused to discuss the matter with
NFL Security, which is investigating the matter, as well as Saints
coach Mike Ditka and team president Bill Kuharisch. (Archdeacon,

 &HT;    LAWYERLY AUTHOR TO WRITE STARR REPORT
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To write the investigative report to Congress that
the world is waiting to read, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has
turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer who shares his smalltown
Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hard-bitten, career prosecutors who make up most of
the team that has investigated President Clinton for four years,
Stephen Bates was recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly
wordsmith as for his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney.
The author of several non-fiction books and an editor of the
``Wilson Quarterly,'' a serious cultural journal, Bates is hard at
work on a massive document that is expected to include explicit
details about Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky in
making a case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well qualified to write the report,'' said Lynn Chu,
a New York literary agent who represents Bates, as well as Starr
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``He's a terrific lawyer and
a really good writer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Bates is about a decade younger than his boss, but they
have similar backgrounds. While Starr grew up in the tiny Texas
town of Vernon, Bates was reared in Pecos, a dusty agricultural
community of 12,000 souls about 200 miles east of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what propelled his son from the West Texas prairie to the
nation's capital, Bob Bates declared ``sheer talent.'' But that's
about all the friendly fertilizer dealer would allow. His son has
asked his family not to talk to reporters, the elder Bates
explained, lest they unwittingly provide ammunition to the ``White
House attack dogs'' eager to discredit Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a low-profile type anyway,'' Bob Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephen Bates did not return phone calls or reply to
e-mail seeking information for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very soft-spoken. Middle of the road politically. Really
smart,'' said Chu. ``He's not going to make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The prose about Clinton will likely stretch 300 pages or more
and will probably be presented to the House of Representatives
within weeks. Along with charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, it is expected to include embarrassing details of
Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation, Clinton maintained he has
been ``legally accurate'' in denying a sexual relationship with the
25-year-old former White House intern. So prosecutors aim to show
that activities in a hideaway off the Oval Office meet the
definition of sex outlined in Clinton's deposition in the separate
Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. Using Lewinsky's testimony
about specific sex acts, Starr's team will try to prove Clinton
committed perjury in the deposition and perhaps later when
testifying before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and other members of Starr's team are expected to use
lawyerly language to tone down this tawdry tale.
</P>
<P>
   The writing has been underway for months. Bates began working in
the Office of the Independent Counsel in 1995. He is a graduate of
Harvard College and Harvard Law School, but has made his mark more
as an author than as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 book, ``Battleground,'' told the story of a
fundamentalist Christian mother's crusade to shield her children
from schoolbooks that she said promoted satanism and evolution. The
case grew into the so-called Scopes II trial in East Tennessee and
attracted publicity minded lawyers from national advocacy groups
like the conservative Concerned Women for America and the liberal
People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Times credited Bates with a ``beautifully researched and
meticulously balanced account of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``If No News, Send Rumors: Anecdotes of
American Journalism,'' ``The Media and Congress'' and ``The Spot:
The Rise of Political Advertising on Television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, he has also been a prolific provider of
magazine articles on an assortment of subjects. He has
</P>
<P>
   written for publications ranging from The National Journal to TV
Guide and Playboy on topics varying from the Constitution to
cyberspace. Last year, however, Bates and Starr struck out when
they tried to interest publishers in a jointly written, scholarly
book on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time magazine reported that Bates considers himself a
``lapsed Episcopalian,'' he grew up in a Bible Belt town where
Baptists fill the most pews on Sundays. Pecos is known for its
irrigated fields of cantaloupes and claims to be the ``Home of the
World's First Rodeo.'' The region's best known citizen, the
mythical cowboy Pecos Bill, rode a cyclone to his final glory and
is commemorated in a downtown museum that also features a replica
of Judge Roy Bean's saloon. Pecos is a town where a bookish boy
might take a backseat to the high school football players in their
letter jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was different...almost like a nerd. Some people gave him
a hard time,'' recalled Cookie Cannon, who along with Bates, was
among the 200 members of the Pecos High School Class of 1976. ``He
was a memorable character ...extremely intelligent. But he didn't
seem to care about grades all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve had a sister named Suzanne, but called Suky, who is the
same age as my younger sister,'' she said. And the Bates family was
well off, living ``on what we called Silk Stocking Road at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Cannon said she and Bates worked on
the annual staff and played in the high school band. ``He did
literary stuff. He was very smart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not arrive at Harvard as an urban sophisticate,'' said
Abigail Thernstrom, who taught Bates in a freshman political
science seminar on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Stephen for over 20 years,'' she said. ``He was a
wonderful student. He's a gentleman out of the Old School. He's a
very strong writer with a very nuanced voice. There's not a
strident bone in him. He's not an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom and her husband, Stephan,(CQ) are the authors of the
book, ``America in Black and White: One Nation Indivisible,'' which
criticizes granting preferences based on race or sex. She had a
televised run-in with Clinton during a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very good conversation with the president at that
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom has remained friends with Bates over the decades and
praises his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a gorgeous writer,'' she said. ``Politically, he's very
careful. He sees all sides of everything. ...Judge Starr has a
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Bates was a clerk for U.S.
Appeals Court Judge James Buckley in Washington and has been a
fellow at several think tanks, including the American Enterprise
Institute, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and
the Annenberg Washington Center.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in suburban Silver Spring, Md., with his wife, Polly,
and their daughter, Charlotte.

   IRELAND-CLINTON _ DUBLIN, Ireland _ President Clinton turned
today from the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's
thriving economy, holding it up as the prize of peace. ``I hope
that success will whet your appetite for working together,'' the
president said. Ireland, with the highest economic growth rate of
any country in Europe, is a ``truly astonishing'' model for other
nations, Clinton said at a reception for Ireland's business and
political leaders at the Royal College of Surgeons. Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and his role in
brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out to Northern
Ireland the same promise of prosperity. (Roughton, Cox News

Although Chernomyrdin's crisi plan would supposedly strengthen the

wealthiest men in Russia, and among the closest to the Kremlin
inner circle that surrounds President Boris Yeltsin. He is believed
to have engineered the re-appearance of Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
publicly stated this week that Yeltsin should resign if a strong
government cannot be formed soon. A look at Berezovsky and the
other so-called oligarchs, who many believe are Russia's real

   KUWAIT-IRAQ-$ADV05 _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait Billboards in this
modern, rebuilt capital warn the people of this oil-rich nation not
to forget their POWs -- the more than 600 thought to be held in
Iraq. A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like
incongruous war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile
city. And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight
from Iraqi occupation. Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond
the border of their two countries, posing a constant threat. And,
they closely followed recent reports that the United States is
allegedly changing its strategy for keeping Hussein in check. But
they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the deserts
protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the 740,000
Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers -- are just
tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises. (Kaplow, Cox News

   CLINTON-DEMOCRATS _ WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope that President
Clinton's reputation won't hurt his efforts to raise $18 million in
big contributions at ``unity events'' in August through October.
They're depending on him to help offset similar efforts by the
Republican party. The chief House GOP fund-raiser, Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, says the GOP has already raised more than $17 millio
toward its goal of $37 million in big gifts during the same period.
Both parties are getting a lot of those funds from favor-seekers
giving the kind of ``soft-money'' contributions that would be
outlawed under a campaign finance bill that Sens. McCain and
Feingold promise to bring to the Senate floor for a vote between
Monday Sept. 7 and Friday Sept. 11. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

ALLEGED MANSON DISCIPLE ARRESTED ON WEAPON CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MALCOLM GLOVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An apparent disciple of cult leader Charles
Manson was arrested for possession of a dagger as he waited near
the home of a wealthy San Francisco man whose name appeared on the
cult's hit list 23 years ago, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Shackelford, 42, was arrested Thursday as he sat in
his car parked in the Pacific Heights driveway of George Jewett's
multimillion-dollar house. Officer Stephen Paulsen of the San
Francisco police was on routine patrol when he spotted a blue 1989
Ford Mustang parked in Jewett's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a recent rash of burglaries in the area, Paulsen
parked nearby and kept the car under observation. While waiting, he
ran a check on the car and learned that it belonged to Shackelford,
who had a record of prior arrests for weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   When Paulsen and other officers walked up to the car, they
spotted a gold-trim handled dagger with a 17-inch blade sharpened
on both sides lying on the passenger seat, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers also found a picture of Manson inside the car. When
asked why he had the knife, Shackelford told the officers it was
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   He also reportedly said that he was waiting for his girlfriend
who lived there.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers contacted Jewett, the owner of the house, he
denied that anyone by the name that Shackelford had given lived
there.
</P>
<P>
   When Jewett overheard the officers question Shackelford about
Manson's picture, he told them he was on a list of businessmen who
were targeted to be killed in 1975 by Manson's followers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jewett, great-grandson of pulp, paper and lumber
tycoon Frederick Weyerhaeuser, was an executive with Potlach
Forests Inc. and very active in San Francisco's art and culture
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, one of the nation's most notorious criminals, was
convicted in 1971 of the first-degree murders of seven people in
1969, including actress Sharon Tate. He is serving a life sentence
and last year was denied parole for the ninth time.
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford was booked on suspicion of possession of a dangerous
weapon.

YOUNG BLACKS PREPARE FOR RALLIES IN NEW YORK, ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Deonte-Lamont Kincaid, 11, is on his way to
Atlanta for a couple of new experiences: his first airplane ride
and the first time he has stood amid a large gathering of other
young people for a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid plans to attend Saturday's scheduled Million Youth
Movement, where he will assemble with young blacks trying to tackle
the problems that affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a million youth together doing positive stuff,
talking to each other without fighting,'' Kincaid said.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid's father, Ivory Morton, said his son was more apt to see
young people in his San Francisco neighborhood caught up in
trouble. Morton, who attended the Million Man March in October
1995, wanted his son to experience something similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living here in the community ... he doesn't have much
opportunity to see positive things going on,'' Morton said. ``He'll
see young men hanging out, womanizing, getting into drugs. (The
march) is a chance to see something positive on a large scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Million Man March and the Million Woman March in
October 1997, young blacks have helped organized two marches for
the Labor Day weekend _ the Million Youth Movement in Atlanta and
the Million Youth March in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New York march, organized by attorney Malik Zulu Shabazz and
former Nation of Islam official Khallid Abdul Muhammad, has
received the most attention, focusing on the organizers' legal
fight with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the right to hold the march
in Harlem. Giuliani pegged the event as a ``hate'' rally, pointing
to Muhammad's penchant for incendiary rhetoric and vitriolic
attacks on Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Shabazz and Muhammad won a U.S. Court of Appeals
decision allowing them to go ahead with a scaled-down version of
the march in Harlem. Reports say 50,000 are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   While the New York march carries a black nationalist agenda that
aims to address demands for reparations for slavery and black
economic self-sufficiency, the Atlanta march focuses more on
personal and spiritual development, as well as increasing political
and community involvement among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Dennis Rogers, an activist leading a national
voter-registration campaign targeting young blacks, the Atlanta
march will include four days of meetings and conferences, running
through Monday, the day of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's New York march is scheduled to consist of one full
day of speeches, talks and musical performances.
</P>
<P>
   Both events have been endorsed by the Nation of Islam, although
the Atlanta march also has won the support of the NAACP, the
AFL-CIO and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Organizers say they are not
competing and hope young people will rally in their own cities if
they can't go to the two larger marches.

MEET THE BIRTHING PROJECT'S FIRST ARRIVALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were never more perfect moments in my life than when I
held my daughters for the first time. Tears splattered my face, but
somehow I felt as though I were in the middle of a marvelous laugh
with one _ or all five _ of my sisters.
</P>
<P>
   My daughters' safe arrivals did not so much make me happy as
make me realize how splendid happiness can be.
</P>
<P>
   I had another such a moment Saturday, when my den echoed with
the gurgles and cries of the first babies born into the Fort Worth
chapter of the Birthing Project, a national organization that works
to lower the infant mortality rate among African-Americans by
pairing teen-age mothers with volunteers who provide care and
support during and after their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   As one who tries to embrace Scripture, to live by it, I believe
that when we do good deeds, they should be done in secret. But I
share this with you now for several reasons, not the least of which
is the joy of having witnessed something that deserves remembering.
</P>
<P>
   I do it because I need my daughters to know that I cared not
just for them, but for all children. And not just in private, but
in public as well.
</P>
<P>
   I do it so that these babies' lives will always mean something.
Not just to me and the nine volunteers who helped usher them safe
and healthy into the world, but to you.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that, after all, what we all want for our children? For
their lives to have meaning and purpose?
</P>
<P>
   And so Saturday, we gathered for our first baby shower. This was
not the traditional shower where the expectant mother receives
gifts and plays cute games.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the babies were born in July. Several of them came
early. Now their mothers had come to dream for them.
</P>
<P>
   We started with 10 pregnant teens, ages 14 to 19. All come from
single-parent households. Most of their mothers, many of whom were
teen-age moms themselves, are younger than my 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   One new mom doesn't know her mother's whereabouts. Another one
lives with a family friend because her mother is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 10 were transient, moving from home to home. In the
end, we lost touch with two after they gave birth. One moved. The
other's phone was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the moment they knew they were pregnant, each
teen-ager was asked to describe what she wanted for her baby. What
she envisioned the child wearing on the first day of school, how
she might feel on that day, the day her child graduates from high
school, college, gets his first job. We wanted each mom to start
thinking about what she might do to make those things happen. Will
she need to stay in school and do the same things for herself?
</P>
<P>
   Their wishes were both simple and ambitious. One mother hopes
that her daughter will wear Tommy Hilfiger on her first day of
school, and that she will grow up to be a beautician in a shop on
Lancaster Avenue. One hopes that her son will become a doctor or
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Another hopes that her daughter will marry a man who won't beat
her.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, when we became the 50th Birthing Project chapter in
the country, each of us was asked to make a wish for the baby we
would help bring into the world. On Saturday, the stones we had
chosen to represent those dreams, and the dreams themselves, were
passed on to our ``little sisters.'' They, in turn, were charged
with keeping the dreams and, when the time was right, passing them
on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   To some, I suppose, this little exercise might seem futile. It
did to me in the beginning, but I had only to remember the dreams I
have for my own daughters, and it all made sense.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to predict what will become of our babies. None of us
can say with certainty, for instance, that little Michael will
become a lawyer or businessman, as his mother hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood of him becoming either is surely diminished
if we don't dream.

<P>
   Bill Clinton picked a bad week to visit Russia, but for the past
thousand years or so Russia has rarely had a good week.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was planned months ago as a way for Clinton to provide
comfort for the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and to signal
American support for Russia as a more or less normal country with a
few passing problems of governance.
</P>
<P>
   However brief Clinton's stay, he must have noticed that Russia
was far from normal, its problems far from passing, and its
president far from comfortable in any sense of that word.
</P>
<P>
   In the preceding two weeks Russia had defaulted on much of its
debt and let the ruble collapse, roughly halving in value. Yeltsin
had sacked his government for a second time in six months, leaving
Russia temporarily without one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival interrupted Yeltsin's efforts to install a new
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin -- the same man he had sacked,
eccentrically, in March. The appointment needs approval from the
Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament -- it
rejected Chernomyrdin at the beginning of the week and postponed a
second vote on the nomination until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin three times, Yeltsin is obliged
to dissolve it and call fresh parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the Duma clearly thought it was time for Yeltsin
himself to go, and that Russia should hold a presidential election
instead.
</P>
<P>
   If Yeltsin does decide to go -- he is chronically sick, confused
and reclusive, and has no hope of winning a third term when his
present one expires in 2000 -- he will leave a devalued legacy
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
birth of a new, democratic Russia. But seven years later the
Russian state consists of a few shallowly rooted institutions -- a
presidency, a parliament, a central bank and so on -- which have
yet to earn public trust, and which are dwarfed by an impenetrable
and antique hinterland of cynicism, incompetence, racketeering and
bureaucratic dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   Weak and corrupt government means that Russia has no rule of
law. There is no local investment, only capital flight.
Manufacturing industry and agriculture are dying, though commerce
survives. Public services are minimal, often criminal.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets of brilliance and generosity to be found, but
only amid a wasteland of misery and poverty, ugliness and
pollution, created partly by the builders of communism, partly by
its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The dream survives, in Russia and elsewhere, that the new Russia
can somehow be induced to behave like a modern western country with
a modern western government.
</P>
<P>
   One day the dream may even come true. But for most practical
purposes the hopes of the West to that effect have been bound up
closely with the person of Yeltsin, and they have been waning along
with Yeltsin himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since his re-election in 1996 the president has undergone a
sharp political, moral, physical and intellectual decline. Whereas
once he looked reasonably sure of an honored place in history as
the man who led Russia from dictatorship into democracy, history
seems lately to have been sizing him up for a much less attractive
role: as the man who caused democracy to fail in Russia through his
own arrogance and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   If his first term had its ups and downs, his second has been a
fiasco from the start. He suffered one or two serious heart attacks
during the election campaign in June 1996, and disappeared
immediately after his inauguration for a quintuple heart-bypass
operation. It was deemed a clinical success, but the patient never
quite recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has come into the Kremlin only rarely (even during this
crisis), and with hindsight he might have done better to stay away
altogether. His capacity for misjudgment touched bottom -- or so it
must be hoped -- five months ago when he sacked Chernomyrdin, his
prime minister of more than five years' standing, out of sheer
pique, and with no replacement prime minister in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin sensed that Chernomyrdin was coveting the presidency for
himself -- hobnobbing with other world leaders on foreign trips,
cultivating ties with Russian financiers, planning for an
anticipated succession if Yeltsin's health collapsed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accurate in his assessment, but foolish in his
response. In place of Chernomyrdin he lighted on an unknown called
Sergei Kiriyenko, then only 35, who had barely a year's experience
in national politics. He was not without intelligence, but was
wholly without authority.
</P>
<P>
   His installation coincided with financial crises in other
emerging markets and a slump in Russian oil revenues. The result
was a rapid erosion of confidence in the Russian ruble, in the
Russian banking system, and in the creditworthiness of the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   For Yeltsin, the worst of all worlds has followed. He has been
obliged to sack Kiriyenko and recall Chernomyrdin. He has been
under pressure from the Duma and from Chernomyrdin to surrender
some of his sweeping powers. His reputation and economic
achievements -- a stable ruble was, briefly, their crowning glory
-- are in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia too it has already been a rough ride. The question
now is whether even more wretched social and political consequences
can be avoided: whether serious unrest might finally erupt among
the poor, perhaps even among the army; whether Yeltsin can be
prevailed upon to resign; and, if so, whether his successor would
be found through constitutional, democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   Those are horrible questions to be haunting any country. But
they follow directly from failings in Yeltsin's character that were
either known or predictable when he was re-elected in 1996. He had
a history of illness. He had a history of cronyism. He had a
history of emotional and arbitrary behavior probably linked to
excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Those were all factors in his decision to invade Chechnya in
December 1994, which, as a display of his capacity for stupidity
and even wickedness, should have been unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all that, Russians elected Yeltsin 18 months later,
and the West supported him financially and politically. They did so
because, though the prospect of a Yeltsin victory was unattractive
in many ways, the alternative was much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was the only non-Communist candidate capable of carrying
the election. Had the Communist candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, won
instead, Russian finances would have collapsed in 24 hours, not 24
months. And they would have done so with substantially less chance
of revival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it would have been better if Russian finances had not
collapsed at all; if the economy had started growing durably; if
living standards had risen as Yeltsin promised they would do.

CLINTON TEAM WEIGHS NEXT FOREIGN TRIP AS LEWINSKY CRISIS DEEPENS

   DUBLIN _ As President Clinton enjoyed the admiration of jubilant
Irish crowds disinterested in the White House sex scandal, White
House officials said Friday he may make a peace-seeking visit to
Pakistan and India in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has traveled abroad 39 days so far this year to
visit 14 countries, would stop in Pakistan and India on his way to
the annual summit of Pacific rim nations known as the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). The APEC nations convene in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on the weekend before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy National Security James Steinberg said Clinton is ``very
actively and intensively involved'' in efforts to reverse the
Pakistani-Indian nuclear arms race that flared in May with a series
of tit-for-tat underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may launch a new round of diplomacy with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee next week. The president returns to the White House late
Saturday night after four days of summitry in Moscow and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg indicated the president might make telephone calls or
send personal letters to both leaders in an effort to foster the
cooperation that would be needed before Clinton would visit them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are pressing Pakistan and India
to forego future tests and sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty that governs nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India have waged three wars and edged to the brink
of a fourth over disputed territory since they won independence
from Britain in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the importance that the administration places
on a potential visit to India and Pakistan came when Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott flew from the Moscow summit to
New York to meet Thursday with Jaswant Singh, the Indian government
official dealing with Clinton administration concerns over India's
nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott met with Pakistani officials in London last week en
route to Moscow for Clinton's Kremlin summit with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have worked to orchestrate five rounds of
negotiating sessions between Indian and Pakistani officials since
the nuclear arms race erupted in May.
</P>
<P>
   Previous U.S. presidents in political trouble at home have found
foreign travel especially valuable as a way of showcasing their
presidential allure to audiences either less interested or less
informed about U.S. political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Since allegations of a sex-and-cover-up scandal emerged in
January, Clinton's extensive foreign travel has taken him to a
34-nation pan-American summit in Chile; a six-nation foray across
sub-Saharan Africa; an eight-nation summit in Birmingham, England
and visit to East Germany; a nine day trip to China; and the latest
five-day trip to Moscow, Northern Ireland and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He has been toasted by enthusiastic crowds during a two-day
visit to Northern Ireland and Ireland as well as public praise by
both Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton was
heartened by the personal support offered by world leaders. ``I
think the president takes some satisfaction from that,'' McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the president rolled out a fourth version of his
apology for carrying on an affair with Lewinsky, Ahern praised him
for his efforts to forge peace in Northern Ireland
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we had such intense and sustained contact
from the United States president in a period when we desperately
need it to be able to move forward,'' Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered his latest remarks one day after suffering
unusually harsh criticism from three influential Democrats in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake; it was
indefensible; and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apparently hoped his remarks, offered calmly and with a
tone of contrition, would help bolster his support from skeptical
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., a long-time Clinton ally,
criticized Clinton in a Senate floor speech Thursday as Clinton
barnstormed Northern Ireland in triumph, receiving accolades for
his efforts for peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Clinton's behavior ``immoral'' and
``disgraceful,'' adding that it warranted ``public rebuke and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's criticism was echoed by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Some past American presidents in trouble at home have found
overseas summitry a tonic for their spirits and an opportunity to
spiff-up their image back home.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon, facing congressional and criminal
investigations into the Watergate scandal, traveled to Egypt in
early 1974 where he was greeted by hundreds of thousands of
clamorous Egyptians as he traveled by train along the banks of the
Nile River.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon hit the overseas campaign trail again in late June 1974,
traveling to Moscow for a summit with Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev. The two leaders signed a number of limited agreements on
nuclear weapons _ including a pact not to conduct underground
nuclear weapons tests of more than 150 kilotons.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was forced to resign from office on Aug. 9, 1974, shortly
after his return to the United States.

BRINGING CHANGE TO JAIL OVERCROWDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim DiPaolo came to his view about the finite limits of prison
sentences the old-fashioned way: as a rookie street cop in Malden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it when I went to my first disturbance. There were
three people to be arrested, and I only had one set of handcuffs.''
Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do with six wrists and one set of cuffs? ``I
handcuffed the first guy to the second guy, right hand to right
hand, so they couldn't run as easily, and I just held the other guy
till more help arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Now DiPaolo is the sheriff of Middlesex (Mass.) County, the
state's largest, home to one-quarter of Massachusetts' six million
citizens. But that episode from his rookie cop days 25 years ago
sticks in his mind as he juggles prisoners and cells. ``That's when
I first realized that there were too many potential prisoners out
there, and not enough jail cells.''
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing growth of America's prison population is fueled
by the public's fear of street crime, and TV shows and newspaper
scare stories. Even though crime is down virtually everywhere,
jails and prisons are overflowing. The US has 1.6 million prisoners
under lock and key, by far the highest proportion of the citizenry
in the calaboose of any developed nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory sentences and lengthy terms for drug and
alcohol-related offenses have stuffed our jails. Sheriff DiPaolo
has 1,600 prisoners to house on any given day; last Wednesday it
was 1,125 at the Billerica (Mass.) House of Correction, 495 in
pre-trial detention at the Middlesex Courthouse-jail skyscraper in
Cambridge, and another 195 inmates parcelled out to other county
jails because he'd run out of space in Middlesex.
</P>
<P>
   When DiPaolo, after 18 years as a policeman, won a four-way race
for the Democratic nomination for sheriff, ``I found that out of
1,200 prisoners at the time, 18 percent of them were serving time
for domestic violence. But I also found that there was no
rehabilitation program at the time for domestic batterers.''
</P>
<P>
   So he designated a 60-man unit at Billerica as base for a new
VIP program. That is not an acronym for coddling prisoners; it
stands for Violence Intervention and Prevention. Nearly one-fifth
of his clientele is jailed for spouse or child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   DiPaola knew he couldn't keep up with the demand for jail cells,
at an average of $30,000 per inmate per year. The endless assembly
line supplying drug-or-alocohol-soaked prisoners threatens to break
the bank, unless more innovative methods are found to curb
antisocial behavior. DiPaolo: ``We've established a preliminary
agreement with the state Probation Dept. to run and operate
together community correction centers for non-violent offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   This would involve setting up arrangements where inmates could
be restrained variously by house arrest, reporting to probation
officers by phone or in person, use of electronic bracelets to see
that a prisoner is inside his home at the required times.
</P>
<P>
   The savings would be dramatic, and the rehab potential is far
greater than stuffing sullen, angry men in dangerously overcrowded
facilities. DiPaolo and other Middlesex County officials live in
fear of a high-rise fire or some other disaster in the cumbersome
and poorly conceived Middlesex court-jail complex.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer a leaking railway tank car in nearby freight
yards caused authorities to virtually cordon off a large section of
East Cambridge, Mass. Hundreds of public safety people were
mobilized to be ready to move 300 prisoners out of harm's way. ``I
had the buses lined up out back, ready to move them all,'' said
DiPaolo. But the logistics of feeding, housing, treating,
transporting and safeguarding hundreds of prisoners around the
clock, year in and year out, is tremendously costly.
</P>
<P>
   DiPaolo has 650 employees. He initially enlisted a lot of
support for the plan, with the Probation Dept., to experiment with
alternatives to traditional jail terms. ``I went to one of the
local newspapers in Middlesex County, and explained to the editor
what we were trying to do. He said, `I'm for it,' till we explained
we wanted to put a community corrections center in his city, then
it was, `No, no, I don't think so.'''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming resistance to reform is part of the process of
bringing change to county-level government. ``It can be a lonely
place out there,'' said DiPaolo, when you are advocating what
people instinctively oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over as sheriff, I found there were 90 employees
(including prison guards) who'd never been through any kind of
training for corrections officers. We got all of them trained
promptly in an innovative arrangement that did not cost the
taxpayers very much money.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPaolo has only one primary opponent this time around, whom he
beat handily last time. That would be one Edward Kennedy _ not that
Kennedy, the one in the US Senate. But DiPaolo is taking no
chances, and wears out his shoe leather running from one end of the
county to the other.
</P>
<P>
   He may be on the cutting edge of meaningful prison reform that
saves the Commonwealth hundreds of millions of dollars. House
Speaker Tom Finneran has signalled he is ready to enact sweeping
changes in the present unwieldy system of mandatory sentences that
leave judges, prosectuors, police and perpetrators unhappy. In
their zeal to address voters' fears and media hype, lawmakers have
gone overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran has studied the problems in depth and immersed himself
and his staff in negotiations with judges, prosecutors and prison
experts. Given the current lead of Atty. Gen. Scott Harshbarger in
the Democratic gubernatorial primary, it is likely that
law-and-order issues, which inevitably touch on prison reform, may
become part of this year's election debate.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Middlesex County District Attorney, Harshbarger was
a career prosecutor, and has signalled he is receptive to changes
in the present system which is deeply flawed in the minds of just
about everyone who has to work within it.

IT'S ONLY A GAME. OR SO YOU THOUGHT

   (italics)The Duke of Wellington supposedly said that the battle
of Waterloo was won ``on the playing fields of Eton.'' Indeed, many
a valuable lesson is learned in games _ and that goes for business
just as much as war. Some lessons may sting, but as these anecdotes
demonstrate, they linger in the memory.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1966, Barry Augenbraun, now of St. Petersburg,
Fla., was a newly minted associate attending his first summer
outing at a major Wall Street law firm. Asked to choose an
afternoon sport, he picked tennis; around 6:30 that evening, before
the dinner festivities began, he phoned his wife, Janet, and told
her he had some good news and some bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she said, her concern evident in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied. ``I came in second in the firm doubles
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great!'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Augenbraun said. ``That was the bad news.'' He told her
that he had been teamed with one of the firm's partners, who was
also a nationally ranked tennis player, and that ``this is the
first firm championship he has lost in six years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the good news?'' Augenbraun's wife asked.
</P>
<P>
   The partner, he replied, ``offered to buy me golf lessons before
next year's outing.'' &QL;

   Meet Bill Byrne of San Francisco, a member of the winning team
in an unusual race.
</P>
<P>
   At a company picnic where food and beer were in ample supply, a
new executive, having decided that team-building games would
provide a good way to observe organizational culture, set into
motion an odd variation on the three-legged race:
</P>
<P>
   Each team had 10 players, and each player was given a short
piece of rope. The first two players, assuming the usual
three-legged stance, tied legs together with the rope; then they
walked 50 yards to a hula hoop. The first player stepped into the
hoop with his free leg, picked it up by hand and passed it over his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Then both players lifted their common leg, passed the hoop
through to the second player's free leg so that he could then pass
the hoop over his head and place it on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Having completed the drill, the team returned to the starting
line, tied on another person and repeated the procedure. The goal
was to sequentially tie together all 10 team members, pass the hula
hoop and return to the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   Given the presence of the beer, coordination was not prevalent,
and several participants were so drunk with competitive spirit that
they failed to notice their bleeding, rope-burned ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne writes, ``The new executive awarded first place to my
team, for having the intelligence to quit soon into the game.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After surviving hours of round-robin play, Brian Brown of
Manhattan and his doubles partner found themselves in the finals of
the hotly contested tennis tournament at their company's annual
sales conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who no longer works for the company, writes that their
opponents in the finals included a man ``who fancied himself a
tennis pro and happened to be a director of our publishing firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Volleying with gusto and covering the net with tenacity, Brown
and his partner sensed an impending victory, made all the sweeter
by the presence of a crowd of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The partners were on the verge of serving out the match when one
of their more senior colleagues, who had been watching from the
sidelines and sipping a drink, called time out and walked
deliberately across the court to the baseline, where Brown was
standing.
</P>
<P>
   He cupped his hands to Brown's ear and whispered: ``Are you out
of your mind? The purpose of this exercise is not to lose your
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown discussed this situation with his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with our priorities in proper perspective,'' Brown
writes, ``we managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always a bright side to losing.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Economou of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., recalls the Type A lawyer
who lost his tennis match to an easygoing stockbroker by a score of
6-1, 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the court, the Type A told his opponent, ``Could
have gone either way.''

MAKING A MOLEHILL OUT OF A MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choice for the trip was between a large, luxury, four-door
with juice drive or a sporty coupe with a five-speed manual _ which
means it was no choice at all. This trip entailed a ride to the
home of the wildest weather on the continent to accompany a team
celebrating the 99th anniversary of an automotive landmark: the
first automobile ascent to the top of New Hampshire's 6,288-foot
Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aug. 31, 1899, when Freelan Oscar Stanley, with his wife,
Flora, took the tiller of a Locomobile steamer and made the
perilous ascent up New England's highest mountain. If the ascent
was rough, the descent was even more problematical _ how does one
guide a car with virtually no brakes 7.6 miles down an average 12
percent grade? Flora remarked in her diary that it was ``easy as
falling off a log.'' Rumor has it that F.O. Stanley dragged a log
to slow the car on the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Monday, Aug. 31, 1998, and Brent Campbell and Norm
Shanklin are preparing to commemorate the Stanley feat by taking
Campbell's 1908 Gentleman's Speedy Racer, a 20-horsepower Stanley
Steamer, up the Mount Washington Auto Road. It is sunny and mild
where we stand, 4,600 feet below the peak, listening to the hiss of
the burner. At the summit, dark clouds scud across the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist is somewhat grateful that the Stanley racer has
but two seats, both of them occupied; I will ascend ahead and
follow the steamer from the four-mile mark in an Acura 2.3 CL, that
sporty little coupe _ with a proper heater, air conditioning, seat
belts, air bags, and a windshield, all of which are lacking in the
Stanley. With me is Stanley Museum director Susan S. Davis, who
will photograph the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Road is a private road, built in the middle of the last
century, an engineering marvel in its day. Today, if you have the
right car _ some automatics are unfit for the descent _ you can pay
the toll and, if you are smart, read the instructions and listen to
the instructional tape or CD provided. Or, if you have the wrong
car or simply prefer, you may pay the fare and take the stage, a
comfortable van professionally driven, to the summit and back.
</P>
<P>
   The four-mile ascent to the initial observation point is a piece
of cake for the Acura CL _ and a good deal of fun, too, as manners
prevail on the trail. Descenders have the right of way; slow
ascenders pull off to allow faster vehicles to pass. The ascent is
in second gear, at modest speed and fairly high r.p.m., although
the twists and turns of the road make it seem as if we're ascending
at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-mile overlook,the view is breathtaking and the wind
is fierce. In the distance, I can hear the Stanley's pumps
chattering; as it nears, the nearly silent chuffing of the steam
engine becomes audible, then suddenly the gray car spurts into
sight rounding a bend _ Shanklin is now driving, having switched
with Campbell on the fly!
</P>
<P>
   As the steamer passes up the slope, I ease the Acura onto the
path, and Davis climbs through the sunroof to capture the ascent on
film. The pavement ends, the road narrows, the view is spectacular,
I see no guardrails _ this is no place for an acrophobe.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is difficult to hold the Acura behind the steamer
as it slows on very steep grades _ here the steamer has the
advantage in full torque at negligible r.p.m. At other times, it is
difficult to keep pace with the Stanley as it gallops without
transmission to hinder it.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, we lose sight of virtually everything as dense
fog shrouds the mountaintop. It is windy, cold; we have passed from
late summer to early winter. The steamer has made the ascent in 28
minutes, 30 seconds, give or take a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   The fog lifts, the sun beams, it is time for the descent. How
does one guide a steamer with rear-only mechanical brakes down the
mountain? ``We lower it with another car and a tow strap,''
Shanklin says. Which car? Shanklin produces a nylon tow strap,
passes it around the rear axle of the Stanley, protecting the paint
with sheepskin guides. ``Nice of you to bring the right car,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura has a tow hook amidships up front underneath _ it's
purpose is to hold the car fast to the deck of a ship en route from
Japan. I hand Shanklin the keys and take to the passenger seat;
Davis climbs into the Stanley. I am sitting a few inches from the
edge of the road, the edge of the world up here. With occasional
stops to cool the brakes, the long, slow descent is another piece
of cake, albeit a boring slice.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura 2.3 CL with its premium package of leather, is $23,360
plus $435 delivery for a jaunty little car with a 2.254-liter,
16-valve, four-cylinder engine and manual gear box. For a bit more
money, it becomes the 3.0 CL with a V-6 engine _ automataic
transmissions are available, at a price. The car is well equipped
with all the niceties, fancy radio, and speed-sensitive steering.
The glove box is small, but that premium package includes pockets
in the seat backs and a covered bin between the seats _ its lid is
an armrest partially obscuring one of two cupholders in front of
it. Adults will fit in the rear. Handling is very good,
acceleration is good off the mark, but the little engine is
somewhat anemic, tops out early _ passing is best done in third
gear, borders on hopeless in fourth. Forget fifth. Fuel mileage is
very good; the CL posted 28.95 miles per gallon for 1,001 miles
traveled _ including the mountaineering. Anyhow, if you're in the
neighborhood of Gorham, N.H., next Aug. 31, the Stanley Steamers
will be back in force, and a '99 Locomobile is being readied for
another run to the clouds 100 years after F.O. and Flora Stanley
made a molehill of a mountain to prove that the automobile was here
to stay _ but, alas, it was not to be as a steamer.

 &HT;    CLINTON PRAISES AHERN, IRELAND ECONOMIC GROWTH AS FACTOR IN
PEACE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A nearly jubilant tour across Ireland
continued Friday for Bill Clinton, who used the day to turn from a
message of peace to praise for the Irish Republic's economic boom
as the ``Celtic tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many U.S. and British officials have cited the
republic's recent economic growth as an essential factor that
created an environment that favored the peace process. Often on
this trip, Clinton has pointed to the prospect of jobs and wealth
as one of the prizes awaiting Northern Ireland if the peace holds.
</P>
<P>
   An economic derelict just a few years ago, the republic last
year boasted a stunning 7.7 percent growth rate. In 1997, the
country recorded $12 billion in trade with the United States, an
increase of 19 percent over the previous year. Two years ago, the
per capita income here for the first time exceeded that of the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtic tiger is roaring and you should be very proud of
it,'' Clinton said during a speech at Gateway Inc., a large
American computer firm with operations in the Dublin suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that 470 U.S. companies have invested in
Ireland, many of them devoted to information technology like
Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway and other companies, like Intel and Dell and Digital,
are strengthening Ireland's historic links to the United States and
reaching out beyond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Gateway, Clinton was nearly playful as he and Irish leader
Bertie Ahern demonstrated a computer system that employs ``smart
cards'' and PIN numbers to affix signatures to documents. Using
laptops, the American and Irish leaders used the system to sign a
communique on technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked that he had mixed feelings about this
technological advance, saying it could lead to the virtual
president. ``Do you have any idea how much time I spend every day
signing my name?'' he joked. ``I'm going to feel utterly useless if
I can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he continued to be dogged Friday by questions about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the
president seemed to build on his emotional success in Northern
Ireland the day before. At the beginning of the visit in Belfast
Thursday morning, he seemed tired and wan. By Friday afternoon, he
seemed to have his color back and to be in high spirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is a little rain in the air today, it's
always sunny for me in Ireland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Clinton met with Ahern privately and discussed
renewed progress with the stalled peace process. The leaders
discussed ways to maintain the momentum generated by the
president's visit, said a White House aide, who did not elaborate.
In his public comments, Clinton heaped generous praise on Ahern for
his part in the peace process, at times appearing to embarrass the
Irish leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world owes you a debt of gratitude,'' Clinton told a
gathering of government, union, business and farming
representatives at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The Taoiseach -- an Irish word pronounced tee-shok and meaning
chieftain -- was right beside him to hear the warm applause of his
countryfolk as Clinton sang his praises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about the role of the Taoiseach in making
this Irish peace process come to fruition,'' Clinton said. ``I just
want to say . . . you can be very proud of his leadership -- as
well as your own overwhelming vote for peace a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the president headed to Limerick on the island's
west coast where he is scheduled to deliver an address Saturday at
a new technology park just outside the city where Austin,
Texas-based Dell Computer Corp. has established its primary
European operation.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading back to Washington Saturday evening, the
president plans to play a round of golf at the famed course at
Ballybunion, ranked among the top dozen golf courses in the world
and known for its stiff wind, unique contours and graveyard hazard
that has confounded such golf greats as Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was been given a 250-to-one chance of shooting a
hole-in-one at the golfing mecca by Paddy Power, Ireland's leading
bookmaker, on Friday. Power predicted Clinton would be the weaker
of his foursome -- which includes club captain Brian McCarthy,
Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy and former foreign minister Dick
Spring, who will partner Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president was forced to cancel his first date with
Ballybunion due to the conflict in Bosnia.

<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   A couple of years ago, on my 42nd birthday, I got my first ever
card from my biological mother.
</P>
<P>
   Like about 5 million American adults, I am adopted. I was born
in Chicago and adopted through an adoption agency. My parents told
me around age 10, but knowing I was adopted didn't sink in, at
least on a conscious level. It did not start to bother me until I
reached my 20s.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, your parents are your parents. But if you're
adopted it's not that simple: There's curiosity combined with a gut
emotion _ the sense of being detached your whole life, the wanting
to know who you are more than anything else in the world, and the
outright longing to see a real life relative in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   For me, no matter how much I loved my family, I never knew my
roots. Even now, in 1998, after having found two-thirds of my
biological family, I can't find my father.
</P>
<P>
   What I have learned is that finding answers isn't easy. In this
country, compared to several other nations, adoption records are
largely sealed.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 27, I asked my parents for my adoption papers. They
contained a starting point -- my birth mother's name. (Her name is
Anne; I am withholding her last name.) I wrote the agency, naively
assuming it would tell me everything. I didn't know I had begun a
15-year, on-again, off-again search.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was happy to share my history: I learned my parents
were of Polish, Russian and German ancestry; my mother operated a
Comptometer (an accounting machine used in offices in the 1950s);
my father served in the U.S. Navy. But that is about all I learned,
for without a court order, the agency would divulge no names.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, I put the search on hold, reaching out occasionally
to attend a workshop or pick up a book. A few years later, I became
a father myself. My girlfriend became pregnant, choosing single
motherhood, and I did not see my daughter for months after her
birth.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally did, I was overwhelmed by emotions I had denied
over the years. At family reunions I had felt detached, totally
unrelated to the ``relatives'' around me. But now I was holding my
own daughter, the first blood relative I had ever encountered. She
had my blue eyes, my dimples, my big ears.
</P>
<P>
   I had to finish searching. I recontacted the agency. It had
become so deluged with inquiries it had created a post-adoption
department. This seemed promising, but once again, shock. I learned
I had a half-sister 18 months older than I. She was adopted through
another agency, which had lost contact with our mother, and so
could release nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred this time, I was ready to go on. After seeing a TV
segment on a woman running online adoption bulletin board, I was
referred to a Chicago adoption searcher. The searcher, who declined
to be identified for this article, did not reveal her methods. But
I understood they were legal, via public records and phone. She
charged an initial fee of $50, and my payments to her and other
parties eventually amounted to $700.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly learned Anne had been married and traced her last
address. But there was bad news, too: Anne had been hospitalized
after a fall, and was now in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   I reached Anne's doctor, got the home's name, then wrote a
letter I had written a million times in my head. It began: ``You
don't know me, but I believe I am your biological son. I've been
waiting a long time to find you and now I have....''
</P>
<P>
   Days passed and no response. I wondered if I had written to the
wrong person, or worse, she wanted no contact with me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I picked up the telephone and dialed. A voice came on
the line, apprehensive at first, then pleased. ``What took you so
long?'' she asked. She had gotten my letter, but had not yet mailed
a response. We arranged to finally meet in person.
</P>
<P>
   While that meeting loomed, I got another call from my searcher:
She had found my half-sister, Karen, and had given her my number.
Presently I had a call from pleasant-sounding young woman in
suburban Chicago. ``This is Karen,'' she said. I nearly dropped the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Anne had existed in my mind, but Karen was a totally new being.
Thrilled, we wondered how to start a relationship. We picked a
weekend, and I was on my way.
</P>
<P>
   I flew to Chicago, staying with a friend. I slept poorly and
woke early. It was a cool spring day and my friend lent me his car.
I imagined Anne as a young, beautiful woman giving me a big hug.
Neither, of course, happened.
</P>
<P>
   Anne was an elfin 66-year-old, with a walker, but I could see me
in her: eyes, ears, fair skin. The agency told me she was the only
child of a divorce. But there were confusing, contradictory and
vague references to her health and family. It was frustrating to
find her and still be clueless.
</P>
<P>
   I took Anne to lunch. While the nursing home was depressing, I
was happy to see the restaurant owner knew Anne. I learned she was
married for 12 years to a man now deceased, had lived on her own
and done office jobs and telephone sales.
</P>
<P>
   She never directly said why she gave me up, and I didn't press
her. Over lunch, she pulled out an article from Parade, in which a
birth mother said it was best her baby be adopted because she could
not care for her. ``I saved this for you,'' Anne said. The woman
said she looked forward to when her daughter found her, if she
chose.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, I took Anne home, and later met Karen, her husband
and son. As with Anne, I saw a resemblance to Karen. We hugged.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Karen, her husband and I took Anne to lunch. She
told us the family history and showed pictures. She could not
recall our fathers but we listened anyway, noting names of male
friends. ``He might have been in the Navy,'' Anne said of one.
</P>
<P>
   Back in her room, Anne's memorabilia got to me: a picture of my
grandfather, Hyman, with my big ears. He was in the military, too,
a painter, decorator and machinist. And his 1963 death notice.
``Are you OK?'' Karen asked. ``No,'' I said, tears welling up. It
was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   I continued trying to find my biological father, fighting
through one bureaucratic barrier after another, to no avail. The
experience, though, was worthwhile. In Chicago I visited the agency
that had placed me with my parents. In one room there were pictures
of many children like myself. I was moved to leave a photo there of
me and my new daughter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on my own now. I have in my possession now a note, signed by
my biological mother. It says: ``Love, your Mom Anne.'' Indeed I
have a mother. But I hope Anne understands that although I have a
primal feeling for her, she is not my mom. I've tried to act
normal, staying in touch. But I can't help feeling that if it had
not taken years to find Anne, she might not be in the nursing home.
She might remember more of who my father was, and how I might find
him. She, he and I might now all be friends.
</P>
<P>
   As Karen said at the end of our first meeting, ``The system
robbed us of all that time.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. In the end I got the agency to release my father's
name to Anne, and tried finding him, yet it's like he never
existed. I know he's out there, but now it's time to let go.

<P>
   Following the money in politics used to be a job best left to
campaign operatives and investigative reporters. At least one
public interest group is hoping to change that situation, by
creating a database-driven Web site that makes tracking political
contributions this election season almost as easy as checking your
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Center for Responsive Politics launched a new
resource that offers detailed campaign finance profiles for every
congressional candidate in the country, challengers as well as
incumbents. The database is updated every month with the latest
filings from the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   While the Center, a nonprofit non-partisan group based in
Washington, D.C., has been around for more than a decade, it has
primarily been a tool for journalists, providing campaign
contribution data for computer-assisted reporting projects. The new
project is the most ambitious it has ever launched, with the goal
of making the information easily accessible to the average voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real idea here is to spread the power, on the assumption
that information is power and there is too much of it in Washington
and not enough everywhere else'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a do-it-yourself congressional investigation
kit, allowing users to search all federal campaign contributions by
donor or recipient, track the sources of contributions to every
congressional candidate in the country by industry or interest
group, identify the recipients of contributions from political
action commmittees and see how much money interest groups spent
lobbying Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can search for the sources of contributions by
industry, metropolitan area and zip code. For example, in Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich's home state of Georgia, the most
generous political action committee (PAC) this election cycle is
the United Parcel Service, which so far has given $922,802 to
congressional candidates, 77 percent of that amount to Republicans.
In Gingrich's District 6 race, he has raised $4.9 million, 14
percent of that from PACs. The largest single donation Gingrich has
received so far was $12,000 from the Coca Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also offers comparisons of in-state vs.
out-of-state fund-raising by the candidates and a scorecard showing
how well each candidate is complying with the legal requirement to
identify the employer and occupation of individual contributors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Center, Paul Hendrie, said the site receives
about 1,500 visits a day, and that traffic has been increasing
since the start of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   The CRP Web site is not the first to offer this type of
information. The FEC and other private Web sites have posted data
from FEC filings online for years. The difference is in how the
information is organized and displayed, so that users do not have
to be campaign data experts to figure out how to interpret the
contribution documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every contribution that comes in to a candidate or political
party, we try to categorize it by industry. Then we try to
translate that,'' Makinson said. ``We try to see what the patterns
are. Because if you really want to understand what politicians are
going to do after they are elected, find out who is paying for
their campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center has also made its database available to other Web
sites. One site that takes advantage of such a partnership is
Project Vote Smart, a campaign watchdog group that has one of the
most comprehensive campaign information sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides campaign finance data, Project Vote Smart offers
candidate biographies, issue positions, voting records and
candidate evaluations by special interests. Heather Holdridge,
director of Project Vote Smart's reporter resource center, said the
CRP database supplements that package with the latest available
numbers from campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it every day,'' Holdridge said. ``I think that CRP is by
far one of the best sites for federal campaign finance information.
... It's very comprehensive and easy to use.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the campaign finance data, the Center For
Responsive Politics has created a database of all reported
privately financed House and Senate travel for 1997. It is the
first computer database of Congressional travel, which was compiled
by hand from paper records lawmakers are required to file with the
clerk of the House and the secretary of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Private interests provided members of the 105th Congress and
their staffs with some $6.4 million in free travel during 1997. The
Center's Web site provides rankings of the biggest travelers,
leading trip sponsors and most popular destination. From the Web
site, users can also search the records by the name of a lawmaker,
sponsoring organization or destination.
</P>
<P>
   For example the database shows that Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, a Mississippi Republican, took just one sponsored trip in
1997, traveling to White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., to address the
Grocery Manufacturers of America. The three-day trip cost
$3,561.89. Senator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, took the
most trips, 20; while Newt Gingrich took the most expensive trip --
a $33,141 excursion to give a speech in London, which was financed
by ARCO.

</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes, ripe red peppers and eggplants are still in the
garden, but they won't be for long.
</P>
<P>
   When frost strikes, these and other tender crops will wither. So
bring them indoors now and stock them away for later when their
garden fresh flavor will be especially delightful. Here are some
tips for handling your final harvest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Green Tomatoes: &LR;  You can pick firm and unblemished green
tomatoes to keep in the refrigerator for several weeks, sometimes
even longer. They are good to slice and sautee or to bake sprinkled
with brown sugar and cinnamon. You also can try root cellaring
them. Wrap them in newspaper and store in a cool cellar for a month
or more. Some of the tomatoes probably will rot but others may stay
good for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ripe Tomatoes: &LR;  Vine ripened, homegrown tomatoes should be
cherished because they are about to become impossible to find.
Enjoy them on salads, sandwiches, or in stir fries, on pasta, or
try grilling them, as detailed in a accompanying recipes. On any
tomato plant, you'll probably find tomatoes that have begun turning
red, but won't be able to finish outdoors. Set them on a warm
kitchen counter and they will brighten up but probably won't be as
delicious as tomatoes that were fully ripe before picking.
</P>
<P>
   Other extra tomatoes are well worth preserving. You can cut them
into quarters and freeze them in freezer bags to use in winter
casseroles, stews, and soups. Or plop them into boiling water for a
minute or until the skin loosens and cracks, then peel the skin
off. Cut these tomatoes into quarters and boil at low heat for an
hour or so. Stir often and when the tomato wedges turn into
slightly thick sauce, you can freeze it for spaghetti or pizza
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dried Tomatoes: &LR;  If you enjoy the intense, concentrated flavor
of sun-dried tomatoes, sold in the upscale part of the grocery
store, you'll be glad to know that you can make them at home with a
dehydrator.
</P>
<P>
   ** Lima Beans: Because they take a long time to develop, lima
beans often aren't ready to harvest until the end of the growing
season. Shell them out of the pod, steam lightly, and enjoy their
slightly nutty, fresh flavor with a little butter.
</P>
<P>
   Extra lima beans are easy to freeze after blanching or quick
boiling to help preserve quality. Blanch small beans for 2 minutes,
medium sized beans for 3 minutes, and large beans for 4 minutes.
Quick cool and freeze in freezer bags. You also can blend lima
beans into salads and casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eggplants: &LR;  These require special treatment to maintain quality
when frozen. Peel off the skin, slice, dip in beaten egg, and cover
with bread crumbs. Bake on a greased cookie sheet at 325 degrees
until slightly tender. Pack into freezer bags. Now you have
ready-to-use breaded eggplants, wonderful topped with tomato and
cheese like mini-pizzas or made into eggplant parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peppers: &LR;  Like tomatoes, peppers are among the easiest
vegetables to store. Simply slice them up, pack into freezer bags,
and freeze. You also can roast succulent peppers like bell, banana,
and chili peppers. Set them under the broiler until the skin chars,
often accompanied by a popping sound as the skin breaks free from
the flesh. Turn the peppers until charred all the way around. Let
them cool then peel off the skin. Roasted peppers are great on
salads, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and also can be frozen.

 Includes photo of a couple riding a tandem bicycle near Solvang,
Calif. 
 By KEN MCALPINE 
 c.1998 Ken McAlpine 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Riding a tandem bicycle might seem a simple thing -- two people
take up one bicycle, providing themselves the opportunity to mesh
together in synchronized idyll or plunge off into roadside
shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   Well, on a simple level a tandem is just a bicycle built for
two. But as anyone who has ever ridden a tandem will tell you, the
activity goes deeper than that. Riding a tandem can be a process of
discovery, some of it wonderful, some of it adrenal jolting, much
of it surprising.
</P>
<P>
   First surprise: Tandems are no longer clunky things piloted by
sunburnt tourists lacking the motor skills necessary to ride a bike
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's tandems are lightweight, they have lots of speeds
--21, 24 and even 27 different gears -- and they're great fun to
ride,'' said Jack Goertz, editor of the tandem magazine DoubleTalk
and a tandem rider of nearly 30 years. ``Two people can ride a
tandem in relative comfort for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every tandem rider I talked to, Goertz was lavish in his
praise. Tandem bicycling, said Goertz, offered all the physical
benefits of conventional cycling -- a great cardiovascular and
calorie burning workout in the great outdoors. Plus, said Goertz,
with two riders you could go faster and farther.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest attraction -- and the one that explained why
tandem sales are on the upswing -- was the simplest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tandem allows couples of different abilities to ride
together,'' said Goertz. ``It gives you the chance to do something
with someone you really enjoy being with.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a tandem was the easy part. I called my friend Jon
Avery. Jon owns Open Air Bicycles, a successful bike store in
Ventura, Calif., where we both live. He'd also been convinced
enough of the merits of tandems to buy one of his own several years
back. Sure, he said. I could borrow it.
</P>
<P>
   When Jon wheeled the tandem into our driveway I had to admit it
was a beautiful thing, a sleek expanse of polished purple tubing,
gleaming spokes and nearly two sets of everything -- from the water
bottle holders to the scimitar-curved racing handlebars. The bike
reeked of performance and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it also cost him nearly $3,000, Jon started by
giving me advice. Riding a tandem was like riding a regular bike,
he explained, but different too. Even though his tandem was
surprisingly light (just less than 40 pounds) it was still nearly
eight feet long and weighted down by two riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a tandem things happen a bit slower,'' Jon explained. ``You
take the turns a little bit wider. Because of all the momentum,
slowing down isn't as quick. It's like driving a truck with a
trailer. Tandems aren't hard to ride, but they take some
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   I listened, but frankly I found this seminar mildly insulting.
Jon meant well. But on numerous occasions I had seen him wheel by
our house with his most frequent tandem partner, his 8-year-old
daughter Hadley.
</P>
<P>
   Jon also rode with his wife Hope, an experience they found
enjoyable and unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope and I have had some of our best conversations on the
tandem,'' said Jon. ``There's no interruptions, no phone, nothing
else to interfere. We can go for an hour long bike ride and get
more talking in than we do in days.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of extended time alone with my wife Kathy sounded
wonderful, but I'd have to get her alone long enough to ask. With
two small boys and two overworked phones, our conversation takes
place in snippets, bookmarked by squealing and crashing, and heard
only because it's shouted from different rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of several days I conveyed my proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only has one set of brakes?'' Kathy said. ``I'm not going
with you''.
</P>
<P>
   Actually the rider up front, the captain in tandem-speak, pretty
much controls everything. Braking, shifting, pedaling and steering,
it's all in the captain's hands, while the rider in the rear,
dubbed the stoker, proceeds along rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   This presented a psychological hurdle too. My wife is giving and
kind and possessed of innumerable other sweet qualities that have
made me the happiest man alive. But when it comes to piloting our
relationship, there's little doubt who is the captain.
</P>
<P>
   Still Kathy said she was willing to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for today. When we scrape Jon's bike up I don't want to
be blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   We set out on a sharp, fall day, and immediately discovered that
tandem riding does present challenges. Getting on the bike, for
one. Theoretically, mounting a tandem goes like this. The captain
straddles the bike, both feet firmly planted on the ground. Then
the stoker mounts up behind. When the stoker is balanced, feet in
the pedals, the captain pushes the bike forward and off they roll,
straight as an arrow.
</P>
<P>
   In practice there is some wobbling involved. Lots of wobbling if
the captain is unsure of himself and takes his sweet time getting
the bike up to speed. Behind me, I could hear high pitched noises
that sounded like one of those squeeze toys being frantically
pumped.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally got rolling, Kathy quickly found her tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see anything back here,'' she said. ``Hey! Can you see
that pole? Do you know how the brakes work? Maybe I should just
shut my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually there was too much to see. We had chosen to ride a
local bike path wending up to the small town of Ojai. The path
paralled a road, but curved away frequently to wend through the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   We had lived here for 12 years, driven the adjacent road
hundreds of times. Now we rolled quietly past creeks that kinked
through a thick tumble of birch, elm and oak, their leaves muted
red and squinty-bright yellow. When the woods cleared, we looked
out to a sweep of green pastures running up into folded, blue
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know this existed,'' Kathy said softly.
</P>
<P>
   True, we would have seen the same things had we ridden
conventional bikes. But it was a lot more fun linked together. For
one thing, Kathy couldn't ride off and leave me. But there was
something more. Feeling the bike surge beneath us, the two of us
working to orchestrate its ebb and flow, promoted a strange sense
of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered each other too. When we rode fast, the wind
whopped in our ears. When we didn't, we talked about dream houses,
college friends, funny memories, and why pealing church bells have
a special timbre on a crisp day.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long time since we'd been this close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remind me to shave the back of your neck,'' said Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   And riding the tandem quickly became as easy as, well, riding a
bike. There were a few dicey moments, sure, like suddenly finding
ourselves in a flood of gym class joggers from a nearby high
school. But we both gained confidence quickly. We left the bike
path and spun down back roads. We stopped, and started up,
wobble-free. Gliding along a sun dappled stretch of road I heard
Kathy singing, and saw her shadow behind me, arms pumping up and
down like some antic jogger.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't ride far, twenty-three miles in all. And, except for
an occasional sprint to feel the power of two, we didn't ride hard.
Jon had advised us to take it easy and make our first ride a
pleasant one. We took his advice seriously. We stopped for lunch.
We stopped for wary pedestrians. We let time seep away. We nearly
got swallowed by night.
</P>
<P>
   Which was nice. Because that's how we found ourselves swooping
alone through ghost shadows of cool and real shadows of flicking
light, the final foggy, low-beam remnants of a setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   It was our wonderful secret, immediate and complete.

CITIES BEGIN TO SOUR ON PUBLIC FINANCING FOR BALLPARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For evidence of skepticism about the community
value of new ballparks and stadiums, consider Round Rock, Texas,
where folks are looking a gift horse in the mouth, even though it's
offered by famous fireballer Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's investment group has purchased the Jackson (Miss.)
Generals of the AA Southern Association, plans to move the team to
Round Rock for the 2000 season and has pledged to put up about $6
million for a proposed $13 million ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock City Council was keen to accept Ryan's offer, but
a grass-roots petition drive has forced a Nov. 3 vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just corporate welfare,'' said David Oatman, one of the
petition campaign leaders. ``They want to use hotel-motel tax for
the city share, but the downside is there's not enough of it. Those
hotels don't exist,'' he said. ``This area loves baseball, but
we've got an even chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by San Francisco, where a flinty electorate has virtually
closed the public purse to the Giants and the 49ers, cities across
the country are requiring sports franchise owners to share in the
cost of the new ballparks and stadiums they say they need to remain
economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, the Padres are trying to persuade voters to accept
a deal in which the team contributes $115 million, or 28 percent of
the cost of a $411 million ballpark. The team also commits to
redevelop the downtown area where the stadium is to be built.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is on the Nov. 3 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, the Pirates and Steelers _ beaten in attempts to
fund a new ballpark and stadium through a regional sales-tax
increase _ have pledged to contribute $40 million and $50 million,
respectively, toward building their projects.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the legislature recently told New England
Patriots owner Robert Kraft to lump it when he rejected an offer of
$50 million in state infrastructure spending for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public sentiment has turned against professional sports teams
and this willy-nilly thing they have of moving franchises around
like snake-oil salesmen,'' said Robert Baade, an economist at Lake
Forest College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesotans said to the Twins' owners, `if you want to go, go.
Here's the door,''' Baade said. ``Maybe the lesson in this is that
cities have more in the way of power than they think they have when
they stand up to teams.''
</P>
<P>
   No city has stood up with greater rigidity than San Francisco,
where the Giants _ after a decade of hearing voters say no to
public financing _ are building the first privately financed major
league ballpark in 35 years and the 49ers are struggling with a
stadium and mall package that may be too rich for the developer.
</P>
<P>
   In making a bold move to finance a major-league ballpark
privately, Giants President and Managing General Partner Peter
Magowan ``has shifted the scale a bit, but he's still way out on a
limb,'' said sports economist Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College in
Massachusetts. He is author of ``Baseball and Billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Magowan ``has had an impact, but not in the form of emulation,''
Zimbalist said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zimbalist acknowledged, ``the trend is to get some
private financing,'' although ``you almost never have the case
where the owner actually takes money out of his pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual scenario is that ``the owner gives back a piece of the
revenue from the facility that is built for him with public
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Baer, executive vice president of the San Francisco
Giants, believes that ``there is a prevailing view among
municipalities that at a minimum there should be some form of
private contribution. The hybrid structure is becoming the dominant
form.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are raising $136 million _ through charter seat
sales, concession rights and sponsorships _ and blending it with
$170 million in loans to finance Pacific Bell Park, which is
scheduled to open in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While he thinks the Giants' financing plan has encouraged an
attitudinal shift and acceptance of the hybrid model among team
owners, Baer acknowledged that San Francisco is an unusual case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a couple of other places around the country have the
combination of taxpayer sentiment and the ability of the team
financially to allow for a privately built ballpark,'' he said.
``We have a rather large market, combined with high disposable
income and a rich tradition of Giants baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the arguments advanced by the San Diego Padres
for substantial public financing of a new ballpark was that the
team has neither the media market nor corporate base to foot the
entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Padres President Larry Lucchino, who was president of the
Baltimore Orioles at the birth of the publicly financed Oriole Park
at Camden Yards, said the deal struck with San Diego is no
softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that by combining a ballpark and a major
redevelopment project, we have increased the degree of difficulty''
for making it all happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That difficulty is enhanced by the skeptical attitude of the
influential San Diego County Taxpayers Association, which has yet
to take a position on the ballpark ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so bloody complicated we're still trying to understand
it,'' said Scott Barnett, executive director of the association.
``A lot of the money they're supposed to put up isn't really
private. For instance, the city is giving them five lots worth $10
million, and they count that as private. It seems like a kind of
clever accounting,'' he said.

   Rodney Fort, a sports economist at Washington State University
and author of ``Pay Dirt,'' said Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen
appears to have perfected a new model of private financing that
will cost him nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is obligated to provide $100 million of the $400 million
being spent for a new Seahawks stadium, ``but not a penny is coming
out of his pocket. The stadium is owned by the King County Stadium
Authority, and Allen has the rights to everything in the stadium
... and the revenues will go to the Seahawks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only trend is being driven by the profitability of
sports,'' Fort said. ``As long as it looks like the teams are
making money, public officials are going to expect them to pay a
part.''

   New York is the scene an intriguing ballpark financing drama,
because the Yankees and Mets are angling for new facilities which
would be heavily financed by taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times _ citing the private financing success of the
Giants _ suggested in an editorial that the teams may be
overreaching: ``When club owners in lesser markets raise huge
amounts of private capital to finance stadiums, owners and
politicians in New York have to explain why that will not work
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study released last week, University of California at
Berkeley scholar Jack Sylvan reported cities that build expensive
stadiums and ballparks to attract sports teams derive little
economic benefit from them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sylvan said in an interview, such facilities
exercise a hard-to-resist fascination because of ``the
intangibles'' and cachet that cities believe they bring.
</P>
<P>
   That is what worries Round Rock's Oatman in the campaign against
$7 million in public financing for a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, major league baseball's all-time strikeout leader and a
sure-fire inductee into the Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible
next year, has turned his city's head, Oatman believes.

   ``One of the big problems we're facing is that the city
hierarchy is totally star-struck. They can't think rationally,'' he
said. ``They don't seem to realize that Nolan Ryan is a
businessman.''

ROSEANNE BARR JOINS THE TALKS SHOW WARS

 Color slides and black and white photos of Roseanne Barr. 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    With Oprah and Rosie, Jerry and Jennie, Howie Mandell, Donny and
Marie and who knows who else, it's getting pretty crowded in the
daytime TV talk show marketplace. But room can always be found for
a tough contender with muscle. And they don't come any tougher than
Roseanne Barr.
 &HT;    King World Productions obviously thinks so. They've paid the
lady handsomely to jump into the daytime ring with the ``Roseanne
Show'' which debuts Sept. 14.
 &HT;    What Barr has going for her is enormous recognition based on
almost a decade as Roseanne Conner, America's favorite blue collar
mom. After nine years on ABC the Conners hit the lottery jackpot
and the working class stiffs ended up as the filthy rich. The saga
was complete. It was, Barr decided, time to move on.
 &HT;    Looking trim and pretty in sandals, white pants and a simple
blouse top, and wearing her hair cut short, Barr showed up for
breakfast one morning recently at her manager Jeff Wald's
26th-floor Century City office to try to explain why she's decided
to become the newest entry in the talk show wars.
 &HT;    ``I wanted a change and felt that talk is a great way for me to
communicate with my audience directly,'' she said. ``No scripts.
Just me, my guests and the audience. When I watch other people who
did talk shows before me, there were some great, great ones.
Particularly Johnny Carson who I'd do anything to get on my show.''
 &HT;    Even though she agrees the talk show market is crowded she
doesn't fear entering the fray. ``There are a lot of shows on TV
that show us how low we can go. I'd like to show how high we can
go. I won't have a sidekick. But I do pick a pet from the audience
for each show who gets their easy chair and gets treated better
than the rest of the audience. We'll go out to meet people. I
answer questions and do a little monologue about whatever I want to
talk about that day.''
 &HT;    She knows what she'll have no time for: ``I don't want any
fist-fighting or people who sleep with their daughter's boyfriends.
I'm not going to have any of that _ unless they're famous.''
 &HT;    She laughs, then promises the her show will be ``more Donahue
than anything else.''
 &HT;    She'd love to have Winfrey on her first show, she adds. ``She's
a class act, a role model and I'm totally inspired by her. I called
her and Rosie when I decided to do my show and they gave me
personal advice. Mostly it was to be myself and have fun.''
 &HT;    The wisecracking, hard-edged Barr came to us first via stand up
in the early '80s with lines like: ``He's always asking, 'Where's
my socks? Where's my keys?' Men think the uterus is a tracking
device.'''
 &HT;    It was a fresh voice, straight from the neglected working class.
Donna Reed she wasn't. And we loved her for it until the tales of
her real domestic life kept getting in the way.
 &HT;    ``We're everybody's nightmare,'' she once said at the height of
her raucous divorce from actor Tom Arnold. ``Rich, white trash.''
 &HT;    But she feels that because she fought the media's attacks on her
weight and her lifestyle she was targeted in the final ``Roseanne''
season. A l997 Washington Post article declared, ``The decline
began when Barr lost weight, had a face lift, and continued when
the Conners won the lottery.''
 &HT;    Was that unfair? ``Stupid,'' she says, nibbling a blueberry
muffin washed down with black coffee. ``It's all the tabloid
mentality that filtered up from the very bottom of journalism to
the top. I was able to see things that started in the National
Enquirer quoted in the New York Times and it blew my mind.''
 &HT;    When she appeared in July at the gathering of TV critics from
around the country in Pasadena, the scribes found her remarkably
subdued. Was this the new Roseanne? ``No. It's the real me,'' she
says without a smile, ``unfettered by the opinions of other people.
People are always shocked when they meet me. They always say, 'Hey,
you're not like it said in The Enquirer.' I never was actually. In
real life I'm very shy.''
 &HT;    Since leaving the weekly sitcom field Barr says she's been
playing full-time mom to her kids, from 3-year-old Buck from her
marriage to Thomas, to her son Jake, 20, and her three daughters
who are 22, 23, and 27.
 &HT;    ``I put all my energy into my kids, getting them into college,
getting their own places to live, their own cars, their own
insurance. The last year was all for my kids. I think I'm a better
mom this time around.''
 &HT;    You have to wonder. Being Barr's kid during the worst of her
continuing saga can't have been the easiest path through
adolescence. ``This time with Buck,'' she says, ``I used my four
grown kids as nannies and that was just a great experience. I
brought them in to help me correct the mistakes I made the first
time. It was a very healing year for all of us. And we got real
close.''
 &HT;    The daily talk show is a grueling contest, as Magic Johnson and
scores of predecessors have learned. ``I often ask myself why I'm
doing this,'' Barr admits. ``I was ready because I had completed
the whole thing I wanted to do on `Roseanne,' but I still had more
things to say. I wasn't ready to go out to pasture just yet.''

<P>
   Edward L. Bernays, who died three years ago at the age of 103,
was a master of public relations _ the grand spinmeister of the
century he spanned.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1920s, Bernays pulled strings and pushed
products so adroitly that his was a truly invisible hand: His
campaigns rarely carried his fingerprints or those of his clients _
Lucky Strikes, Calvin Coolidge and the United Fruit Co., to name
just three among hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Larry Tye writes in ``The Father of Spin: Edward L.
Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations'' (Crown, $27.50), he
relied on a more roundabout method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernays generated events, the events generated news, and the
news generated a demand for whatever he happened to be selling,''
writes the author, a reporter for The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   To get more women to buy cigarettes in the 1920s, Bernays
convinced feminists that public smoking was a sign of liberation.
Once they decided to brandish their cigarettes at a Manhattan march
_ his idea _ the resulting newspaper coverage did the work for
Bernays's client, the American Tobacco Co., the maker of Luckies.
</P>
<P>
   To soften the image of the dour Coolidge, whom he helped elect,
Bernays sent celebrities to the White House, then helpfully gave
the press corps its angle. ``Jolson Makes President Laugh for the
First Time in Public,'' read one obedient headline.
</P>
<P>
   And decades later, in 1954, Bernays had a key propaganda role in
the overthrow, aided by the Central Intelligence Agency, of
Guatemala's socialist government. His line: the Latin American
nation represented a Communist threat. His goal: protecting United
Fruit's profitable banana operation.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, Tye notes, the news media were Bernays's partners,
unwitting and otherwise. They listened to his pitch on Guatemala.
They published articles by ``experts'' he had hired to write about,
say, hearty breakfasts (for a bacon processor) or the growing
popularity of being slim (for American Tobacco, whose pitch to
women was ``Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet'').
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategic approach to shaping public opinion was a
hallmark of the man _ and his legacy, the author says. There is
even a widespread belief that Joseph Goebbels was influenced by
Bernays, who was a Jewish Austrian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the author notes, tens of thousands of American spin
doctors build on the strategies that Bernays refined, from movie
product placement to presidential image-making.
</P>
<P>
   This book, the first full biography of Bernays, is meant to
``unmask'' the man, the author says, and to show how popular ideas
are shaped routinely by ``singular powers in our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Father of Spin'' is myopic at times, picking at Bernays's
personal flaws and worrying over his exact place in public
relations history. And it has a few other problems _ most notably
the failure to deliver on a juicy claim early in the book that
Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, used his uncle's theory of the
unconscious ``to rob customers of their free will.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tye, who sifted through hundreds of boxes of Bernays's
papers at the Library of Congress, succeeds wonderfully in
illustrating the often-creepy power of our opinion makers.
</P>
<P>
   As the author re-creates one after another of Bernays's
campaigns to change public life for the sake of a product _ he
calls it the ``Big Think'' strategy _ the lines between publicity
and propaganda seem to blur.
</P>
<P>
   The full tale of United Fruit is especially chilling in this
regard, as is, for some reason, the revelation that Bernays's staff
wrote jokes and repeated them in society for the benefit of
clients. Thus every woman who eyed chocolate and quipped, ``a
moment on the lips and 10 years on the hips'' was a soldier in
Luckies' anti-sweet campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Based on correspondence he found in some of the Bernays boxes _
more than 50 cartons chronicling an 18-year relationship with
American Tobacco _ the author also argues that Bernays suspected
that smoking was perilous as far back as the 1930s, despite his
assertions years later that he wasn't aware of the dangers at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The book is much less absorbing in the chapters devoted to
Bernays's personal life. As a husband, the self-proclaimed feminist
was often chauvinistic, we are told; as a father, he could be
overcontrolling. (When one of his daughters, Anne Bernays, the
novelist, published her first book, he sent out news releases
against her wishes.)
</P>
<P>
   For a liberal, he was class-conscious and elitist, the author
says. And as an autobiographer and eminence grise of public
relations, he sometimes puffed up the importance of his
contributions. What else would a PR man do?
</P>
<P>
   Biographies, of course, demand these assessments. But Bernays's
personal foibles seem beside the point here. Fittingly, perhaps, it
is the spinmeister, not the man behind the mask, who commands our
attention.

IF IT SMELLS LIKE A GUN TAX, IT'S A GUN TAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most folks are familiar with the old ``if it looks like a duck,
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck''
analogy. A governmental version of that goes: ``If it looks like a
tax, acts like a tax and hurts like a tax, call it anything you
like _ even a user fee _ but it's still a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, this is not original
thinking. A column-writing colleague first used it years ago to
take a local municipality to task about water rates, if memory
serves me. It fits perfectly the ongoing debate about the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has proposed that federally licensed
firearms dealers be assessed a ``user fee'' each time the FBI
processes a background check on a prospective gun buyer after Nov.
30. The gun dealer, naturally, will pass that t`h ... uh, check
that _ ``user fee'' ... on to the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that the $200 million that was appropriated to
it under the 1993 Brady Act can only be used to improve the
criminal history record systems in the states, and not to perform
the individual background checks that will become law Dec. 1. And
because it will cost upward of $91.6 million next year to run the
NICS Operations Center, a $14 ``user fee'' will be necessary to
cover the costs of the estimated 6.7 million inquiries per year.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the topic of names ... the full name of the Brady
Act is the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act. But don't any of
you long-gun devotees think you'll be exempt from being treated
like a felon. As of Dec. 1, sportsmen and hunters desiring to
purchase rifles and shotguns will be subjected to the same
background check _ and tax _ as those wishing to purchase a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Justice's proposed rule for the
instant checks, the FBI has the ``authority to establish, collect
and retain fees for processing name checks for non-criminal justice
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold the phone right here. Why would we be doing tjIf

DAN BURTON WATCHES FOR CRACKS IN A GLASS HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, well. Somebody is investigating Rep. Dan Burton's sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
</P>
<P>
   Burton is the Indiana Republican who called President Clinton a
``scumbag'' and made it perfectly clear that he considers Clinton
morally unfit to hold the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Now we hear reports that Vanity Fair magazine has been examining
Burton's background in pursuit of what Burton calls a ``scandal
story.'' With the media posse nipping at his heels, the
sanctimonious congressman is suddenly admitting to ``rough spots''
in his 38-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, Burton will be confessing that he caused
pain in his marriage. He'll be confirming that he misled people,
including even his wife. He might even concede that he indulged in
relationships that were not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Such things can happen when politicians start rummaging around
in other politicians' dirty laundry. This must be what the
old-timers meant when they talked about the pot calling the kettle
black.
</P>
<P>
   The cliches just scream to be heard. What goes around comes
around. You reap what you sow. People who live in glass houses...
</P>
<P>
   Burton attempted to pre-empt the scandal by issuing a _ pardon
the expression _ blanket apology.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, Burton said at a town hall
meeting in Frankfort, Ind., ``Anything you read in the paper that I
should be accountable for, I apologize in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   And we thought Clinton's apology was vague.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the catch-all nature of his pre-scandal apology, Burton
evidently has committed enough private indiscretions that he isn't
sure which one _ or ones _ that Vanity Fair is investigating.
Wouldn't be ironic if Burton has participated in so many ``not
appropriate'' relationships that he makes Clinton look like a monk?
</P>
<P>
   After all, you'd have to figure that if Burton had strayed only
a time or two, he would know exactly what Vanity Fair was working
on. You'd have to figure that he could have offered a more specific
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was spouting off the other day about how he will ``own
up'' to his sins if and when any bad behavior is reported by the
media. Burton said he will do the right thing _ not lie, mislead
and dissemble, as Clinton has done.
</P>
<P>
   Swell. But if Burton truly wants to demonstrate that he's a man
of integrity _ something, he has said, that Clinton is not _ then
why should he wait until the other shoe drops to ``own up'' to
whatever it is that he's done? Why not ``own up'' now, instead of
waiting to find out what Vanity Fair or other media scandalmongers
have uncovered?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, why doesn't Burton call a news conference,
admit to all the inappropriate conduct that the media might be
inclined to expose, and apologize for each and every indiscretion?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is obvious. Like any rational human being, he'd
rather not reveal any secrets unless he has to. Like anyone who
cherishes his privacy _ like Clinton, even _ Burton believes that
his private life should be private. Or as private as he can keep
it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Burton blames Vanity Fair's interest in his
sexual history on the Clinton White House, suggesting that the
president's henchmen are trying to intimidate him because he is
chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee and
in that capacity is investigating allegations of campaign finance
violations by the 1996 Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported that Burton's brother, a state representative,
pointed out that ex-Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers works for
Vanity Fair. The magazine dismissed as ``totally ludicrous'' the
suggestion that it might be hauling water for the Clintonites.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, almost nothing is totally ludicrous where the Clinton
White House is concerned. But Burton is learning the hard way what
he should have known about politics: If a congressman wants to call
the president a ``scumbag,'' the congressman's glass house had
better be bulletproof.

A WASTELAND POPULATED BY BIRDS AND APES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now we've surely all sent away for our personal Singing Bird
Clocks (``Mommy, Mommy, that's an oriole!'') for only $19.99 plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Singing Bird Clock commercials seem to be doing a heap to keep
PAX TV in chirping fettle.
</P>
<P>
   These educational clocks, which turn little girls into annoying
pests (``Mommy, Mommy, it's a pterodactyl!''), might not be
available in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe they are. I say that only to avoid phone calls
from hundreds of outraged proprietors of Singing Bird Clock
boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. Television. A visual medium, pervasive in the second half
of the 20th century, in which transient images of boring programs
are sent over the electromagnetic spectrum, or shoved into cables,
so that time can be killed and brain cells can evaporate like
raindrops in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Which is about how I see ``Behind the Planet of the Apes''
(Sunday on American Movie Classics), a documentary that asks us to
believe that those ape movies were Hollywood classics.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, an otherwise agreeable cable channel, is surrounding the
documentary with one ``Planet of the Apes'' movie after another on
Sunday and Monday, until you may feel like a Singing Bird Clock
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is hosted by Roddy McDowell, who has always been
a curious mixture of erudition and irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   It's supposed to be two hours long. I say supposed to be because
I put the damn thing on _ last week, maybe? _ and it never ended.
</P>
<P>
   My Singing Bird Clock could have spun through spectra of
feathered vertebrates while Roddy clucked along on that tape.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up somewhere around the third sequel. McDowell seemed
bent on reliving every ``Planet of the Apes'' film and two TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   To me, ``Planet of the Apes'' was a bunch of actors in monkey
suits chasing a half-naked Charlton Heston with nets.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably what thousands of deer would love to do, now
that Heston is president of the National Rifle Association. But
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that's clear is that ``Planet of the Apes'' was quite
an industry from the first movie in 1968 to the TV cartoon show in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that political satire wasn't cycling through a subtle
period in 1968. Geez, you mean ``Planet of the Apes'' cleverly
turned the tables and taught us how it felt to be the underdog?
Smack my chops!
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Zanuck, who ran the 20th Century Fox studio at the
time, insists he didn't have a clue that the movie was anything but
pure sci-fi entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Statue of Liberty planted in Zuma Beach, in the film's final
scene? Not a political statement, Zanuck says. It was just a little
something to titillate the audience. This man ran a studio?
</P>
<P>
   If you care about these things, you can learn that Maurice
Evans' role as the orangutan in chief was originally slotted for
Edward G. Robinson, that Orson Welles declined the role of a
gorilla military leader in ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' and
that the ape revolt in ``Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'' was
modeled after the 1965 Watts riot in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There, aren't you richer for that?
</P>
<P>
   This one is interesting, though. A caste system developed,
unintendedly, during filming. Actors in gorilla suits ate lunch
with other gorillas. Orangutans ate with orangutans. Chimps with
chimps.
</P>
<P>
   Singing Bird Clock owners probably would have confined
themselves to other Singing Bird Clock owners, ignoring Talking
Bird Clock owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation for that whatsoever,'' Heston jokes
about the monkeys fraternizing only with like monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he did, you couldn't force it out of him at gunpoint.

<P>
   When President Clinton returns to the White House after his long
vacation and business trip, I'm sure there will be quite a bundle
of mail piled up outside his door. Catalogs from Hammacher
Schlemmer, old copies of Golf Digest and Cigar Afficionado, cable
bills, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton wades through the pile, he'll also find a package I
FedExed to him, containing a CD of his new theme song: ``Hard for
Me to Say I'm Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; After all that we've been through &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I will make it up to you, I promise you &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You might recall they used that tune in the classic movie
``Summer Lovers,'' starring Peter Gallagher as a smooth charmer who
lives with a blonde but fools around with a brunette. Hey, just
like the president!
</P>
<P>
   This guy is beyond belief. It's not just hard for him to say
he's sorry, it's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   My theory: It's all about ``Love Story.'' You know, the Erich
Segal novel that was turned into the movie in which Ali MacGraw
uttered the immortal line, ``Love means never having to say you're
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   As you'll recall, popular lore says Segal based the story in
part on the romance of his old Yalie buddy Al Gore and bride-to-be
Tipper. Gore has no doubt taken his Love Story connection to heart
- whispering in Clinton's ear, ``Mr. President, love means never
having to say you're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my theory and I'm sticking with it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you knew that sometime during Clinton's visit to
Russia, a reporter was going to ask him about his semi-apology to
the American people and whether he regretted the decision not to
say two words: ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the president's chagrin, it happened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' the reporter said, ``you were just speaking of the
challenges that we face as a nation. And one is reaction since your
admission of a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky _ (Has it) given you
any cause for concern that you may not be as effective as you
should be in leading the country?
</P>
<P>
   There was the windup and the pitch. Now all Clinton had to do
was say, ``You know, I've been thinking a great deal about that,
and I've been listening to what the American people have had to
say, and I understand the concerns of those who believe I wasn't
clear enough in my speech. So let me take this opportunity to say I
am sorry. Truly, deeply sorry for lying to people and prolonging
this madness. And that's the last we're going to speak of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton launched into one of the most astonishing
examples of political doublespeak we've ever heard. You may have
caught snippets of his answer on the evening news, but I'd like to
reprint his answer in its entirety, to truly capture the
slitheringly duplicitous nature of his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the president replied, ``I've actually been quite
heartened by the reaction of the American people and leaders
throughout the world about it. I have acknowledged that I made a
mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a
lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of
weeks and said I was going back to work. I believe that's what the
American people want me to do, and based on my conversations with
leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do,
and that is what I intend to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very
large issues that will affect the future of the American people in
the short run and over the long run. There are large issues that
have to be dealt with now in the world and at home. And so I have
been quite encouraged by what I think the message from the American
people has been and what I know of the message from leaders around
the world has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to do my best to continue to go through this
personal process in an appropriate way, but to do my job, to do the
job I was hired to do. And I think it very much needs to be done
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, that's more than 200 words of pure, Grade-A, unadulterated
bull-oney.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same press conference, Clinton offered another
lengthy non-apology, which started thusly: ``Well, to your second
question, I think I can almost reiterate what I said in response to
the first question. I think the question of the tone of the speech
and people's reaction to it is really a function of _ I can't
comment on that ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   While I continue to maintain the president's personal life is
his and his alone to screw up, he does owe the American people a
straightforward apology for lying to our faces. That he continues
to dance around ``I'm sorry'' and thinks he can assuage us with
classic Clinton-speak tells us we are dealing with the most
self-absorbed president in modern history.

MONITOR DISRUPTIONS WITH WINDOWS 95 COULD CALL FOR VIDEO CARD
CHECKUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a computer that is about four years old and recently
upgraded it to Windows 95 from 3.1. Now, when the computer comes on
the Windows logo screen looks great, but then as the desktop comes
up, the screen squeezes in to 70 percent of normal horizontal and
goes to about 120 percent of vertical. As a result, the task bar at
the bottom is lost. All efforts to adjust the screen with buttons
and knobs on the monitor have failed. I don't know if it's the
monitor or the graphics hardware or the driver.
</P>
<P>
   A: The video card driver is the first thing you should check,
particularly if you are using the original driver that came on the
Windows 95 disk. Even the most recent, retail version of Windows 95
likely has older drivers than what you'll find on your video card
maker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If installing a new driver doesn't help, you might want to see
if the Windows 95 installation didn't recognize your monitor
properly. This will often happen on an older computer that doesn't
fully support Plug-and-Play, particularly if you also have a
monitor that's not Plug-and-Play.
</P>
<P>
   To check the monitor settings, right-click on the open desktop
and choose Properties, then click on the Settings tab. Click the
Advanced button, and from here you should be able to tell what kind
of monitor you have. If it lists a generic monitor, or it's not the
one you have, click on Change. You'll be able to pick from a list
of manufacturers on the left of the dual-pane window, and specific
models on the right. Choose your specific make and model and click
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Your screen may or may not reset at this point. Depending on
your version of Windows 95, you may also have a drop-down box that
will let you change the refresh rate. Once you've chosen your
monitor, one of your choices may be ``Optimal'' _ if so, choose
that.
</P>
<P>
   If that still doesn't fix your problem, you might want to
contact the tech support for the maker of your video card, and then
your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I currently have 64 megabytes of memory in my computer, and
its maximum is 128 megabytes. Memory is so cheap right now that I
am thinking about taking it to the limit, all the way to 128
megabytes! Will I see a big difference in my performance? Going
from 32 to 64 megabytes was certainly impressive!
</P>
<P>
   A: This depends largely on what kind of user you are.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most PC users _ with two, maybe three
applications running at a time _ you probably won't see that big an
improvement. You also won't see much improvement if you are using
basic programs _ word processors, browsers or e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a ``power user'' who has many applications up at
the same time, or you use RAM-hungry programs, such as graphics
manipulation packages, then going to 128 megabytes might be a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The more memory you can feed Windows, the less it will use the
slower hard drive for virtual memory. But if your needs are modest,
you might not access virtual memory at all with 64 megabytes. In
that case, you can save your money for some other PC goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people like the changes in the way Windows 98
``moves'' on the screen, where menus slide out or appear to expand
from a single point. But to me, it just seems to make everything
slower. Is there a way to turn these things off so menus just
instantly appear?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is yet another job for TweakUI, the amazing applet
that's found on the Windows 98 CD-ROM (look in the
toolsreskitpowertoy folder; instructions for installing are there,
too).
</P>
<P>
   Launch TweakUI from the Control Panel, then choose the General
tab. You'll see Menu animation, Combo box animation and List box
animation. Uncheck those and watch Windows 98 speed up.

LOW-COST POWER COMES AS A SHOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scanning the newspaper computer ads has turned into an exercise
in reverse sticker shock. Even though it's part of my job to keep
tabs on what's happening with PC prices, I'm always stunned and
amazed at the amount of power $1,000 will buy you today.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, the standard for a sub-$1,000 computer was
a processor that ran in the 233- to 266-megahertz range. Now, with
competition heating up among chip makers, an increasing number of
low-cost computersrun at 300 megahertz or faster.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that 400-megahertz systems will be selling for
around or below $1,000 by Christmas boggle the mind. But for now,
you'll have to ``settle'' for bargains like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aptiva E3N, $999, IBM. &UR;  &LR; Big Blue was a latecomer to the cheap
personal computer party. But IBM has staged a comeback with its E
series of Aptiva PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This Aptiva comes with a 300-megahertz Advanced Micro Devices
K6-2 chip, which has the 3D Now! extensions to help improve 3-D
graphics performance. This isn't automatic, however _ software
developers must write their programs to take advantage of the
chip's features, and AMD is working to convince game companies to
support 3D Now!
</P>
<P>
   The E3N comes with a whopping 64 megabytes of memory, a
six-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem, an ATI Rage Pro AGP video
card and a 32X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a 100-megahertz system bus, which refers to the
speed at which information travels between the main chip and other
hardware devices. The model I tried, however, was a pre-production
unit and didn't have this feature. Indeed, the E3N felt a bit
sluggish at times; I would have liked to have tried it with the
faster system board.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has been showing off its K6-2's capabilities by creating a
special version of id Software's Quake II that works with 3D Now! I
ran both the K6 and the standard versions, and there was a
noticeable improvement in speed when using the former.
</P>
<P>
   The Aptiva has a couple of interesting programs on it that will
be a boon for novices. An ``Aptiva Adventure'' module configures
Norton Antivirus and some on-screen navigation tools that make it
easier to access the computer's features. A configuration tracker
takes a snapshot of your system when it's healthy, so you can
restore it to working order if something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   There are two shortcomings to E3N, however. First, it has a
single, shared ISA and PCI expansion slot. That means you can add
just one card to it. Although this would be a nice, affordable game
machine, adding a Voodoo2 add-on 3-D video card means you can't
also add a network card for multiplayer competition. Choose one or
the other, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you decide to stick with the ATI video card for your
3-D needs, it's got only two megabytes of video memory, which
limits resolution and color depth capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ NEC Ready 9883, $1,099, NEC/Packard Bell. Intel Corp.'s
Celeron processor got a bad rap when it first came out, because
early models lacked a level 2 cache, a kind of buffer that boosts
the speed of data moving into and out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel's latest Celerons have this cache feature, and their
performance now rivals that of the more celebrated _ and more
expensive _ Pentium II chips. In fact, some analysts have wondered
why consumers now would even consider a Pentium II system, when the
Celeron-based machines have comparable performance at much lower
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ready 9883 uses the 333-megahertz Celeron chip, and it's
easily the peppiest low-cost PC I've tried yet. This machine
handled everything I threw at it flawlessly, despite the fact that
its system bus is only 66 megahertz. I put a Creative Labs 3D
Blaster Voodoo2 card in it, with 12 megabytes of video memory, and
it ran Quake II incredibly smoothly, even at a resolution of
800-by-600 pixels. And it did not require a specially tweaked
version.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with 64 megabytes of memory; a 6.4-gigabyte hard
drive; a 56K fax modem; and a 32X CD-ROM drive. Like the E3N, it
uses the ATI Rage Pro AGP video card, but this one has four
megabytes of video memory instead of just two. It also is much more
expandable, with two PCI slots and an ISA slot.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Aptiva, the Ready 9883 has an on-screen utility for
working with features and setting preferences. One of those buttons
is an instant connection to the Internet that automatically knows
your preferred onramp. For example, if you have an America Online
account, clicking the Internet Connect button launches the AOL
software.
</P>
<P>
   This computer really is one of the best buys I've seen so far in
the low-price class. Why wait till Christmas?

GARDENING: NOT ALL THE BEST ASTERS WERE EDUCATED IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    In the garden, as elsewhere, refinement is often viewed as a
plus. Take New England and New York asters, for example. Among the
first plants to catch the eyes of European settlers, they were sent
abroad about 300 years ago and went to finishing school in the
hands of British and German nurserymen.
 &HT;    Hundreds of well-bred cultivars were created, featuring colors
ranging from pure white to rich purple and European names like
``Nesthakchen'' and ``Alma Potschke.'' Their undisputed beauty in
late-season borders, however, requires much upkeep, as they are
prone to mildew and wilts, form dense clumps requiring division
every two to three years and often need staking.
 &HT;    Those are not traits that I want. Rather, I choose plants that
are not only attractive but also easy to care for. Thus, my borders
in central New Jersey are filled with ``common asters,'' the
overlooked ones that remained rooted at home.
 &HT;    Sky blue aster (A. azureus) is the first to flower, usually by
mid-August. The popular name is misleading because the flower is
actually a pale, almost purplish blue rather than the rich blue of
a clear sky. The rays _ or petals as they are popularly known _
surround a sunny yellow central disk.
 &HT;    When cut back in June, sky blue aster forms a bushy two-foot
clump of one-inch flowers that open for almost a month. Left on its
own, it reaches almost four feet and lightly flops among other
flowers. I pair it with boltonia (B. asteroides), a white-flowered
aster relative, and the two form a graceful end-of-summer
combination in borders outdoors and arrangements indoors.
 &HT;    Umbellatus aster (A. umbellatus) is the longest blooming and
perhaps least known of these plants. Sometimes called flat-topped
aster, a name that in no way conveys its beauty, it bears masses of
creamy white three-quarter-inch flowers. Resembling petite daisies,
these asters start their six to seven weeks of bloom in mid- to
late August.
 &HT;    Umbellatus aster can be used in many ways. In early June, I cut
back a six-foot-long planting to about 14 inches. This encourages
intense branching, so that when blooming starts, I have the
equivalent of an unstaked, three-foot-tall flowering hedge.
 &HT;    In my white garden, the asters are between a six-foot fence and
a Diana rose of Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus ``Diana''). Here the
asters, buttressed by the shrub, soar well over six feet and create
further privacy. Their flowers bob among Diana's lustrous
three-inch white blossoms, creating a plant fence that features
contrasts in flower shape and size.
 &HT;    Calico aster (A. lateriflorus var. horizontalis) tops off at
three feet and needs neither staking nor cutting back. It is
unusual in that it features color in both foliage and flowers.
 &HT;    The tips of the leaves, which branch off the sturdy horizontal
stems, become tinged with a purplish hue in mid-September. These
leaves peek out from the myriad half-inch blush white to pale lilac
flowers, each with a rose-colored disk, that cover the stems and
appear from mid-September into the first week or two of October.
 &HT;    Calico aster is perfect for anyone who wants a soft, pastel
presence in the garden at a fiery-colored time of year.
 &HT;    In my borders, the sky blue, umbellatus and calico asters are in
full sun, where they perform best. When heath aster (A. ericoides)
is similarly placed, it forms a dense, thick mound packed with
sprays of flowers that rival those of a heath in full bloom.
 &HT;    Given its tolerance of dry situations, however, I decided to
experiment and planted it in a tree-shrouded spot that receives no
more than two hours of morning sun. It has been happy there for
seven years now, growing about two feet tall and featuring open,
airy stems profusely dotted with half-inch white flowers for almost
three weeks, starting shortly after Labor Day.
 &HT;    White wood aster (A. divaricatus) is an outstanding dry shade
plant. Nevertheless, despite being sent abroad well over a century
ago and being used by Gertrude Jekyll in her fall borders in
England, it has yet to become popular with European breeders or
American gardeners.
 &HT;    It is one of those plants that are just too easy to grow. And to
be honest, until it bursts forth with its late-season flowers, it
is rather bland and inconspicuous. (If I had the naturally
occurring form with dark purple stems, I might change this
assessment.) Starting in late August, however, this plant earns its
presence with its five-week display of abundant one-inch flowers
with white rays and purple centers surrounding a small yellow disk.
 &HT;    Once you incorporate one or more of these widely adaptable,
no-maintenance ``common asters,'' you might agree that refinement
is needed not in their appearance but rather in the eyes of
gardeners.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Asters are available by mail from Forest Farm, 990 Tetherow
Road, Williams, Ore. 97544, (541) 846-7269, catalog, $4; Prairie
Nursery, PO Box 306, Westfield, Wis. 53964, (800) 476-9453, free

 &HT;    THIS WEEK: SEEDS TO SAVE, SEEDS TO SUPPRESS 
 &HT;    By PATRICIA JONAS
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Save seed of heirloom vegetables and climbing vines like
hyacinth bean. Pods of beans and peas left to dry on the vine give
up their seed easily when rubbed gently. Store seed in labeled,
airtight moisture-free containers like 35-mm film canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ignore weeds in the garden. They will produce abundant
seed that will remain dormant in the soil over winter, so pulling
up or cutting off seed heads will save weeding next year.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ordering bulbs to naturalize in a lawn, good choices
are masses of small, very early-blooming bulbs like snow crocus
(Crocus chrysanthus), spring snowflake (Leucojum vernum),
glory-of-the-snow (Chionodoxa luciliae) and the English favorite,
snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis).
</P>
<P>
   In spring, if the mower is set high and the first mowing
postponed several weeks, they will thrive and multiply. Plant these
bulbs when they arrive, but hold off on tulips until the end of
October or later.

IF IT SMELLS LIKE A GUN TAX, IT'S A GUN TAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most folks are familiar with the old ``if it looks like a duck,
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck''
analogy. A governmental version of that goes: ``If it looks like a
tax, acts like a tax and hurts like a tax, call it anything you
like _ even a user fee _ but it's still a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, this is not original
thinking. A column-writing colleague first used it years ago to
take a local municipality to task about water rates, if memory
serves me. It fits perfectly the ongoing debate about the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has proposed that federally licensed
firearms dealers be assessed a ``user fee'' each time the FBI
processes a background check on a prospective gun buyer after Nov.
30. The gun dealer, naturally, will pass that tax ... uh, check
that _ ``user fee'' ... on to the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that the $200 million that was appropriated to
it under the 1993 Brady Act can only be used to improve the
criminal history record systems in the states, and not to perform
the individual background checks that will become law Dec. 1. And
because it will cost upward of $91.6 million next year to run the
NICS Operations Center, a $14 ``user fee'' will be necessary to
cover the costs of the estimated 6.7 million inquiries per year.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the topic of names ... the full name of the Brady
Act is the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act. But don't any of
you long-gun devotees think you'll be exempt from being treated
like a felon. As of Dec. 1, sportsmen and hunters desiring to
purchase rifles and shotguns will be subjected to the same
background check _ and tax _ as those wishing to purchase a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Justice's proposed rule for the
instant checks, the FBI has the ``authority to establish, collect
and retain fees for processing name checks for non-criminal justice
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold the phone right here. Why would we be doing this if it
wasn't for the purposes of criminal justice? Sarah Brady, Handgun
Control Inc. and other proponents of the Brady Act have long
advocated that the law was m?dq`JHM$gmh|S9z;|!rad people from doing
unknown bad things with guns. If attempting to keep convicted
felons from buying a gun is a non-criminal justice process, I'll be
the first to quack like a duck.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the way that the FBI ``doesn't'g e9iV)b''mheb]

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choice for the trip was between a large, luxury, four-door
with juice drive or a sporty coupe with a five-speed manual _ which
means it was no choice at all. This trip entailed a ride to the
home of the wildest weather on the continent to accompany a team
celebrating the 99th anniversary of an automotive landmark: the
first automobile ascent to the top of New Hampshire's 6,288-foot
Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aug. 31, 1899, when Freelan Oscar Stanley, with his wife,
Flora, took the tiller of a Locomobile steamer and made the
perilous ascent up New England's highest mountain. If the ascent
was rough, the descent was even more problematical _ how does one
guide a car with virtually no brakes 7.6 miles down an average 12
percent grade? Flora remarked in her diary that it was ``easy as
falling off a log.'' Rumor has it that F.O. Stanley dragged a log
to slow the car on the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Monday, Aug. 31, 1998, and Brent Campbell and Norm
Shanklin are preparing to commemorate the Stanley feat by taking
Campbell's 1908 Gentleman's Speedy Racer, a 20-horsepower Stanley
Steamer, up the Mount Washington Auto Road. It is sunny and mild
where we stand, 4,600 feet below the peak, listening to the hiss of
the burner. At the summit, dark clouds scud across the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist is somewhat grateful that the Stanley racer has
but two seats, both of them occupied; I will ascend ahead and
follow the steamer from the four-mile mark in an Acura 2.3 CL, that
sporty little coupe _ with a proper heater, air conditioning, seat
belts, air bags, and a windshield, all of which are lacking in the
Stanley. With me is Stanley Museum director Susan S. Davis, who
will photograph the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Road is a private road, built in the middle of the last
century, an engineering marvel in its day. Today, if you have the
right car _ some automatics are unfit for the descent _ you can pay
the toll and, if you are smart, read the instructions and listen to
the instructional tape or CD provided. Or, if you have the wrong
car or simply prefer, you may pay the fare and take the stage, a
comfortable van professionally driven, to the summit and back.
</P>
<P>
   The four-mile ascent to the initial observation point is a piece
of cake for the Acura CL _ and a good deal of fun, too, as manners
prevail on the trail. Descenders have the right of way; slow
ascenders pull off to allow faster vehicles to pass. The ascent is
in second gear, at modest speed and fairly high r.p.m., although
the twists and turns of the road make it seem as if we're ascending
at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-mile overlook,the view is breathtaking and the wind
is fierce. In the distance, I can hear the Stanley's pumps
chattering; as it nears, the nearly silent chuffing of the steam
engine becomes audible, then suddenly the gray car spurts into
sight rounding a bend _ Shanklin is now driving, having switched
with Campbell on the fly!
</P>
<P>
   As the steamer passes up the slope, I ease the Acura onto the
path, and Davis climbs through the sunroof to capture the ascent on
film. The pavement ends, the road narrows, the view is spectacular,
I see no guardrails _ this is no place for an acrophobe.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is difficult to hold the Acura behind the steamer
as it slows on very steep grades _ here the steamer has the
advantage in full torque at negligible r.p.m. At other times, it is
difficult to keep pace with the Stanley as it gallops without
transmission to hinder it.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, we lose sight of virtually everything as dense
fog shrouds the mountaintop. It is windy, cold; we have passed from
late summer to early winter. The steamer has made the ascent in 28
minutes, 30 seconds, give or take a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   The fog lifts, the sun beams, it is time for the descent. How
does one guide a steamer with rear-only mechanical brakes down the
mountain? ``We lower it with another car and a tow strap,''
Shanklin says. Which car? Shanklin produces a nylon tow strap,
passes it around the rear axle of the Stanley, protecting the paint
with sheepskin guides. ``Nice of you to bring the right car,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura has a tow hook amidships up front underneath _ it's
purpose is to hold the car fast to the deck of a ship en route from
Japan. I hand Shanklin the keys and take to the passenger seat;
Davis climbs into the Stanley. I am sitting a few inches from the
edge of the road, the edge of the world up here. With occasional
stops to cool the brakes, the long, slow descent is another piece
of cake, albeit a boring slice.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura 2.3 CL with its premium package of leather, is $23,360
plus $435 delivery for a jaunty little car with a 2.254-liter,
16-valve, four-cylinder engine and manual gear box. For a bit more
money, it becomes the 3.0 CL with a V-6 engine _ automataic
transmissions are available, at a price. The car is well equipped
with all the niceties, fancy radio, and speed-sensitive steering.
The glove box is small, but that premium package includes pockets
in the seat backs and a covered bin between the seats _ its lid is
an armrest partially obscuring one of two cupholders in front of
it. Adults will fit in the rear. Handling is very good,
acceleration is good off the mark, but the little engine is
somewhat anemic, tops out early _ passing is best done in third
gear, borders on hopeless in fourth. Forget fifth. Fuel mileage is
very good; the CL posted 28.95 miles per gallon for 1,001 miles
traveled _ including the mountaineering. Anyhow, if you're in the
neighborhood of Gorham, N.H., next Aug. 31, the Stanley Steamers
will be back in force, and a '99 Locomobile is being readied for
another run to the clouds 100 years after F.O. and Flora Stanley
made a molehill of a mountain to prove that the automobile was here
to stay _ but, alas, it was not to be as a steamer.

SELL THE RANGE ROVER; IT'S FORD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So, the long slide begins. This time, though, instead
of being boiled in oil, like they were in 1987, investors look as
though they will get a slow poaching. If 1987 was a head-on at 60
miles per hour, 1998 is more like running out of gas on the Garden
State just after you enter the express lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 100 points here, 100 points there _ pretty soon it begins
to add up, and the formerly flush will have to start trading down.
After nearly seven fat years on Wall Street, America may be poised
for a life-style retooling.
</P>
<P>
   It will be subtle. Chastened by the last market crash, the Wall
Street winners spent their cash with a lot less flash this time
around. There are no swaggering figures on the scale of Michael
Milken, Donald Trump or Ivan Boesky. There was less cocaine, more
Deepak Chopra.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogance of the 1980s gave way to humble gratitude in the
'90s. America enjoyed the party for as long as it lasted, but
always there was the nagging sense that midnight would arrive, the
lights would dim and everyone would have to go home. It was fun
while it lasted, but it had to end, and the end, in retrospect,
could have been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Hemlines, historically an accurate leading economic indicator,
plunged right down to the ankles this spring, anticipating the
Dow's dive. And could it have been anything other than an omen when
several Manhattan restaurateurs were rounded up last month for
selling illicit Cuban cigars, the very emblem of the '90s-style
Master of the Universe?
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to be trading in a Cohibo for a Tiparillo, but
adjustments will be made. The signature '90s car, the sport utility
vehicle, will not go away, but the proud owner of a road-ruling
Range Rover 4.0 may sneakily consider downsizing to a Ford
Explorer. And if the market continues to contract, there's always a
Kia Sportage. Have your eye on a Porsche 911? Try thinking
Volkswagen Bug. Same basic shape.
</P>
<P>
   At Manhattan's top steakhouses, the double magnums of Petrus
will go back to the wine cellar. Instead, several sommeliers around
town predict, the bonus babies who pushed the Bordeaux prices
straight through the roof will return to comfort wines. ``They'll
go back to California, to wines like Beringer Private Reserve
Cabernet, or anything by Phelps,'' said Andrea Immer, the wine
director at Windows on the World. ``When you're in a depressed
state of mind, you don't get experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at Montrachet, looks into his
crystal ball and sees strange things. For the cult wines of the
'90s, he said, look to Spain or Chile, where they turn out wines
Wall Street wouldn't gargle with a year ago. ``They might want to
look for the boutique beers out of Belgium,'' he added helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Although their wine sales might sag at the top end, restaurants
could do well out of a market correction. ``Good food is one of the
last things you give up,'' Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant,
said. ``You're more likely to give up your trip to that clever
little island off the coast of whatever, so we may actually see
more restaurant-going.''
</P>
<P>
   But count on the menu to change as foodies come eye-to-eye with
a bear market. New Yorkers have been gobbling foie gras and
truffles fast enough to create shortages. A more chaste cuisine may
lie around the corner, not the comfort food of the early '90s but
less indulgent fare. ``We are going to find new peasant foods,''
Wolf predicted. ``I see herbs. I see turkey burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does nothing else, a punctured Dow could thin out the
surplus population of cell phones, easing the pressure on area
codes and eliminating the widespread pretraumatic stress syndrome
associated with potential loss of one's 212 status. With luck, ugly
additions like 908, 773 and 847 could be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the market should let the air out of grossly
distended Internet stocks. The '80s had junk bonds. The '90s have
Yahoo and Amazon.com. and, if ever a scapegoat figure is going to
emerge from the current mess, Bill Gates, supreme lord of the Net,
could be it. The Justice Department's antitrust case against
Microsoft comes up soon, and a comeuppance for its chief executive,
Gates could ease a lot of social tension.
</P>
<P>
   Gates replaced ``greed is good,'' Gordon Gekko's famous '80s
mantra, with a shambling, Jimmy Stewart style. There's a lot of
free-floating anxiety in the air. Gates could be the man for the
moment, a lightning rod for a lot of bad feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion looks as if it's right on the money, or lack of it.
Although riding a wave of prosperity, designers hedged their bets
for this fall, sneaking in more luxurious fabrics, fondling a
little fur, but keeping the look dressed-down. It's a lot easier to
climb down from cashmere than a Christian Lacroix pouf skirt, the
image of '80s excess. As though anticipating the recessionary mood,
designers from Marc Jacobs to Calvin Klein have invested in a new
color this season: gray. Gray is perfect. It suggests mild
depression rather than black despair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, someone ought to check in on Ira Rennert, the
reclusive industrialist, out there in Bridgehampton. Is that house
he is planning still going to be 72,000 square feet? Or is he maybe
thinking of a nice four-bedroom Cape Cod?

REFINISH WORN COUNTER STRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The strip of oak edging along my kitchen counters are nice,
but the strip in front of the sink is wearing, and the oak is
showing through and is dirty. How can I clean it, stain it the
proper color, and finish it? Can I apply a finish that will last
more than three years?
</P>
<P>
   PEG FORBES, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The wood strips, being varnished, do not stand up to abrasion
and water for long. To refinish, try redoing just the worn area,
although getting it to match the rest of the strip in color and
finish is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, sand the area to the bare wood, apply a light oak
or similar stain to try to match the original, and finish off with
varnish. The only problem is that being three years old, the finish
is probably water-based polyurethane, so you will have to use
water-based polyurethane to finish, because oil-based polyurethane
is incompatible with the water-based. Apply at least three coats,
more if possible. The water-based polyurethane does not stand up to
wear and tear very well.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more durable finish, you have to sand the entire
strip to the bare oak and restain. If you get every bit of finish
off, you can use an oil-based polyurethane; it is much better, in
my opinion, than the water-based; apply two or three coats of high
gloss for a finish that will last more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a rubber roof put on my shed dormer, which has a
shallow pitch, too shallow for shingles. Should I put in a ridge
vent where the shallow dormer roof and the opposite roof meet? The
opposite roof is steeper than the dormer roof, but I am concerned
about the vent leaking on the shallow side.
</P>
<P>
   JOYCE RILEY, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a legitimate concern, because blowing water is more
likely to get into the shallow side, despite the baffles that ridge
vents have. But there is an answer. Put in the ridge vent, but cut
the roof sheathing only on the steep side of the ridge. Keep the
shallow side of the ridge closed, and you'll get no leaks. The vent
will do just half its duty, but half is a sight better than not at
all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh oh, we've been caught using a brand name the wrong way. Last
Sunday we mentioned Ice &AMP; Water Shield on a roof as a protection
against leaking from ice dams. It's a strip of rubberized material
applied along the eave edge of a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Mark DerMugrditchian called to say the information is correct,
but the use of Ice &AMP; Water Shield is not. The correct use is W.R.
Grace's Ice &AMP; Water Shield; it is the copyrighted word for the
rubberized sheet material pioneerd by W.R. Grace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Mark, and thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. During the hurricane scare, somehow or other paraffin oil
spilled in the car, and does it ever smell! It soaked the carpeting
in the back of an old station wagon, and the carpet is not
removable. A week ago, a friend used Joy to break down the oil, but
the smell remains. Can I ever get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   A.P.L., Woods Hole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Paraffin oil certainly does stink, because it is petroleum
based, much like kerosene or paint thinner, or, heaven forbid,
diesel or heating oil, which really does reek.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope. If the oil is fresh, simply pile a whole
bunch of an absorbent such as baking soda on it. Leave it for an
hour (you will probably see it changing color as it absorbs the
oil), sweep it up, and throw it away. Repeat as necessary. The Joy
emulsified the oil to make it easier to be absorbed. If the
absorbent doesn't seem to be doing much good, wet the oil with a
solution of detergent and water, then apply the absorbent. The
absorbent works best if the material being absorbed is liquid. You
can use Speedy Dry or cat box litter (both are absorbent clays)
instead of baking soda.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a wood storm door with an arched top, to match the
front door of my house. Trouble is, it is solid, without a window,
and is not very inviting. I would like to replace it with an
arched-top wood storm with windows. But where can I find one?
</P>
<P>
   A NEW ENGLAND CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We looked and looked and came up with these possible sources:
</P>
<P>
   Elegant Entries, 45 Water St., Worcester, MA 01604,
508-755-5237. While they specialize in regular doors, they might
make a storm to order.
</P>
<P>
   Curved tops and other shapes by Allied Windows, 2724 West
McMicken Ave., Cincinatti, OH 45214. They might also make doors.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's Old House Store, Waukeshaw, Wisc., 414-542-0134.
</P>
<P>
   Half-round-top aluminum storm door to cover round-topped main
door. Made by Walco-Chase, Waltham Aluminum, 250 Calvary St.,
Waltham, MA 02154.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration Resources of Hanover, 781-878-3794.
</P>
<P>
   Could you build a window into the present round-topped door?
It's just a thought.

COMEDIES OF MANNERS, LACED WITH MORALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alison Lurie is a transoceanic novelist, equally at home on both
sides of the Atlantic, but with an even greater following in
England than in the United States. Although she lives most of the
year in Ithaca, N.Y., where she teaches children's literature at
Cornell University, she keeps an apartment in London. She also has
a home in Key West, Fla., the setting of her new novel, ``The Last
Resort,'' and for her a kind of neverland where fantasies are made
real.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that she writes comedies of manners.
That, she admitted in a recent interview, is more accurate than
saying she writes ``tragedies of morals.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that her novels are comedies of manners and morals,
which explore the lives of the literati and the relationships
between the sexes in academia. In that sense, she has more in
common with English authors from Evelyn Waugh to David Lodge than
she does with many of her American contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in ``The Last Resort'' is Jenny Walker,
whose husband, Wilkie, is a famous nature writer suffering a
late-in-life depression. Jenny, Wilkie's dutiful researcher and
all-around literary aide, persuades him to go to Key West in the
hope of returning him to his writing. As often happens in Lurie
novels, it is the female character who makes the discoveries, Jenny
finding a sense of self beyond her role as wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who is 71, indicated that in writing the book she
was fully prepared for feminists who might criticize Jenny for
being so subservient to her spouse. Looking back on her own youth,
she said she grew up during a period ``when a woman who didn't
devote herself to a husband and family was not a real woman.'' Now,
she added, ``a woman who doesn't have a career is not a real
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Lurie, ``the pendulum has swung too far.'' Her aim was
to restore the balance, letting Jenny choose her own path even as
it includes a brief romance with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   The lesbian in her book is a partial answer to complaints she
received about an earlier novel, ``The Truth About Loren Jones'':
``There was a gay woman in it who was not very admirable.'' As is
often the case in her books, she has assembled a colorful cast of
minor characters whose lives intersect on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times Book Review, Francine Prose called ``The
Last Resort'' a ``sparkling, smart new novel,'' in which the author
``has selected a dozen or so exemplary types, added some highly
volatile elements and put them out to sizzle in a paradoxically
balmy and claustrophobic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lurie's other principal reason for writing ``The Last
Resort'' was, she said, to deal with ``a fear of not being in
control of your life, about what it's like to grow old.'' That part
focuses on Wilkie, the aging environmentalist: ``He feels that what
he's done has had no effect, which is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Wilkie's fate brought the author around to the
subject of fame. ``Norman Podhoretz once wrote this book explaining
that the way to become well known was to attack people who are well
known. But if you limit yourself to attacks, after a while you look
around and there's nothing but smashed lumber and broken stones,
and you haven't built anything. There you are standing in the
debris and nobody's interested anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Following her own direction, Ms. Lurie has created a relatively
small but clearly defined, affirmative body of work, 10 books of
fiction along with several works of nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   The novels are a connected series of close looks at Americans in
her time. As with David Lodge and others, Ms. Lurie writes about a
floating cast of characters. Even as the books move to Key West
from Corinth University (a stand-in for Cornell) in ``The War
Between the Tates'' and London for her Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Foreign Affairs,'' people reappear.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of characters' finding lives in different books is, she
said, one point in favor of Balzac over Dickens, whose characters
do not return even when the books take place at the same time in
the same part of London. ``Nobody you know is there,'' she said,
with a tinge of regret.
</P>
<P>
   In the four decades she has been writing novels, Ms. Lurie's
characters have grown up, married, divorced and remarried _ as has
the author. She is married for the second time and has three adult
sons.
</P>
<P>
   To her readers, characters have become old friends. ``It's like
real life,'' she said. ``People you knew in high school will turn
up again.'' To avoid making mistakes of genealogy, the author has
created a chart for use as a family tree.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For example, Barbie Mumpson, who had a small role in ``Foreign
Affairs,'' is one of the characters who finds renewal in Key West
in the new book, and there is every indication that she might be
heard from again in a future Lurie novel.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-running character is probably Leonard Zimmern, L.D.
Zimmern, known as Lennie, a cynical literary critic who seems to
pop up in most of her books and has something snappish to say about
anyone else who happens to be a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Lennie's lineage can be traced from ``Real People'' (a 1969
novel about an artists' colony) through ``The Truth About Lorin
Jones'' (the title character is his half-sister) to ``The Last
Resort,'' in which he makes a cameo appearance. ``As usual,''
writes Ms. Lurie, ``he was wearing an old denim work shirt and a
skeptical, penetrating expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the origin of Lennie, she said, ``He's the dark side
of my character.'' Then she admitted that as an intellectual he was
a bit like Alfred Kazin or Irving Howe: ``I think that, like Kazin,
Lennie is getting a little nicer in his old age.''
</P>
<P>
   The impulse to inject Lennie Zimmern into her books is
irresistible, she said. With his stern, high literary demands, he
plays the role of devil's advocate who ``stirs up trouble wherever
he goes.'' Ms. Lurie said her instinct as a writer was ``to make
things turn out right for people I know and care about.'' Lennie's
presence assures that the books will have a certain edge of irony.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether she would ever write a book with Lennie as
the central character, she explained that she already had _ her
first novel, unpublished and jettisoned. Lennie has gone on to have
a long history in other people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   What would Lennie say if, as a critic, he were called upon to
review ``The Last Resort''? He might read it, Ms. Lurie said, but,
as with his role models, he would not deign to review it. If he
were asked to comment, she said, ``I expect he would say that it's
a really good book to take to the beach.'' She added, ``That's
assuming he didn't know he was in it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mini-sport utilities are for poseurs who covet the look, not the
function. Face it: the real appeal of the wildly popular Subaru
Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV is comfort, splendid road
manners and a great view of traffic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One significant exception has been the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
closest in spirit to the tough, simple general-purpose vehicles
that landed with the Allies at Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Wrangler has to make room for some newcomers, including
the Isuzu Amigo, a brawny little two-door beast with serious
off-road capability and impressive V6 power to match. The downside
is a harsh ride, wretched side vision and sticker shock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Isuzu Amigo made its debut in 1989 as a stripped-down
utility for the young at heart. It was noisy and underpowered, and
the canvas roof over what would otherwise have been the rear of a
very small pick-up truck offered minimal protection against the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   But it was cheap as four-wheel-drive vehicles go, cute and a
great hit with people in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The new 1998 Amigo (the old model rode into the sunset in 1994)
still comes with a canvas top and soft plastic windows in the back.
But a hard-roof option is planned as a 1999 model. Both versions
offer more of what appealed to buyers of the old Amigo, plus an
optional dose of muscle and luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The base model has a 2.2 liter, 130 horsepower, four-cylinder
engine, lean for a 3,335-pound truck. But the optional 3.2-liter,
205-horsepower aluminum V6, producing 214 pounds of torque at a
modest 3,000 rpm, provides oomph.
</P>
<P>
   All that power could be downright dangerous hitched to the
primitive suspension of the earlier-generation Amigo. But the Isuzu
engineers did their homework: while the vehicle feels heavy, it
accelerates out of corners with impressive stability and only
modest body roll. Anti-lock brakes and a somewhat mushy five-speed
manual gearbox are standard.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't try to navigate the Great Dismal Swamp in my test
vehicle. It was fine, though, on poorly maintained dirt roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Amigo is noisy at highway speeds, with the canvas top
chattering in the wind. The stiff shocks guarantee that you feel
every bump. And the backseat resembles a church pew, with the
saving grace that it folds down easily to add cargo capacity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the front seats are comfy and supportive. The fit and finish
are up to Japanese standards _ though the truck is manufactured in
Indiana. And the stereo speakers are a cut above economy grade.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the busy, bumpy highway ride, the Amigo's only big
fault is the big rear ``C'' pillars that stiffen the frame but
create huge blind spots on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Check that: there's also the price. While a two-wheel-drive
version can be had for a shade more than $15,000, four-wheel drive
and the V6 engine push it close to $20,000. A lot of money for your
average surfer dude.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a tabloid television talk show decided to visit
downtown Manhattan, Kelly Galligan and Ed Briggs _ proudly seated
on a recently bought 1950s square-cornered sofa in their apartment
_ would make ideal guests for an episode called ``We Traded the
Grunge Life for an Eames Chair.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple admit, sheepishly, that they were once slackers who
blasted Nirvana and made a pact to stay unemployed during the Gulf
War so they could watch CNN. Today, Ms. Galligan is gainfully
working at a new-media production company in Silicon Alley and
Briggs works in the art department of the television show ``Law and
Order.''
</P>
<P>
   And like a large number of their fellow downtowners, they've
chosen mid-century modernism _ the industrial, futuristic design
style of the 1950s and '60s _ to mark their transition to
affluence.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a Calvin Klein tank top, slim jeans and black rubber
Adidas sandals, Ms. Galligan, 31, described how one day they put
their funky votive candles and wrought-iron bed into storage and
painted their natural-wood floors a lacquered black. They filled
their Chelsea apartment with such modernica as a fiberglass '50s
Tulip chair by Eero Saarinen, a shag rug, an amoeba-shaped coffee
table and two space-age chrome lamps they found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Change,'' Briggs, 46, said. ``A lot of our
friends have gone through it, too. They show up for work one day
wearing yellow-tinted prescription glasses, the next day it's Gucci
loafers and finally the long hair gets chopped off.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of downtowners who once embodied the ``Rent'' life style,
partial to thrift-store fashions and long hours at coffee houses,
has been transformed into an upwardly mobile, entrepreneurial
crowd. They can be described as the Wallpaper Generation, after the
two-year-old design and life-style magazine that has given an
ultra-hip spin to the retro-future look of the postwar decades. It
is a generation that breathes technology, fast travel and designer
labels.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it wants to be stylishly poised for the millennium _
in '70s-inspired Gucci clothes, conducting international business
on a tiny Motorola cell phone, while lounging on a Florence Knoll
sofa, circa 1954, like the one in Tom Ford's Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them global nomads,'' said Tyler Brule, 29, the editor
in chief of Wallpaper. ``Whether they're a West Coast snowboarder,
a copy writer for a hot advertising firm in Stockholm or a grunge
kid working in an indie record shop that suddenly got a film deal,
there's a degree of affluence all of a sudden. They're a young
international group that grew up moving around without any
possessions, and now they need advice on how to live a
sophisticated life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Details magazine in the late '80s and Wired in the early
'90s, Wallpaper, which is based in London, has momentarily captured
the mind-set of Generation X. It has a small circulation _ 85,000,
including 30,000 in the United States _ but its influence far
outweighs the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In many a downtown apartment, it is the only magazine on the
(boomerang shaped) coffee table. It's a name to drop at rooftop
parties and in other magazines' editorial meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from its first issue in September 1996, it attracted the
covetous attentions of publishing giants like Conde Nast and Time
Warner, and Time ultimately bought it, increasing its sporadic
publication to eight times a year. The latest issue, at 334 pages
the fattest ever, drips with ads for Prada clothes, Bulgari watches
and Smirnoff Black vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wallpaper first came out, it was like, `Why didn't I
think of that before?''' said Sean MacPherson, who owns stylish Los
Angeles night spots like Bar Marmont and El Carmen's and is also an
avid collector of modernist furniture. ``It's such an obvious idea.
If you take the idea of a tribe, where I can fly to New York City
and have more in common with someone I meet at a restaurant than my
next door neighbor, there's definitely a Wallpaper tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine goes beyond traditional shelter publications by
photographing fictitious living rooms inhabited by terminally hip
models, wearing the latest fashions and dining on stylish but
birdlike meals. For the magazine's newly arrived readers, every
item, down to the wine in the glasses and the ambient-style music
on the DVD player, is listed, with prices and store information.
</P>
<P>
   But Brule maintains that the Wallpaper Generation is not just
the latest wave of yuppies. ``Our readers are not corporate _
they're entrepreneurs,'' he said. ``They would never spend all day
hung over behind a computer like in `Bright Lights, Big City,'
because most of them are self-employed or working at small
companies.'' The prototypical Wallpaper interior seems to be the
first-class lounge of an international airport.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine did not create the revival of mid-century modernist
design, which includes Scandinavian modern masters like Arne
Jacobsen and Alvar Aalto and Americans like Eero Saarinen, Florence
Knoll and Charles and Ray Eames. These visionaries used wartime
technology _ materials like fiberglass and foam rubber, and
techniques for bending plywood and molding plastics _ to make
furniture that was streamlined and easy to mass produce.
</P>
<P>
   There was a naive optimism about the future in the aluminum
lamps and stacking plastic chairs, and the look was echoed in the
Jetsonesque imagery of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Its rediscovery by furniture dealers and collectors _ embraced
with a hipster's wink _ has been gaining momentum for several
years, and lately it has shown up everywhere from music videos to
downtown clubs. Seeking evidence? In Hollywood, Tom Ford of Gucci,
the actor Vincent Gallo, the actress Kelly Lynch and Eli Bonerz,
who owns X-Large Clothing with Mike D of the Beastie Boys, have all
bought glass-walled houses by mid-century modern architects like
John Lautner and Richard Neutra.
</P>
<P>
   In the film ``Men in Black,'' the headquarters building was
based in part on Saarinen's gull-winged TWA jetport at Kennedy
airport, and the set was decorated with Jacobsen's sensuously
futuristic Egg chairs from 1957.
</P>
<P>
   In the Queen Latifah current video, ``Bananas,'' there is a
Peter Ghyczy '60s Egg Garden chair, and in Missy Elliot's video for
``Beat Me 911,'' there is a fiberglass Gyro chair by Eero Aarnio.
The pieces are an ``easy read for a futuristic moment,'' said Paul
Hunter, the director of Queen Latifah's video.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper, if it didn't create the trend, had peerless timing.
``It's sort of a chicken-before-the-egg question,'' said Matt
Hanna, 31, an editor at VH1, sitting on an egg-shaped cushion at
Cafeteria, a modernist-inspired restaurant in Chelsea. ``I've
always been a Wallpaper kind of guy. I just didn't know it till the
magazine came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a year ago, cool Soho lounges like Spy and Wax were
furnished with Victorian velvet couches and dripping candles.
Today, clubs of the moment, including Veruka, Lot 61, Bond Street
and Moomba, have all embraced mid-century modernism. Lot 61's
blocklike rubber seating was made in the '50s for a mental
hospital. The new restaurant Bottino in the West Chelsea art
district has 100 vintage Eames chairs. And Cafeteria, co-owned by
the clothing designer Victor Alfaro, has '50s-inspired patio
chairs.

HERE'S THE STOCK MARKET ADVICE YOU'VE BEEN SEEKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of you, I know, have been shocked (and possibly appalled)
in recent weeks by the exuberant wildness of the stock market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point, for instance, you saw the Dow Jones Industrial
Average lop most of 2,000 points off the record high it reached in
mid-July, and now you are asking hard questions. For instance: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ What exactly is the stock market? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Where is Wall Street? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Say, this subject doesn't have something to do with money,
does it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the most frequent question of all: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Is now the time for me, in the context of my 401(k), to
syndicate my equity, which is mostly in leveraged junk bonds, into
securities-backed, factory-authorized sinking debentures of fully
invested small-cap futures contracts? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least that one's easy. You should definitely do that _
unless, of course, your tax bracket is between 1 and 100. In that
case, consider buying puts and calls in the global-exposure options
pit. Duh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for your other questions, well, the space I have here doesn't
come close to what would be required for full (and maybe even
helpful) answers. So instead, as usual, you will get incomplete,
misleading and ridiculous ideas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, however, will make my answers seem quite familiar to you
because they will resemble those you've been getting from your
brokers, bankers and financial advisers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, if you are going to be an investor in this kind of
ticklish market, you need to determine your risk tolerance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, you are tempted to yell at your canary and
slit your cat's wrists (if any) when the S&AMP;P 500 average (S&AMP;P
stands for Stocks &AMP; Provisions) drops 10 points, you may be better
off putting your money into nincompoop long-term investments like
non-interest-bearing checking accounts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' you ask, ``how will that make me any money?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, you may not exactly make any money, in the commonly
thought of meaning of those words, but you won't have to buy a
calculator to keep track of your earnings. And you won't have to
pay fees to stock brokers. Besides all that, Uncle Sam will get no
part of your earnings, there being none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, in mid-July, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in
the 9,300 range, you had inherited, say, $10,000 and put all of it
into a stupid interest-free checking account and spent none of it,
you'd still have $10,000 today. Which, given minimal inflation,
would be worth about $9,994.78. Give or take a five spot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you'd put your $10,000 into an S&AMP;P index
fund, you would have felt as if you'd lost your shirt the day the
market dropped 512 points, and you'd be crying about it and
generally making a pest of yourself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a year from now when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
is above 10,000 (oh, it will too be), your $10,000 will be worth a
lot more, whereas your numskull checking account, if you haven't
spent any of it, will be worth maybe $9,988 or something and you'd
be crying and generally making a pest of yourself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You know, as I think about your reaction to this whole thing,
you aren't looking very good. In fact, you're turning into someone
I'd frankly rather not know. And if you don't shape up soon I'm
going to quit giving you this quality financial advice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I'm glad I'm not in the investment advice business. I'd
have to put up whiny, unsatisfied clients. As a columnist I simply
have to put up with whiny, unsatisfied readers. But the most I'm
costing them is 50 cents a day. &QL;

 NEW YORK: patio chairs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Stone Gossard, a guitarist for Pearl Jam, one of the last
surviving grunge acts, is a co-owner of a new modernist-inspired
club, ARO.space, in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely wanted to move away from that
found-in-a-thrift-shop look,'' said David Schefer, who designed
Moomba and Veruka.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Look, 32, an architect who was sipping an oversize
cosmopolitan at Standard in the East Village, another hot spot that
has adopted the style, explained it this way: ``Try to imagine that
downtown was a big college town. Now, it's grown up and wants to be
more responsible and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bond Street, which looks like a Zen version of a Gucci ad,
with spare dark tables and muted olive banquettes, a stylist in a
black Daryl K T-shirt who goes by the single name Sabrina rested
her chopsticks next to the tiny sushi roll she was sharing with a
friend. ``It's very Wallpaper, isn't it?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, furniture and interior design have acquired a hipness
once reserved for fashion designers and alternative music. At Form
and Function, a new store at 95 Vandam St. that sells rare Eames
pieces and vintage electronics like the first-ever Walkman-style
headset from 1970, Fred Schneider of the B-52s rock band is an
owner; shoppers include musicians like Moby and Mike D.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Mike D said Wallpaper is
one of the only magazines he subscribes to, and he mused about
starting a line of home accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The most unlikely crowd is gravitating to the Wallpaper look. On
television monitors facing Lafayette Street from Supreme, a
skateboard shop, educational films by the Eameses are shown. ``The
cool furniture just sticks out,'' said James Jebbia, the owner of
Supreme, as well as of Stussy, a major skateboard and hip-hop
clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many skate graphics and logos are influenced by the simplicity
and humor of Eames or Nelson,'' Jebbia, a collector of modernist
furniture, maintained. ``When my friends come in from Japan or
London, the first thing they want to do is check out the fresh
modern furniture stores downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many admiring the Eameses through the window of
Supreme have no clue to the historical place of their work. And
that seems true of many members of the Wallpaper Generation. Jim
Walrod, 33, a co-owner of Form and Function, said the appeal of
mid-century modernism to Generation X, even those without knowledge
of its origins, is natural because of ``an invisible reference
point'' young people acquired after years of exposure to the art
direction of old movies and television shows, not to mention the
teak and stainless-steel contents of their parents' living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids with no design training will walk over to a Swan chair or
an old radio and just start smiling,'' Walrod said. ``They don't
know why they're interested, but it's probably because they saw it
on `Logan's Run' or at their aunt's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Morales, 28, who recently quit his job at Stussy to
become a full-time modernist furniture dealer, echoed the point.
``It's like the furniture belongs to our generation even though it
was made 40 or 50 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Frankie Inglese, a downtown deejay who has stocked his space
age bachelor pad with vintage electronics, traces his love of space
age design to mid-60's album covers. ``It's nearly the year 2000,''
he said. ``We have great technology, like cell phones, the Internet
and digital cameras. But we're still sitting on eyesores by Ikea.
This is not what the future was supposed to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, older downtown stores specializing
in industrial modernist design like Moss and Troy have been joined
by a slew of newcomers, including Ace (295 Elizabeth St.),
Re-Generation (38 Renwick St.), Antik (104 Franklin St.), Twenty
(20 Prince St.), and R 20th Century Design, which is at 326 Wythe
Ave. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Snyderman, 28, and Zesty Meyers, 29, opened R 20th Century
Design in a lonely industrial neighborhood eight months ago and
were featured in Wallpaper almost immediately. On a recent Saturday
afternoon, the store was packed with tattooed artists and other
young people marveling at an aqua George Nelson daybed priced at
$3,750. Snyderman said he couldn't get over how well the store is
doing, considering the typical resident of the area is supposed to
be a starving artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first there was some neighborhood resentment because our
store was sort of slick looking and expensive,'' Snyderman, who set
up a layaway plan, said. ``But now people just want to know what
the stuff is.''
</P>
<P>
   As modernist design becomes trendier, some of its longtime
champions are skeptical of the newly converted. ``It's like New
Balance sneakers,'' said Serge Becker, a co-owner of Bowery Bar,
who plans to open a new nightclub at the Joseph Papp Public Theater
this fall, which he has designed in 1930s Italian-modern style.
(Think cork walls and Perelli rubber floors.) ``Soon, people will
get sick of it and the people that liked it all along will be
left,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The London press has recently proclaimed the end of the buzz
about Wallpaper. The magazine is an easy target for critics of its
achingly hip fashion models either posing amid lavishly priced
interiors or racing to catch the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you can't be cool unless you can afford to fly
first class on your own private jet with the perfect modernist
interior,'' said Mike Mills, a graphic designer for hipster bands
like the Beastie Boys, Cibo Mato and Air, who has lectured on the
Eameses to college students. ``A better magazine would have
furniture that cost under $20 and where jet-set meant Tower Air.
It's very un-Eames-like.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Doige, a set designer who works for Calvin Klein, said he
wouldn't dream of using modernist furniture again because
``everyone and their grandmother is using it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a Citibank commercial that has all modernist
furniture, then you know it's time to try something else,'' he
said. ``Next season, I'm going to try the Dada look: lots of shapes
but no recognizable props.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at Form and Function, Walrod predicted that the look and
the life style have plenty of mileage left in them.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a television commercial for L'Oreal Preference with
Heather Locklear tossing her blond mane while seated in a luscious
purple 50's Egg chair, he said, ``If I was a kid and saw that, I'd
be so happy I'd start investigating modernism immediately.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In Frankenstein fashion, the politically powerful
business barons of Russia have created a monster that threatens
their stature and clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the tangled world of Russian politics, their scheme last
month appeared to be fairly straightforward: push the ailing
President Boris Yeltsin to return their friend Viktor Chernomyrdin
to power and thus make it easier for Russia's big businessmen to
weather the economic tempest swamping the country.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of financiers and industrialists, collectively
known as the ``oligarchs,'' have over the years helped keep Yeltsin
in power, and in turn profited wildly on the economic policies --
and the lack of rules -- since the Soviet Union disintegrated in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and media billionaire Boris Berezovsky, 52, was widely
credited as the chief mastermind of Yeltsin's Aug. 23 decision to
fire the previous government and promote Chernomyrdin as the new
prime minister. Chernomyrdin had been prime minister from December
1992 until May of this year, when most of the oligarchy accumulated
their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berezovsky and others find themselves threatened with the
double whammy of economic turmoil and a political impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In the current crisis, the oligarchs are having to compete with
another faction -- the Communist-led parliament, flexing its muscle
as never before to seek a power-sharing deal with Yeltsin as a
result of the president's weakening stature.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reports this week also said some prominent
businessmen were hedging their bets, holding talks with Yeltsin's
opposition on alternatives to Chernomyrdin should he not receive
confirmation from the Duma, the lower house of parliament. A second
confirmation vote is scheduled for Monday after the Communist-led
Duma overwhelming rejected a first attempt on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing anything and everything they can to push
Chernomyrdin and avoid another candidate for prime minister. Their
power and in some cases their empires are at risk. Everything was
at stake with Yeltsin, and when Yeltsin faltered, they pushed
Chernomyrdin. Now he is in trouble and they are worried,'' said
political analyst Sergei Kolmakov.
</P>
<P>
   They are troubled primarily, according to analysts, over the
potential that Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow and himself a
rival oligarch, could ascend in the current political vacuum to
replace either Chernomyrdin or Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that distress was an interview Berezovsky gave Sept.
2 to a Moscow radio station in which he said that Yeltsin should
resign if the current political impasse continues and a ``strong
authority'' is not created. The implication being that if this deal
for Chernomyrdin falls through, the tycoons will abandon Yeltsin
and look for a better one, Kolmakov said.
</P>
<P>
   How far and wide this loose association of businessmen cooperate
on political affairs is a matter of much speculation in Moscow.
Their financial interests bind them, but they are not a monolith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berezovsky is not participating in this like the general
secretary of a party of oligarchs, but as a political adviser to,
first of all, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin,'' said Sergei Markov,
director of the Institute of Political Studies in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   If any confirmation were needed of Berezovsky's prominence in
the current political and economic crisis, consider this: When
President Clinton and his team came to Moscow for the summit with
Yeltsin, a key presidential adviser, deputy treasury secretary
Larry Summers, peeled off for private talks with Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's wealthiest men, the oligarchs include figures like
Vladimir Potanin, the 37-year-old chairman of Uneximbank; Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, 35, of Bank Menatep and on the board of ORT, a
television station owned in part by Berezovsky; and Vladimir
Gusinsky, 45, of Most-Bank and a magazine publisher.
</P>
<P>
   They and others, numbering fewer than a dozen in all, are a
group of sharp-witted risk-takers. The oligarchs made their wealth
carving up the assets of the Soviet Union with the help of the
cronyism and unregulated finance of new Russia, a moneymaking
manner often compared to America's 19th-century robber barons.
</P>
<P>
   But the current economic chaos has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gusinsky, Potanin and Khodorkovsky merged their
banks in order to reduce their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Smolensky, chairman of SBS-Agro Bank, and Vladimir
Vinogradov, president of Inkombank, have seen government
intervention in their banks' management in the past two weeks after
huge losses resulting from their rambunctious trading in Russian
treasury bills and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Berezovsky who gets -- and often himself demands --
the greatest share of media attention, sometimes publicly bragging
about his ability to manipulate Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated worth of $3 billion, Berezovsky and a handful
of other oligarchs banded together in 1996 to support Yeltsin, who
was trailing badly in his reelection campaign against Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov. They poured millions of dollars into his
campaign and assured favorable coverage in their newspapers and on
their TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a former mathematician who began building his empire
with car dealerships, also reportedly financed a 1994 publication
of Yeltsin's memoirs and guaranteed the president monthly royalties
of $16,000. The He is also said to give lavish gifts of jewelry to
the women in Yeltsin's family.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Berezovsky became particularly close to
Yeltsin's daughter and chief image-maker, Tatyana Dyachenko; the
presidential chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev; and deputy chief of
staff, Igor Shabdurasalov.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no government. The president is a non-factor. At the
moment the country is being run by them,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov,
director of the Politica Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the Russian media said the billionaire businessman
secretly met with Chernomyrdin and Shabdurasalov in the French
resort of Cannes to hatch the scheme to oust previous prime
minister Sergei Kiriyenko after only five months in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Berezovsky was credited with orchestrating
Chernomyrdin's ouster in March and bringing in the little-known
reformer Kiriyenko. (A depiction that Berezovsky encouraged at the
time, but which he now denies). But as the financial crisis
worsened, and Kiriyenko proposed serious measures to deal with it
-- steps that would have threatened the assets of the oligarchy --
reportedly Yeltsin was urged to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Berezovsky also had run-ins with two of
Yeltsin's chief advisers and young economic reformers, Anatoly
Chubais and Boris Nemtsov. Both are now gone from government.
</P>
<P>
   After the government sacking two weeks ago, the newspaper Russky
Telegraf, which competes with Berezovsky's Nezavisimaya Gazeta,
headlined a front-page editorial: ``Berezovsky Is Now Our
President.''

DEMOCRATS FEAR DESERTION OF WOMEN THIS NOVEMBER

 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid a rising chorus of Democrats chastising
President Clinton, party loyalists fear that women voters _ a key
component of the Democratic base _ will stay home this November out
of disgust over the Bill-and-Monica debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that President Clinton's lying about his
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
could jeopardize the party's hope of a net gain of 11 seats needed
to take the House of Representatives away from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many Republicans are predicting a GOP gain of a dozen
or so House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nightmare,'' said former Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., last Friday, a day after Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
an influential Clinton ally, called the president's conduct
``immoral'' and ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the latest among prominent Democrats to publicly
castigate Clinton. Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York and Dianne Feinstein of California spoke out
last month, with Feinstein saying her faith in the president had
been ``badly shattered.'' A week before Leiberman's stunning
comments on the Senate floor, House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt called Clinton's behavior ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In their gut, elected Democrats are just dying over this
because they are aware of harmful it could be,'' Schroeder said.
``And an awful lot of women are going to start saying, `Wait a
minute. Have we totally lost our moral compass?' This is very
harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the Democrats' nightmare scenario: If
Democratic women avoid the polls and Republican voters are
energized, the GOP could rack up a 60-vote filibuster-proof
majority in the Senate. Now its lead is 55 to 45. Such a victory
would solidify Republican control on many crucial legislative
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that women within the party want to get past this
and go on,'' said Linda Cacchione, Colorado Democratic Party vice
chairwoman. ``But I think there is a real dismay among women that
this (the Clinton scandal) has gone on so long and they find
themselves having to explain things to young children that they'd
rather not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cacchione expressed optimism that in Colorado at least, women
will turn out to vote for two female Democrats running for major
offices, U.S. Senate candidate Dottie Lamm and gubernatorial
candidate Gail Schoettler.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, which raised $6.5
million in the 1996 election cycle for Democratic women candidates
who favor abortion rights, said, ``I don't think anyone believes
voters will go into the polls and vote on the basis of Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she added, the brouhaha over Clinton's seven-month
denial of the Lewinsky affair followed by his admission that he had
lied may drown out discussion of other issues. ``If voters are not
aware of what the debate (on these issues) is about, there's not a
lot of incentive to go to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Low turnout by women could spell trouble for the re-election
bids of three Democratic female senators _ Patty Murray of
Washington, Barbara Boxer of California, and Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois. All three were elected with Clinton in 1992, in what
became known as ``the year of the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Metcalf, vice chairwoman of the Democratic Party in
Vermont, sees a female division on Clinton that she describes as
``a generational thing.'' Older women are more astonished and
disheartened by Clinton's behavior, she said. But middle-aged and
younger women, ``who grew up when things were much looser, are more
`been there, done that,''' she said. ``So they're quicker to say,
`Let's put this behind us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are looking at how Clinton's troubles might help
them. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said a survey he took
since Clinton's Aug. 17 admission showed a 4-percentage-point drop
among women, Republicans and Democrats, who said they are likely to
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 53 percent of women said they expected to vote,
compared with 57 percent in a poll taken before Clinton's
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see women voting Republican who otherwise would have
voted Democrat,'' Luntz said. ``But I do see women staying home
rather than voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice, which during the 1996
election cycle raised $1 million for moderate Republicans who
support abortion rights, sees a possible benefit for centrist GOP
candidates. ``If Clinton-type voters are going to get discouraged,
the only Republican they'd vote for is our kind,'' she said. ``So
if they turn out at all, it's to our benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in off-year national elections has for the most part
dropped steadily since 1966, when it reached its high mark of 48.8
percent of the voting-age population, according to Curtis Gans,
director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
Gans said he expects turnout this November to be no higher than 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In small-turnout elections, a party that energizes its base of
support can expect to do well, but its chances can be doomed if a
key part of its base stays home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a presidential year, women's votes gave Clinton a
second term, even though Democrats failed to retake the House and
Senate, which the Republicans had captured in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate Bob Dole won 44 percent of the male vote, and
Clinton took 43 percent, a gap of only 1 point. But Clinton rolled
up the female vote by a whopping 54 percent compared with Dole's
meager 38 percent, a 16-point gap.
</P>
<P>
   Women voted for Clinton because of his support for abortion
rights, his appointment of women to high government posts and his
leadership in passing the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, which
gives employees up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for medical emergencies
and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between women and Democrats have not always been
solid. Some analysts attribute the GOP's 1994 congressional victory
to women staying home out of disappointment over Clinton's botched
health care plan and charges by Paula Corbin Jones that he had
sexually harassed her when he was Arkansas governor and she was a
low-ranking state employee.
</P>
<P>
   That year 38.8 percent of the voting-age population went to the
polls, with 54 percent of women supporting Democratic candidates
and 46 percent voting for Republicans, according to exit polls
cited by Carll Everett Ladd of the Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research.
</P>
<P>
   That was an 8-point gap. Meanwhile, 57 percent of men voted for
Republicans and 43 percent voted for Democrats _ a 14-point gap.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson appears to be that whichever side gets a lion's share
of either gender's vote is the winner. For Democrats, there is no
chance for victory without big support from women.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, other national and international issues _ terrorism,
gyrations on Wall Street and the impact of Russian and Asian
financial turmoil on the U.S. economy _ could cloud the electoral
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton-Lewinsky matter remains the Democrats' biggest
headache. ``My first gut reaction is that none of this should fall
out on members of Congress,'' Schroeder said. ``What were any of
them going to do about it? They aren't hall monitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she added, ``If congressional Democrats paid the
price in '94, who's to say you don't have a rerun in '98?''

CATS, FOXES TARGETED TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EVE MITCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ Life on the levee could soon turn deadly
for stray cats, raccoons, red foxes and skunks when a trap-and-kill
plan to protect two federally endangered species starts next month.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they had no choice but to sign the five-year
agreement to allow the federal predator-management program in the
Redwood Shores neighborhood. The program is required by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bay
Conservation and Development Commission as a condition of a permit
to raise the local levees to federal flood-control standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally opposed to doing it,'' said City Manager Ed
Everett. ``The trapping and killing of foxes or raccoons or any
animal to save another animal is to mess with the natural process.
There is a food chain. I think this is a misguided approach. There
is probably a better solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Endangered Species Act, nonnative predator species can
be killed if they pose a threat to endangered animals. In this
case, the program is intended to increase the survival rate of the
California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse, both
endangered species found in the Redwood Shores area.
</P>
<P>
   The program will target red foxes, raccoons, skunks, and feral
cats and be focused on the levee along San Francisco Bay, an area
that is home to both the protected and targeted animals. Public
access to the area will be restricted, according to a city report.
</P>
<P>
   The predator-management program will be carried out by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which embarked on a similar effort to
rid the former Alameda Naval Air Station of feral cats and other
nonnative predators viewed as a threat to the least tern, an
endangered seabird.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Thabault, a deputy assistant field supervisor with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife office in Sacramento, said the plan is necessary
because the improved levee system will lead to increased
development and, in turn, attract more predator species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Redwood Shores area is a really important area for the
clapper rail,'' he said, adding that with development comes
increased human habitation and garbage, which draws predators such
as red foxes and raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Development) has a devastating impact on the clapper rail
population. Mostly, we're worried about the red fox. Skunks,
raccoons and foxes all prey on eggs and the foxes also prey on the
birds,'' Thabault said. ``Cats will prey on both the birds and the
eggs. We don't mandate euthanasia. We just mandate removal.''
</P>
<P>
   After the animals are lured into baited traps, they will be
euthanized by lethal injection, said Peter Vorametsanti, the city's
senior civil engineer. If a cat or other domestic animal is
trapped, workers will look for a collar or micro-chip
identification to make sure the animal is not someone's pet.
Vorametsanti said he has not seen feral cat colonies in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Coette Schmidt, a founder of the Peninsula-based Homeless Cat
Network, said she does plan to survey the area for feral cats in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not thrilled with it,'' said Schmidt, whose
organization works with the Peninsula Humane Society to humanely
manage feral cats through trapping, testing, vaccination, spaying
and neutering and releasing felines back to colonies tended by
volunteers. In some cases, cats that can be socialized are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members voted 4-1 Monday to approve the agreement
for the predator-management program.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials will evaluate the program annually to
determine whether it should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the levee upgrade began about three months ago and is
expected to be completed by the end of next year.

CBS' 49ERS ALUMNI WON'T GET TO CUT THEIR TEETH ON COWBOYS 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS makes its return to professional football official Sunday
and, at least as far as Cowboys' fans are concerned, it's a good
thing the Eye's going to be trained on the American Football
Conference and not the National.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a pregame show whose hosts are, among others, George
Seifert and Brent Jones, two notable Cowboys tormentors of recent
vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the No. 2 play-by-play team that features as its
color man Randy Cross. You'll vaguely recall him blowing holes in
the Dallas defensive line a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   Objective though these new-sprung journalists might try to be,
it's hard to believe they'd give Chan and company an even break,
especially if they happened to be pitted against those 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   At least Cross is balanced in the booth by old buddy Verne
Lundquist, who must have a blue star somewhere in his closet, even
years after departing Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Seifert and Jones, who will appear on the ``NFL
Today'' pregame show, and Cross, who will be calling games, will
mostly be making their points about the Patriots and the Jets, the
Steelers and the Raiders. Judging from ``The NFL Today'''s
preseason tune-up on Aug. 27 (the Thursday night exhibition between
the Cowboys and Jaguars) they ought to do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The old coach gave signs that the wit he flashed in those
singing TV commercials a couple years ago was the real George _ not
the drab guy behind the dark glasses who has stalked NFL sidelines
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen, basically another West Coaster, also looked at
ease. His intelligence should shine through on the hourlong pregame
and during the rapid-fire halftime highlights segments.
</P>
<P>
   Jones seemed a bit overactive in his debut, but that could
easily morph into mere enthusiasm once he has had a few Sundays in
front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   All will benefit greatly from the pass-the-rock skills of
pre-eminent studio host Jim Nantz.
</P>
<P>
   They'll depend a lot on this wily veteran, too, since, with his
lonely exception, they're all TV novices. That has everybody a bit
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little jittery going into this thing,'' Nance
admitted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of those jitters come from excitement. CBS is thrilled to
have the NFL back after punting its NFC rights to Fox in the
previous network negotiations. The return came at a monumental
price _ some would say too high a price _ but at least CBS Sports
can again hold its head high as a major player in the world of
sports broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives, including sports division president Sean
McManus, are cautioning viewers not to expect too much out of the
box, especially from ``The NFL Today'', which is the
highest-profile element of the network's football Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going against two very well-produced pregame shows \Rat
Fox and ESPN\S,'' McManus said. ``It takes a while for these shows
to evolve. I would hope everyone would watch us with an open
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to hitting our stride at some point in the
season,'' he said. ``It's going to be a slow process. It's not just
going to happen right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz said viewers will need time to adjust to CBS' new pregame
show, like the way they needed time to catch on to the ways of
another famous TV ensemble: the characters of ``Seinfeld''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the first time you saw it,'' Nantz said, ``you
wondered, `Who's that guy Kramer? Why does he come running through
the door? Who's that neurotic guy George?'''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Nantz added that rehearsals ``so far have gone
extremely well. It's a jittery feeling,'' he said, ``but a good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus said one of his network's strengths will be its ``very
fresh and contemporary outlook on the NFL.'' That freshness will
come mainly from Allen, Jones and Seifert, he said, all being
recently of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a nifty studio set for ``The NFL Today'', CBS
folks say, as well as ``cutting edge'' in-game graphics and
technology, plus a premier No. 1 play-by-play team in Greg Gumbel
and Phil Simms, who will battle Fox's Pat Summerall and John Madden
for Sunday Supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   But back to ``The NFL Today''. For purposes of fairness, it
should be noted that the old 49ers did right by the Cowboys in that
preseason broadcast. Seifert downplayed the winless exhibition
campaign while reporter Bonnie Bernstein (who played for ESPN, not
San Francisco) went toe-to-toe with Jerry Jones in a halftime
interview, though with little success.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, considering Dallas' prospects, those might be the
nicest words anybody at Fox utters this year about the Cowboys.

GALLO'S HUMOR: OUTSPOKEN INDIE FILMMAKER SPEWS VENOM, WIT,
SUBVERSIVE ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vincent Gallo can't seem to help himself. He has led an
incredible life: Among his accomplishments, he played in a downtown
New York band with Jean Michel Basquiat. But the achievement _
probably not exactly the word he'd like to hear used in this case _
that most people mention is his brief period as a Calvin Klein
model. In the recent past _ like yesterday, maybe _ he'd probably
have gone a little ballistic about this being brought up, but he's
a little sanguine now. His film ``Buffalo 66,'' which he wrote,
directed, starred in and composed the music for, was recently the
No. 1 independent film in Los Angeles. But clearly, that's not
enough for this wiry, voluble talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm broke, and I have no future,'' he says in a matter-of-fact
manner. ``Why? Because I've said shocking things in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   This sounds overstated, but with Gallo, it is true. A
conversation with him is wide-ranging and passionate. He has a
sense of humor about himself; a good chunk of his comments are
self-deprecating. But the words often sound as if they were fired
from a nail gun; it's as if some accident damaged his superego, so
that the first thing he thinks comes right out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of the Village Voice, for example, he browbeat
Christina Ricci for mentioning ``The Opposite of Sex'' instead of
``Buffalo 66'' in her interviews. (After meeting him, though, you
can see how there might be something slightly ingratiating about
his abuse.) And there's the crack he made about Skeet Ulrich, which
was that if life were really like a party, Ulrich wouldn't get past
the doorman. ``Yeah,'' Gallo says, resignedly, ``I did say that.
Poor Skeet. But he's really terrible.'' Or, while trying to be on
his best behavior in a conversation about innovators, Gallo blasts
Quentin Tarantino as ``a rip-off artist.'' It's quotes like that
that make Gallo believe he'll never be hired by a major studio.
``That's why Walt Disney will never hire me, ever. Those suits,
they never forget anything, so it's over for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if money is the great equalizer _ whether if he
creates enough profit with ``Buffalo 66,'' the suits would gladly
subject themselves to his abuse for future profits _ Gallo
fervently disagrees. ``The kind of money that it would take to
interest those bean-counters would be profound. It would not be
having the hot film in an art house theater. My film is the No. 1
independent box office film. There's nothing about the film I
didn't control. (But) I haven't been offered a job as a (production
assistant) since the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo wouldn't take such a low-level job, would he? ``You'd be
surprised. For the right price ...,'' he says, joking. ``I'm in
trouble right now. I mean, I had to borrow a car to get here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his occasional joking and vitriolic attacks on other
people, Gallo does believe in what he says. For Gallo, life and
creativity are about making subversive art, about challenging
himself. It's what he struggled to do with the oddball verite
comedy ``Buffalo 66,'' obviously a personal film.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know me _ even people who don't know me _ feel that
the film is autobiographical, that I'm probably playing myself in
the film. What I'm really playing is my father. Or what I would
have become, if I'd let my father's heavy impact stay in my life.
And what I play in the last five minutes of the film is me on a
really good day. I'd like to get 12 of my most complicated, bizarre
friends together _ and there are many of them like that _ and I
would like to have a dinner party with them all. But the only way
they could come is if they brought their mother and father. And
film that, make a documentary. Every time I meet my friends'
parents, it's just brilliant, it's just genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation skitters all over the place, eventually coming
to his third-person description of his darker side, the ``bad''
Vincent Gallo. ``He's unforgiving, and vindictive beyond belief,''
Gallo says, rifling off his liabilities. ``Relentlessly vindictive
and unforgiving, and resentful of feeling ... well, victimized. If
I get photographed by a photographer, and he picks the wrong photo
of me, in some way, at some point in my life _ in my mind _ I'm
gonna punish him. And I'm rigorous, because I have a long list.''
His eyes go wide, and he shakes his head. ``I have two books in my
house. One is every money transaction I've made since I was 13
years old. I need to evaluate in a daily way exactly where I stand.
The other book is every person who's done something against me.''
</P>
<P>
   These vendettas have seemingly become his raison d'etre. His
shaggy mane goes up and down in agreement: ``You're looking to be
disappointed, because you're comfortable in disappointment.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6)  
 (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's cheap, it's cute, and the top comes off. What's not to
like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too much, alas. For while the 1999 Kia Sportage two-door
convertible is certainly ready to deliver fun, fun, fun for the
beach-blanket crowd, there's no mistaking it for the more polished,
car-like miniature sport utilities from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Those who keep track of the many new sport utility vehicles
already know about the South Korean-made, four-door Kia Sportage,
which landed in showrooms on the East Coast over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot like the small sport-utes from Honda, Subaru and
Toyota that are built on the frames of compact cars. But the
Sportage offers neither the soft ride nor the careful finish that
distinguishes the Japanese offerings. Of course, it doesn't match
their window stickers, either, which can run above $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kia is offering a twist on its previous formula, with a
shorter, racier, al fresco version of the Sportage _ one aimed at
younger drivers more likely to identify with the style than the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Start with some positives. The two-door Sportage is 14 inches
shorter than the four-door but just as tall and wide, giving it a
macho, sawed-off, beach buggy swagger. A generous 7.9 inches of
ground clearance and a tough suspension make off-road use a
realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   The nicely proportioned captain's chairs in front offer a great
view of the road. And while the back seat is a squeeze for adults,
entry is relatively easy and the convertible half-top _ there is a
solid roof over the front seats _ offers compensation in the form
of blue sky and breeze.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Kia has not stinted on amenities that usually
come as options on vehicles with a sticker price of $13,995 _ and
maybe far less after on-again, off-again rebates. Power windows,
locks and mirrors are standard equipment, as are intermittent
windshield wipers, a tachometer, a theft-deterrent system, front
disk brakes and a full-size spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   It even includes a third air bag, positioned at the driver's
knees to prevent ``submarining'' and thus maximize the efficacy of
the air bag mounted in the steering wheel hub. Air-conditioning
($900) and the radio-CD player ($545) are the only must-have
extras.
</P>
<P>
   The two-door Sportage comes with rear drive and a four-speed
automatic transmission, or, for an extra $500, with four-wheel
drive and a five-speed manual. (Sorry, you can't mix and match.)
Both versions are equipped with a 16-valve, 4-cylinder, 2-liter
engine that puts out a maximum of 130 horsepower and 127
foot-pounds of torque. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I tested only the rear-drive, automatic transmission, which is
probably less peppy and certainly less versatile than the
four-wheel drive with stick shift. Still, the Sportage seemed
powerful enough, shifting with a thud around 5,000 rpm under full
throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Engine noise is high, which hardly matters because that
cacophony is drowned out by the chatter of the canvas top.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is a mixed bag. While the wide track and short
wheelbase (11 inches shorter than the four-door version) do give
the Sportage a nimble feel at low speeds, the poorly damped coil
springs are bouncy on rough roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Sportage's brakes are responsive and don't fade much with
hard use _ a real achievement in view of the hefty 3,100-pound curb
weight and the drum brakes at the rear wheels. Anti-lock braking is
available as a $495 option.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the canvas top and flexible plastic rear window is a
relatively simple, five-minute chore. But I'd hate to try to put
them back together in the middle of a rainstorm. And even when it
is properly attached, the canvas leaks a breeze at 60 miles an
hour.

`KNOCK OFF': A FILM THAT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was a film ever more appropriately titled than ``Knock Off''?
</P>
<P>
   This latest Jean Claude Van Damme vehicle, which ostensibly
takes its name from the cheap imitations of brand-name clothing and
other goods manufactured in Hong Kong, is actually one itself.
</P>
<P>
   With standard-issue villains like former KGB agents working for
the Russian Mafia and CIA baddies scheming to hold whole countries
for ransom, ``Knock Off'' runs breathlessly over land and water in
familiar comic-book fashion, offering more action than sense and
next to nothing in the way of suspense, humor or romance.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tsui Hark, a veteran of Hong Kong action films, and
written by Steven E. de Souza, whose credits include ``Die Hard''
and ``48 Hrs.,'' ``Knock Off'' deadens the brain with its
convoluted plot, and then tries to revive its victims with its
stunts and shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   As the plot goes, the Russian Mafia is planting tiny
``nanobombs'' in everything from children's toys to the buttons on
blue jeans manufactured in Hong Kong. The evildoers are in league
with a traitorous CIA section chief (Paul Sorvino). Once the goods
are shipped abroad and bought, he intends to threaten whole
countries with destruction unless he gets his $100 million a month
ransom payment.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the British turnover of Hong Kong to China in
1997, enter Van Damme as Marcus Ray, rogue of the rag trade, who,
for no reason the film ever makes clear, sets clothing models into
a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   A partner with Tommy Hendricks (Rob Schneider) in the operation
of the Hong Kong offices of an American company called V Six Jeans,
he is apparently trying to overcome his traumatic childhood as an
orphan (the son of doctors, of course) and his more recent past as
a shady Hong Kong character.
</P>
<P>
   But just as all seems to be going well (Marcus even has one of
those BMW sports cars introduced in films by James Bond), an
attempt is made to murder his buddy Eddie (Wyman Wong), who runs
the factory that manufactures the jeans.
</P>
<P>
   And soon afterward, Karen (Lela Rochon), announcing herself to
be an executive vice president of V Six, informs him that the
company has been ripped off to the tune of more than $4 million
because some of the jeans shipped out of Eddie's factory are
knockoffs made of inferior denim.
</P>
<P>
   Now faced with fraud charges, Marcus is soon up to his thick
skull in people who would like to see him dead. Of course, no
matter how many guns, knives and bombs they have, they can't kill
him; but every time he fires a shot, even while flying through the
air, one of them drops. Van Damme, who has never been known for the
subtlety of his acting, achieves no new heights in ``Knock Off.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the swift action defeats the efforts of the eye to
distill its sense, but many of the locations _ a Hong Kong
wholesale fruit market, the eye-catching harbor, the skyscrapers
and the busy streets and people _ are a generous compensation for
watching the rest of this unsurprising exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock Off'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes foul language and violence, all of
it as unoriginal as the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>

IF IT SMELLS LIKE A GUN TAX, IT'S A GUN TAX
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to correct garbles) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most folks are familiar with the old ``if it looks like a duck,
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck''
analogy. A governmental version of that goes: ``If it looks like a
tax, acts like a tax and hurts like a tax, call it anything you
like _ even a user fee _ but it's still a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, this is not original
thinking. A column-writing colleague first used it years ago to
take a local municipality to task about water rates, if memory
serves me. It fits perfectly the ongoing debate about the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has proposed that federally licensed
firearms dealers be assessed a ``user fee'' each time the FBI
processes a background check on a prospective gun buyer after Nov.
30. The gun dealer, naturally, will pass that tax ... uh, check
that _ ``user fee'' ... on to the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that the $200 million that was appropriated to
it under the 1993 Brady Act can only be used to improve the
criminal history record systems in the states, and not to perform
the individual background checks that will become law Dec. 1. And
because it will cost upward of $91.6 million next year to run the
NICS Operations Center, a $14 ``user fee'' will be necessary to
cover the costs of the estimated 6.7 million inquiries per year.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the topic of names ... the full name of the Brady
Act is the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act. But don't any of
you long-gun devotees think you'll be exempt from being treated
like a felon. As of Dec. 1, sportsmen and hunters desiring to
purchase rifles and shotguns will be subjected to the same
background check _ and tax _ as those wishing to purchase a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Justice's proposed rule for the
instant checks, the FBI has the ``authority to establish, collect
and retain fees for processing name checks for non-criminal justice
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold the phone right here. Why would we be doing this if it
wasn't for the purposes of criminal justice? Sarah Brady, Handgun
Control Inc. and other proponents of the Brady Act have long
advocated that the law was meant to keep known bad people from
doing unknown bad things with guns. If attempting to keep convicted
felons from buying a gun is a non-criminal justice process, I'll be
the first to quack like a duck.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the way that the FBI ``doesn't'' enforce the law
amounts to a non-criminal justice process, I suppose. Handgun
Control Inc. enjoys trotting out numbers from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics that say more than 242,000 handgun applications were
rejected in 1994-97, the assumption being that thousands of bad
people who had reasons to lie on their forms were kept from buying
handguns. During that same time, only 599 were convicted of
supplying false information on the forms, according to the U.S.
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's likely that thousands of the rejectees filled
out the forms incorrectly, not necessarily falsely. But that's not
a very sexy explanation, and the anti-gun side can't get much
mileage out of that.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking on the public comments period on the
proposed rule that will establish the gun tax. It's a bad rule;
Congress should appropriate the money needed for law enforcement
efforts and not tax a targeted group of citizens who are just
trying to exercise their right under the Second Amendment. Anyone
who shares that opinion should let the feds know, in writing, on or
before Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Send letters to Emmet A. Rathbun, Unit Chief, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, CJIS Division, Module C-3, 1000 Custer Hollow Road,
Clarksburg, W.V. 26306-0147.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're at it, send a copy to your congressional
representative. They love to hear from voters _ especially at
election time.

BROWN VOWS TO TACKLE SAN FRANCISCO'S TRANSIT PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 and TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, who had vowed to fix public
transportation problems within 100 days of taking office, has
reiterated his promise to turn the troubled municipal transit
agency around.
</P>
<P>
   The latest pledge came with the unveiling of a plan Thursday
that is intended to make the Muni Metro operation more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be able to get efficiency out of this system like
you're never seen before,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief component of the plan, which was launched with
apparent success for the Thursday-morning commute, removes
streetcars that aren't compatible with a new automated control
system from the underground Metro system. Twenty trains will be
taken out of tunnel service, bringing the maximum number operating
at one time to between 67 and 75.
</P>
<P>
   To test the new procedure, Brown raced the Muni Metro down
Market Street at rush hour Thursday morning. The mayor set out on
foot from Civic Center station to see if he could beat the train to
the Embarcadero stop. His walk, according to staff members, took 21
minutes. The train, on which an aide was riding, beat him by more
than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It is Brown's hope that even with the reduced fleet, the
operation will run more smoothly and put an end to the delays that
have plagued passengers and put him on the political hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   But, acknowledged Muni spokesman P.J. Johnston, there's a
potential price: comfort. The trains, he said, are likely to be
more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have sacrificed in physical space, we have gained in
frequency and efficiency and movement,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from agitated riders to improve the
heavily used Metro, Muni is instituting several other do-or-die
remedies. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mechanics and technicians will be stationed in the tunnels so
they're never more than three minutes away when a train breaks
down, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra Muni workers will be available in the stations to alert
passengers to delays and help direct them to alternative
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   _ An above-ground, backup shuttle system will be available in
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying in every way to speed the repair of any glitch
that's created,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The automated system, put into operation nearly two weeks ago,
is supposed to double the number of trains that can run through the
tunnel at one time. A series of glitches has severely hampered that
effort.

THE TENSION BETWEEN CULTURE AND FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `s' code)  
 (bl)  
 Samuel G. Freedman is the author of three books, most recently
``The Inheritance,'' and a professor of journalism at Columbia
University. 
By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Maraniss decided
several years ago to embark on a book about Vince Lombardi,
legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers, he called his friend and
fellow author Madeleine Blais to share the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've taken leave of your senses,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blais' scorn could have been easily dismissed were she
simply bored by sports. Quite the contrary: she had written a
much-praised book about a high-school basketball team, ``In These
Girls, Hope Is a Muscle.'' She simply loathed football,
particularly as the subject for a serious author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as the worst of everything in our culture,'' Ms.
Blais said. ``It's brutish. It's mean-spirited. And the guys look
like they're heavy equipment stuck in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between Maraniss and Ms. Blais charted a fault line
through American intellectual life. The sentimental, rhapsodizing
language and images that thinkers and writers lavish on almost
every major sport are not usually applied to football. Rarely does
it receive the thoughtful regard that golf does, the appreciation
of athletic grace conferred on basketball and tennis, even the
respect for mano-a-mano confrontation applied to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Football League opens its season Sunday, the
contrast appears most starkly when football is compared with
baseball, the subject of elegaic evocations from the book ``The
Boys of Summer'' to the film ``Field of Dreams'' to the pop song
``Centerfield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sports derived from a different mythic base,'' said
Joseph Pici, a professor of English at the University of Dayton and
an expert in sports literature. ``Baseball comes out of a kind of
pastoral myth. It's nostalgic. It's set in a springlike
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast, football comes from a heroic myth, a myth of
war,'' he continued. ``The season begins in fall, when things start
to die. In football, there's a rush to complete the game. It's the
whole idea of sudden death. The visceral, hard knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, American culture ought to be able to embrace both
myths equally. Yet author and sportsman George Plimpton has
posited, ``The smaller the ball, the better the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sports Illustrated listed the 15 essential sports books in
1987, 11 dealt with baseball. A recent poll of readers by USA Today
put only one football film (``Brian's Song'') among the top 10
sports movies. The list included three pictures about baseball and
two about boxing and was topped by one about basketball
(``Hoosiers''). The current edition of the database Art Abstracts
shows 67 citations for baseball and 57 for football, an apparent
parity except that two-thirds of the football references involve
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   To put the disparity in personal terms, filmmaker Ron Shelton
has written and directed movies about baseball (``Bull Durham'' and
``Cobb''), basketball (``White Men Can't Jump'') and golf (``Tin
Cup'') but never football. ``I like to see the characters I'm
writing about,'' he said. ``In football, they are so buried in
cages and gladiator wear that I have nothing to identify with. It's
corporations and systems against corporations and systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some artists disagree. Critics have extolled such
football books as the novels ``A Fan's Notes'' by Frederick Exley
and ``End Zone'' by Don DeLillo, the short story ``The 80-Yard
Run,'' by Irwin Shaw, and H.G. Bissinger's nonfiction narrative,
``Friday Night Lights.'' Former players like Pat Toomay and Peter
Gent have produced highly regarded fiction. A striking number of
poets, among them Randall Jarrell and James Dickey, have rendered
football in verse.
</P>
<P>
   All these works harbor the darkness characteristic of art about
football. Pici contends that the tonal difference in sports
literature can be distilled to two poems: William Carlos Williams'
affectionate ode to baseball, ``At the Ball Game,'' and Jarrell's
bleak eulogy for a football star fallen to heroin addiction, ``Say
Good-bye to Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Exley's protagonist is a broken man who sees in football the
vision of a vanished grace. An undistinguished English teacher and
weekend drunk, he spends Sundays transfixed by the exploits of
Frank Gifford, a college classmate starring for the 1950s New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Football enjoyed its greatest cultural regard in an earlier
America, one proud of Manifest Destiny and gunboat diplomacy.
``Football was a symbol of empire, of war, of manliness,'' said
Robert Higgs, professor emeritus of English at East Tennessee State
University and the author of ``Laurel and Thorn: The Athlete in
American Literature.'' ``You follow the rules, you do what you're
told, and America's right.''
</P>
<P>
   When reformers wanted to ban the college game because of several
deaths, none other than President Theodore Roosevelt interceded to
preserve it. Augmenting football's connection with an imperial
America, Higgs said, such leading coaches as Fielding (Hurry-Up)
Yost, Earl (Red) Blaik and Vince Lombardi all began their careers
at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, football's military bond connoted heroism. F. Scott
Fitzgerald modeled Allenby in his novel ``This Side of Paradise''
on Hobie Baker, the Princeton football star killed in World War I.
Ring Lardner and Grantland Rice wrote of football for a popular
readership. The success of Notre Dame under Knute Rockne and the
backs whom Rice called the Four Horsemen was instrumental in
winning Catholics acceptance in a largely Protestant country.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War, however, cast football in the eyes of
intellectuals as the sport of hawks and reactionaries. On the eve
of a major antiwar demonstration in Washington, President Richard
M. Nixon tried to engage protesters in chat about football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment tried to prop up Lombardi as a symbol of the
old ways: responsibility and discipline,'' said Maraniss, a
Washington Post reporter whose book on the coach is tentatively
titled ``When Pride Mattered.'' ``And there's the military analogy:
faceless, interchangeable parts controlled by an authority figure.
All that marginalized football to intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the longtime parallels of football teams to
corporations ultimately proved controversial. The tie goes back to
the 1870s and Walter Camp, an executive at a clock company who
helped shape the rules that separated football from its parent game
of rugby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp was more interested in corporate metaphors than military
metaphors,'' said Michael Oriard, a former college and professional
player, now an English professor at Oregon State University. ``His
view of football was managerial. It was a top-down thing: those
with superior brains controlling those with brawn and deploying
them in efficient ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings about football's impersonality began to be heard in
the 1940s when the one-platoon game gave way to separate offensive
and defensive units. ``And in the 1960s, with the countercultural
rejection of Corporate America, there's a crucial turning point,''
said Oriard, the author of the 1993 book ``Reading Football: How
the Popular Press Created an American Spectacle'' (University of
North Carolina Press). ``At this point, the myth-criticism school
of American Studies starts to explain baseball as pastoral and
football as corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   What football literature may have lost in sentimentality as a
result it gained in realism, however. David Meggyesy's 1971
muckraking memoir ``Out of Their League'' depicted the intense
brutality of the game. Pat Toomay, a former defensive end for the
Dallas Cowboys, put his insights about football as big business
into the 1984 novel ``On Any Given Sunday,'' which follows a player
who believes a game may have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Cowboy, Peter Gent, wrote about a struggle for
corporate control of a team in his 1985 novel, ``The Franchise,''
and about the physical toll football extracted in his breakthrough
1973 novel, ``North Dallas 40.'' In 1972, DeLillo fused the
language of football and nuclear war in ``End Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a love-hate relationship in writing about football,''
Gent said. ``It's like writing about war. You're stuck in a foxhole
with a guy, and you're relying on him to keep you alive, and he's
relying on you. If you play for five years, you see lots of guys
get killed. Yet you never feel more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by a jumble of armored men, none recognizable by face,
football also challenges an artist's powers of comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shadow game,'' Toomay said. ``It's where the blood and
the bodies are banging into each other. I'll never forget the first
time I watched the professional game from the press-box level. You
had no feel for the emotions down there. You couldn't see the
blood. You couldn't smell the fear. You saw patterns of movement.
It was all very abstract.''

   PUPPET-FESTIVAL (New York &UR; )  &LR; _ There has been a great increase
in this high-art notion of adult puppet theater in the United
States over the last 20 years as vanguard American artists have
turned to the medium, and as work from countries where puppetry was
never ghettoized for children has been brought to the New York
stage. The most important venue for new puppet work is the biennial
International Festival of Puppet Theater, produced by Cheryl
Henson, Leslee Asch and the Henson Foundation. The fourth festival
opens Wednesday. By Andrew Solomon. (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;

<P>
   VIDEOBOYZ-MOVIES (Los Angeles) _ It has been said that anyone
could produce a movie: all you needed was money, the ability to
hire good people and very good, or very bad, taste (as long as you
were consistent). But to direct one you surely needed concrete
experience, every John Ford and Preston Sturges move at the ready
and a proven ability to handle actors. Well, that was then but
maybe not now, when a new generation of aspiring movie makers are
getting incredible opportunities based largely on razzle-dazzle.
And when overnight successes like the brothers Peter and Bobby
Farrelly (``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``There's Something About Mary,''

   MULTI-ACT-BALLETS (Undated) _ Today, when abstractions dominate
many ballet repertories, it's tempting to proclaim plots
unimportant. Dance is an art of movement, and the best story in the
world cannot disguise unimaginative choreography. Nevertheless,
should choreographers wish to tell tales, good stories can help
make good choreography look even better. This is especially true of
full-evening productions. Recent months have offered several
imposing multi-act story ballets, ranging from Marius Petipa's
19th-century blendings of classicism and exoticism to Boris
Eifman's contemporary balletic expressionism. By Jack Anderson.

   EQUESTRIAN-DANCE (Paris) _ Equestrian art may be as old as
ancient Greece, but Bartabas, the founder and director of the
Paris-based Zingaro Equestrian Theater, still likes to think he is
doing something new. He may well be right. Carving a niche for
himself somewhere between the classical dressage of, say, Vienna's
legendary Spanish Riding School and the athletic antics of circus
horses, the 41-year-old Frenchman has created an equestrian show
that underlines the emotional power of horses. By Alan Riding.

   HANDEL-OPERAS (New York) _ Handel has changed. For pretty much
two centuries after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily
as a composer of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas:
music that bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and
decisiveness. His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in
tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920s. On Friday, the second
night of its new season, the New York City Opera will present
Handel's ``Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass
during the summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas
have just appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. By Paul Griffiths.

But consider the evidence. The finely engraved teeth, the whalebone

THE TENSION BETWEEN CULTURE AND FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `e' code)  
 (bl)  
 Samuel G. Freedman is the author of three books, most recently
``The Inheritance,'' and a professor of journalism at Columbia
University. 
By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Maraniss decided
several years ago to embark on a book about Vince Lombardi,
legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers, he called his friend and
fellow author Madeleine Blais to share the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've taken leave of your senses,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blais' scorn could have been easily dismissed were she
simply bored by sports. Quite the contrary: she had written a
much-praised book about a high-school basketball team, ``In These
Girls, Hope Is a Muscle.'' She simply loathed football,
particularly as the subject for a serious author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as the worst of everything in our culture,'' Ms.
Blais said. ``It's brutish. It's mean-spirited. And the guys look
like they're heavy equipment stuck in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between Maraniss and Ms. Blais charted a fault line
through American intellectual life. The sentimental, rhapsodizing
language and images that thinkers and writers lavish on almost
every major sport are not usually applied to football. Rarely does
it receive the thoughtful regard that golf does, the appreciation
of athletic grace conferred on basketball and tennis, even the
respect for mano-a-mano confrontation applied to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Football League opens its season Sunday, the
contrast appears most starkly when football is compared with
baseball, the subject of elegaic evocations from the book ``The
Boys of Summer'' to the film ``Field of Dreams'' to the pop song
``Centerfield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sports derived from a different mythic base,'' said
Joseph Pici, a professor of English at the University of Dayton and
an expert in sports literature. ``Baseball comes out of a kind of
pastoral myth. It's nostalgic. It's set in a springlike
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast, football comes from a heroic myth, a myth of
war,'' he continued. ``The season begins in fall, when things start
to die. In football, there's a rush to complete the game. It's the
whole idea of sudden death. The visceral, hard knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, American culture ought to be able to embrace both
myths equally. Yet author and sportsman George Plimpton has
posited, ``The smaller the ball, the better the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sports Illustrated listed the 15 essential sports books in
1987, 11 dealt with baseball. A recent poll of readers by USA Today
put only one football film (``Brian's Song'') among the top 10
sports movies. The list included three pictures about baseball and
two about boxing and was topped by one about basketball
(``Hoosiers''). The current edition of the database Art Abstracts
shows 67 citations for baseball and 57 for football, an apparent
parity except that two-thirds of the football references involve
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   To put the disparity in personal terms, filmmaker Ron Shelton
has written and directed movies about baseball (``Bull Durham'' and
``Cobb''), basketball (``White Men Can't Jump'') and golf (``Tin
Cup'') but never football. ``I like to see the characters I'm
writing about,'' he said. ``In football, they are so buried in
cages and gladiator wear that I have nothing to identify with. It's
corporations and systems against corporations and systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some artists disagree. Critics have extolled such
football books as the novels ``A Fan's Notes'' by Frederick Exley
and ``End Zone'' by Don DeLillo, the short story ``The 80-Yard
Run,'' by Irwin Shaw, and H.G. Bissinger's nonfiction narrative,
``Friday Night Lights.'' Former players like Pat Toomay and Peter
Gent have produced highly regarded fiction. A striking number of
poets, among them Randall Jarrell and James Dickey, have rendered
football in verse.
</P>
<P>
   All these works harbor the darkness characteristic of art about
football. Pici contends that the tonal difference in sports
literature can be distilled to two poems: William Carlos Williams'
affectionate ode to baseball, ``At the Ball Game,'' and Jarrell's
bleak eulogy for a football star fallen to heroin addiction, ``Say
Good-bye to Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Exley's protagonist is a broken man who sees in football the
vision of a vanished grace. An undistinguished English teacher and
weekend drunk, he spends Sundays transfixed by the exploits of
Frank Gifford, a college classmate starring for the 1950s New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Football enjoyed its greatest cultural regard in an earlier
America, one proud of Manifest Destiny and gunboat diplomacy.
``Football was a symbol of empire, of war, of manliness,'' said
Robert Higgs, professor emeritus of English at East Tennessee State
University and the author of ``Laurel and Thorn: The Athlete in
American Literature.'' ``You follow the rules, you do what you're
told, and America's right.''
</P>
<P>
   When reformers wanted to ban the college game because of several
deaths, none other than President Theodore Roosevelt interceded to
preserve it. Augmenting football's connection with an imperial
America, Higgs said, such leading coaches as Fielding (Hurry-Up)
Yost, Earl (Red) Blaik and Vince Lombardi all began their careers
at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, football's military bond connoted heroism. F. Scott
Fitzgerald modeled Allenby in his novel ``This Side of Paradise''
on Hobie Baker, the Princeton football star killed in World War I.
Ring Lardner and Grantland Rice wrote of football for a popular
readership. The success of Notre Dame under Knute Rockne and the
backs whom Rice called the Four Horsemen was instrumental in
winning Catholics acceptance in a largely Protestant country.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War, however, cast football in the eyes of
intellectuals as the sport of hawks and reactionaries. On the eve
of a major antiwar demonstration in Washington, President Richard
M. Nixon tried to engage protesters in chat about football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment tried to prop up Lombardi as a symbol of the
old ways: responsibility and discipline,'' said Maraniss, a
Washington Post reporter whose book on the coach is tentatively
titled ``When Pride Mattered.'' ``And there's the military analogy:
faceless, interchangeable parts controlled by an authority figure.
All that marginalized football to intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the longtime parallels of football teams to
corporations ultimately proved controversial. The tie goes back to
the 1870s and Walter Camp, an executive at a clock company who
helped shape the rules that separated football from its parent game
of rugby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp was more interested in corporate metaphors than military
metaphors,'' said Michael Oriard, a former college and professional
player, now an English professor at Oregon State University. ``His
view of football was managerial. It was a top-down thing: those
with superior brains controlling those with brawn and deploying
them in efficient ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings about football's impersonality began to be heard in
the 1940s when the one-platoon game gave way to separate offensive
and defensive units. ``And in the 1960s, with the countercultural
rejection of Corporate America, there's a crucial turning point,''
said Oriard, the author of the 1993 book ``Reading Football: How
the Popular Press Created an American Spectacle'' (University of
North Carolina Press). ``At this point, the myth-criticism school
of American Studies starts to explain baseball as pastoral and
football as corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   What football literature may have lost in sentimentality as a
result it gained in realism, however. David Meggyesy's 1971
muckraking memoir ``Out of Their League'' depicted the intense
brutality of the game. Pat Toomay, a former defensive end for the
Dallas Cowboys, put his insights about football as big business
into the 1984 novel ``On Any Given Sunday,'' which follows a player
who believes a game may have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Cowboy, Peter Gent, wrote about a struggle for
corporate control of a team in his 1985 novel, ``The Franchise,''
and about the physical toll football extracted in his breakthrough
1973 novel, ``North Dallas 40.'' In 1972, DeLillo fused the
language of football and nuclear war in ``End Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a love-hate relationship in writing about football,''
Gent said. ``It's like writing about war. You're stuck in a foxhole
with a guy, and you're relying on him to keep you alive, and he's
relying on you. If you play for five years, you see lots of guys
get killed. Yet you never feel more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by a jumble of armored men, none recognizable by face,
football also challenges an artist's powers of comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shadow game,'' Toomay said. ``It's where the blood and
the bodies are banging into each other. I'll never forget the first
time I watched the professional game from the press-box level. You
had no feel for the emotions down there. You couldn't see the
blood. You couldn't smell the fear. You saw patterns of movement.
It was all very abstract.''

   Skillet Southern-fried classic

<P>
   (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Auchmutey
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   No dish in the canon of Southern cooking has as many variations
as fried chicken. The first recipe for it appeared in the first
Southern cookbook, the 1828 edition of Mary Randolph's ``The
Virginia Housewife.'' Since then, countless permutations have been
tried and passed down through the generations.
</P>
<P>
   The variables are legion: What size should the hen be? Do you
soak the pieces in salt water or buttermilk or something else? How
do you bread the chicken? Season it? Do you pan-fry, deep-fry or
fry at all? How deep should the oil be? Should you use shortening?
Vegetable oil? Peanut oil? Do you cover the skillet, and how long?
What kind of gravy do you make, and what do you pour it over? (Not
the chicken, please.) And what's the proper way to eat it?
</P>
<P>
   That last one's actually easy. Years ago, Gainesville, Georgia,
one of the centers of the American poultry industry, passed a law
making it illegal to eat fried chicken with anything other than
your fingers. As far we know, no one has been arrested for using a
knife and fork _ but it sure looks funny.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Real Southern Fried Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   My sister-in-law Lucy is the best chicken fryer I know. When I
called her to ask how she did it, she laughed and said, ``Go out in
the yard, get a plump hen and wring its neck.'' She grew up eating
chicken that fresh. Now she buys it like most of us, at the grocery
store, where she looks for the smallest fryer (never more than 3
pounds) because it'll probably be the tenderest. You'll likely have
to cut up the bird yourself if you want a pully bone, the meaty
morsel from the chest that others call a wishbone. Here's how you
cook it.
</P>
<P>
   1fryer (2 1/2-3 pounds), cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   Buttermilk to cover
</P>
<P>
   1cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Canola oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon bacon fat
</P>
<P>
   Rinse chicken pieces, pat dry and place in casserole dish. Cover
with buttermilk and soak at least 2 hours in refrigerator. Remove
dish and let chicken come close to room temperature (no longer than
2 hours) before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Combine flour, pepper and salt in a bowl or paper bag. Remove
chicken from dish, letting buttermilk drip off, and dredge each
piece (or shake it in the bag) to coat evenly with flour and
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Place bacon fat in a 12-inch (or larger) skillet with enough
canola oil to cover 1/2 inch deep. Over medium-high heat, bring oil
to point that a drop of water flicked into it sizzles (about 350
degrees). Lower heat to medium and arrange chicken pieces in
skillet, skin side down, being careful not to overcrowd. Fry 5 to
10 minutes on each side, with lid on. Remove lid and fry each side
another 5 to 10 minutes, until crust is crispy and golden. Drain on
wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Cooking times vary by size of piece, whether the meat is
white or dark, type of skillet and temperature of the oil (which is
difficult to keep steady). All of which is to say, keep an eye on
the chicken and regulate the heat so the inside gets done before
the outside gets overdone.

<P>
   2tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2cups milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Discard all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the skillet. (Be sure
to leave the crispy brown pieces, for flavor.) Over medium-high
heat, whisk in flour until it turns medium-brown. Gradually pour in
milk, stirring until gravy comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer
for at least 2 minutes, or until it reaches a creamy texture. As
you're cooking, taste the gravy and add salt and pepper as needed.
Serve over mashed potatoes or rice.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Constructive criticism goes a little awry
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a blow to the old ego when you find out you're not a gifted
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   I have a young relative whose children needed supervision while
they brushed their teeth, their dentist said. She undertook to sit
with them night and morning and make sure they scrubbed the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   My heart went out to her 13-year-old, who put up his toothbrush
and headed for bed, saying over his shoulder, ``Goodnight,
warden!''
</P>
<P>
   The feisty young waitress at a picturesque Mentone, Ala.,
deli-restaurant wasn't so philosophical when I undertook to
instruct her.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I interviewed a noted restaurateur who had just moved
south and was doing his best to enlighten and sustain the locals.
</P>
<P>
   He told me that he found Southerners troublesome because we are
unhandily polite. If we don't like his food, we won't tell him, and
we'll leave and never come back. New Englanders, on the other hand,
will make their criticism known _ in the politest terms _ and go
away, but come back again to see if things have improved.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of that as my daughter and I sat on the little open
porch outside a log cabin on Mentone's main street. (I think they
have only one.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful day, cool and bright, and we had feasted our
eyes on some incomparable scenery. We were only moderately hungry.
(A lady who runs a grocery-filling station had sold us some
homemade peanut brittle, which was so good we ate it as we
traveled.)
</P>
<P>
   My daughter ordered a sandwich and a Coke; I ordered a cup of
pinto beans, corn bread and iced tea. The drinks were fine,
although I abhor to have them served in pint fruit jars. But the
rest of the food was inedible.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, who paid, would have been horrified at complaining
to management. But I thought the place was so charming, the
waitress so cute and obliging, I wanted to help them out. Teach
them, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The child thanked us and apologized as she collected our dishes
and the untouched food. I tried to explain that I hoped they would
use a better corn bread recipe. I even offered mine. But the
atmosphere was decidedly cool when we left.
</P>
<P>
   The theory that it's unseemly to complain is pretty general, I
expect, and I may never attempt to instruct another restaurant
operator.
</P>
<P>
   But I did like Mentone, the pretty little town across the
Georgia line in northernmost Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It seems relatively undiscovered and unsettled, although any
road you take _ and they have some pretty ones, paved and unpaved _
leads to a magnificent mountain view and some wonderful houses. We
liked the old ones, weather-stained and tin-roofed, but there are a
lot of new ones, too _ subdivisions yet.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter would like a second home in the Mentone area, but I
think it is just a dream.
</P>
<P>
   We conferred with another delightful young woman, a real estate
agent named Angela, who operates in the lower half of one of the
log cabins. She had pictures of pretty old houses and wonderful
woodland and lakeside views _ all sold.
</P>
<P>
   For fun on the way home, we toured Menlo across the Georgia
line, a jewel of a little town, which apparently has only one house
to sell _ a two-story frame, needing painting, $90,000.

 &HT;    Jill Vantosh simplifies her lifestyle by stripping a condo to
the bone
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_When Jill Vantosh talks about paring down, take her
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of living in a large traditional home, the
Atlanta interior designer and her husband, Jeff, went the route of
many other middle-aged empty nesters: They downsized to a condo.
</P>
<P>
   But moving to the Buckhead unit last winter involved far more
than sorting, selling and storing belongings.
</P>
<P>
   The designer seized an opportunity to create a streamlined
interior that emphasizes a few of her favorite things _ including
concrete. Vantosh stripped the second-floor unit of the 1950s red
brick building to its concrete bones, from floor to ceiling, then
extended the concrete to the kitchen countertops. The result is a
clean, industrial look made warm and inviting by juxtaposing the
unpainted beams and chrome furnishings with oak floors and rich
cabin-
</P>
<P>
   etry.
</P>
<P>
   Like the move, the renovation was a gamble _ the kind of risk
the designer's known for embracing _ but one that's paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to simplify,'' Vantosh said, ``but I have
this real high level of energy when it comes to design.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who during her 26-year career has earned a
reputation for being avant-garde, relishes experimentation. ``I'm
open-minded, always looking for new ways to skin a cat,'' she said.
``If you're going to work in such a creative field, it just seems
such a waste not to reach out and go the step further. I try to
teach my clients to experiment, too, because if you don't, you
don't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   And growth is something the former schoolteacher-turned-designer
knows all about. Among her high-profile clients is actress and
former Atlantan Halle Berry.
</P>
<P>
   After earning an education degree at the University of Georgia
and marrying commerical real estate broker Jeff Vantosh, she taught
for four years before deciding to sell real estate. She began to
help friends decorate their homes, and after taking courses in
engineering, drafting and design, entered the field full time.
``Nobody can teach you what you see inside your head,'' she said,
``but I still had to learn the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it came from working for an architect and builders while
playing mom to Aaron, 27, and Beth, 26. ``It was really tough on my
family,'' Vantosh recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her projects began as children's rooms and small offices, then
evolved into commercial work and model homes. She later opened a
furnishings and accessories store, Vantosh Details, in Buckhead's
West Village but closed it last spring to refocus on design.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come to know me as contemporary because I'm 'out
there,' though that doesn't mean I don't love and use antiques,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Vantosh once raised a few eyebrows in traditional-minded
Atlanta with a room she created for a decorator show house by
covering its walls in corrugated cardboard and aluminum strapping.
</P>
<P>
   Such experimentation with materials and furnishings doesn't have
to be expensive, she said. Client Sandy Hartman was prepared to buy
all new furniture for the contemporary house she built in Buckhead
last spring. ``What I liked about Jill is she didn't push for that
like other designers,'' Hartman said. ``She said, 'Let's work with
some of the things you already have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her trust in Vantosh's instincts led her to agree when the
designer suggested incorporating concrete in a stairwell and wet
bar. It's a look she would emphasize in her Peachtree Road condo.
</P>
<P>
   A few of my favorite things. Besides an in-town location, the
Vantoshes' priority in downsizing was ``finding something I could
tear up without feeling guilty,'' she said. ``We'd find all these
really nice houses, but I wanted the next place to be my
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the couple found their unit in the ``eyebrow
building,'' as it's known because of the curved awning, they had
sold their home and were renting an apartment. That proved a
blessing because the small apartment not only removed them from the
chaos of renovation but forced them to take a hard look at their
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but I didn't want clutter,'' said Vantosh,
aiming for a minimal decor. ``I had had walls of Aaron's baseball
pictures and all of Beth's things from school, so we went through
and picked the most sentimental things we wanted to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   After selling many of their furnishings in yard sales or at her
store, they bought new pieces that would enhance the new home's
modern architecture. ``I wanted to live here because of the
ceilings,'' Vantosh said of its concrete construction. ``I knew the
structure and what I could do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-month project included converting a third bedroom to a
living room by removing its blocked walls and creating an
``L-shaped'' open space that flows into the dining room and den. A
kitchen wall was lowered to leave only a partition between it and
the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Ceilings were stripped of their tile to expose concrete as were
the hardwood floors, which proved a real challenge because tar had
to be removed before they could be cleaned and sealed. To define
spaces within the open interior, Vantosh covered some floors with
light oak and left others unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen concrete countertops and thought, 'How perfect!' ''
Vantosh said. ``You can do so much with it _ stains, paint, shells
and rocks _ that people are starting to experiment with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of uneven walls, a section had to be poured on site,
creating quite a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff was a little concerned about all the concrete but
supportive,'' Vantosh said. He joking asked how he'd be able to
tell when the project was complete.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete walls also made wiring difficult. Soffits were
added to hide electrical, sound and plumbing systems, and oak
storage cabinets were built to cover unsightly heat-and-air units
beneath the windows. The cabinets also reduced the need for
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In editing their belongings for a smaller space, Vantosh proved
that sentimental items don't have to be cast aside to make room for
more treasured pieces. A childhood painting by her daughter hangs
in the master bedroom, while family photos and framed displays of
her infants' hospital gowns find a home on the powder room walls.
</P>
<P>
   Vantosh is the first to admit downsizing is difficult but forces
homeowners to focus on what's important. ``Not enough people are
willing to let their personality show. They get stuck on rules,''
she said. ``Simplifying is a risk worth taking.''

 &HT;    In Kentucky, Col. Sanders and his finger-lickin' legacy are
something to celebrate
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, Ky. _It's a good thing the Big Chicken doesn't face
north. If it did, the Marietta, Georgia landmark with the movable
beak and rolling eyes might really start squawking. Because people
here in Kentucky have come up with something that fryers of all
sizes should fear: a big skillet.
</P>
<P>
   The World's Biggest Frying Skillet _ we'll take their word for
it _ weighs 700 pounds and comes in four wedge-shaped segments that
each take three men to hoist. It stretches 10 1/2 feet across, not
counting the 8-foot handle, and holds almost 200 gallons of cooking
oil that propane jets take an hour to heat up. Watching the skillet
in action under a festival tent, burners blasting, chicken hissing,
you think not so much of Sunday dinner as the day shift at a pig
iron furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need an engineer for this job, not a cook,'' says Harold
Smith of the London Bucket Co., which forged the magnificent pan.
</P>
<P>
   Every September, Smith and company drag the skillet out of
storage and reassemble it to feed the crowds at London's World
Chicken Festival. Chew on that name a moment: not the London
Chicken Festival or the Kentucky Chicken Festival _ the World
Chicken Festival. Where does a town in a state that produces a
smidgen of the poultry produced in Georgia or Arkansas get off
staging an event with such a preposterously boastful name? The
justification lies in a former resident who made good, a tough old
bird named Harland Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a corporate logo, Col. Sanders was a real man
who moved from his native Indiana, got one of those honorary
Kentucky colonel certificates and opened a cafe and tourist court
on the U.S. highway between London and the next town south, Corbin.
In the 1950s, when I-75 bypassed his business, he took to the road
in a white linen suit and black string tie and started selling
franchises. Americans were just beginning to discover that they had
less time for cooking, and the dapper gent with the cane got in on
the ground floor of the meal-replacement industry. By the time he
died in 1980, the man and the chicken were internationally
renowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine the Colonel and Muhammad Ali are the two most
recognizable people in the world,'' says one of the festival's
planners, Caner Cornett, who may not be far off in his assessment
of Kentucky's famous sons.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so high on the Colonel and his food, though.
There are those who feel that Kentucky Fried Chicken and its
fast-food brethren are to traditional Southern fried chicken what a
plastic-wrapped pecan log is to freshly baked pecan pie. It's
convenient, maybe even tasty, but it ain't the real thing. As any
purist can tell you, authentic fried chicken _ the kind Southerners
have been fixing for the preacher since before the Civil War _
doesn't come out of a deep fryer or an oven or some industrial-size
cooking contraption. It's pan-fried in a black iron skillet heavy
enough to dent the linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   You don't find that kind of chicken as much anymore. ``I'm
afraid it's becoming one of the lost arts of Southern cooking,''
says Ronni Lundy, a Kentuckian who wrote the cookbook ``Shuck
Beans, Stack Cakes and Honest Fried Chicken.'' She believes home
cooks have shied away from fried chicken because it's messy and
time-consuming, not to mention fattening. As for restaurant
chicken, most of it is deep-fried these days, like potatoes, a
faster method that makes for crispy crust but often overcooks and
dries out the meat inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's become the benchmark for chicken,'' says Lundy, who,
unlike Sanders, was actually born in Corbin. ``I'm not a fan of the
Colonel's. It saddens me that Kentucky cooking is so identified
with fast food.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no escaping the Colonel and his legacy at the chicken
festival. London, a pleasant town of 4,000 in the low mountains on
the edge of Daniel Boone National Forest, started the celebration
eight years ago to capitalize on Sanders' fame. His face is
plastered on the front of the festival program. One of the main
events is a Harland Sanders look-alike contest; Robert M. Thompson
of Lawrenceburg, Ky., who grew a white goatee after he retired from
IBM, has won it the last two times. ``I saw the Colonel drive by in
his white limousine once, and he waved at me,'' he says. ``I always
try to represent him in a way that does honor to his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Other remembrances aren't as fond. One year at the festival,
several of Sanders' former employees were asked to get up on stage
and answer questions about rubbing wings with the legend. ``They
wouldn't do it,'' says the festival's Cornett. ``They said he was a
difficult old man to work for, and they didn't want to talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Local gossip has it that one of those employees, a cook, was the
true creator of Sanders' original recipe. ``Everyone knows where it
came from,'' says Judy Nicholson of the tourism bureau, ``but we
don't talk about it too much because the Colonel's a god down this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there's a shrine. Twelve miles south of London, on a
two-lane stretch of U.S. 25 in Corbin, the old Sanders Cafe has
been restored to 1940 condition and converted into a museum. The
white frame cottage with the steep dark-shingled roof adjoins a
sleekly modern KFC. Inside, the dining room opens onto exhibits of
artifacts and memorabilia like a flier from his unsuccessful 1951
run for the state Senate (as a Republican) and the cover of a rare
1960s recording, ``Christmas Eve With Col. Sanders,'' showing him
in Santa cap as he naps next to a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the old kitchen, too, where those ``11 secret herbs
and spices'' were first mixed and where the Colonel perfected a
new, speedier way to cook chicken at the massive Vulcan range. His
revolutionary technique used the same oil but a different utensil,
a pressure cooker. One of them is sitting next to the stove, beside
the old technology he bypassed like a slow two-lane _ a cast-iron
skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the two of them together, it suddenly occurs to you that
the most famous fried chicken in the world is not, strictly
speaking, fried.

 &HT;    With the right attitude, any job can be a ministry, making the
world brighter for co-workers, customers
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_A few years ago author Michael Toms found himself with
three hours to kill at an airport in the Midwest. Wandering the
corridors, he heard singing and followed the voice to what turned
out to be a shoeshine stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man shining shoes was happily singing, laughing and
generally uplifting the spirits of all who came within his orbit,''
Toms wrote in ``True Work _ The Sacred Dimension to Earning a
Living'' (Bell Tower, 1998, $21), a book he co-wrote with his wife,
Justine Willis Toms. ``I had my shoes shined and remained there for
about an hour, basking in the positive energy this man exuded
through his dedication and singular artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   In these days of often surly service _ if what many businesses
provide can be called service at all _ an encounter such as Toms'
is memorable.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation celebrates Labor Day weekend, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution asked readers about workers who make the world
brighter for their colleagues and their customers. We heard about
Edith Heath who does shampoos at a Buckhead salon and Charley
Lindsey who drives a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Ola W. Reynolds, a salesclerk at Saks Fifth Avenue at Phipps
Plaza, makes shopping a pleasure, two of her customers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen her not be happy,'' says Carlette Iredale.
``She turns away the wrath of angry customers with a kind word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always polite,'' says Edith Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, 55, who has worked at the store for 28 years, says
simply: ``I treat everybody the way I want to be treated. That's
just something I was taught as a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits her parents (her mother was a housewife and her
father a farmer) and her Baptist faith for her attitude toward
other people. ``You can't be taught customer service,'' she said.
``It's part of who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jennings, 41, assistant to Laura Leathers in the Freedom of
Information office of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, ``is never anything less than cordial and courteous''
to fellow workers and to the public, says Leathers. ``If you ask
her to do something, she's very willing to do it. If she thinks of
a way to help that you haven't thought of, she'll suggest it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jennings, ``I've sat on the other side of the fence. I've
had to deal with federal offices and federal agencies. I remind
myself how frustrating it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy, Jennings says, is that ``you make the day what
it is. You can have a bad day or you can make it a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Any job can be a ministry if it's done with the right attitude,
says Rabbi Jeffrey K. Salkin, author of ``Being God's Partner _ How
to Find the Hidden Link Between Spirituality and Your Work''
(Jewish Lights Publishing, $19.95). ``We need to judge ourselves
not by what we do but by the meaning we bring to it,'' says Salkin,
spiritual leader of the Community Synagogue, a 630-family Reform
congregation in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met taxi drivers who believe they have holy jobs because
they are the connective tissue that makes the world go around. They
believe they could be taking someone, if not on a ride, on a
journey, and if not on a journey, on a mission. I've met sanitation
workers who believe their role in life is to keep the world clean.
I've met movers who believe that their role in life is to get
people where they need to be and to help them midwife a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for workers, whatever their work, is to
determine how their values intersect with their jobs, the rabbi
says. ``I ask them to think about the things they most cherish, the
ideals they find holiest, the religious motivations they may have,
and I ask them to discover how their work reflects what they are
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hebrew, the word avodah means both work and worship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a balance between values and work, Justine Toms says
she tries to begin each day with a prayer of gratitude, ``and after
that, to dedicate our day, all my actions and all my words, to the
benefit of something greater than myself.''
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, she founded New Dimensions Radio and New
Dimensions Foundation. They live in rural California.
</P>
<P>
   Her other bits of advice include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tell the truth with kindness. ``Our words affect others in
very deep ways,'' she said. ``If you can't speak the truth with
kindness, then don't speak at all.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't make assumptions, ask questions. Assumptions often lead
people to take things personally that aren't meant that way at all.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask, ``How can I be of help?''
</P>
<P>
   -- Always do your best. ``Have energy and enthusiasm for
wherever you are. You never know where it might lead or who's
watching.''

 &HT;    Labors of Love: Six metro Atlantans who find meaning and passion
on the job

<P>
   EDWARD SEA
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 39
</P>
<P>
   -- Home: Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Married with four children
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: Distribution and window clerk, an Atlanta post office
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Customer Sylvia Schwartz. ``His demeanor, his
willingness to help and his cheerfulness are outstanding. We look
forward to going to the post office now in hopes we will see him.
If he's not there, we're disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: Sea has worked at the post office for
only eight months, but in that time he has made an impression.
``He's one of the best employees I've ever had,'' says his
supervisor, Jackie McLloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Sea, a native of Vienna, Ga., retired from the Air Force, then
opened his own import-export business in El Paso, Texas. The postal
job in Sandy Springs ``was a chance to get back closer to home,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He sorts mail for carriers and works with the public selling
stamps and weighing parcels and letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a people person,'' says Sea. ``We are a service-oriented
business. If I can get you in and out of here efficiently, that's
great. ... If you come into this post office with an attitude, it's
human nature for people to strike back. ... Sometimes it might be
warranted, sometimes it might not be. If two people get into a
confrontation and you both get heated, you're not going to get
anything resolved. If you're not part of the solution, you're part
of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   CHARLEY LINDSEY
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 65
</P>
<P>
   -- Home: Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Married with three children, four grandchildren
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: School bus driver, Fulton County(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Parent Joni Pelta. ``He is terrific. He's
always bright and cheerful, even when it's raining. He conveys a
sense of warmth and appreciation to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: Lindsey, who drives a small group of
special education children to New Prospect Elementary School in
north Fulton County, has two rules on his bus: ``Be careful and be
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   He is in business for himself and first began driving a school
bus five years ago for the health insurance he could get through
the Fulton County school system. He continues to drive because of
the relationship he has with the children. ``The thing about school
bus driving is the kids. That's what makes it addictive. They
appreciate you. They love you,'' he says. ``As long as I can pass
the physical, I'll probably keep driving.''
</P>
<P>
   His first Christmas on the job, a young girl from Haiti wrote
him a note, calling him ``the nicest person'' she had met in her
four years at school. ``All I had done was give her common courtesy
and respect,'' he says. ``I may have driven around the block when
she was late once, but I thought it was amazing that the things we
should all do _ treat people with respect and courtesy _ would draw
that much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving a school bus gives Lindsey ``a sense of community,'' he
says. ``You feel like you're in there contributing with the
policeman, the fireman and the power company people _ the people
who make it work.''

<P>
   -- Family: Married with two children and two grandchildren
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: Assistant, Who's Who Hair Salon in Buckhead
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Co-worker Audrey Faucett. ``Her job as a
shampoo person is as basic as you can get. What she brings to her
profession is a genuine humbleness that will make the most arrogant
person mild. She has a joy in what she does and that is helping
others.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: For 25 years, Heath has worked in
beauty salons, including 11 years at her current salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' she says. ``I like meeting different people, our
clients. I like what I do. I try to be nice to them, try to take
care of the old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath, a Baptist, said her faith and the Bible play a role in
her approach to her job. ``I just treat people the way I want to be
treated.''

   CAROL BROWN
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 49
</P>
<P>
   -- Home: Villa Rica, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Five children, seven grandchildren
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: Office cleaner at Geiger International Furniture
Manufacturers in southwest Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Office employee Cori Harth. ``She has problems
of her own but you would never know it. She's interested in
everyone else. She leaves surprise candy and little smiley faces on
our computers. I'm fighting cancer and she put together the most
thoughtful basket for me you could ever put together. She just has
a way with people. She makes you believe in the goodness of human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: For most of her 10 years at Geiger,
Brown worked in the plant making furniture. About two years ago,
she moved to cleaning the front office from 3:30 p.m. to midnight.
``I'm getting a little older now, and I needed not to maybe lift as
many heavy things as I was in the manufacturing part.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some people might consider janitorial work menial,
Brown says she enjoys it. ``I've always liked cleaning,'' she says.
``I think it's important. I think it's neat for me to look at
something and see that it's as clean as it can be, whether it be
home or here. I think things need to be kind of neat and tidy. It's
a great way to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown expresses a great deal of affection for the workers in the
offices and cubicles she cleans. ``Sometimes, meeting a deadline,
they're really kind of under the gun and working a lot of hours,''
she says. ``Sometimes I can do just a little something, anything,
to say hello and let them know they're appreciated because they
really do work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown credits her parents and her Christian faith for her
outlook. Her parents, she says, ``instilled in me that you really
do need to work in life, that it's not just a free ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Her religion teaches her ``that it's important to be as kind to
people as you possibly can, as in the golden rule,'' she says.
``God has a purpose for everyone. Not everyone can be a rocket
scientist.''

   WANDA WHITE
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 43
</P>
<P>
   -- Home: Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Divorced, two children
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: Receptionist and switchboard operator, WALR radio
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Media representative DeNatalie Phillips. ``She
is definitely a bright light. I am in media relations so I spend a
lot of time with media outlets and I've seen her in different
environments. She is a bright light. Everybody is attracted to her.
People just want to be around her. She's a patient and caring
person.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: ``I try to treat people the same,''
says White, who estimates that she answers as many as 800 telephone
calls a day. ``No one is better than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   White got into radio in 1989 when a temporary agency sent her to
work at WAOK and V-103. She was hired full time and worked at the
stations until 1993, when she left to care for her grandmother,
whose health was failing. She returned in 1995. She took her
present job in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about radio is the fact that it's an arena where
anything can go,'' she says during a conversation constantly
interrupted by telephone calls. ``I ask God every day to intercede
and let me do his will and not mine. ... It gives me a chance to
try to show the realness in the industry. You don't have to be
fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers ask anything and everything, but White says ``there is
no stupid question.'' She tries to be familiar with the station's
public service announcements and programming. ``If I can help a
person from the switchboard and they don't have to go through a
third person, I've done my job,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG'' JOHN GOINES
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 50
</P>
<P>
   -- Home: Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Married, four children
</P>
<P>
   -- Job: Technician, Baranco Pontiac GMC
</P>
<P>
   -- Nominated by: Customer Ann Kimbrough. ``Getting your car
repaired is a pain. It's costly and time consuming. However, 'Big'
John Goines at Baranco Pontiac GMC takes extra care. He gave me an
unusual and welcome feeling of comfort and calmness each and every
time I had my car serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Personal point of view: Goines, who was born on a farm in
Alabama, says he became interested in vehicle repair because of his
father's problems with farm equipment. ``My dad had farm tractors
and trucks,'' he says. ``He would hire people to come out and work
on those things. He would pay a lot of money, but people would come
when they wanted to and wouldn't always do the job right. One of
the things that drove me into being a technician was that I wanted
to help my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Goines has been working on General Motors cars for 26 years, 17
at an Oldsmobile dealership in New Orleans and 11 with Baranco in
metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is always first,'' he says. ``The customer is the
one that keeps this business open and going.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can get angry if a job is not well done and if they
can't get the information they need about the status of their car,
he said. ``I don't have nasty customers,'' he says. ``I don't
promise nothing I can't deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   While Goines' job is important, he says, it is not his first
priority. ``I always put God first, then my family, then my job. If
you take things in that order, it always works out good for you.''

LABOR AND THE LEFT: GETTING COZY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ideas)  
(lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last three decades, two groups that should be obvious
bedfellows _ the labor movement and leftist intellectuals _ have
far more often acted as enemies than as allies.
</P>
<P>
   Close partners throughout the first half of this century, these
two had an ugly breakup in the 1960s over Vietnam, integration and
the vehemence of Cold War anti-communism.
</P>
<P>
   But with the end of the Cold War and with leadership changes in
the house of labor, unions and left-of-center intellectuals have
concluded that they might have a lot in common after all. Eager to
counter the rise of the right and growing corporate dominance of
the economy and culture, labor and the left have attempted a
reconciliation over the last two years. To what degree this
rapprochement will succeed, however, very much remains an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   In candid moments, several intellectuals who have fostered the
reconciliation acknowledge that one of their main goals is to end
their exile from power and the public policy arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, liberal-left thinkers like Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,
John Kenneth Galbraith and Michael Harrington had the White House's
ear, but by the 1980s, the right was clearly winning the war of
ideas as much of its agenda gained acceptance even with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago the AFL-CIO, preoccupied with toppling communism
overseas, added insult to the left's insignificance by allying
itself with neoconservative intellectuals _ the nemesis of labor's
new-found friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way out of the ghetto, out of marginalization, a way
to once again have our ideas taken seriously and to move public
policy and the cultural values of the country in what we think is a
more progressive direction,'' said Steven Fraser, who wrote a
biography of Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers, and was a prime mover in bringing left intellectuals and
labor back together.
</P>
<P>
   These labor-friendly academics, writers and artists often call
themselves social democrats; they include veterans of Students for
a Democratic Society, graduates of the Berkeley Free Speech
Movement and disciples of the socialist leaders Norman Thomas and
Michael Harrington. There is also a smattering of red-diaper babies
and of academics who were pulled left by the civil rights movement
and legendary labor leaders like Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   This pro-labor group first banded together publicly in January
1996, three months after John Sweeney was elected AFL-CIO
president, promising to help lift the poorest workers and to expand
labor's influence and size after decades of decline. Encouraged by
Sweeney's approach, more than 30 prominent intellectuals signed a
letter to the New York Review of Books vowing to support labor's
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   This who's who of left-of-center thinkers and writers included
Paul Berman, Barbara Ehrenreich, Betty Friedan, Henry Louis Gates
Jr., Robert Heilbroner, Jonathan Kozol, Richard Rorty, Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., Cornel West and the late Alfred Kazin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the revitalization of the American labor movement
can fashion a new politics of social solidarity and economic
justice, and reverse the country's descent into the kind of
mean-spirited selfishness that so discolors the contemporary
political scene,'' they wrote. ``It is the most heartening
development in our nation's political life since the heyday of the
civil rights movement a third of a century ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Leftist intellectuals and labor both want a country with less
corporate dominance, with more social protections and with more
democratic participation in government and in the workplace. Both
want American workers to have more security and a fairer share of
the nation's economic wealth, leading both to support universal
health insurance and a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   These writers and university professors have been following a
tradition that dates from organized labor's formative years in the
late 1800s all the way through its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s.
In those years, luminaries like the philosopher John Dewey, the
economist Charles Beard and the novelists Upton Sinclair, Theodore
Dreiser and John Dos Passos wrote books and essays that furthered
labor's cause.
</P>
<P>
   These intellectuals are responding to appeals from Dewey and
Richard Rorty, widely considered the United States' leading living
philosopher and a champion of the labor-left alliance, that
intellectuals are too inward-looking and should not ignore social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1960, if you were on the left, the left was always asking,
`What is the vehicle, to increase power?''' said Nelson
Lichtenstein, a University of Virginia history professor and a
biographer of Walter Reuther, the auto workers' leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and
the civil rights movement were unquestionably the dynamic movement
that one had to orient to. Today, to the extent there's any
movement that has the potential for dynamic possibilities, it's the
labor movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build a social movement, Sweeney has encouraged the
alliance with intellectuals, as well as ones with civil rights
groups, women's organizations and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement needs to win the war of ideas in addition
to other wars that are going on,'' said Robert Welsh, Sweeney's
executive assistant and his liaison with intellectuals. ``The whole
conversation with progressive scholars, writers and artists is
critically important to having a vibrant, outward-looking labor
movement as opposed to an inward-looking, moribund one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some union leaders quietly share the sentiment of
Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor,
who feared that aloof intellectuals, often with a utopian bent,
might be more hindrance than help.
</P>
<P>
   And not surprisingly, the neoconservatives who were labor's
friends a decade ago ridicule the intellectual left as desperate
midgets eager to piggyback on the labor giant so they once again
can be seen and heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a new strategy,'' said Norman Podhoretz, one of the
fathers of neoconservatism. ``What you have is a movement with all
of these warm bodies and a big treasury, and if you're a small
splinter group somewhere on the left, it's not a bad idea to hook
up with a movement like that. I do not believe there is much good
that will come of this alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   For many intellectuals, however, their new embrace of labor
gives them an opportunity to climb down from the ivory tower and
ally their yin with a brawny, powerful yang that they have long
envied from afar.
</P>
<P>
   And while the intellectuals talk repeatedly about how their goal
is to help the less fortunate, a few admit to some self-interest in
forming the alliance. With universities relying increasingly on
low-paid adjuncts to teach classes, many academics say they need to
join arms with labor to prevent their own exploitation.

</P>
<P>
   ``We as academics are increasingly under attack and are
experiencing many of the same problems that workers are, workers
who are paid much less than we are,'' said Daniel Clawson, a
sociology professor at Smith College. ``It's difficult to see how
we can solve our problems without alliances and support. If we talk
about part-time and contingent workers, it's not only UPS and the
Teamsters. It's what's happening in the universities.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the most tangible fruits of the alliance have been two
dozen teach-ins at universities around the country. There, scholars
and union leaders have dissected and denounced stagnating wages,
growing corporate might, globalization's squeeze on workers and
management's offensive against unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain at these teach-ins is that something is badly
awry in this richest of nations when millions of full-time workers
remain caught below the poverty line, and the percentage of workers
without health insurance and pensions is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teach-ins make labor issues more salient in the minds of
students,'' said Eric Foner, a Columbia University history
professor who was master of ceremonies at the first labor teach-in,
a standing-room-only affair at Columbia in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students here have never met a member of a labor union
except the person who cleans up on campus. These are students
coming from rather privileged backgrounds, and it's important for
them to be exposed to some of the reasons why the labor movement is
so vital.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the teach-ins, the alliance has helped funnel hundreds
of students into the labor movement to work as organizers. These
intellectuals have formed an organization: Scholars, Artists and
Writers for Social Justice, with 1,500 members and an acronym
pronounced ``sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has encouraged members to write pro-labor Op-Ed pieces
and has pulled scores of pro-union academics together at the annual
meetings of the nation's sociologists and political scientists.
</P>
<P>
   This alliance has not taken the world by storm, however, as the
left (intellectual and otherwise) continues to languish and labor
remains far less potent than a half-century ago when John L. Lewis,
the thundering president of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations, was as well known as Bill Gates is today.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the movers behind the alliance, like Fraser and
Foner, voice disappointment that the partnership has not captured
the nation's attention and that labor has still not climbed back
onto center stage in politics and social policy. Their goal is to
make labor as vocal and powerful as it was a half-century ago, but
with unions representing 14 percent of all workers, down from 35
percent, that will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and their intellectual friends also face an uphill battle
because globalization and the Gingrich revolution have repeatedly
thrown unions on the defensive. In addition, the campaign-finance
scandal in the Teamsters and other eruptions of union corruption
have tarred unions badly just as they are trying to win more
members and public backing.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Bell, the Harvard sociologist and longtime student of
unions, said he doubted the labor-left alliance would amount to
much. ``For the intellectuals, it's a lot of wishful thinking. I
don't mean that in an invidious way,'' he said. ``The real test
will be whether labor has the ability to expand its numbers. Simply
becoming more rhetorical and becoming more active politically is
not in and of itself enough.''

GO SLOW ON PRIVATIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Sept. 8)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No investor likes to see the stock market tumble
into the cellar, but the terrifying turmoil on Wall Street these
past week may have done the nation an unanticipated favor.
</P>
<P>
   It sent a powerful warning to Congress to put a cork in all that
bubbly enthusiasm for privatizing Social Security by getting
workers to invest the tax money that now goes to the federal system
into private stock portfolios instead.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security financing will be overstretched in 15 years,
when the baby boomer generation retires. There has been a great
deal of scare talk about the drastic reductions in benefits that
will result unless dramatic reforms are made in the system.
</P>
<P>
   But Social Security comes with a government promise of
permanency that Americans are accustomed to rely on. Social
Security now pledges a specified benefit to 44 million elderly and
disabled citizens, creating a fundamental base of family stability
that makes a peaceful democracy possible.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the politicians will fix the threatened insolvency
within the federal system because they will have to do so or lose
their jobs. The elderly, unlike the young, vote in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to increase taxes or slash benefits, Congress has been
flirting with the notion of throwing the old folks into the free
market. In part this seemed desirable because Wall Street was
enjoying a long, successful run, climbing an average of 10 percent
a year over the past century. Conservatives have always opposed the
concept of Social Security anyway, but the current argument has
been that retirees would be better off depending on stocks than an
always-overburdened federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The falling stock market, however, had the shock value of a cold
shower. While the federal government is ultimately accountable to
the voters, Wall Street is not accountable to anyone. Investments
made in Wall Street can be risky, particularly for elderly people
unfamiliar with stocks and vulnerable to bad financial advice from
inept brokers.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Social Security system had been privatized and
retirees were forced to watch their pensions collapse last week as
the market went into a tailspin? The plunge on Aug. 31 wiped out
more than $2.3 trillion (that's with a t) in market wealth since
the Dow peaked in July. And lots more was lost over the following
week as stocks went up and down, but mostly down.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the panic of old folks when they realized they would
have to live on a mere fraction of what they had anticipated. How
could they pay their bills?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the horror of middle-aged children suddenly facing the
prospect of supporting penniless parents they had thought were
independent. The younger generation has its own bills.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the drop in income of employees of stores, cruise lines
and beauty salons that depend on spending by elderly couples with
both leisure and financial flexibility. They have bills too.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market may recover, or it may not. Even if it does,
the psychological jolt to elderly hearts is unnecessary and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   We have just had an object lesson in the fact that pensions are
one area in which experimenting with privatization is politically
and socially dangerous. Whether it would be a fully private system
in which beneficiaries make their own investment decisions or a
combination of government and private accounts, this is a bad idea
whose time has not come. And hopefully will never come.
</P>
<P>
   Many pension plans are invested in mutual funds, equities,
stocks and other securities. But the decisions are made by experts
who are responsible for balancing profit and risk and monitoring
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Telling the elderly they are on their own in the puzzling
financial wilderness that is the stock market is quite another
thing. It is not realistic to expect many of them to master the
nuances of when and what to buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street collapse also sent another message about the
importance of protecting individual pension plans from the whims of
the entwined international markets.
</P>
<P>
   It confirmed the political wisdom of President Clinton's veto
three years ago of a Republican measure that would have allowed
corporations to withdraw ``surplus'' money from their workers'
pension plans for any purpose they pleased, including raising
executive salaries. In his 1996 State of the Union address, Clinton
pledged to veto this heartless, reckless scheme a second time
should it reappear. It has not.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted ``surplus'' represents the value of pension funds
invested in mutual and other funds above the necessary amount
estimated to meet retiree needs. That's fine when the market is
high. But when the market goes south, the ``surplus'' is lost _ and
is unrecoverable if previously frittered away for some other
corporate purpose. Either the retirees are out of luck or the
taxpayers must make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Safe pensions, whether Social Security or private corporate
funds accumulated from deferred wages, are essential to the
well-being of the nation. And tying them too closely to the
vagaries of the stock market is not the way to secure their future.

ILA BORDERS: A PITCHER WHO'S IN A LEAGUE OF HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By NEAL KARLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While pampered millionaire ballplayers chased home-run records
this summer, much of the Upper Midwest was enthralled by a 5-foot,
8-inch, 140-pound pitcher with a shoulder-length ponytail and a
uniform that read ``Duluth.'' Playing for about $1,000 a month, Ila
Borders, the first woman ever to make the roster of a men's
professional baseball team, electrified this chilly Minnesota town
on Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in a minor league several light-years removed in pay
and perks from what players call ``the Show'' _ the major leagues _
Ms. Borders, 23, proved to be a phenom just the same against teams
like the Sioux Falls Canaries and the Fargo Redhawks. Fans greet
her with the kind of outgoing warmth remarkable for a Midwestern
populace akin to the staid citizens of Garrison Keillor's Lake
Wobegone.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Ms. Borders played in the seven other towns, in
addition to Duluth, that make up the Northern League, her mere
warm-up pitches were met by thousands chanting ``I-la, I-la,
I-la.'' When she took the pitching mound, she was greeted by
standing ovations and public-address systems blaring the Doors'
``Don't You Love Her Madly?'' or Roy Orbison's ``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity was due not just to the fact that she is, as S.J.
Perelman would have put it, ``button cute.'' Ms. Borders can
actually pitch. ``It still gives me chicken skin when I hear
everybody cheering me on like that,'' she said Wednesday in Duluth,
before the final game of the season. ``But I wouldn't be here if I
didn't think I could make it all the way. I've known since I was 10
I wanted to play in the major leagues, and this is no publicity
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked hard to tamp down the hype. She turned down two
offers to appear on ``The Tonight Show,'' as well as guest shots
with David Letterman and Rosie O'Donnell. Although Ms. Borders
agreed to be featured on ``60 Minutes,'' she ignored Mike Wallace
after he had the temerity to approach her in the Duluth locker room
last month after she'd already put on her game face shortly before
taking the mound against the Sioux City Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at me,'' Wallace recounted for The Duluth News
Tribune , ``like I was a hair in her soup.'' He stayed an extra day
and got his interview when Ms. Borders wasn't scheduled to pitch
(the segment is due to be telecast around World Series time.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borders hasn't always been so popular. The only girl playing
Little League baseball in La Habra, Calif., she was routinely
plunked in the head when she came to bat. In junior high school,
she sued to play baseball on the boys' team. Playing for Southern
California College, where she was the first woman to receive a
baseball scholarship _ there or at any other college _ she once had
another woman come after her with a knife because Ms. Borders had
struck out her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Moss, a coach for the St. Paul Saints of the Northern
League, discovered her. Invited to try out for the Saints in 1997,
she made the team, taking the last available pitcher's slot. After
a few rocky outings, she was traded within the league by the
first-place Saints to the last-place Duluth Dukes. There, the
rookie could work on her pitching while escaping the media
microscope in the league's largest city. Pitching 15 games, she
finished last season with no wins and no losses, a statistical
ghost. But Duluth came back at midseason and went on to win the
league championship. During the playoffs Ms. Borders pitched a key
scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were pitchers with worse statistics,'' she said. ``I
wasn't embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was her team. ``I wanted her back for 1998,'' said Jim
Wadley, the owner of the Duluth Dukes who has a daughter who
wrestled on her high school's boys' team. ``Ila's rookie season was
really just an extended spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borders returned to Duluth last May to find the city had
taken her to its heart. True, she still had to put on her uniform
before the games and to shower after them at the home where she
boards near the stadium. And she still had to yell
``Housekeeping!'' as a put-your-pants-on warning before entering
her own team's locker room. But there has been no whining. ``My
teammates have all been great,'' she said. ``You're not going to
hear me complain about anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been true of everyone in the league. This season,
Ms. Borders pitched six scoreless innings against Sioux Falls,
becoming the first woman ever to win a game in a professional men's
league. Even so, Sioux City's manager complained on the radio that
Ms. Borders shouldn't be playing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Talk reached Duluth's front office that Fargo's manager might
forfeit the game if his team had to face Ms. Borders, a Dukes
spokesman said. The manager didn't forfeit, and Ms. Borders
silenced the critics by pitching six shutout innings in Fargo,
giving up only four hits before leaving with a 2-0 lead. (The Dukes
eventually lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Few others in the league seemed to have problems. Even the St.
Paul Saints, who had exiled her to Duluth in 1997, printed a
pagelong ode to Ms. Borders in their 1998 yearbook. It included
these lines:
</P>
<P>
   On the heads of the thousands of baseball-capped girls
</P>
<P>
   a new style had begun
</P>
<P>
   not driven by Saks or Fifth Avenue sales
</P>
<P>
   but by Ila.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as she prepared for her final start by stretching in
the Duluth outfield, dozens of children hung over the fence, as
many boys as girls, proffering baseballs for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ila is so cool,'' said Mike Lewis, 9, watching her bend like
Gumby. ``She's the best pitcher on the Dukes, and she's so nice. I
got my picture taken with her, and she autographed it, and then she
said she'd like a copy of the photo, which I got to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd behind the fence cheered each of their heroine's
stretches. ``Ila is my favorite, no question, because she shows you
can just do it,'' said Dradasha Wittmay, 13, her own ponytail
flowing out from a baseball cap in what she called ``Ila style.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ms. Borders was on the mound, where she put in five
innings, giving up a reasonable three runs against Thunder Bay.
Along the way, she was cheered like a benevolent queen from the
crowd shoehorned into Wade Stadium, a bucolic 4,000-seat brick
ballpark built by the WPA.
</P>
<P>
   There was joy in her steps as she raced back to the dugout after
her last performance of the year, receiving a standing ovation. Her
final statistics: one win, four losses. Not great, but not
horrific, either. She expects her quest for a major league start to
take years. Wadley, the team owner, said he would pick up her
contract for next year. He also pooh-poohs any notion that Ila
Borders is an excuse worthy of P.T. just to get 'em into the tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ila is going to make the big leagues,'' Wadley said. ``She's
going to be like Jackie Robinson being the first black man to play
in the majors, or Chuck Yeager being the first to break the sound
barrier. She'll be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that her second season is over, Ms. Borders is anxious for
the next one. ``This is no joke,'' she said. ``I don't want to live
my life as someone's idea of a stunt. I'm here on my road to making
the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the parking lot, the children waited until after the game
for their heroine, still in uniform, to emerge from the stadium and
sign, smile and talk. And she stayed until the last child went
home.

TEXAS HARVESTERS URGE PROBE OF BALLAST WATER AS SOURCE IN TAINTED
OYSTER OUTBREAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 6) 
 
By CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ About four years ago, after detecting cholera bacteria
in oysters from Alabama's Mobile Bay, scientists traced it to water
dumped from ships that had been to Peru, where a major outbreak had
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar instance, the U.S. Coast Guard in 1990 issued an
order barring ships from emptying water from their ballast tanks
into the Great Lakes. The ban came in response to an infestation of
zebra mussels that had caused problems for decades _ clogging water
intake pipes, nearly destroying the native clam population and
costing the area economy billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That outbreak, too, was linked to ballast water that had been
taken on in foreign ports to stabilize ships and then dumped in
U.S. waters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Texas oyster harvesters want an investigation into whether
the bacteria that made 419 people ill this summer from eating raw
Galveston Bay oysters might also have come from water discharged
from ships.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration marine biologist Dr. George
Hofkin, who is studying the Texas outbreak, believes such a
connection is a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specific strain of bacteria that made people ill has never
before been detected in Galveston Bay, but it is common in Japan,
India and Taiwan,'' Hofkin said. ``It is something that needs to be
looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   New technology, including the ability to type genes, has made
the bacteria trails easier to follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galveston Bay outbreak, which set a national record, was
first traced to ``Vibrio parahaemolyticus'' _ a bacterium that
occurs naturally in all waters of the world _ and then narrowed
down to a specific virulent strain called ``03:K6,'' which never
before had been detected in U.S. waters but is common in Southeast
Asian waters.
</P>
<P>
   The strain was the only type of ``Vibrio'' confirmed in those
who became ill from eating raw oysters from Galveston Bay, said Dr.
Bruce Elliott, who heads the state's microbiology lab in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bay was closed to harvesting more than two months ago
because of the outbreak, authorities have not been able to find any
sign of this strain in oyster samples taken from the bay. Federal
and state officials are testing an additional 90 samples. If no
contaminants are found, harvesting may resume within about a week.
</P>
<P>
   The impact from the outbreak has been devastating, and the
question remains as to what caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did 419 people from 10 states become ill with flulike
symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and headaches after eating the
raw oysters, but the outbreak also has pushed Texas' $33 million
oyster industry to the brink of financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's on the verge of bankruptcy. This has halted a
complete industry. It's a disaster,'' said Lisa Halili, who with
her husband, Johnny, employs 300 people at their oyster processing
business in San Leon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crippled us so badly that we're not sure we'll ever
recover because of all the bad publicity that is giving the Texas
oyster an undeserved black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been felt nationwide, because more than half of
the oysters eaten raw in this country come from Texas, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what frustrates oyster harvesters most is that if the
bacteria tainting their oysters came from ships' ballast water,
safety precautions might have prevented the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real selfish for someone to cause this much misery for
someone else,'' said Halili, who chairs the Gulf Oyster Industry
Council. ``Something needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are voicing a growing concern that ballast water may
be providing a pathway for exotic species to be introduced into
areas where they never have been, thus upsetting the ecological
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming a big international issue,'' said Bob Peoples,
executive secretary of a federal task force set up in 1990 to
prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous marine
species. ``Sometimes it takes just the right window of opportunity
for these new species to become viable. They may have been
repeatedly introduced until the temperature and salinity conditions
are just right for them to take hold.''
</P>
<P>
   A drought and unusually high temperatures increased the salinity
in Galveston Bay this year, creating ideal conditions in which the
``03:K6'' strain thrives, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples said the cholera detected about four years ago in Mobile
Bay oysters temporarily baffled the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hofkin, the FDA marine biologist, was aware of a cholera
outbreak in South America so he decided to sample the ballast water
from ships that were coming in from areas where cholera had been
reported. He said researchers found the bacteria in the ballast
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved the route,'' Hofkin said. ``Luckily, it went away as
fast as it came, without anybody getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Lakes, the introduction of the zebra mussel did
take a toll, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists first warned about the zebra trouble in the
1920s,'' said Lt. Pat McKeown of Coast Guard's environmental
standards department in Washington, D.C. ``But it didn't create a
breeding problem until the 1980s. This mussel attaches itself to
things and must now be constantly scraped from water supply pipes.
It has also consumed much of the food and made it difficult to find
native clams that are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   After much research, the Coast Guard adopted the 1990
requirement that ships bound for the Great Lakes dump at least 85
percent of their ballast water and replace it with water from the
open seas _ at least 200 miles from shore and 2,000 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of metric tons of water can be carried in the
ballasts of one vessel, noted a Coast Guard report.
</P>
<P>
   ``By exchanging its ballast water while at sea, exotic organisms
from other ports-of-call will be replaced with ocean organisms used
to high salinity that usually can't cross into coastal areas and
survive,'' McKeown said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Maritime Organization also recommends this
water exchange system, but it does not require it, said McKeown and
Peoples.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Coast Guard wants more information about ballast
water and is considering a mandatory reporting rule to see how many
ships are complying with the voluntary rule and where each ship's
ballast water originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received pages and pages of comments on this proposed
rule. Now we are reviewing and evaluating them,'' McKeown said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peoples' task force is working to revise maritime
regulations to make the water exchange mandatory, but the earliest
effective date would be in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exchange will help, but it is not a foolproof system that
will eliminate the problem 100 percent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Maritime officials also are seeking alternatives to rid ballast
water of organisms, such as using filtration systems, ultraviolet
light or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time to determine what caused the Galveston
Bay outbreak, said the Texas Department of Health's seafood safety
spokesman, Kirk Wiles of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that that bacterial strain is a common
seafood contaminant in Southeast Asia, where thousands contract the
flulike symptoms each year, Wiles said scientists may never know
for sure whether the Galveston Bay bug came from there.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 -- The following chart shows how senators voted
on key bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 87 to 3, an $8.45 billion spending
bill for military construction projects. Allocating funds for
housing and construction projects and costs associated with base
closings, the bill falls $760 million below last year's version.
Supporters said the bill sufficiently addresses the needs of
military bases. Opponents said the bill was loaded down with
unnecessary ``pork'' items. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TREATY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 49 to 44, a bill that would
provide $29 million to fund a commission that would oversee
compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which bans the
testing of nuclear weapons. Although the bill passed, the close
vote indicates the treaty may not gain the two-thirds support
needed for ratification by the United States. Supporters said it is
in the security interest of the nation to support funding for the
treaty. Opponents said it was premature to fund the treaty before
it had been internationally ratified. A ``yes'' vote favors funding
the treaty commission.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, 91 to 5, a $29.9 billion spending
bill for the Treasury Department, Executive Office of the President
and U.S. Postal Service. Debate of the bill was halted in July due
to controversy surrounding a Republican amendment that would have
limited the terms of the staff director and general counsel for the
Federal Elections Commission. Under a compromise, the terms of the
current staff director and general counsel are not limited, but
future service is set at six years. Supporters said the spending
bill meets the needs of the Treasury Department and other related
agencies. No one rose in opposition to the bill. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

WHY MANY MUSICIANS WISH THEY PLAYED THE PICCOLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon Gottlieb laid out the Polaroid shots of the massive daiko
drums he bought in Japan while touring Asia with the New York
Philharmonic in July and rattled off their dimensions: The drums
are 29 inches long and 90 inches in circumference with heads that
are 24 inches across. Each was hand-crafted from a single piece of
wood and took up to four years to make.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb is nearly as famous for his international collection of
instruments as for his technical prowess as a percussionist. And
his latest additions, the gleaming drums, sat safely in his Chelsea
loft, having moved through Kennedy Airport without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this easy.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, after performing in Brazil, Gottlieb stood at the
same airport, 15 fiberglass cases in a heap by his side, as he
waited in vain for the cartage company he'd hired to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   First he got angry. Then he got serious. Somehow he hauled the
cases out of the terminal and persuaded two taxis to drive in
tandem back to his loft, the cases piled high in their front and
back seats, tied into their trunks and strapped to their roofs. He
rode in the first and prayed the second would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was desperate,'' he remembered. ``Here I was, stranded with
an army's worth of valuable stuff, in bad shape, and with no one to
get me out of the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the years of training, the hours of rehearsals, the
nightly performances and even the stage fright. For thousands of
musicians who, like Gottlieb, play instruments larger than a
piccolo, just getting there is more than half the battle. And in
summer, when musicians crisscross the continent _ and sometimes the
world _ on the festival circuit, the living is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the professionals come in: the travel agents and
cartage companies and production managers who get their clients,
and their clients' equipment, to their destinations and home again.
</P>
<P>
   After his fiasco, Gottlieb turned to Gary Boxer, the owner of
Sound Moves LLC, a Manhattan company dedicated solely to
transporting equipment for musicians and recording studios. Boxer
counts among his ``few hundred'' clients the percussionist Jack
DeJohnette, the saxophonist Michael Brecker and the pop singer
James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Needs vary, from the special dolly required to transport a harp,
to the coffinlike container custom designed to hold a bass
saxophone, to ``holding pens'' for equipment too large to haul in
and out of pint-size apartments. But the goal is the same: getting
the client from point A to point B with minimum hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Large ensembles may have it the easiest, relying on production
managers to handle the logistics of transporting instruments,
equipment and even wardrobes. Hank McHugh, the production manager
for the Dave Matthews Band, has moved the group among some 100
sites since April. A veteran of 23 years with performers like Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers, Hall and Oates, and Bob Dylan, McHugh
approaches his job with assured nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   He oversees the contents of six 48-foot-long trucks, part of a
caravan that also includes six buses for the five band members, 21
crew members and 12 drivers. Each morning by 7, McHugh and his team
plot the layout for a new stage, keeping it as similar as possible
to the last one. At 8, they begin a four-hour ordeal of unloading
trucks packed with instruments, lighting, sound equipment and
speakers, and making repairs to anything that is broken in the
process. They also set up the band's opening act.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, the crew takes it all back down, in a mere 90
minutes. ``It's amazing how things come apart more quickly when
you're thinking about going to sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every instrument can withstand the conditions in an airplane
baggage hold. Most string instruments, made of tender, aged wood,
fly in the cabin with their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Salm, the cellist with the Raphael Trio, knows the
intricacies of moving her instrument across continents and oceans
perhaps a bit too well. In addition to shuttling among apartments
in New York, Venice and Vienna this summer, she performed at
festivals ranging from Juneau Classics and Jazz in Alaska to Music
in Ouray in Colorado, where the trio is the ensemble in residence,
to the Chenango Festival in Hamilton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salm works with Jean Furukawa at VTS Travel in Manhattan,
who first makes sure that an appropriate plane _ and seat _ is
found to transport the musician and her cello. (Not all planes are
suitable because of the variations in the distance between the
seats and the overhead compartments. And cellos must almost always
rest in a window seat in a bulkhead row.)
</P>
<P>
   In her student days, she could often talk the cello's way on
board, Ms. Salm said. But today she buys a full-fare ticket for her
instrument. When she travels as part of an ensemble, her colleagues
share the cost. Frequent-flier miles earned by the cello may not be
honored by the airline. After the security check, Ms. Salm carries
her cello on board, where it is strapped into a seat using a
seatbelt extension. Some airlines, like British Airways, require
that a trained specialist do the strapping.
</P>
<P>
   War stories abound, from the amusing (in retrospect) to the
unnerving (like the time she was booked on a flight but her cello
was booked on standby).
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, there was a real horror story. Returning to
New York from London, her cello already ticketed, Ms. Salm was
informed that the plane was completely full and despite the cello's
fully paid ticket, the instrument was being bumped for a human
passenger. The cello would be relegated to the baggage hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a choice,'' she remembered. The airline promised
that the cello would be hand carried on and off the plane. At
Kennedy Airport, she claimed her suitcase and waited for the cello
at the designated rendezvous. And waited. ``Finally, three people
came over and said: `Aren't you Susan Salm? We don't know how to
tell you this, but there's no cello on that plane.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told them the value of the instrument they had just
lost, they freaked, maybe even more than I had.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the airline found Ms. Salm's Marconcini cello, made
in Ferrara, Italy, in the 1700s and worth about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with instruments ``never becomes a joy,'' said Rose
Hirschel, the owner of Musicians' Travel Services, a Manhattan
company that has specialized in making arrangements for musicians
for 15 years. Insurance is necessary, since airlines are not
responsible for damage to instruments, she said. ``My experience
has been that airline employees are not so much impressed about the
value of an instrument but rather the age.''
</P>
<P>
   New Federal Aviation Agency guidelines for carry-on baggage,
implemented on April 15, have also adversely affected musicians
like violinists, who normally stow their instruments in overhead
compartments. A violin case now falls outside these new size
guidelines. But it's often the woodwind players who have the
hardest time clearing security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the intricacies of the mechanism in a
wind instrument _ the rods and keys _ that are more likely to
arouse suspicion,'' said Ms. Hirschel. ``That and oboe players, who
travel with reed tools. They have all sorts of curious ways of
getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   To a security agent, those tools, with which oboists make the
reeds for their instruments, can look like an arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use knives, files and screw drivers,'' said Bert Lucarelli,
who taught an oboe seminar this summer at Music Mountain in Falls
Village, Conn., and performed at the Festivalde Artes de Itu in
Brazil. ``When I think of it, I'm smart and put it in my luggage.
When I forget about it, that's another story entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Lucarelli forgot, he was playing in London. After
much debate with customs officials, he finally persuaded them to
give his tools to the pilot, who carried them back to New York. ``I
played oboe for them when we landed because they couldn't believe
this had anything to do with my instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass saxophones are perhaps the most difficult instruments to
ship, Ms. Hirschel said, because their cases resemble small
coffins. And though the instruments ride in the cargo hold, ``it
still requires a certain type of charm to get the case under the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Giordano has perfected that charm. The freelance musician
and former leader of Vince Giordano's Nighthawks, a big band that
has serenaded society functions ranging from the wedding of Steven
Spielberg and Kate Capshaw to President Clinton's Inaugural ball,
plays perhaps the most unwieldly trio of instruments imaginable: a
bass saxophone, a string bass and a tuba. For him, ``traveling has
always been a crazy adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the adventure was trying to get cases that
would withstand the abuse of airline baggage handlers, one of whom
once threw a case with such force that the wheels penetrated the
shell and damaged his gold-plated, antique saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a metal shop, which riveted large sheets of
one-eighth-inch-thick aluminum to the case, increasing its weight
to 122 pounds with the horn inside, making it virtually ``airline
proof,'' he said. But then a new FAA regulation banned oversize
cargo on commercial airplanes. Giordano would now have to ship his
saxophone on a cargo plane, adding a day on each side of the trip
to make sure the instrument was there when he landed. The cost:
$120 each way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all leads to the joke, `You should have taken up the
flute,''' he sighed. ``I wish I had a quarter for every time I
heard that because I'd be able to pay all my excess baggage
costs.''
</P>

   IRELAND-CLINTON _ DUBLIN, Ireland _ President Clinton turned
today from the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's
thriving economy, holding it up as the prize of peace. ``I hope
that success will whet your appetite for working together,'' the
president said. Ireland, with the highest economic growth rate of
any country in Europe, is a ``truly astonishing'' model for other
nations, Clinton said at a reception for Ireland's business and
political leaders at the Royal College of Surgeons. Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and his role in
brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out to Northern
Ireland the same promise of prosperity. (Roughton, Cox News

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin offered up his economic crisis plan Friday, saying he

Although Chernomyrdin's crisi plan would supposedly strengthen the

President Clinton made tanatmount to Russia receiving Western aid.

wealthiest men in Russia, and among the closest to the Kremlin
inner circle that surrounds President Boris Yeltsin. He is believed
to have engineered the re-appearance of Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
publicly stated this week that Yeltsin should resign if a strong
government cannot be formed soon. A look at Berezovsky and the
other so-called oligarchs, who many believe are Russia's real

   KUWAIT-IRAQ-$ADV05 _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait Billboards in this

to forget their POWs -- the more than 600 thought to be held in
Iraq. A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like
incongruous war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile
city. And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight
from Iraqi occupation. Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond
the border of their two countries, posing a constant threat. And,
they closely followed recent reports that the United States is
allegedly changing its strategy for keeping Hussein in check. But
they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the deserts
protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the 740,000
Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers -- are just
tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises. (Kaplow, Cox News

   CLINTON-DEMOCRATS _ WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope that President
Clinton's reputation won't hurt his efforts to raise $18 million in
big contributions at ``unity events'' in August through October.
They're depending on him to help offset similar efforts by the
Republican party. The chief House GOP fund-raiser, Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, says the GOP has already raised more than $17 millio
toward its goal of $37 million in big gifts during the same period.
Both parties are getting a lot of those funds from favor-seekers
giving the kind of ``soft-money'' contributions that would be
outlawed under a campaign finance bill that Sens. McCain and
Feingold promise to bring to the Senate floor for a vote between
Monday Sept. 7 and Friday Sept. 11. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

his opponent's in hand before the last runoff. A supporter of the

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tropical moisture will continue to invade the Southwest on
Saturday as a sluggish low pressure system several thousand feet
above southern California draws humid air northward from Mexico and
the Gulf of California. Scattered showers and thunderstorms, some
heavy, will develop across parts of southern and western New
Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and California. Storms are more
likely to form over or near mountains, particularly those that
receive at least some partial sunshine, which will, in turn,
destabilize the atmosphere. Flash flooding is likely in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a surge of hot air will trespass into the upper
Middle West ahead of a cool front dipping down from Canada.
Isolated showers and thundershowers may develop along the front in
parts of upper Michigan, Wisconsin and northern Minnesota later
Saturday. Only a few storms are expected to develop, however,
because very warm air a few thousand feet above the ground will act
like a lid to suppress the growth of cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of valley fog will veil the river and mountain valleys
of the Northeast on Saturday morning. Once fog dissipates, abundant
sunshine will boost afternoon temperatures toward or slightly above
seasonal levels. A warming trend will continue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will flare across parts of
southern Florida on Saturday as prevailing winds from the
east-southeast continue to import tropical moisture. Farther north,
hot weather will build across the Southeast and Gulf Coast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hottest Day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mercury soared to 107 degrees Thursday afternoon at the Will
Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, officially marking the
city's highest temperature ever recorded in September. Despite the
widely publicized heat wave across the Plains this summer, Thursday
staked a claim as the hottest day of 1998, matching the extreme
heat on July 26 and August 2. The all-time September record was
wind-aided. A ribbon of southwesterly winds was warmed upon descent
from the Rockies, boosting temperatures several degrees to the
unprecedented September reading. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Like many other investors, Allen Page, 31, a packaging salesman
in Pasadena, Calif., had a bad week last week. But if not for his
cellular phone, his laptop, his Internet account and his pager-like
device that receives stock prices, it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding his portable electronic arsenal, Page was able to limit
the damage by exercising options on beaten-down stocks, sometimes
trading from the shoulder of the freeway between sales calls with
his laptop plugged into his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Page is part of a rapidly swelling contingent of investors who
keep an open line to their financial position as they go about
their daily lives. He is in a position to know: ``Sixty percent of
my customers are hooked up on the Internet, and I can walk in the
office and ask them the price of a stock and they'll tell me what
it is,'' he said. ``It's scary. It wasn't like that a year and a
half ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Most investors who track the movements of their stocks on the
Internet _ about three million now have on-line brokerage accounts
_ are enthusiastic about the virtues of expanded access to
information. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But in a time of market volatility, some on-line investors
warn that such close contact with the ups and downs of a portfolio
can have an emotional effect that is not always beneficial to
strategic reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are on line trade more often than those who are
not, for example. According to E-Trade, the on-line brokerage firm,
its customers average 25 trades a year, far more than the typical
customer of a full-commission brokerage firm, who trades once or
twice a year, or customers of a discount brokerage firm who trade
four to six times a year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Part of the reason is that on-line brokerage firms typically
charge much lower commissions than traditional ones, a feature that
would naturally attract more active traders.
</P>
<P>
   But even for investors who trade through human brokers,
monitoring a stock in real time on line can induce decisions more
hasty than wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something about watching it live, where you feel
an immediacy and an urgency to do something, more than if you came
home at the end of the day and looked at it in the paper,'' said
Jeffrey Mitchell, 38, who has lost money by not waiting an extra
hour to see what happened to a stock. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Mitchell, of Westport, Conn., runs a software company and
calls his broker when he sees opportunities on line.
 &UR;  &LR; In addition to hair-trigger trading, the Internet offers investors
another double-edged sword: on-line discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``tips'' posted on line have been exposed as erroneous or
even fraudulent. But there is a subtler danger: the psychological
attachment, or aversion, an investor can develop for a stock that
is the subject of debate on financial World Wide Web sites like
Silicon Investor or The Motley Fool.
</P>
<P>
   Posting a comment about a stock puts personal credibility and
pride on the line, not just money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy a stock and talk about it on Silicon Investor, it
becomes more than just a stock,'' Mitchell said. ``You become
polarized on the Internet, and then you feel, by selling or
shorting, you are giving in to the dark side.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mitchell and others said they found that on-line
discussions bolstered their confidence about investment choices.
And soaking in the rhythm of the market through cyberspace clearly
gives individual investors new ways to participate directly in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Levinson, the president of E-Trade, attributed some of the
intraday volatility seen in the market early last week to the
ability of on-line investors to react swiftly to the market's
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that consumers can get information so readily, they can
take advantage of a downward movement and buy into it, or an upward
movement and sell into it,'' Ms. Levinson said. ``There's more
confidence and comfort when you can see your stock and watch it
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool, one of the oldest
investment sites on the Internet, said that the more information
individual investors had access to, the better off they were, even
if they lost some money along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can misuse their freedom,'' Gardner said. ``But the
long-term benefit of knowing this stuff, having information, being
able to ask questions far outweighs the effect of a person who sees
they're down 12 percent and makes a foolish decision.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investors appear to be climbing a learning curve. Dr.
Jacob Snyder, 39, who lives in Kotzebue, Alaska, said his strategy
had evolved since he opened an on-line brokerage account with
Charles Schwab three years ago and began participating in
discussion groups on Silicon Investor.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that no one in his town of 2,000 was interested in
talking with him face to face about the merits of Intel or Applied
Materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of last year I discovered that I had a lot of
short-term gains and short-term losses that exactly balanced out,''
Snyder said. ``I decided I was acting too quickly. So I've forced
myself to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, last Monday, as he listened to the news of the market
slide while traveling to visit his brother on Washington's Olympic
Peninsula, Snyder was eager to log on to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had bought myself a bunch of shorts to hedge my position,''
he said, meaning that he had protected himself against falling
prices by selling borrowed shares of some stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as soon as I arrived, I signed on.'' He then took advantage
of the market's dive to close his position profitably.

inner circle that surrounds President Boris Yeltsin. He is believed
to have engineered the re-appearance of Viktor Chernomyrdin, and

modern, rebuilt capital warn the people of this oil-rich nation not
to forget their POWs -- the more than 600 thought to be held in
Iraq. A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like
incongruous war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile
city. And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight
from Iraqi occupation. Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond
the border of their two countries, posing a constant threat. And,
they closely followed recent reports that the United States is
allegedly changing its strategy for keeping Hussein in check. But
they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the deserts
protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the 740,000
Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers -- are just
tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises. (Kaplow, Cox News

They're depending on him to help offset similar efforts by the
Republican party. The chief House GOP fund-raiser, Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, says the GOP has already raised more than $17 millio
toward its goal of $37 million in big gifts during the same period.
Both parties are getting a lot of those funds from favor-seekers

WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 -- The following chart shows how senators voted
on key bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 87 to 3, an $8.45 billion spending
bill for military construction projects. Allocating funds for
housing and construction projects and costs associated with base
closings, the bill falls $760 million below last year's version.
Supporters said the bill sufficiently addresses the needs of
military bases. Opponents said the bill was loaded down with
unnecessary ``pork'' items. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TREATY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 49 to 44, a bill that would
provide $29 million to fund a commission that would oversee
compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which bans the
testing of nuclear weapons. Although the bill passed, the close
vote indicates the treaty may not gain the two-thirds support
needed for ratification by the United States. Supporters said it is
in the security interest of the nation to support funding for the
treaty. Opponents said it was premature to fund the treaty before
it had been internationally ratified. A ``yes'' vote favors funding
the treaty commission.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, 91 to 5, a $29.9 billion spending
bill for the Treasury Department, Executive Office of the President
and U.S. Postal Service. Debate of the bill was halted in July due
to controversy surrounding a Republican amendment that would have
limited the terms of the staff director and general counsel for the
Federal Elections Commission. Under a compromise, the terms of the
current staff director and general counsel are not limited, but
future service is set at six years. Supporters said the spending
bill meets the needs of the Treasury Department and other related
agencies. No one rose in opposition to the bill. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN CALLS FOR ``ECONOMIC DICTATORSHIP'' AS KREMLIN,
COMMUNISTS TALK

 &HT;    With RUSSIA-BOX-0905.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ignoring pleas coming just two days earlier from
President Clinton to avoid inflationary policies and state control
of the economy, President Boris Yeltsin's interim government
announced plans for an ``economic dictatorship'' that among other
steps will print more money to cope with the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin offered his plan to
deal with the worsening economic turmoil in a speech before
parliament, as the value of the ruble again fell sharply on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk was clearly a bid to win support for his
confirmation from the Communist-dominated Duma, parliament's lower
house, as Russia continues to operate without a permanent
government.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma postponed a planned vote Friday on Chernomyrdin's
confirmation to allow negotiations over the weekend on Kremlin
proposals for an unprecedented power-sharing arrangement with the
Communist-led parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma was set to vote Chernomyrdin down for a second time,
prolonging Russia's political chaos as the economy withers. The
vote was rescheduled for Monday afternoon, after opposition leaders
attend talks with Yeltsin at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Friday that his party
would continue to oppose Chernomyrdin and seek an alternative
compromise candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin repeated his support Friday for Chernomyrdin, who
served as prime minister from 1992 until March of this year and is
widely blamed for helping to create the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chernomyrdin proposed an aggressive economic crisis
plan that includes printing money to help pay Russia's debts,
linking the ruble to the country's gold and foreign reserves and
establishing a state board to oversee the currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the government seemed ready to risk
hyper-inflation for the sake of bailing out shaky banks and paying
back wages to millions of workers -- albeit in significantly
devalued rubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation will go up very sharply. There will be further
turmoil in the economy, living standards will be cut,'' warned
Gunnar Tersman of the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy,
a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems like in the short-run they are going to
bail out the banks to a considerable degree by giving them cheap
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov, a co-author of the
economic plan, conceded in a Russian television interview that
prices will rise as a result of the policy. But he said it was
important for Russia to clear its mounting debt in order to
stabilize the economy and return to the pursuit of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the ruble stood at 6.2 to the U.S. dollar, and
plunged to a close of 16.99 at the official rate Friday. On the
street, the ruble was trading as low as 20 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices also have continued to rise -- as much as 50
percent on some items -- and some markets reported food shortages.
Inflation rose to 15 percent in August, up from 0.2 percent in
July, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While pumping more rubles into the economy would increase the
money supply, it also would weaken the currency's value and reduce
the spending power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is scheduled to receive a $4.3 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sept. 15, part of a $22.6
billion bail-out package announced in July. But the IMF and Western
leaders, including Clinton who was in Moscow this week for a summit
with Yeltsin, have warned Russia that the aid will stop if market
reforms do not continue.
</P>
<P>
   Russia experienced massive inflation after the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, wiping out the savings of many Russians and
reducing much of the middle class into poverty in a matter of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that all savings will be lost in the coming weeks
or months and we will return to 1992. And it is very difficult to
survive 1992 twice, so nobody knows what it may lead to,'' said
Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the Politica(CQ) Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, representatives from the Duma and the Kremlin were
expected to negotiate throughout the weekend in an effort to
overcome their political impasse.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin a second time, Yeltsin has the
option of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new candidate.
If the Duma votes against Yeltsin's choice a third time, the
president can call new Duma elections
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that on Monday the Duma will vote against Chernomyrdin
and then both sides will be searching for a compromise,'' said
Sergei Markov, director of the Moscow-based Institute of Political
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, the Federation Council, on Friday held a
largely symbolic vote in favor of Chernomyrdin. While it has no
constitutional force, the vote was added pressure on the Duma as
the upper house -- which consists of governors from Russia's
regions -- signaled it is supporting Yeltsin.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not every day that Donna Karan acts as a stylist
for anyone but a runway model. But on an August afternoon on Terry
Lane in East Hampton, Ms. Karan found herself at the home of
Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar,
counseling women on what to buy and how to wear it, and draping her
sweaters over Hamptons-tan passers-by with the ardor of a Soho
street vendor. The event was a garage sale to benefit the Ovarian
Cancer Research Fund, an organization presided over by Ms.
Tilberis.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of almost 400 that haggled over Cindy Crawford's blue
jeans and Ms. Tilberis' hand-me-down Chanel handbags included
dozens of celebrities like Patrick Demarchelier, Isaac Mizrahi and
the models-in-love Esther Canadas and Mark Vanderloo, whose names
were all but guaranteed to turn up in gossip columns. ``If a light
could turn on and shine brightly on ovarian cancer, I'd be very,
very happy,'' Ms. Tilberis said from her Hamptons house last week.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the cause that could. Because of the advocacy of the
socially prominent and well-connected Ms. Tilberis and a handful of
grass-roots organizations, along with recent developments in
diagnosis and treatment, ovarian cancer has finally begun to make
inroads into the charitable arena dominated by _ there is no
delicate way to put it _ more easily marketed diseases like breast
cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ms. Tilberis will be a host of a fund-raiser at Saks
Fifth Avenue in New York that will raise money for the Ovarian
Cancer Research Fund while promoting the clothing lines of a
battalion of British designers sold by Saks. Ms. Tilberis is
lending her magazine's mailing list of fashion insiders, and Saks
is contributing $50,000 to her cause. The invited guests include
designer Alexander McQueen, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and actress
Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Later in September, Ms. Tilberis and actress Meryl Streep will
be the hosts of the New York premiere of the MCA/Universal film
``One True Thing,'' also for the benefit of the ovarian cancer
fund, and plans are under way for ``the requisite gala in
December,'' as Ms. Tilberis put it.
</P>
<P>
   The publication in March of her memoir, ``No Time to Die''
(Little, Brown) _ about her own continuing struggle with ovarian
cancer _ also focused attention on the issue. It was excerpted in
Good Housekeeping, and Walt Disney Co. plans to turn it into a
television movie.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, Ms. Tilberis is quite candidly using her position
atop a highly visible fashion magazine to link ovarian cancer with
the boldface names that are the quickest way to generate heat and
light these days _ whether for an Oscar gown, a restaurant or a
charitable cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, it's essential,'' she said. ``You've got to have a name
out there if you're going to get it dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her models is the effort behind breast cancer
fund-raising, which has raised tens of millions in the 1990s, in no
small part because of the glamour and financial support of people
like Ralph Lauren, Ronald O. Perelman and Evelyn Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to say you want to make ovarian cancer a chic cause.
Making that happen, however, is a tough job, largely because of the
disease's insidiousness: it is the most lethal cancer among women.
It is diagnosed in about 24,500 American women every year, and they
face daunting odds: three out of four die within five years of
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible, but most people don't survive long enough to
become celebrated spokespeople,'' said Anne Kolker, director of the
Ovarian Cancer National Alliance in Washington, an umbrella group.
``One of my colleagues spoke to somebody about this and she said,
`Gee, why isn't there the same level of advocacy for ovarian
cancer?' And the answer was because none of us lives long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis, whose cancer was diagnosed four years ago, when
she was 46, has had surgery, chemotherapy and a marrow transplant.
She is in good health now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, she presided over the first benefit for the Ovarian
Cancer Research Fund, which raised $750,000 and landed her cause in
the pages of In Style magazine. Altogether, her group has raised
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   While breast cancer is more common _ afflicting about 180,000
American women each year _ breast cancer survival rates are higher.
The number of deaths from ovarian cancer is about half that of
breast cancer, said Dr. Robert Young, president of the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He said about 50,000 women die of
breast cancer each year, and 20,000 of ovarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make rough estimates comparing mortality and the amount
of research funding, the funding falls short,'' he said. ``It seems
to me that for ovarian cancer there ought to be targeted funding in
the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million, and we're far short
of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the forgotten women's cancer. We've got to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most crass terms, it is harder to enlist donors and
government sources of financing against ovarian cancer than other
diseases. It presents no easy symbol of feminine beauty and
potential frailty like the breast. In fact, there aren't even any
great colors left for a ribbon. (Ms. Tilberis' group is using
teal.)
</P>
<P>
   But in small ways, the movement is growing. President Clinton
has been asked to declare this month Ovarian Cancer Awareness
Month. Last year, the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance was
organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're beginning to see a new awareness, more activities and
more attention being focused on ovarian cancer,'' said Betty
Reiser, the director of the ovarian cancer program at Share, a
women's cancer advocacy group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easily detectable disease. A routine annual Pap
smear detects cervical cancer, not ovarian cancer. Women cannot
examine their own ovaries every month, as they can their breasts.
And the symptoms of ovarian cancer are hardly distinguishable from
those suffered after a bout of food poisoning, a typical menstrual
period or a stressful day at the office: abdominal bloating,
indigestion, fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   There are usually no detectable symptoms in the early stages. To
diagnose ovarian cancer, patients must have a sonogram followed in
most cases by abdominal surgery. The blood test in current use _
called CA125 _ is not reliable in detecting early ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society reports that more than two-thirds of
the women who discover that they have ovarian cancer each year find
that it is already in Stage 4, when five-year survival rates hover
around 25 percent. If the cancer is discovered in Stage 1, survival
rates soar to 93 percent. One of the most urgent causes of the
ovarian cancer movement is to push for research that will speed
early diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Journal of the American Medical Association
published a study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic who
announced a new blood test for early detection that is more
sensitive and effective than any now available. (It is not yet
available to the public, however.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is finally national attention being focused on the
disease,'' Ms. Kolker of the national alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates in the fight against ovarian cancer maintain that
Ms. Tilberis doesn't deserve much credit for bringing attention to
the disease. Gail Hayward, the president of the National Ovarian
Cancer Coalition in Pompano Beach, Fla., said that grass-roots
organizations directed the spotlight to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think this recent awareness began because NOCC
began in 1993 and has sent out thousands and thousands of packages
of information and had millions of people visit our Web site and
done thousands and thousands of hours of work,'' Mrs. Hayward said.
``We are the underpinnings for the celebrity people. We came
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond, Ms. Tilberis said: ``She's right. The
underpinnings are at the heart of the charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unless you can come out with a book or be a famous face
like Pierce Brosnan or someone . . . '' Her voice trailed off.
``It's great to be a support group. It's great to be one of those
smaller charities that will pass information around about the
newest chemotherapies or teas to drink or sharks' cartilage, but
what we're trying to do is attract enough attention to get the
18-year-old to listen. And you need a face for that.''

 &HT;    CHERNOMYRDIN CALLS FOR ``ECONOMIC DICTATORSHIP'' AS KREMLIN,
COMMUNISTS TALK

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ignoring pleas coming just two days earlier from
President Clinton to avoid inflationary policies and state control
of the economy, President Boris Yeltsin's interim government
announced plans for an ``economic dictatorship'' that among other
steps will print more money to cope with the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin offered his plan to
deal with the worsening economic turmoil in a speech before
parliament, as the value of the ruble again fell sharply on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk was clearly a bid to win support for his
confirmation from the Communist-dominated Duma, parliament's lower
house, as Russia continues to operate without a permanent
government.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma postponed a planned vote Friday on Chernomyrdin's
confirmation to allow negotiations over the weekend on Kremlin
proposals for an unprecedented power-sharing arrangement with the
Communist-led parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma was set to vote Chernomyrdin down for a second time,
prolonging Russia's political chaos as the economy withers. The
vote was rescheduled for Monday afternoon, after opposition leaders
attend talks with Yeltsin at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Friday that his party
would continue to oppose Chernomyrdin and seek an alternative
compromise candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin repeated his support Friday for Chernomyrdin, who
served as prime minister from 1992 until March of this year and is
widely blamed for helping to create the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chernomyrdin proposed an aggressive economic crisis
plan that includes printing money to help pay Russia's debts,
linking the ruble to the country's gold and foreign reserves and
establishing a state board to oversee the currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the government seemed ready to risk
hyper-inflation for the sake of bailing out shaky banks and paying
back wages to millions of workers -- albeit in significantly
devalued rubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation will go up very sharply. There will be further
turmoil in the economy, living standards will be cut,'' warned
Gunnar Tersman of the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy,
a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems like in the short-run they are going to
bail out the banks to a considerable degree by giving them cheap
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov, a co-author of the
economic plan, conceded in a Russian television interview that
prices will rise as a result of the policy. But he said it was
important for Russia to clear its mounting debt in order to
stabilize the economy and return to the pursuit of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the ruble stood at 6.2 to the U.S. dollar, and
plunged to a close of 16.99 at the official rate Friday. On the
street, the ruble was trading as low as 20 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices also have continued to rise -- as much as 50
percent on some items -- and some markets reported food shortages.
Inflation rose to 15 percent in August, up from 0.2 percent in
July, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While pumping more rubles into the economy would increase the
money supply, it also would weaken the currency's value and reduce
the spending power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is scheduled to receive a $4.3 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sept. 15, part of a $22.6
billion bail-out package announced in July. But the IMF and Western
leaders, including Clinton who was in Moscow this week for a summit
with Yeltsin, have warned Russia that the aid will stop if market
reforms do not continue.
</P>
<P>
   Russia experienced massive inflation after the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, wiping out the savings of many Russians and
reducing much of the middle class into poverty in a matter of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that all savings will be lost in the coming weeks
or months and we will return to 1992. And it is very difficult to
survive 1992 twice, so nobody knows what it may lead to,'' said
Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the Politica(CQ) Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, representatives from the Duma and the Kremlin were
expected to negotiate throughout the weekend in an effort to
overcome their political impasse.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin a second time, Yeltsin has the
option of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new candidate.
If the Duma votes against Yeltsin's choice a third time, the
president can call new Duma elections
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that on Monday the Duma will vote against Chernomyrdin
and then both sides will be searching for a compromise,'' said
Sergei Markov, director of the Moscow-based Institute of Political
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, the Federation Council, on Friday held a
largely symbolic vote in favor of Chernomyrdin. While it has no
constitutional force, the vote was added pressure on the Duma as
the upper house -- which consists of governors from Russia's
regions -- signaled it is supporting Yeltsin.

CAUGHT IN A WEB OF ODD AUDIBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: About two months ago, while on the Net, I
started to get peculiar sounds through my speaker system. They were
distinct cries for help. Since that time on two occasions I heard
very realistic cat fights and, just the other day, ghoulish
laughter. My service provider says he has no complaints from other
customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Haunted
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAUNTED: Maybe the other customers had been sticking to
their drug regimens like the nice doctors told them to. Hey, don't
get all weirded out, Haunted. I can think of about four
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe dweebs embedded those sounds in their Web pages because
they thought it would be way cool to freak out casual surfers.
Sticking sound on a page is something any reasonably well-trained
monkey can do: You just add the appropriate line of code in the
hypertext document that displays your page and upload it and an
accompanying sound clip file to the server where the rest of your
Web stuff is stored.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe somebody's woofing you. Maybe they loaded a bunch of
scary sound clips on your computer to signal certain system events.
OK, it's funny, but not too imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, certain unshielded speakers can pick up radio or
television waves and play them, but I thought ``The Fighting Cats
Hour'' had been canceled two seasons ago. Maybe I'm thinking of
that whole nasty Norville-Pauley business.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is something you beings of this earthly
realm are not prepared to learn about. Just ignore anything you
think you hear. And that ghoulish laughter? Don't worry. That was
just me.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: i saw your article and was offended by the way
you were talking about hackers.Don't worry im not going to do
anything like send a virus to you but you shouldn't talk about
hackers that way the hobbie is expanding infact im a recruiter for
the world wide hacking group ``oo7'' yah call me elite if u want
but what im trying to say is dont talk about hackers the way you
did because i gaurantee at least 100 hackers saw that and i also
bet you will recieve many spam e-mails, virii, viruses, mail
bombs,and the most elite hacking aspect cracking all of your system
passwords i also would be glad to help with your security if u
would like cause i not only hack but i am a network manager.
</P>
<P>
   _ ..ooOCoD36X60oo..
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OO: Ooooooh! Now I'm really scared! Actually, what's really
frightening is that a functional illiterate is recruiting a whole
army of people who think that the degree to which they harm other
people is some measure of their own worth.
</P>
<P>
   The original hackers did no such harm. They broke into systems
to see if it could be done, then left things untouched. Somewhere
along the line, tiny-minded hangers-on _ hacker wannabes _ decided
it would be really funny to see how much damage they could do
building their own spurious ``legends.'' Let me say this slowly:
Out here in the real world, we're not impressed with your juvenile
pranks. Elite? Try ``pathetic.'' Why don't you just grow up and
take a remedial English course?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, I traced your e-mail and have informed your boss
about your ``hobbie.'' Your own computer is now being monitored.
You know, your password was really easy to guess, too.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: In Windows 98 and the ``B'' version of
95, select the 3D Text screensaver. Type in ``volcano'' for the
text and watch it cycle through different volcano names. (Thanks
and a tip o' the chapeau to Gordon Sandlin III.)
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay wants to hear about
your stupid software trick, too. He can be reached at

TREASURIES GAIN AGAIN AMID STOCK MARKET JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities traded mostly higher in an
abbreviated session Friday, as a decline in stocks led nervous
investors to seek safety in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 103 8/32. The bond's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
dropped to 5.28 percent, from 5.30 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury market closed early Friday, two hours before the 4
p.m. closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange, which may have
prompted some investors to be cautious going into a long holiday
weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Monday in observance of Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the benchmark long-bond yield was down 5 basis
points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The August employment report released Friday had little impact
on the market. The report showed that the return of workers
following two plant strikes against General Motors helped swell
payrolls by 365,000 jobs and kept the nation's unemployment rate at
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One
Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, said that although the
credit markets were focusing more heavily on world developments
than on domestic economic data, the employment report was fairly
market-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said that the average nonfarm payroll jobs gain for the
months of July and August raced ahead of the first-quarter average
but came in well below that of the second-quarter average. ``Such
evidence suggests that we should not expect too much further
firming on the wage front in the months ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that many traders were looking ahead to a speech
Friday night by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan at the
University of California at Berkeley. A number of traders, Chan
said, ``refused to rule out the possibility that a more friendly
Fed posture would be revealed by the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If so, his comments would certainly go a long way in coloring
the path of trading'' during the next couple trading sessions, Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds were also bolstered by a strong dollar in currency
trading.

CLINTON APOLOGIZES FOR RELATIONSHIP WITH LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ President Clinton, forced again on this
five-day foreign trip to confront questions about the Lewinsky
scandal, said Friday that he ``basically'' agreed with Sen. Joseph
Lieberman who on Thursday criticized the president's conduct as
``immoral'' and ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, Clinton said that he was ``very sorry
about'' his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, describing it as
``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a picture-taking session Friday morning with the prime
minister of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, Clinton was asked about
Lieberman's remarks on the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been briefed on them and basically I agree with what he
said,'' Clinton said. He was clearly prepared for the questions and
his manner displayed no suggestion of unease or defensiveness; he
stood casually with his hands clasped behind his back as Ahern
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said. ``So I have
nothing else to say except that I can't disagree with anyone else
who wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further by reporters, Clinton added: ``There's nothing
that he or anyone else could say in a personally critical way that
I _ that I don't imagine that I would disagree with, since I have
already said it myself, to myself. And I'm very sorry about it.
There's nothing else I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Friday, Lieberman said he appreciated Clinton's
apology, but added that the president would have to say more. ``It
doesn't end with a single statement,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said after the president spoke that his remarks were part
of a deliberate effort to convey remorse and to placate critics who
say that Clinton has not sufficiently apologized for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The critics _ many in the president's own party _ have said that
Clinton has inflamed the crisis by continuing to attack Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel whose investigation brought the
Lewinsky matter and Clinton's lies about it to light. Clinton made
no reference on Friday to the investigation that threatens his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman suggested on Thursday that Clinton's transgressions
were so severe that the Senate might feel compelled to formally
condemn them, in a vote of censure or other official action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded: ``I just don't want to comment on that. I
shouldn't be commenting on that while I'm on this trip, and I don't
think that _ my understanding is that was not a decision that was
made or advocated clearly yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If that's not an issue, I don't want to make it one,
one way or the other. I don't think that's appropriate right now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the second time on this trip to Russia and Ireland,
Clinton's comments on the Lewinsky matter overshadowed the scripted
message of the day, which on Friday was supposed to be on progress
toward peace in Northern Ireland and prospects for economic growth
in the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton faced questions on the affair in a Kremlin
press conference with Boris Yeltsin, the besieged president of
Russia. On that occasion, Clinton said he believed he had already
expressed his ``profound regret to all who were hurt'' by the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Clinton knew he would confront the issue again
Friday after Lieberman's statement on Thursday. Erskine Bowles, the
White House chief of staff, tried to persuade Lieberman to delay
his remarks until after Clinton returned to Washington on Saturday
night, but Lieberman declined, according to Mike McCurry, the White
House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, Clinton spoke to Lieberman about the
senator's concerns, but he, too, failed to persuade Lieberman to
withhold judgment, McCurry said. Clinton, the aides said, chose his
words carefully on Friday as part of a strategy to apologize for
his actions, without offering any fuller explanation for them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to bed Thursday night unaware of Lieberman's
comments, according to McCurry. The president was briefed on the
statement Friday morning and discussed possible responses with
Bowles and other senior advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made very clear how he wanted to respond, and that's what
he did,'' McCurry said. He added that there was no special
significance in the president's saying he was ``sorry'' twice in
his responses Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that that's what he's been saying all along,''
McCurry said. ``Saying you're sorry means you're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president knows that his further statement of regret
would not put the matter to rest, McCurry added. ``He's got a very
realistic outlook'' on Starr's investigation, on the continuing
debate in Congress and among the public about the Lewinsky
relationship, and on the certainty that he will continue to face
questions from the media about this issue at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president has been calling Democratic leaders
and other supporters in hopes of preventing further desertions like
Lieberman's. But the job of repairing the breach with members of
his party, and the public, will not be easy and will not be
accomplished quickly, McCurry acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president clearly does not believe that one
conversation, one statement, one speech is going to be sufficient
in addressing this matter the way he wants to, and he intends to
keep addressing it both personally and, to the degree he needs to,
publicly, as he sees fit,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that there has been no discussion ``whatsoever''
among Clinton and his advisers about the president resigning.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in April that he would ``never'' resign.
Asked if Clinton had reconsidered in light of recent revelations,
McCurry replied, ``I am confident his attitude has not changed on
that.''

WHY BIG MAC'S HOME-RUN MOMENT WILL MOVE US TO TEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that I will react in the most unrugged way
possible when Mark McGwire hits his 62nd home run. When the St.
Louis Cardinal slugger surpasses Roger Maris' home-run record, I'm
sure I will choke up, perhaps even shed a drop or two of saline
water from the areas immediately left and right of my nose. Not a
fitting way to honor history's most stalwart, gifted home-run
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be helped. McGwire's breaking the record is that
important to me. (The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa may well break it,
too, or even surpass Big Mac by season's end, and this entire essay
would then be equally true for his feat.) In fact, McGwire's
pending feat may be the most meaningful one that my generation of
sports fans will witness.
</P>
<P>
   We are, for the first time, living through the sort of baseball
that Ken Burns documented, the baseball that captivated the
hard-core fan and the casual observer, the game my dad called
``America's pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be absurd that I _ and, if television is to be believed,
the nation _ care so deeply about a ``home-run race.'' In other
words, a statistical aberration in a ``pastime'' will move me in
ways my wedding anniversary, my job and very special episodes of
``7th Heaven'' cannot. This is probably not the mark of
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   But as McGwire himself said after homer No. 59 Thursday night,
``Some things you just can't explain,'' proving his perspective is
as true as his swing. It's decided then. I and sports fans of my
generation have spent a lifetime preparing for this drama. It is
Big Mac's party, and we will cry if we want to.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedence for such things. Last season, in an episode
of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' sportswriter Ray and his buddy were
drinking beer and watching Tiger Woods win the Masters golf
tournament on television. When Woods hugged his father, the
emotionally deficient males began to weep. Raymond's wife wondered
aloud why men could cry over a golf tournament but not at important
moments in their own lives, or something to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond replied with, ``But, honey ... Tiger ... his dad ... the
Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny though it is, it's rather easy to explain a man's (and
woman's) fascination with sports, and many books have been written
that do so. Sporting events, seasons and careers are
quick-and-dirty metaphors for life, as too many cliche-infested
speeches have reminded us. Football and war, you may have heard,
are oh-so-very similar, as ``North Dallas Forty'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan'' remind us. Baseball is particularly susceptible to
such comparisons: Like life, baseball is not governed by a time
clock; its languid pace and sudden bursts of excitement neatly
mirror our lives. (Well, not my life, which is in the third inning
of a scoreless game, but you get the picture.)
</P>
<P>
   All or none of this may be true. But what is certain is that 25
years of the day-to-day insanity of being a baseball fan _ reading
the box scores, listening to the pre-game show for lineup changes,
staying until the end of a 13-1 ballgame, punching someone who
tells you the designated hitter was a good innovation _ will soon
pay off for me and others like me. We did not see Babe Ruth play,
you understand. Gen X-ers were not around to see Maris break the
Babe's record.
</P>
<P>
   But that's ridiculous, you say. You have watched Michael Jordan,
who is (along with Pele) the greatest professional athlete in the
history of sports. Even in baseball, you saw Nolan Ryan throw his
5,000th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   True but irrelevant. Jordan's is a lifetime achievement _ and a
subjective one at that. There are still those, for example, who say
that Wilt Chamberlain is basketball's greatest all-time player.
Ryan's feat is quantifiable, but again one accomplished during a
20-year period. It is no less awesome, but its impact on people who
are not true sports fans was negligible, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is hitting home runs, which is the most
recognizable feat in sports. The home run is THE metaphor most
Americans immediately understand and appreciate: It is majestic,
powerful, graceful and simple. It is what we all strive to be, an
act of compact force and clarity that defines what we want out of
our games and our athletic stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm chasing history,'' McGwire said this week, and I'm
glad he's acknowledging the importance of his home-run quest. I
don't want anyone, least of all him, to diminish the excitement
building for those of us who had to settle for Jim Rice instead of
Roger Maris, for Albert Belle instead of the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to someday being able to bore my grandchildren
with the tale of Big Mac going Big Fly 62 (or more) times. I can
explain why my memory of his breaking that record is special and
how I hope they will one day understand. I will tell them that in
my mind's eye, I still clearly see Mark McGwire, and he is swinging
away.

woman's) fascination with sports, and many books have been written
that do so. Sporting events, seasons and careers are
quick-and-dirty metaphors for life, as too many cliche-infested
speeches have reminded us. Football and war, you may have heard,
are oh-so-very similar, as ``North Dallas Forty'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan'' remind us. Baseball is particularly susceptible to
such comparisons: Like life, baseball is not governed by a time
clock; its languid pace and sudden bursts of excitement neatly
mirror our lives. (Well, not my life, which is in the third inning
of a scoreless game, but you get the picture.)
</P>
<P>
   All or none of this may be true. But what is certain is that 25
years of the day-to-day insanity of being a baseball fan _ reading
the box scores, listening to the pre-game show for lineup changes,
staying until the end of a 13-1 ballgame, punching someone who
tells you the designated hitter was a good innovation _ will soon
pay off for me and others like me. We did not see Babe Ruth play,
you understand. Gen X-ers were not around to see Maris break the
Babe's record.
</P>
<P>
   But that's ridiculous, you say. You have watched Michael Jordan,
who is (along with Pele) the greatest professional athlete in the
history of sports. Even in baseball, you saw Nolan Ryan throw his
5,000th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   True but irrelevant. Jordan's is a lifetime achievement _ and a
subjective one at that. There are still those, for example, who say
that Wilt Chamberlain is basketball's greatest all-time player.
Ryan's feat is quantifiable, but again one accomplished during a
20-year period. It is no less awesome, but its impact on people who
are not true sports fans was negligible, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is hitting home runs, which is the most
recognizable feat in sports. The home run is THE metaphor most
Americans immediately understand and appreciate: It is majestic,
powerful, graceful and simple. It is what we all strive to be, an
act of compact force and clarity that defines what we want out of
our games and our athletic stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm chasing history,'' McGwire said this week, and I'm
glad he's acknowledging the importance of his home-run quest. I
don't want anyone, least of all him, to diminish the excitement
building for those of us who had to settle for Jim Rice instead of
Roger Maris, for Albert Belle instead of the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to someday being able to bore my grandchildren
with the tale of Big Mac going Big Fly 62 (or more) times. I can
explain why my memory of his breaking that record is special and
how I hope they will one day understand. I will tell them that in
my mind's eye, I still clearly see Mark McGwire, and he is swinging
away.

RUSSIA POSTPONES VOTE ON NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Parliament Friday put off until Monday a
critical vote on a new government, buying more time for political
horsetrading as the country's economic crisis worsened.
</P>
<P>
   With the central bank unable to summon the foreign currency
reserves to defend the ruble, its value fell sharply again Friday.
Inflation for the month of August was reported at 15 percent, an
official figure that paled next to the severe price increases
Russians saw this week as they scoured stores for vanishing
supplies of domestic staples and imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for ways to avert another showdown, the Parliament's
lower house Friday accepted President Boris Yeltsin's last-minute
offer to reopen talks on a power-sharing agreement, and delayed its
second vote on the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister. Chernomyrdin's nomination was defeated on its first try
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes for an easy breakthrough in Russia's 12-day-long
political deadlock flickered Friday when the leader of the
Communist Party _ which holds the biggest bloc of votes in the
lower house _ said he would refuse to sign any political agreement,
and would continue to oppose Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to consider any agreement on Monday,'' said
Gennadi Zyuganov. ``We won't sign anything. It's pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Although opposition leaders have said they will present Yeltsin
with their own list of prime minister candidates on Monday, Yeltsin
_ as yet _ has shown no signs of backing away from his choice of
Chernomyrdin. A third rejection of the president's nominee by
Parliament would require Yeltsin to disband the lower house of
Parliament, known as the Duma, and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The country's mounting frustration and impatience with its
dawdling political leaders Friday finally penetrated the halls of
the Duma building, a giant structure of concrete and granite that
once housed the Soviet State Planning Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of striking miners, who have been camped for
several months outside the Russian government building in a nonstop
protest against unpaid wages, flashed guest passes at the security
guards at the Duma and briefly occupied its grand staircase,
rhythmically banging their miners' helmets against the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant ultranational leader who
Thursday announced he would swing his 51 parliamentary deputies
behind Chernomyrdin's candidacy, also staged his own eruption from
the floor of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar rate is already almost 20 rubles, and there are
lines at food stores even in Moscow,'' he shouted into the
microphone. ``Everything is being swept away, and then we will be
blamed. Either we will be disbanded, or we approve Chernomyrdin,
but we will be accused of exploding the ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruble _ which was pegged at 6.2 to the dollar three weeks
ago _ fell Friday to 16.9, although stores and currency offices
around the city were trading at even lower rates. In another sign
of the widening crack in Russia's financial system, another major
bank, Inkombank, was taken under the temporary supervision of the
central bank, following similar orders imposed last week on
SBS-Agro, the country's second largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup against Chernomyrdin in the lower house did not
change Friday, even after he picked up an endorsement from a
majority in the Parliament's upper house, which is made up of
leaders from Russia's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his speech, outlining a program of economic measures to
bring Russia out of its crisis, seem to sway anyone. If anything,
the program, which calls for a gradual easing into a harsh regime
of financial austerity, or ``economic dictatorship,'' was largely
ignored Friday as the debate focused on the search for a political
compromise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, both Chernomyrdin and his supporters Friday said they
thought his chances for confirmation Monday had improved. As the
days go by, deputies from small left-wing parties, pressed by an
increasingly unhappy electorate and by regional bosses who want to
see a government move into Russia's widening political void, may
choose a face-saving way out of the impasse. They could also be
swayed by promises of ministerial portfolios, although such offers
have less value than usual, given the difficulties any government
would face in Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's offer to restart talks that had collapsed last weekend
signaled that he is still looking for ways to avoid the kind of
confrontation that could come with a disbanding of Parliament. In
1993, such a confrontation led to an aborted mutiny, and Yeltsin's
order to shell the Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   On the table Monday when Yeltsin meets with leaders from both
houses of Parliament will be a political agreement that calls for a
redistribution of the considerable powers assigned to the president
under the 1993 constitution, which he himself crafted. The
agreement also spells out a political cease-fire, imposed on both
the Parliament and the president, designed to stop the kind of
brinkmanship that has brought Russia to a crisis point so many
times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   To back up his peace offer, the president Friday submitted a law
that would amend the constitutional framework for the Russian
government, giving Parliament more say in the appointment of
cabinets _ a point that the Communists had pressed in negotiations
last weekend. Other parts of the political agreement call for a
moratorium on no-confidence votes against the government and a halt
to impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party backed out of a similar agreement last
Sunday, setting the groundwork for the rejection Monday of
Chernomyrdin. Their reasons for backtracking still remain unclear,
but most analysts say that they probably see greater political
advantage in staying clear of an unpopular government and an
increasingly unpopular president. According to a recent poll of
1,500 citizens taken by the Social Opinion research group, 66
percent said Yeltsin should resign.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment proceedings are initiated next week in the lower
house, as Communist deputies have threatened, it could run into a
constitutional logjam and explode into another confrontation. Under
the Russian constitution, a president cannot disband the lower
house once it has begun impeachment proceedings, whereas the same
constitution compels the president to disband the Parliament if it
rejects his choice for prime minister three times. If both events
happen at once, the issue is referred to the courts _ a recipe for
either more paralysis or more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario, now openly discussed, would allow Yeltsin to
disband the Parliament and then postpone the date for new
elections, using the argument that the country cannot afford them
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Had the lower house held its second vote on Chernomyrdin's
candidacy Friday as expected, he would have surely gone down to
defeat again, setting the stage for a third vote in another week.
Given the urgency of the economic crisis, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin
have tried to raise the stakes for the second vote, in order to
avoiding dragging the political battle on for another week.

TELEVANGELIST IS KEEPING `IN TOUCH' WITH THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Stanley, pastor of the 14,000-member First
Baptist Church of Atlanta, has had an amazing rise as a television
and radio evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   He started small, with his weekly sermons televised only in
Atlanta in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I let Pat Robertson have our tapes to play on the
Christian Broadcasting Network in 1978,'' Stanley said this week.
And his ``In Touch'' programs began to spread slowly around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Now his programs are seen or heard in about 250 nations, Stanley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord has just opened door after door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the televangelist scandals of the mid-1980s slowed the
growth of his broadcast ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into issues much,'' he said. ``I just preach Bible
truths. And I distance myself from finances of the church or the
television ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who served twice as president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, helped move that denomination in a conservative
direction.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't get involved in this year's convention in Salt
Lake City when Baptists passed a controversial resolution on family
which stated that wives should submit graciously to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe the Bible says that the husband is the head of
the home,'' said Stanley. ``But he has to be a loving husband, not
dictatorial.''
</P>
<P>
   His basic interests now are his broadcast ministry and his
Atlanta church. The congregation has moved from near downtown
Atlanta to the outskirts of the city. It is meeting in a
300,000-square-foot converted office building, but a new sanctuary
will be built as soon as the downtown property is sold, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And his ``In Touch'' programs are available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pull up a sermon any time of the day or night,'' he
said. ``We've had over 7 million hits on the Internet so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web address is www.intouch.com.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has had a number of books published. His latest,
released this month by Thomas Nelson, is ``Enter His Gates,'' a
series of devotionals for each month based on the 12 gates of the
old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other devotional books are ``A Touch of His
Goodness,'' ``A Touch of His Freedom,'' ``A Touch of His Wisdom''
and ``A Touch of His Love.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the secret of Stanley's popularity?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hurting and looking for answers,'' said Stanley.
``Whether they feel a sense of rejection or whether they feel lost
in sin, I'm teaching the word of God in simple fashion. And it is
meeting people's needs and hurts where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's career hasn't been without difficulties. His biggest
challenge came three years ago with his highly publicized marital
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Anna, twice filed for divorce, saying Stanley cared
more for his ministry than for her. She later withdrew the
petitions. The two are still separated, however.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's position as pastor of First Baptist, Atlanta, was
threatened at the time. Many Baptists believe a divorce
disqualifies a person from being pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a painful experience, Stanley said it has
sensitized him to people in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep going on,'' he said. ``I've learned a
lot from it. I think the whole experience has made me more
understanding of people in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And even that may have added to his television and radio
audiences, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's caused a lot of people to start listening to
me,'' said Stanley. ``A lot of people figured I had it all
together, but now they know how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe God has taken a bad situation and used it
for good.''

COMMENTARY: TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Drury died on his 80th birthday Wednesday. He had a keen
eye for newspaper cliches, so I refrain from calling him ``the
father of the Washington novel.'' Still, his ``Advise and Consent''
is probably the best Washington novel there ever was, and its
success inspired other reporters to produce a spate of novels in
the same style, a couple of which were not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Both of us came to The New York Times in 1954 with over-inflated
expectations. These had been raised by James B. (Scotty) Reston,
who ran the Washington Bureau and had hired us.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we laughed a bit sourly about Scotty's power, when the
hiring was going on, to ``take you to the top of the mountain'' and
show you an improbably glorious future on The Times. It did not
take long for Allen to realize what a long climb it might be up
that mountain.
</P>
<P>
   He had a reputation as an elegant writer when he came to the
paper. Scotty Reston was then trying to persuade The Times to write
plain English, and it was assumed that Allen was brought in to
promote this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He tried. The results depressed him. In those days, plain
English was under suspicion at The Times. Many stories read as if
written by a Henry James imitator with a bad hangover.
Incomprehensible English was accepted as evidence of the honest, if
inarticulate, reporter; plain English bothered people.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was soon finding his pieces being melted down into gray
lead or being asked to rewrite them in murkier English.
</P>
<P>
   His desk was directly in front of mine in the bureau, and we
both covered the Senate, and I quickly noticed that he had given up
the struggle to get to the top of the mountain. If
conscientious-but-dull was what the paper wanted,
dull-and-conscientious was what he would give them.
</P>
<P>
   After a while I noticed that Allen was getting his work done and
was ready to leave the office at the earliest permissible minute
each day.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1958 I learned why. Before leaving the office, he
lifted a big cardboard box from the floor, set it on my desk and
said, ``I've written a novel.'' He hoped I'd read it.
</P>
<P>
   I groaned silently, the way you groan when a friend who has
never written more than a postcard asks you to read this book he's
been working on and tell him what you think. What lies I would be
compelled to tell poor Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The box weighed slightly less than a ton. The manuscript inside
was typed not very well on long legal-size paper. I took it home,
ate, fixed a drink, sat down and with a heavy heart reached into
the box for a fistful of manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Good Lord!
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't put the thing down! I read half the book that night
and finished it next day. My wife finished close behind, and the
sight of her suppressing a tear at one point confirmed my hunch.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, handing the box back to Allen, I said, ``You're going
to make a million dollars.'' He made a good bit more, I heard. In
those days a million dollars was money.
</P>
<P>
   Later I realized Allen always knew he had a wonderful book. The
Book-of-the-Month Club, which in those days offered practically
absolute assurance of making its selection a best seller, notified
the publisher that it would make ``Advise and Consent'' its choice
novel if Drury would make some changes.
</P>
<P>
   It wanted to eliminate two characters it considered utterly
dispensable. Allen declined. He wrote the club a letter. It said
``Advise and Consent'' was a wonderful book, that it deserved to be
published exactly as he had written it, and that if the club
refused it would be the Book-of-the-Month Club's loss, not his. It
was published uncut.
</P>
<P>
   Its success irritated book reviewers of the liberal stripe.
Allen had based his corrupt senator on Joseph McCarthy, a
red-baiting conservative, but made him a mirror image of McCarthy _
a leftish demagogue.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Cold War theme, and Allen's sympathy obviously lay
with the Cold Warriors. The great Cold Warriors of course were
Democrats like Truman and Acheson, but I believe Allen was an
admirer of Sen. Robert Taft, who seems to have been the model for
his Sen. Orrin Knox.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to be helpful, I told Allen that the proper term was
``advice and consent'' and suggested he might correct his title. A
better reporter than I, he suggested I check the Constitution.

MURDER CHARGES AGAINST 2 YOUNG BOYS DROPPED AFTER DETECTION OF
SEMEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (bl)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an extraordinary turn of events in a highly charged
murder case, charges were dropped Friday against two boys, ages 7
and 8, who had been accused of killing an 11-year-old girl by
hitting her with rocks and suffocating her with her panties in an
effort to take her bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dismissed the case against the boys after a
laboratory analysis found the presence of semen in the girl's
panties. Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine said medical
experts had advised that ``the possibility of semen coming from
boys this age is at best remote.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against the boys had riveted national attention because
they were believed to be the youngest children charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police had said the boys confessed to the July 27
killing of Ryan Harris, a fifth-grade honor student from a Chicago
suburb who was spending the summer with a godmother in the
impoverished Englewood neighborhood, where the boys lived. They
said the boys struck Ryan with a rock, causing her to fall off her
bicycle and knocking her unconscious. Then, police said, the
younger boy told them he put leaves in Ryan's nostrils and stuffed
her panties in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such apparently depraved actions by children so
young, commentators took to the airwaves and opinion pages
bemoaning the circumstances that could have led children to commit
such a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's dismissal is likely to raise a whole new debate _
about the ability of juvenile systems in Chicago and elsewhere to
be fair and accurate in its investigation of society's youngest
accused criminals.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the Ryan Harris case raised fundamental
questions about the way to handle young children charged with
crimes. Some experts questioned whether children so young could
waive their right to a lawyer or their right to remain silent. The
boys' defense lawyers had complained about the way their clients
were interrogated, saying that because their parents were not
allowed in the room and no juvenile advocate was president, police
could have coerced or teased the statements out of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, defense lawyers for the boys were already calling for
significant changes in juvenile proceedings in Chicago, the home of
the nation's first juvenile court. Their demands included a
requirement that police officers videotape confessions from
children, a rule stating that children under 13 must have a parent
present in the interview, and a policy that, as they do with
adults, police could not file felony charges against children until
prosecutors have reviewed the evidence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think there was a rush to judgment,'' said Elizabeth Tarzia,
a public defender for the 7-year-old. ``There were policies and
procedures that were not in place in juvenile court that led to
this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's dismissal also provoked an explosion of reactions from
the boys' families and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology is in order from everyone who convicted my child of
something that it should have obvious he had nothing to do with,''
said the 8-year-old's father. ``I tried to get them to help find
out who this monster was and instead the authorities became the
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and police defended their handling of the
investigation and their decision to bring charges against the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in new territory here with young people of these
tender years,'' said Devine. ``To say, in retrospect, you could
have done this differently, you could have done that differently _
obviously we can all do that.'' He added, ``This is a very
tragically unique case. We took the action we thought was
appropriate to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine said the boys were arrested based on their confessions, a
practice he said was very common. Tom Cronin, the commander of the
Chicago Police Department's crime laboratory, said that initial
swab tests of Ryan's underpants had turned up no traces of semen.
He said the panties were then sent to the Illinois State Police
crime laboratory for hair and fiber analysis, and also to be
retested for semen. Those tests took several weeks and were
discovered to be positive for semen late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hillard said the police
investigation was conducted properly and he refused to rule out the
possibility that the boys could be rearrested. He said that police
would likely interview the boys again, seeking to resolve the
contradictions between the semen evidence and their statements,
which he said revealed knowledge of details of the case that could
only be known be someone who was ``intimately involved'' in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no _ I repeat _ no misconduct on the part of
any member of the Chicago Police Department,'' Hillard said.

READERS GET THEIR OWN SAY FOR THE HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the interest of getting a running start on
the last long weekend of summer, this is a good time to dip into
the ol' mailbag and let the readers do the work of writing today's
column.
</P>
<P>
   Our lead-off helper will be a Kansas City, Kan., woman who takes
issue with a recent column contending that politicians don't do
``the work of the people,'' but work more for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's job is to protect us from...the greed...of
business....Corporations are a much bigger `brother' than
government, largely because they can keep their objectives and
activities secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Distrustful:
</P>
<P>
   Your faith is misplaced. Business isn't the evil thing you
perceive it to be. Have you ever considered what you or government
could accomplish without business? No business, no jobs. Business
provides the products you want and need and the services you
require daily. Without business there would be no individual or
corporate tax revenues for government to redistribute to the
consumers of its goodies. Moreover, have you ever thought about the
things government can do to you that business can't? Government can
put you in jail, confiscate your property, force you to do things
that aren't in your best interest to do, and take your money
against your will. Business can't do any of these things. As for
keeping secrets, government is at least as good at that as
business. Maybe more so.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of government's abilities to serve the people, another
recent column decried the legacy of Soviet-style communism, which
has left Russian business largely ineffective as the country tries
to create a market economy. A Johnson County reader responds to the
observation that few, if any, imports ever bear the inscription
``Made in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are three examples of (Russian-made products) I have some
familiarity with: vacuum tubes. Yes, the `hollow state' devices are
still in demand. Small signal types have not been made in the
United States for some time....(The) best imports are from Russia.
(Another is) world's best .22-caliber ammunition. Up until the '94
Olympics, the Russian stuff absolutely dominated the
competition...world-class product (but) poor export distribution,
(so) I cannot buy the stuff anywhere....(Also) vodka, several
brands, that seem to be world-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Informative:
</P>
<P>
   Veddy interesting. Your examples seem to strengthen my argument
that Russia is a far piece from transforming itself into a dynamic
producer of standout consumer goods for high-consumption economies.
The fact that they are big in the vacuum tube business leads to a
question of whether they're also major producers of eight-track
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're talking about government and business, here's
an interesting take on the nonmarketable Treasury securities in the
Social Security ``trust'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``(T)he giant con behind the Social Security `surplus' (is)
probably the most successful fraud ever perpetrated on an
unsuspecting public. The analogy I like to use...is this: I can
make you a millionaire instantly! I'll just give you an IOU for a
million dollars. You can then go put it in a safe-deposit box and
list it as an asset. You're a millionaire! Listing the IOU as an
asset is fundamentally what the government is doing with this
`trust fund.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perspicacious:
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the insight. Couldn't have analogized it better
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

A GUIDE TO CLEANER DRIVING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICKEY MEECE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many consumers want to know the size of a car's engine, its
horsepower, how fast it races from 0 to 60 miles an hour. They're
interested in the number of pockets, compartments and cup holders.
But do they really care about the environmental impact of the
vehicle they're thinking of buying?
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring many signs of environmental apathy, the American
Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has published the ``Green
Guide to Cars and Trucks,'' which ranks all 1998 models for
environmental friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   The higher a vehicle's ``green score'' on a scale of 0 to 100,
the higher its environmental friendliness over its lifetime. (The
average green score for 1998 was 21.) Each model is also assessed a
ranking by class.
</P>
<P>
   The objective, according to the book's authors, John DeCicco,
senior associate of the Washington-based nonprofit group, and
Martin Thomas, a research assistant, was to urge consumers to
consider environmental factors as they would price, safety and
styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people do have environmental sensibilities,'' DeCicco
said, but such information has not been available to them. The
guide thus fills a void, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 108-page soft-cover guide is available from the group for
$8.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling. More information is
available by calling (202) 429-0063 or on the Web site,
www.aceee.org/greenguide. A guide for 1999 models will be published
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The authors used data on tailpipe emissions and fuel economy,
along with an estimate of pollutants emitted during the
manufacturing process, to come up with an environmental damage
index. The index was then converted to a green score.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, the authors said, consumers could choose
cars with the highest green score. For example, Thomas said, ``even
this year and model year 1999, you can walk into dealerships and
look at four different versions of the Ford Escort.'' The same is
true of Honda Civics, he said, adding that the car that one picks
``does make a difference on the environment.'' &QL;

MOTORISTS BENEFITING FROM NATIONWIDE DECREASE IN GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Motorists out and about this Labor Day
weekend will be burning the cheapest gasoline, adjusted for
inflation, since at least World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to abundant supplies, the average price for self-service
gas in the Kansas City area this weekend is 94.1 cents a gallon.
That's about 30 cents a gallon less than Labor Day weekend a year
ago, according to the latest survey by the AAA Automobile Club of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, AAA said, the average price is $1.08 a gallon, down
18.9 cents from a year ago. In nominal terms, motorists enjoy the
lowest gasoline prices in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The news is even better for consumers when prices are adjusted
for inflation. Mike Shanahan, a spokesman for the American
Petroleum Institute in Washington, said gasoline prices are at
their lowest inflation-adjusted level since such statistics started
being compiled before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern motorists in particular are benefiting from economic
factors that have pushed down gasoline prices, according to the AAA
and the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Ackerman, a Blue Springs, Mo., motorist gassing up
Thursday, said that in his travels through the Midwest, ``Kansas
City has been one of the low ones'' in terms of price.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said he can remember paying well over $1 a gallon this
time a year ago, ``but I don't like to remember those kinds of
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The average gas price in the Midwest is $1.04 a gallon. Only the
Southwest, at $1.03 a gallon, and the Southeast, at 98 cents a
gallon, have lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The West is the most expensive, with an average price of $1.22 a
gallon. That's followed by New England at $1.08, the Mid-Atlantic
at $1.06 and the Great Lakes at $1.05.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where motorists drive in the United States, gas prices
are a fraction of those in most other industrialized nations, which
routinely tax gas far more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Sharply lower gas prices are due to a 10 percent increase in
crude oil supplies compared with a year ago and a decrease in
worldwide demand caused by the Asian financial crisis, said Mike
Right, spokesman for AAA in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major factor is the strength of the supply,'' he said.
``There is an abundance of crude oil and finished product.''
</P>
<P>
   Abundant supplies are partly a result of a decision last
November by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
increase oil production. Shortly afterward, Asia's economic woes
hit.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Iraq recently was permitted to sell crude oil on
the world market after several years of sanctions. And despite cuts
in daily production by OPEC, several members have been exceeding
the quota.
</P>
<P>
   Also, said Shanahan, Midwest states had a warmer winter than
expected and used less heating oil, adding more product on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts projected that with gasoline at such low rates,
motorists would take advantage and do more driving this summer. But
gasoline consumption did not meet those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists thought people would see prices so low they would
drive more,'' Shanahan said. ``It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAA estimates that nearly 37 million Americans will take
trips of 100 miles or more this Labor Day, up 5 percent from last
year, but not nearly enough to offset double-digit growth in
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline supplies are being boosted, in part, by improved
technology that allows for cheaper oil exploration and extraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like MRI technology _ 3-D pictures,'' Shanahan said. ``It
costs less to find and get it out of the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting glut has caused crude oil prices to fall far below
levels a year ago, Right said.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices are about $13.33 a barrel, compared with nearly
$20 a barrel a year ago. The wholesale price of gasoline is about
40 cents a gallon, compared with 70 cents a gallon a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Right noted that Saudi Arabia recently said it would cut
production, and several American refineries said they also would
cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, with a 10 percent level over last year, there is an
awful lot of product out there,'' Right said. ``But efforts to
bring supply and demand in line eventually will bring prices up.''

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Arthur Blank, the president of Home Depot, was
brimming with optimism as he left Atlanta the other day on his way
to visit his first store outside North America, a store that sits
at the foot of the snow-capped Andes, flies the Chilean flag and
houses a McDonald's franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This cultural hybrid is the beachhead for a planned expansion
that Blank hopes will take Home Depot's name-tagged orange aprons,
do-it-yourself home-improvement workshops and steady sales growth
across Chile, then to Argentina and eventually to Peru, Brazil and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be successful almost anywhere,'' Blank said. ``Over
the long haul, we are going to be a truly global company.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he stepped off the plane in Chile on Aug. 28, just a day
after the Santiago store opened, Blank was greeted by this headline
in El Mercurio, the country's leading newspaper: ``Worldwide
Landslide: Black Thursday in Latin America's Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, Home Depot, which has 679 stores in the
United States and Canada, scrapped plans to expand into Mexico,
because of a currency crisis that sent similar shivers across Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Once the region got back on track, the company was ready to test
the Latin waters again. But this time it turned to Chile, whose
expanding middle class and predictable free-market government
policies over nearly two decades have made it a model of stability
for emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now the economic pendulum may be swinging back again _ just at
the wrong time for Home Depot _ and underscoring the
vulnerabilities of even the most stolid Latin American economies to
global gyrations. Santiago's stock market, down more than 30
percent since Jan. 1 and at its lowest level in five years,
plummeted 6.2 percent on the day before Blank arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean consumers, taking their cues from the stock slump and
the worsening news from Asia and Russia, are tightening their
belts. Car sales and, more important to Home Depot, construction
starts are grinding down quickly. Local economists predict that the
unemployment rate, now at 6 percent, will climb to 8 percent in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who just a few weeks ago predicted confidently that
Chile could withstand the icy winds blowing from Asia have begun to
advise consumers to take it easy with their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian and Russian contagion has been racing through Latin
America at an accelerating rate, pushing commodity prices lower and
chasing away foreign investment dollars, trends that in turn are
forcing up interest rates. In Venezuela, for instance, short-term
bank interest rates have shot up to 120 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia devalued its currency on Wednesday, sending Latin
markets down sharply even as the region's finance ministers
traveled to Washington to tell the International Monetary Fund that
their economies were sound.
</P>
<P>
   Reassurances aside, J.P. Morgan has cut its prediction of 1999
growth for Argentina from 4 percent to 2 percent; for Brazil, whose
large economy is South America's main economic motor, the forecast
has been cut from 2 percent to minus 2 percent. Net outflows of
foreign exchange from Brazil were nearly $8 billion in August
alone.
</P>
<P>
   So is Blank worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not affect our plans at all,'' he said. In fact, he
sees an opportunity to pick up real estate for more stores at lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 40 years, 50 years, we'll be here,'' Blank said,
thumping his palms on a table in his Chilean headquarters. And when
he sees customers and employees ``with smiles on their faces, I
don't even have to work out the numbers,'' he added. ``The numbers
are going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank's gung-ho Yankee optimism has been reinforced by Home
Depot's 20 years of sensational growth _ the company's stock has
risen fortyfold over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The growth has held up in good times and bad; after all, even
when Americans stay home at vacation time to save on air fares and
hotels, they often build bookshelves or paint the den. And a
leaking roof or faucet must be repaired or replaced no matter how
much the Dow Jones industrial average falls that week.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is betting that the same verities will apply to
Chile, a country whose demographics _ one-third of the country's 15
million people are between the ages of 20 and 39 _ fit neatly into
the company's marketing strategies. Company executives were
publicly exuberant about sales and customer reaction in the first
few days after the Santiago store opened, although they refused to
release any numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Home Depot's experiment in Chile _ though
complicated at the outset by the specter of a worldwide recession _
will serve as a fascinating case study of whether a highly
successful U.S. corporation can take its winning culture abroad and
make it work despite language barriers, long supply lines and
differing customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, are the U.S. middle-class values woven into Home
Depot's image transferable to Chile, a Spanish-speaking nation half
a world away from the company's Georgia headquarters?
</P>
<P>
   Many local business executives say Home Depot is pushing an open
door. ``Chileans always say if it's American, it's good,'' said
Alexander Fernandez, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Chile. ``You can call it a mystique, a respect.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   But the answer will ultimately lie with families like the
Chilcumpas, who were so eager to shop in Home Depot on opening day
that they fought through Santiago's heavy traffic for 45 minutes in
their beat-up 1986 Dodge Colt.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Chilcumpa, 35, finished graduate school two years ago and
now teaches geology at the University of Chile. His wife, Marcela,
30, is a bookkeeper at a local finance company. Both dress in blue
jeans and wear designer sunglasses. Their 8-year-old daughter,
Mariel, says her sweetest dream is to fly to Orlando, Fla., someday
to see Disney World, as an estimated 70,000 Chileans do every year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the slowing economy just after they had a baby,
the Chilcumpas say they are watching their pesos. Still, they have
a new house on the outskirts of Santiago that they need to fix up
and furnish.
</P>
<P>
   Walking up and down the wide aisles of the new store, Chilcumpa
expressed disappointment. ``I thought I'd find American products at
a cheap price,'' he said. ``What I see is not cheap.'' Indeed, 70
percent of the store's stock is made in Chile, and prices are
comparable to those of local competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Chilcumpa was shopping for a wall mount for a television set;
what he found instead in the furnishings aisle was a mount intended
to be suspended from the ceiling. He shook his head. Just then, a
Chilean employee named Carlos came by to help, wearing a wide,
inviting smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that all you have?'' Chilcumpa asked sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, yes,'' Carlos replied. ``We're just starting, so we
are strong in some things, weak in others.''
</P>
<P>
   In other stores in Chile, or in the United States for that
matter, the exchange might have ended then and there. But this is
Home Depot, where employees are trained to listen to customers.
Carlos pulled out a pad and pen and began interviewing Chilcumpa,
asking exactly what he was looking for. He promised to forward the
information to management.
</P>
<P>
   The interchange instantly warmed Chilcumpa's mood. He slowed his
pace and wandered about the store, taking a special interest in the
displays that gave point-by-point instructions on topics like how
to fix a toilet, solder pipes or lay tiles. He stopped at a display
of 31-piece titanium drill sets, made in Taiwan, costing the
equivalent of $23 each, and put one in his cart. A sale was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely have a wide variety,'' his wife said. ``That's
what will make them successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chilcumpas then drove to a nearby outlet of Sodimac
Homecenter, a chain that is Home Depot's direct competitor here, to
find the television mount they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   As Home Depot moves from a 110-volt world where most houses are
built of wood and nails to a 220-volt world where most houses are
built of cement and metal reinforcement rods, it will have to
adjust its inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retail, no concept is 100 percent portable,'' said Enrique
Ostale, executive director of Distribucion y Servicio, a leading
Chilean supermarket and houseware chain holding company. ``They
will have to adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the record of U.S. companies is good in Chile
and the rest of Latin America, but their success in transporting
U.S.-style services and products is not guaranteed. McDonald's is a
hit everywhere, as are the minisupermarkets connected to Exxon
stations. But Sears, Roebuck flopped in Chile in the early 1980s
and pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney made some early mistakes when it put a store in the
affluent Santiago neighborhood of Las Condes in 1996. The company
misread Chilean taste, which favors simple clothes, and offered
expensive lines in the flashy colors popular in more tropical
markets like Miami and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing performance, the store replaced American
managers with local talent, put greater emphasis on less expensive
items and went after Chile's growing maternity market, offering a
huge department for expectant mothers. Sales picked up, and Penney
recently opened a second store.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has taken pains to avoid similar mistakes. It mixes
what is American and what is Chilean as carefully as its employees
mix paints to get exactly the right color.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act,'' said Bill Pena, 44, Home Depot's
regional president for Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company looked for the right management combination.
It teamed up with Falabella, an upscale Chilean department store
chain, which has a 33 percent interest in the project. Falabella
advised Home Depot on where to put stores, plugged the company into
its public relations and market research firms, and, most
important, provided a base of 2 million customers who can use their
Falabella credit cards at Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first Home Depot store is in La Florida, a sprawling
lower-middle-class Santiago neighborhood with the fastest
construction growth rate of any urban community in Chile. The
second and third Santiago stores, to open over several months, will
be in Maipu, a neighborhood similar to La Florida, and in Las
Condes. The goal for 2000 is to have five stores in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot executives said they were opening the La Florida and
Maipu stores first to send a message that the chain was
price-conscious and would appeal to the lower middle class, the
large majority of Chilean society.
</P>
<P>
   In accord with its tradition of decentralized management, Home
Depot put a Chilean in charge of its operations in the country _
Julio Campos, who, as a senior Sodimac executive, led the team that
adapted the home-center concept for Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Campos spent six months in the United States, learning Home
Depot culture. He sometimes worked in the aisles or even as a
bagger at the checkout counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked 11 years in this industry in Chile, and the first
time I soldered anything was in a store in the United States,''
Campos said. ``Most companies in Chile are very hierarchical, with
executives in ties. At Home Depot we all wear smocks, and when an
associate has a suggestion, he speaks up,'' he added, using the
company's term for an employee.
</P>
<P>
   With Campos as his guide, Pena spent more than six months
studying the Chilean market. They used focus groups and research,
but most of all they wore out shoe leather, walking through Chilean
shopping centers and hardware stores and interviewing hundreds of
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Home Depot's shelves have a different look from
those in the United States. There are fewer rugs and more ceramic
tiles. Instead of automatic garage-door openers, there are
remote-control gate openers. Concrete and metal are the
construction materials of choice, so there is a large stock of
jackhammers, welders and grinders for cutting metal.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Home Depot's U.S. suppliers have opened operations in
Chile as well, shortening supply lines as they also learn to
satisfy Chilean tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Home Depot's philosophy in the United States is sound
employee relations, and it is no different here. ``Some people
think of us as a cult or a religion, and they are right,'' Pena
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven thousand Chileans applied for just over 200 positions at
the La Florida store, and Home Depot used extensive interviews,
exams on practical math, and psychological tests to choose people
with experience and friendly, open attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The pay scale is lower than in the United States _ company
officials wouldn't say by how much _ but Chilean employees, like
American workers, can buy Home Depot stock at a 15 percent
discount, and supervisors, beginning with assistant managers,
receive stock options.
</P>
<P>
   To learn the ropes, 30 Chilean employees were sent to the United
States for three to six months to shadow their American
counterparts. Once they returned to Santiago, they helped train
their Chilean colleagues. And a group of bilingual American
managers came to Santiago to train workers and instill in them the
company's esprit de corps.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights before opening day, the store gave a party for local
employees and their families, complete with games and a barbecue;
1,600 people showed up. There was also a pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, employees here are told that they can
question management, but the sometimes aggressive, almost
confrontational approach taken in American stores to hash out ideas
has been softened to fit the more reserved personal interactions
typical in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know whether such corporate strategies will
let Home Depot eventually dominate the Chilean hardware market. But
Sodimac, which modeled itself in part on Home Depot more than a
decade ago, is taking no chances. The chain has opened more stores,
lowered prices, expanded parking lots, improved service and updated
its computerized systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid, but I do respect them,'' said Carlos Wulf
Urrutia, Sodimac's vice president for home-center operations.
``Construction activity is decelerating, and we are much more
prepared because of our long-term relationships with contractors.
Home Depot should have come two years ago. They waited too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Home
Depot's chance of success in Chile despite the economic slowdown,
saying the company has far more to gain than to lose. As Home Depot
saturates the U.S. and Canadian markets over the next 10 years,
they said, it needs to look abroad for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next eight to 12 months are iffy,'' said Francisco Chevez
of Salomon Smith Barney, ``but over the long haul the underpinnings
for this type of retailing are great in Chile and around Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Aram Rubinson, a retail analyst at Paine Webber, said that for a
chain the size of Home Depot, a less-than-expected return from five
stores in Chile ``is not even a rounding error.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From what they learn in Chile,'' he added, ``they are going to
be able to attack and succeed in some of the bigger countries of
the world.''

RWANDA EX-PRESIDENT GETS LIFE SENTENCE FOR GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ A U.N. tribunal sentenced a former prime
minister of Rwanda to life in prison Friday for his part in the
1994 genocide there, despite his agreement to plead guilty and to
testify against other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Jean Kambanda, who was prime minister for
three months in 1994 when more than 500,000 people were killed,
stood motionless in court as the president of the tribunal, Judge
Laity Kama of Senegal, told him he would spend the rest of his life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kambanda is the first person in history to be sentenced for the
crime of genocide, an offense first formally defined in the 1948
Genocide Convention after the horrors of World War II and now
incorporated into the U.N. tribunal's statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing on Friday came two days after the Rwanda tribunal
handed down the first guilty verdict by an international court for
the crime of genocide, against a former small-town mayor, Jean-Paul
Akayesu.
</P>
<P>
   Kama said the gravity of Kambanda's crimes outweighed the help
he had given to prosecutors and his willingness to accept
responsibility for what happened. On May 1, Kambanda pleaded guilty
to six counts of genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Kambanda, a 42-year-old former bank director, has described to
prosecutors in more than 90 hours of recorded testimony the inner
workings of the interim government that orchestrated the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle must always remain that the reduction in the
penalties from mitigating circumstances must in no way diminish the
gravity of the offense,'' Kama said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean Kambanda committed these crimes knowingly and with
premeditation,'' the judge added later. ``The crimes are
unacceptable because, as prime minister, Jean Kamanda had the duty
and the authority to protect the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the judge's decision to impose the maximum
penalty allowed under the tribunal's statute would make it more
difficult to persuade other defendants to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But they said Kambanda is still likely to testify in future
trials, if only to protect his wife and children, who are being
guarded by U.N. bodyguards. In addition, they said, the court can
reduce Kambanda's sentence in the future in light of the testimony
he gives against his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``His main concern has been the protection of his family,'' a
senior prosecutor, Mohammed Othman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials and genocide survivors welcomed the sentence,
though some said they regretted that the tribunal could not order
Kambanda's execution.
</P>
<P>
   One Rwandan diplomat said Kambanda's confession that the interim
government had organized and carried out the genocide was
gratifying, since many Hutu leaders still deny that the state
sponsored the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who is being sentenced was a key player in the
whole genocide,'' the diplomat, Joy Mukanyange, said. ``In a way he
has convicted the entire government of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a presentencing hearing on Thursday, a defense lawyer
portrayed Kambanda as an unwilling puppet whom Hutu militants had
coerced to lead the government in the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Oliver Michael Inglis, said Hutu militants had
drafted Kambanda against his will to become prime minister shortly
after a plane carrying the Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana,
was shot down near Kigali, the capital, on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Habyarimana's death marked the beginning of the genocide, but it
was also in effect a coup by hard-line Hutu militants. After four
years of intermittent fighting, Habyarimana and Tutsi rebels had
just concluded a peace agreement and agreed to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Hutu militants had seized the government,
assassinated several moderate Hutu politicians, forced Belgian
peacekeeping troops to withdraw by killing 10 of them, and ordered
militias to start massacres of Tutsi civilians. Almost
simultaneously, the civil war between the government and Tutsi
rebels in the north resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Kambanda was at the heart of the interim government that
orchestrated the killings before being defeated in July by the
Tutsi rebels and forced into exile in Zaire (now Congo).
</P>
<P>
   An economist and banker from the town of Butare, Kambanda was a
well-known politician in the radical wing of the Democratic Popular
Movement, one of the main Hutu parties.
</P>
<P>
   The coup leaders chose him to become prime minister on April 8,
and for three months he served as the chairman of a council of
ministers who, along with senior military officials and militia
leaders, planned and carried out massacres of Tutsi across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Thursday, Inglis said Kambanda had had no
choice. He said the Hutu military leaders who had seized the
government dragged Kambanda out of his bank position and forced him
to serve to give their government legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis pointed out that military bodyguards accompanied Kambanda
wherever he went. The defense lawyer said Kambanda had agreed to do
what the militants asked, because he feared for his family's
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have any hand in the planning of the gruesome
events that had taken place,'' Inglis told the court. ``Everything
had already been prepared and packaged for him for delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused was trapped and made a puppet,'' Inglis added. ``A
puppet has no will of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors maintain Kambanda was not only a willing member
of the government that oversaw the genocide, but became its main
spokesman. He traveled throughout the country, visiting places
where massacres were taking place, and gave inflammatory speeches
that encouraged people to kill Tutsi, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of speeches, recorded speeches, that he made,
which we think amounted to a direct call to people to commit
genocide,'' the senior prosecutor, Othman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kambanda also signed directives legalizing the murderous gangs
of militiamen and personally distributed arms to them, knowing they
would be used to commit massacres, prosecutors said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister admitted he dismissed the local Tutsi
governor in his home region, Butare, and replaced him with a
radical Hutu official, who organized the killings of Tutsi
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most chilling charge Kambanda has acknowledged
is that he chaired a meeting in Kibuye in May 1994, at which local
officials asked him to save dozens of Tutsi children who had
survived a massacre and were hiding in a local hospital. Kambanda
did nothing to help them. They were killed later that day.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tutsi rebels defeated the government army and stopped
the killings, Kambanda fled into Zaire with thousands of other Hutu
refugees in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where he was arrested in July
1997 along with several other high-ranking former government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest, Kambanda has provided prosecutors with
critical information about what happened in Cabinet meetings and
meetings with military officials during the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, prosecutors at the tribunal see Kambanda as the
key to several cases in which they hope to prove that the genocide
was a state-orchestrated event, a vast conspiracy planned by senior
military officers, politicians and militant Hutu journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can say is that what he has told us in general terms
confirms our theory,'' Othman said. ``That the genocide is the
result of a criminal conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Othman said Kambanda is expected to be a star witness at several
future trials. Prosecutors say he can give testimony about what top
officials knew about the killings going on in remote regions and
how they planned the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we would know the deliberations of top
decision makers without someone who participated in the meetings,''
he said. ``He chaired the meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Among survivors of the genocide, there is little doubt Kambanda
was a driving force behind the killings. Alice Karakezi, an
advocate for survivors who has followed the trial closely, sat in
the court on Thursday. As she listened to Kama's summation of
Kambanda's crimes, she said, she could see images of Kambanda
during the genocide, dressed in military fatigues, handing out
weapons, urging people to kill ``accomplices'' of the rebels, a
euphemism for Tutsi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really be satisfied you know,'' she said after the
sentencing. ``Life imprisonment. So what? People who are dead won't
come back again.''

NORTH KOREA SAYS IT WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED OF TESTING A MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea said Friday that the purpose of its
launching on Monday of a two-stage rocket was to carry a satellite
into orbit, not to test a missile. It denounced Japan and other
countries for jumping to the conclusion that it was launching a new
class of missile.
</P>
<P>
   Military and scientific experts in the United States, Japan and
South Korea immediately began reviewing their data, but their
initial reaction to the North Korean announcement was deep
skepticism. Officials said that they had not detected any new
satellite and that they were reasonably sure that what they had
monitored was a missile test.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that if it had been a
satellite, Japanese technology should have been able to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we cannot consider that this was a launch of a
satellite,'' a Japanese National Defense Agency official told NHK
television in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of the two-stage rocket caused deep alarm in Japan
and provoked a chorus of denunciation in Tokyo and Washington. The
rocket passed over Japan, with the first stage dropping into the
sea before reaching Japan and the second stage dropping in the
ocean on the other side, and the idea of a North Korean rocket
whizzing overhead gave the Japanese people a new and more immediate
sense of their vulnerability to enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missiles are not considered particularly useful
militarily, because they are quite inaccurate and could not
dependably hit their targets. But the test provoked concern among
some experts because it suggested that the missiles could now, for
the first time, reach any part of Japan, including Tokyo, and
because it indicated that North Korea had worked out the technology
for multi-stage rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean an initial range of about 1,000 miles for a
one-ton payload, but by improving the technology and lightening the
load, North Korea might in the coming years develop
intercontinental ballistic missiles and threaten U.S. soil. Since
North Korea is believed to have some nuclear weapons and huge
stocks of chemical weapons, the missile technology has aroused
fears of the payload that the missiles could carry.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket launching on Monday came at a time of growing
international exasperation with North Korea, and politicians in
Tokyo and Washington alike seemed ready to put more pressure on the
North Korean government. North Korea had not previously commented
on the launching, although it had complained that Japanese critics
did not know what they were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in launching the
first artificial satellite aboard a multi-stage rocket into
orbit,'' the official Korean Central News Agency declared in
Friday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal
revolutionary hymns Song of General Kim Il Sung and Song of General
Kim Jong Il,'' the dispatch said. Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994,
was North Korea's longtime ruler. His son, Kim Jong Il, now rules
the country and is expected to be appointed president in the coming

   ``The successful launching of the first artificial satellite in
the DPRK,'' the wire said, referring to North Korea, ``greatly
encourages the Korean people in the efforts to build a powerful
socialist state under the wise leadership of the Great Leader Kim
Jong Il.''
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea has almost no credibility among neighboring
countries, officials did not quite rule out the possibility that
North Korea was telling the truth about a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to verify whether North Korea fired its
missile for satellite purposes,'' said Kim Young Min, a spokesman
for South Korea's Unification Ministry. ``I don't think we will be
able to verify that fact in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior government official said there was no
question that North Korea fired a Taepodong-1 missile on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that even if the missile did
carry a satellite, the launching remained a grave concern for the
administration because of the technological advances it
demonstrated. ``No matter the purpose, it demonstrated the
capability to deliver a weapons payload against surface targets at
medium ranges,'' the official said.

   SUNDAY MARKETS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The AJC is planning a package for this Sunday examining whether
the stock market volatility has altered consumer behavior, as well
as the plans of businesses that are directly affected by the whims
of consumers. Early reporting indicates that consumer confidence is
eroding, but other forces are probably more important than concerns
about the market. There's no doubt, however, that the market news
will reinforce some negative trends that were already at work. A
budget with all of the stories and visual elements that will run in
this package will move on the Cox wire. A CoxNet repackaged page
has been created and posted on the Cox server. Please call CoxNet
at 404-526-5456.

   PRISONER-BERENSON _ MIAMI _ ``President Clinton visited with
Monica Lewinsky on 37 occasions, but he can't see us once,'' said
Mark Berenson, his voice trembling with anger. For the last two and
a half years, the New Yorker and his wife, Rhoda Berenson, have
worked to free their daughter, Lori Berenson, from a windowless
prison some 500 miles outside Lima, Peru, where she's serving a
life sentence for treason. The 28-year-old MIT graduate was
convicted in 1996 of plotting to take over Peru's Congress by
hooded judges during a secret trial. The Berensons have tried
repeatedly to see Clinton, who has asked Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori to review their daughter's case. I will visit in New York
with the couple, who will be just back from a visit with their
daughter at the prison, located 12,700 feet above sea level. I will
also visit with other members of Lori Berenson's family, who live
in Palm Beach, Florida. Story will focus on the family's plight to
win their daughter's freedom, and where Lori Berenson's case stands
now. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   POOR-SUBURBS _ WASHINGTON _ The economy is booming, but not for
everybody. Two decades of declining wages have squeezed the middle
class and flattened the poor. Nowhere is this trend more apparent
than in suburbia, where the Cleavers have given way to the Joads,
with little or no social safety net left. (Shepard and Jaspin, Cox

Elizabeth Stoner has become a household name in Mississippi. She

casinos to a statewide vote, giving Mississippians a chance to kick
the casinos out. If they vote to ban gambling, the 30 riverboats
docked in eight counties along the Mississippi River and the Gulf

   BINGO _ ROCK HILL, S.C. - The Indian tribe that didn't really

raking in about $2 million a month at the largest bingo operation
on the Eastern Seaboard. Located in a former Sears Roebuck store on
the edge of this college town, Catawba Bingo offers games every day
except Sunday, luring thousands of folks from all over the
Southeast. On Big Games days, twice each month, the payout is
$200,000 with one game worth $50,000. Folks arrive as early as 10
a.m. for the start of the 1 p.m. games. ``We're doing quite well,''
said Wanda George Warren, the Catawba Indian Nation's executive
director. (Riddle, AJC freelancer; not for use by NYT clients).

   LABOR _ The labor movement in the Miami Valley and United States
has been on the decline for about two decades. Nearly every major
independent union has seen a drastic decline in membership while
battling with massive private employers like the General Motors
Corp. In fact, some labor experts believe the labor movement is
nothing but a myth. And results from a recent Dayton Daily
News/Springfield News-Sun poll show residents also believe unions
are losing power. Nearly half of the poll's 503 respondents believe
labor unions will become weaker in the Miami Valley over the next
10 years. And nearly 80 percent of the people polled believe
companies will continue to export more jobs during the same period.
The poll shows that people in the Dayton-area are becoming less
sympathetic towards labor unions. We talk with poll respondents,
labor leaders, workers, labor experts and others about the problems
facing unions and what organized labor is doing to reverse its
decline in membership and support. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News).

   GM _ Who got hurt most by the recent United Auto Workers strike
against the General Motors Corp in Flint, Mich.? The automaker and
company endured about the same amount of pain, according to Miami
Valley residents responding to the Dayton Daily News/Springfield
News-Sun labor poll. Surprisingly, more people from union
households believe one of the costliest strikes in U.S. history
hurt the UAW more than the company. The poll results reflect the
opinions of most labor and Wall Street analysts who said neither
side won the 54-day strike labor dispute which idled nearly 200,000
workers and shut down GM's North American production. (Wagner,

at London's World Chicken Festival. Chew on that name a moment: not
the London Chicken Festival or the Kentucky Chicken Festival _ the
World Chicken Festival. Where does a town in a state that produces
a smigen of the poultry produced in Georgia or Arkansas get off
staging an event with such a preposterously boastful name? The
justification lies in a former resident who made good, a tough old

after they documented the influence of money in state politics, the

   TRAVEL-VIETNAM - Before I visited Vietnam, I took a look at the
Web site of the Vietnamese embassy in Washington. The Vietnamese
must have thought some re-education was called for when the nations
resumed diplomatic ties in 1995, because the first sentence that
popped up on my screen was this: ``Vietnam is a country, not a
war.'' Vietnam is indeed more that the sum of its battles. It is an
ancient country with a distinctive culture and a natural beauty
that runs from mountains to vast river deltas to a serpentine coast
that has more beachfront than California. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

   With the kickoff of the NFL season on Sunday, CoxNet will begin
posting The Journal-Constitution's two weekly NFL pages _ a preview
page and an Inside the NFL page _ every Saturday beginning this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The preview page will feature a standings box and a capsule
preview of the games on Sunday and the Monday night game. It will
be posted by 2 p.m. EDT each Saturday during the regular season and
is for use that Sunday. The format for this year's page will
include the equivalent of one column in ads. The AJC has asked for
the ad stack to be a strip across the bottom of the page each week,
but there is no guarantee that the ad stack will be in that
position or will be the same from week-to-week. If the capsules and
standings box are ready on Friday night, CoxNet will post the page
then without a story. This early posting will allow papers that are
using it to pull it into their systems as early as possible. In
this case, other Cox papers would have the option of waiting for
the story to move on the Sports wire or of filling the text hole
with another story, such as one about a team in their circulation
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Inside the NFL page will look much the same as the AJC's
Inside Baseball and Inside the NBA pages with conference briefs on
the outside rails and league feature stories in the middle four
columns. This page will be posted on the Cox server by 3 p.m. EDT
each Saturday during the regular season and is also for use that
Sunday.

CLINTON'S VISIT TO DUBLIN IS MORE LOW-KEY THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Harassed but smiling and even joking,
President Clinton returned to Dublin on Friday, as he promised he
would on his first trip here in December 1995. But Friday's visit
was very different.
</P>
<P>
   The last time, he was thunderously cheered by thousands as he
spoke at College Green, near Trinity College, of the possibility of
a new peace in Northern Ireland. The sun was shining and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, stood by him and waved to the crowd, which
waved hundreds of American flags back at them.
</P>
<P>
   He was an American hero, with some Irish roots who reminded many
Irish people of President John F. Kennedy: youthful, handsome,
articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at a reception for labor leaders and business
executives, Clinton looked back fondly to that visit, saying ``it's
great to be back in Dublin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is a little rain in the air today,'' he
continued, ``it's always bright and sunny for me here. The day that
we were in College Green in 1995 will go down for me as one of the
great days of my presidency and, indeed, one of the great days of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Clinton did not go out in the cold rain to shake
hands. He attended only indoor events with Irish politicians and a
few hundred workers at a American-owned computer factory. Mrs.
Clinton was either missing or out of television camera range.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, the president was warmly applauded, and none of
the Irish people he met brought up awkward personal questions or
made complaints about his order for a missile attack on a
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government and most Irish men and women apparently
felt it would be churlish to attack Clinton for his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Callers to radio talk shows said they were
happy he was back, that without him there would be no peace in
Northern Ireland, and that his peace effort had in effect saved
several hundred lives.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing about the visit that bothered them, it seemed,
were the traffic jams in downtown Dublin caused by the closing of
main thoroughfares for security. In central Dublin, manhole covers
were being sealed and street-light poles taped shut with steel
bands to prevent the implantation of bombs. People looking out a
window at the motorcade said they had been told by Americans with
short hair and in dark suits that it was all right to look, but not
to open the window.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen people stood across from government Buildings, where
Clinton met Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and waved signs of
protest over the Sudan bombing, which was heavily criticized here.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Times, which often criticizes U.S. policy, said in an
editorial that Ahern should have expressed reservations about the
Sudan attack in his meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jim Steinberg said he had
no knowledge that Ahern had done so, asserting only that the prime
minister had expressed understanding of the responsibility the
United States has to combat terrorism around the world. Of the
Lewinsky issue, the newspaper said that ``most Irish people would
share the general view in Europe that the affair has been abused by
his opponents and blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's visit, Clinton used Irish writers to make some
of his points, quoting James Joyce, for example: ``History is a
nightmare from which I am trying to awaken.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gateway computer factory, Clinton was greeted with
several hundred cheering, flag-waving employees, a faint reminder
of the thousands in the streets on the first visit.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton and Ahern issued an electronic communique using
``smart cards,'' Clinton tried a joke: He said nowadays everything
is done by computer and that in the future ``we'll have virtual
presidents, virtual Prime Ministers, virtual everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Foreign Minister Dick Spring had some kind words
discussing the golf he is scheduled to play with Clinton on
Saturday in Ballybunnion, in the west of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his handicap is 13 or 14,'' said Spring, a good
golfer. Asked if he would ever consider playing poorly to let the
visitor win, Spring said, ``I don't think so. There will be honor
among politicians.''

   Trash Is Her Bag
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trash inspired Leah Singer to start her own
newspaper. Working as a freelance graphic artist, she was
captivated by Rubyliths _ orange acrylic masking films used by
commercial artists to make silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   She dug some out of a wastebasket and, she said, ``fell in love
with them _ they were so strange.'' She collected silhouettes
including a Buddha, a roller skater and a woman with a gun, and
produced 1,000 copies of a 16-page all-graphics ``newspaper''
called Copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are accessible and cheap, and yet they hold so much
meaning,'' Ms. Singer said. Copy, printed on newsprint, sells for
$8 in outlets like Printed Matter (77 Wooster St., near Spring
Street) and Alleged Gallery (28 Prince St., near Mott Street;
closed until Sept. 14).
</P>
<P>
   But the idea has expanded. She started silk-screening the
silhouettes on canvas bags. (If public television can have tote
bags, why not Copy?)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had them for two or three months, and I've sold more
than 50,'' said Aaron Rose, owner of Alleged, to ``everyone from
young fashionable kids to tourists to fashion ladies.'' Steven
Meisel stopped by Alleged twice for photo shoots, and twice the
bags appeared in fashion photos in American Vogue and Italian
Vogue. The gnomic images of the gun girl and the Buddha are popular
with Japanese tourists in San Francisco, where the bags are $20 at
the Mac clothing store. Bags can be ordered from Ms. Singer at
(212) 587-1337.

   Frogs Hit the Charts
</P>
<P>
   Cold-blooded they may be, but frogs have never been hotter. In
May, alarm over frog populations caused Congress to form the Task
Force for Amphibian Decline and Deformities. Now frogs are going
from popular cause to radio sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Folkways Smithsonian has just rereleased ``Sounds of North
American Frogs'' _ field recordings that include the sounds of 57
species, among them the confident growl of the Florida gopher frog
and the paranoid honk of the green tree frog.
</P>
<P>
   The odd selection, first issued in 1958, is getting rotations on
a few rock stations and is No. 166 on the College Music Journal's
current chart (sandwiched between Arab Strap's ``Philophobia'' and
the Dave Matthews Band's ``Before These Crowded Streets''). Tony
Seeger, the Folkways curator and director, can't believe the
response, nor figure out what artist or genre to list the disk
under. ``It's certainly not folk,'' he said. ``It isn't rock. We
thought we'd put it under Various Amphibians.''
</P>
<P>
   Folkways has been approached by one composer who wants to
include frog sounds in his next piece, but he's not the first. The
hip-hop turntable team known as the Invisibl Scratch Piklz beat him
to it with the repetitive croak on its coming release ``The Friggar
Shiggar Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk Snowball Fete
</P>
<P>
   The lines formed as usual on a recent summer night outside Bond
Street and Bowery Bar. What was unexpected was the action around
the corner, on the patch of sidewalk in front of Guru, a
flavored-snowball stand. On some Thursdays, Mary Frey, Guru's
owner, hauls out a turntable and transforms this dark industrial
stretch of Lafayette Street into a yard-style party, where players
on the downtown scene like the Beastie Boys and Chloe Sevigny hang
out, listen to dub music and help themselves to free pomegranate
and coconut snowballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just friends, really,'' said Ms. Frey, describing a
recent Guru crowd that included Mario Sorrenti, a fashion
photographer; the former Deee-Lite singer Lady Miss Kier; Mary
Schecter, a rock-star stylist, and Ms. Frey's four-year-old
Rottweiler, for whom Guru is named.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frey used to work the door at nightclubs like Save the
Robots, but Guru has a door policy more akin to yard parties in her
native New Orleans: no velvet ropes, no cover charge. Celebrities
are more likely to arrive by skateboard than limousine.
</P>
<P>
   But without a VIP room, how to keep the party from being overrun
by passers-by? ``Whoever feels it knows it,'' said Joe Hova, who is
Guru's deejay and was a childhood friend of Ms. Frey. ``And if it
gets too crowded, we skip a few weeks.''

   Surf on Seventh
</P>
<P>
   Seventh Avenue's going surfing. Designers, stylists and fashion
executives are catching the surf craze, and not just by making
beachy clothes. Camp Pascowitz, a family-run surf camp at San
Onofre State Beach in California, counts movie executives and rock
stars (Perry Farrell, Chris Isaak, Flea and his daughter) among its
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is noticing an influx of would-be boarders from the
East Coast, particularly the garment trade, said Izzy Pascowitz,
the owner. ``We've had this huge draw of fashion people,'' he said.
``Editors, executives from Versace and Louis Vuitton, the marketing
director of Hugo Boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylish New Yorkers aren't the only ones who have realized that
just looking like a surfer doesn't cut it anymore. Any day now the
Pascowitzes are expecting the beach-blond Hanson family. ``They
look like such surfers,'' Pascowitz said of the band, which is from
Oklahoma. ``It's a pity they don't actually surf.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN STANDARD WOULD RAISE MORAL BAR FOR OFFICE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman's admonishments that the
president has no private life and must stand as a moral exemplar
carry profound implications for those who hold and seek the
nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   With one sobering speech from the Senate floor, the longtime
ally of President Clinton lifted the White House sex and deception
scandal beyond party and politics to what the Connecticut Democrat
called the ``bright lines of right and wrong in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he implicitly offered Americans a choice between
two standards for their president.
</P>
<P>
   The public can choose to brush aside Clinton's admitted
misconduct with a former White House intern as irrelevant so long
as they approve of his administration of national and international
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lieberman urged in impassioned words Thursday, they can
accept that a ripple effect goes from the White House to the
children who are now asking their parents troubling questions about
the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a role model who, because of his prominence
and the moral authority that emanates from his office, sets
standards of behavior for the people he serves,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has insisted that he is entitled to some
privacy, his friend declared that no president has a private life
in these times of all-news 24-hour cable networks. Moreover,
Lieberman said that the personal example is essential now that
``our society's standards are sinking, that our common moral code
is deteriorating and that our public life is coarsening.''
</P>
<P>
   By that reasoning, the president becomes responsible not just
for public policy on taxes and budgets and diplomacy, but for
setting the tone to counter disintegrating families and
out-of-wedlock births that now account for almost one in every
three new babies. He helps set the example for sexual mores of
teenagers and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman blasted Clinton for behavior that ``sends a message of
what is acceptable behavior to the larger American family,
particularly to our children, which is as influential as the
negative messages communicated by the entertainment culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman model, if accepted by the public, would raise the
bar of qualifications for presidents, recalling predictions made
earlier this year by William Bennett, who served in two Republican
cabinets and has written extensively on public morality. Soon after
the news first broke of the sexual liaison between Clinton and
former-intern Monica Lewinsky, Bennett said that the heightened
scrutiny of character means that any Republican who seeks the
presidency in 2000 had better have been faithful in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've committed adultery, I don't think you're going to
get the nomination,'' he said, citing the increased scrutiny of
candidates in the aftermath of the Clinton sex controversy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some past presidents have not held to high standards
of personal conduct. John F. Kennedy, his former Secret Service
guards have now revealed, brought prostitutes into the White House,
and his escapades with a Mafia girlfriend are well documented.
Lyndon B. Johnson is widely quoted as bragging that he had more
infidelities than Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But in those cases the public was unaware of the
behind-the-scenes conduct until much later. In the Clinton case,
the behavior has already been disclosed in increasingly grim
detail, forcing the public to make the difficult judgment on what
it expects from its chief executive while he's still in office. The
public's verdict now will set the rules not only for this president
but for future ones.

TIGHT ENDS SHARPE, COATES NO LONGER UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DOVE VALLEY, Colo. _ At first, Shannon Sharpe said he was too
busy to sit and talk. This brought a chuckle. Are the Rocky
Mountains too tall to climb? Too steep to ski? There are certain
givens in Denver, and Shannon Sharpe talking is more of a certainty
than snow falling upon Vail or Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   But then the subject of Ben Coates was brought up, and 15
minutes later, Shannon Sharpe was still talking. Coates and Sharpe
not only are the two best tight ends in football but the closest of
pals. Coates is ``my closest friend in the NFL,'' Sharpe said,
``outside of the guys here in this locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendship goes back more than a decade, to when Sharpe took
Coates on his recruiting trip to Sharpe's school, Savannah State,
and gave Coates the obligatory tour of the tiny campus in Georgia.
He added some typical Shannon Sharpe words. ``I told Ben he'd be
making a very wise decision not coming because he'd be sitting on
the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   More chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Two unknown tight ends at an unknown school who, less than a
decade later, would become the best in football, Sharpe with the
Broncos and Coates with their opponents in Monday night's season
opener, the Patriots? This needed elaboration. Sharpe, the
extrovert's extrovert, now was more true to his nature and told
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hung around,'' said Sharpe of that recruiting trip,
``and I pretty much joked. I've been joking all my life. I was
clowning around with a few guys, but I also gave Ben the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ben the coaches were going to be moving me to tight end
and I told Ben I wasn't about to sit on the bench because I had sat
on the bench pretty much my freshman year,'' said Sharpe. ``And I
knew they were going to move me to tight end my sophomore year, so
I was pretty honest with Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   How honest?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ben, `If you come here, unless you plan on moving
outside (to wide receiver), the likelihood of you starting is not
very good,''' Sharpe went on. ``I told Ben, `I'm going to be honest
with you _ I don't think you can beat me out.' So Ben made a great
decision going to Livingstone (College in North Carolina).''
</P>
<P>
   So Sharpe had the tight end position to himself at Savannah
State and Coates made his mark at tiny Livingstone, and the two
teams never met on the football field. Good thing, too, joked
Sharpe, ``because my team would have killed his.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the two unknowns from the unknown colleges were
drafted, Sharpe in the seventh round in 1990, Coates in the fifth
round in 1992. Sharpe said he never dreamed that he would become
what he became with the Broncos, just as he never thought Coates
would become what he became with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to small schools like we did, you have desires
just like the guy who goes to Nebraska and just like the guy who
goes to Penn State,'' said Sharpe. Here he punctuated each word
with emotion: ``... But you know ... you ... have ... to ... be ...
so ... much ... better ... than those guys just to get a little
mention.''
</P>
<P>
   If he and Coates had put up similar numbers at major football
schools, they both would have been first-round picks, said Sharpe.
``But just to get (pro scouts) to come down to schools like ours
and time you in the 40, just to get guys to come on down and watch
you on film ... so Ben going to Livingstone, which is smaller than
even Savannah State, no way in my mind did I ever think that him _
or myself _ would be in the position we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Coates ``talk all the time'' about how far they've come,
Sharpe said, and ``we realize that guys coming from smaller schools
have to work harder. We have no problem with that. We didn't have
the boosters giving us cars. We didn't have the luxuries that the
Division 1 schools have.'' So when they got to their pro camps, he
and Coates ``wanted to show we deserved to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, years after becoming John Elway's favorite target
and years after being recognized as one of the NFL's best, Sharpe
still feels that old insecurity that comes with being the product
of a small school. ``I still feel I have to go out there week in
and week out and show everybody that I'm still a good football
player and I deserve to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sharpe had told the world how he had put Coates on the
straight and narrow by advising him he had no shot to play at
Savannah State, Sharpe was asked if Coates ever had given him
anything. ``Advice,'' said Sharpe with a laugh. ```Stay out of
trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   And who is the better of the two, an argument that has divided
pro football for years?
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, as usual, was quick on the draw with his reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Ben are every competitive and we always talk about
it,'' he said. ``And I always say to Ben, `As long as my team wins,
I'm the better tight end.' So no matter what he says _ Ben can
catch 200 passes, but if my team beats his, I'm the better tight
end.''

NOTRE DAME FIGHTING IMAGE AS WELL AS MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ They held a pep rally here Friday night, as
they do before every Notre Dame home game. It featured the usual
words, fight songs, brave talk about beating the visitor _ in this
case, Michigan in the season opener Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If you looked around the stadium and the campus that still is
one of the most serene spots anywhere, you would think that not a
whole lot has changed at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The past several months have been tumultuous. Instead of pep
rallies, we were told of peep shows. Instead of fight songs, we
heard of lawsuits being filed, charges and countercharges
exchanged, and dirty laundry hanging all over the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in the glorious history of Irish football has the
beginning of a season been so welcomed, so anticipated. And it's
not because the Irish will challenge for the national championship.
A decade after its last national title, Notre Dame football is
still renovating.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a far more attractive diversion than the events
of the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   The tawdry saga started with an ugly age discrimination suit
filed by former offensive line coach Joe Moore when new head coach
Bob Davie fired him last season.
</P>
<P>
   In court testimony, it was revealed that Davie had questioned
his predecessor, Lou Holtz's, mental stability, and that members of
the football team had been peeping Toms while two cheerleaders were
engaging in sex on the team's trip to Ireland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After that coutroom episode came charges that Fighting Irish
players had accepted gifts from a booster, which led to
embezzlement charges against Kimberly Dunbar, who the NCAA
determined had been acting as a school representative while a
member of the now-disbanded Notre Dame Quarterback Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of college athletics' sleazy side, this was not a
stop-the-presses situation. Lots of little things added up to a
large blemish. Happens a lot in big-time college sports. But the
perception had been that Notre Dame was different, better if you
will, able to stay above the slime and still compete at the highest
level.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame maintains that its athletic mission has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a situation where the program has fallen apart,''
said athletic director Mike Wadsworth, who nevertheless has had to
do some severe damage control in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth says that in one sense, Notre Dame was in a no-win
situation, particularly in the case involving Moore, which did more
damage through the revelations in court than through the judgment
against the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had settled (without a trial), some people woud have
called it hush money,'' said Wadsworth. ``They would have said,
`Here's a school so paranoid about nobody knowing what's going on
on their campus and trying to conceal it that they will let
themselves be held up.' That to me would be tarnishing the dome.
That to me would have been a very unhealthy position to have. To
me, that would have been the story.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all this was Davie, Notre Dame's second-year
coach, coming off a 7-6 debut and telling people that the cupboard
when he took over from Holtz had not exactly been overstocked.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the public relations hits, Davie did not want to
deal with any more distractions. Talking about his football
problems was almost a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things around here are a lot better than people might think,''
he said. ``That's the one good thing about being around the
players. It provides a source of reality. We do focus on the things
that are most important, and that's putting a football team on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, what happened over the spring and summer may
have helped the football team, especially if the coaching staff
develops an us-against-them mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Notre Dame held up to a higher standard?'' said offensive
tackle Mike Rosenthal, who was put in the awkward position of
giving damaging testimony against Davie in the Moore suit. ``I hold
myself to a higher standard, and everyone who comes here does the
same. It's not that we think we're better. It's just important to
the people who come here to try to be the best in everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Notre Dame, everything is in the spotlight. Everything that
happens gets magnified. That's the good and the bad. If you're
going to accept the good, you have to accept the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth says he has learned some lessons in the past several
months. ``The basic program hasn't changed,'' he said. ``Bob Davie
through all of this has borne out what we expected from Bob from
the time we hired him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wadsworth paused. ``What it does make you is very careful
of the quality of people you have on your staff,'' he said. ``You
have to have people you can be very open with. If you've got the
right people, then you're not going to be second-guessed about what
you say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is that if somebody has done something wrong,
you get rid of them. You don't live with it. Because if you live
with it, ultimately, then it's going to be a huge embarrassment to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie says he is wiser than he was a year ago, if not wearier.
``You learn to worry about the things you can control,'' he said.
``There are certain things you can't change. I want to feel good. I
want to look at the future and be positive. There is no sense
looking in the past because we can't change it. We really do have a
lot of positives going for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie knows that beginning this afternoon, Notre Dame's
motivation for winning will be obvious each week. ``We've got a
schedule, the first four teams beat us (last season),'' he said.
``That ought to motivate us. We've worked our tails off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people expect much from the Irish this season, although
they still are ranked in the Top 25. Davie says that is fine with
him. Better to overchieve in people's minds than underachieve.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first test of how Notre Dame has weathered its
spring and summer of discontent. Michigan is not only the defending
national cochampion but a longtime rival with Top 10 talent. If
nothing else, the game will give Irish followers something to focus
on other than the sideshows.

CARTER HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Even now, two seasons after his departure,
we are sometimes reminded of the influence Bill Parcells wielded in
New England. Consider the case of Tony Carter, the 5-foot-11-inch,
235-pound fullback from the Chicago Bears whom the Patriots signed
as a free agent during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Carter and whom do you think of? You think of Sam Gash.
You realize that Carter is replacing Gash, who became something of
an icon in these parts simply because Parcells singled him out in
his postgame speech after the Patriots won the AFC championship in
1997, saluting Gash's contributions even though he had been injured
late in the season and had been unable to participate in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Before Parcells extolled him on the field at Foxboro Stadium,
Gash was considered a good player, a rugged blocker who wore down
linebackers and helped make the running game go. Still, he was just
another blue-collar, hardworking player.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells's words raised the bar for Gash, who was unable to live
up to such a lofty endorsement after he returned from his injury
and eventually departed to the Buffalo Bills as a free agent. It
also raises the bar for Carter, who knew Gash only as a player
other NFL fullbacks respected. Carter knew nothing of Parcells's
fondness for Gash, nor did he know that much of the current
Patriots coaching staff had a less glowing opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of it mattered. Carter had his own problems, having
been replaced as a starter in Chicago by Raymont Harris. He wanted
to go somewhere he could be a pure fullback again, a place where he
might even get to carry the ball from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Carter signed a three-year deal worth $2.7
million with an $800,000 bonus last spring after the Patriots
decided they did not want to pay Gash anywhere near that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Carter considered Buffalo as his other option in
urestricted free agency but wanted to cast his lot with a
legitimate contender after his experience with the woeful Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the front man for an inexperienced running corps, but a
big part of the Patriots' attack.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is not considered a Gash-type fullback who can wear down
the opposition, though a couple of the players he blocked in the
exhibition season are still trying to find the license number of
the truck that hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking was ``something I've been asked to work on more when I
came to Chicago,'' said the former University of Minnesota star.
``I've been working on it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   When he signed with the Patriots, he thought he would be the
lead blocker for Curtis Martin. But Martin went to the New York
Jets after the Patriots failed to match an offer sheet to the
restricted free agent. Now Carter will be trying to clear the way
for Sedrick Shaw, who will start Monday night's season opener in
Denver, and rookie Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The fullback-halfback relationship is important. Martin relied
on Gash to blast into the defensive line and pick off a linebacker.
Now Shaw and Edwards rely on Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to do my job with the same mentality,'' said
Carter. ``It makes it a little easier. The longer you play with
somebody, the better you work together. You get that feeling that
you know what the other guy is going to do before he even does it.
We're still working on that end of it with the two new guys. But
the longer we're together, that will come naturally in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates have already commented on Carter's toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Tony was a good blocker because we had seen enough of
him in games to see that,'' said Bobby Grier, the Patriots' vice
president of player personnel, ``but we didn't know what an animal
he was on special teams. That part has been an eye-opener to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said that in the new Ernie Zampese offense, Carter won't
be in on every play, which will give him time to rest for
special-team cover situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some wear and tear, but I'll be limited on special-teams
plays,'' said Carter. ``With the role I'm asked to play, I'll be in
there 5-10 plays per game, so it shouldn't be too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots feel Carter is a better receiver than Gash. Carter
seems to be able to gain more after the catch than Gash, though two
years ago, Gash led the team in that category and in 1997, Carter
had an off year with 24 catches for 152 yards in the reconfigured
Bears offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to catch a lot of passes in the backfield,'' said
Carter. ``We've been trying to get the ball downfield and stretch
the defenses. But as the season starts, I hope to be able to catch
a few passes and contribute that way. I think that's a strong part
of my game that will develop in time as Drew (Bledsoe) gets used to
me and I prove that I can catch the ball and do something with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also used Carter a couple of times in the
exhibition season on running plays. Since most of the running plays
are derived from the Dallas offense Zampese used to oversee, Carter
is basically New England's answer to Daryl ``Moose'' Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a whole lot of running plays, but there's a
few,'' said Carter. ``It's a matter of whether or not they'll call
them. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to do some of that. I could
definitely contribute like that where I could stuff it up there on
third and 1 and keep a drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unexpected for a fullback to run with the ball
in this league now because fullbacks are basically blockers. But I
I think it helps level off the offense and balances things out and
keeps the defense guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter hasn't been involved in many games like the one coming up
in Denver, but ``as a player, those are the games you want to play
in,'' he said. ``It's Monday night, everybody's watching, and
they're the world champions. We can show them and the country
something about us with the way we perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter can show a lot about himself as well. The Patriots say
they don't have to worry about the fullback position. But the true
test is ahead.

   MARKET (New York) _ The stock market flirted with the bears
again Friday, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell below where
it closed Monday, the day of the 512-point, 6 percent plunge that
shook investors here and around the world. But in the last-half
hour, the Dow and other indexes rebounded, cutting their losses by
two-thirds and more. Still, the Dow was off 5.1 percent for the
week and gave up most of Tuesday's 288 point rally. And with the

RECORDINGS DETAIL FINAL MANEUVERINGS OF DOOMED AIRLINER

   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia -- As grieving family members from the
United States and Europe started gathering on this fog-shrouded
shore Friday to mourn loved ones lost in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111, searchers continued the grim task of plucking bodies
and wreckage from heavy seas that hampered the massive recovery
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials revealed that recordings of the final radio
communications from the doomed plane showed the pilot made looping
``orbits'' over land and sea while dumping tons of fuel in
preparation for an emergency landing at Halifax International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch maneuverings occurred in the final minutes of a
tragedy that started when the pilot sent his first emergency
broadcast at 9:14 p.m Eastern time Wednesday, roughly 15 minutes
before the passenger craft plunged into the cold Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot indicated that he had an emergency condition and
that he was going to land,'' said Vic Gerden, the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board. ``It would have been very risky to
land with that amount of fuel aboard. So he was dumping fuel while
making an orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials angrily dismissed media reports that the pilot started
a turn toward Boston before being diverted to Halifax. The reports
suggested that precious time was lost that might have made the
difference between life and death for the 229 passengers and crew
members aboard, all of whom were killed in crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden confirmed that Swissair pilot Urs Zimmermann initially
suggested reversing course for Boston after reporting smoke aboard
the MD-11 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were offered the information that Halifax was closer, and
the crew elected to fly to Halifax,'' said Gerden. ``The only turns
made were toward Halifax.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was 58 miles southwest of Halifax airport when the
pilot issued a ``Pan-Pan-Pan'' warning, indicating a dangerous
condition aboard. Because the plane had to descend from a cruising
altitude of 33,000 feet -- as well as dump fuel -- it took a
quarter-hour to close the relatively short distance. Officials have
placed the time of the crash between 9:28 and 9:30, although there
still seemed some confusion as to time sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Zimmermann and his flight crew were operating the
craft while smoke filled the cockpit. It was unclear whether there
was smoke in the main cabin, although passengers had donned
emergency gear.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before hitting the water, the three-engine
McDonnell-Douglas aircraft was flying so low that it sheared off
the top of a 16-foot buoy marking a shipping channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said the pilot never issued a call of ``Mayday,'' the
signal for the most serious of emergencies in which a crash is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was clear that he had an emergency aboard and that he
was going to land,'' Gerden said. ``The recordings show they were
dealing with the situation in a very professional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the around-the-clock search under way a few miles
offshore from this tiny fishing village Friday officially shifted
from a ``rescue effort'' - with the emphasis on seeking survivors -
to a salvage mission.
</P>
<P>
   The change represented formal acknowledgement of what searchers
had known but were reluctant to admit: There is no chance that
anyone lived through the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to abandon hope, but it's necessary,'' said
Lt.-Commander Glenn Chamberlain, a Canadian naval officer assigned
to the Halifax-based Rescue Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts will now focus on recovering bodies and probing the
cause of a disaster believed to be an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Joining scores of vessels and aircraft already scouring the
seas, a Canadian submarine probed the depths seeking flight
recorders and other instruments that might explain what caused the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary examinations of wreckage recovered so far has shown
no sign of burning or scorching, suggesting that the three-engine
jetcraft was not brought down by an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of fire on the parts we've seen,''
Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials in Canada, the US and Switzerland have played
down the possibility of a terrorist bomb, Royal Canadian Mounted
Police explosives experts are on the scene looking for any sign of
a blast.
</P>
<P>
   In an eerie coincidence Friday, a Boeing 757 en route from
Toronto to Scotland was forced to make an emergency landing at a
Canadian military base after the pilot reported smelling fumes in
the cockpit. The Royal Airlines flight, with 225 people aboard,
touched down safely in Goose Bay, Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's on the ground safe,'' Capt. David Muralt, pilot for
the Montreal-based charter airline, told the Canadian Press news
agency. ``And everyone's very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was far less cheerful 600 miles to the south as tides
and wind started pushing corpses and body parts ashore on islands
and bayfronts in the vicinity of Peggy's Cove. Soldiers combed
miles of the rugged coast, stuffing human remnants into black
plastic body bags.
</P>
<P>
   Flotsam ranging from postcards to baby bottles was still spread
for miles over waters smeared with aviation fuel. Roughly 100
suitcases have been pulled from the water.
</P>
<P>
   As family members of the victims arrived in Nova Scotia aboard
free flights provided by Swissair, investigators made a determined
effort to play down the grisly discoveries of body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with remains and partial remains,'' said Cpl.
Frank Skidmore of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ``The fact
that we have some 60 body bags containing remains doesn't mean we
have 60 bodies. Out of respect for the families, we're not going to
be providing explicit details of what we are finding.''
</P>
<P>
   A Swissair official, Philippe Bruggisser, said that the only
body found more or less whole so far is that of an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members face the terrible task of picking out
spouses, siblings, parents or children at the makeshift morgue at
Shearwater military base, near Halifax, where 20 forensic doctors
and dentists are examining -- and reassembling -- bodies both to
speed identification and gain information about possible causes of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bodies recovered so far has been officially
identified. Medical officials said most victims appeared to have
died from traumatic injures as the result of huge impact.
</P>
<P>
   But many families arrived in Nova Scotia Friday simply to make a
sad pilgrimage to the site where they had lost so much.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the hundreds of mourners will not visit the
site until Saturday, a few families gathered on a rocky outcropping
by the edge of the sea Friday afternoon, gazing off across the gray
waters where Canadian naval ships and Coast Guard vessels rose and
fell on seven-foot swells as crews labored to hoist bits and pieces
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   When weather permitted, military helicopters carried wreckage
and bodies back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're finding ourselves turned from the scene by thunder
showers,'' said Lt. Erin O'Toole, one of hundreds of Canadian
aviators, soldiers and sailors deployed on the salvage mission.
``It's frustrating. The weather is making a difficult job even more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, said that searchers want badly to find large sections of
fuselage in waters that range from 70 to 150 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed disappointment that the naval submarine HMCS
Okanagan, an aging vessel pulled from retirement to perform one
last mission, failed in its first attempt to detect flight
recorders and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet received any signal from the body of the
aircraft,'' said Bouchard. ``What we want most urgently is to find
the black box recorders. But also if we find a very, very big piece
of the aircraft, it could give us some important information about
what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the relatively few bodies that have been
recovered suggest that a large section of fuselage might have
remained largely intact and may contain many of the victims as well
as flight recorders. However, they backed down on earlier
statements that big section of plane had been detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sonar search is showing a lot of large objects, but there
are many shipwrecks from years and centuries past, as well as
underwater geographic features, so we don't know what we're
seeing,'' said Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   A small submersible search vessel equipped with video cameras
was flown to the scene late Friday, and more than 40 military
deepwater divers were preparing to explore the search area.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest fragment pulled from the sea ``is only about
the size of a small car's roof,'' said Lt.-Commander Jacques
Fauteux.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair announced that there were only 132 Americans aboard the
ill-fated craft, not the 137 the airline reported Thursday.

12 DIE AS TWO AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS CRASH IN APPARENT COLLISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Air Force helicopters crashed early Friday on a
nighttime training mission over a remote mountainous area in
Nevada, killing all 12 crew members on both crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the Air Force's most deadly accident since
September 1995, when 24 airmen died in the crash of an Airborne
Warning and Control System surveillance aircraft moments after
taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters, each of which had six
airmen aboard, crashed at roughly 1 a.m. local time while flying
together about 70 miles north of Nellis Air Force Base outside Las
Vegas. It appeared likely that the two craft collided, but
officials at Nellis and in Washington said they would not know for
certain until the Air Force completes an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, made by Sikorsky Aircraft of Connecticut at a
cost of more than $10 million each, are designed to carry out
search-and-rescue missions and belonged to the 66th Rescue Squadron
at Nellis. The squadron had recently returned from duty in the
Persian Gulf and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters were on a routine nighttime exercise inside the
sprawling 5,000-square-mile training range north of Las Vegas, the
Air Force's largest.
</P>
<P>
   They crashed in a mountainous area about 25 miles north of
Indian Springs, Nev., that is so rocky and remote that it took
about four hours for rescue crews from the base, as well as the
Bureau of Land Management and the Energy Department, to discover
the wreckage and recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first crash of an Air Force Pave Hawk helicopter
since 1995, when one from Osan Air Base in South Korea crashed,
killing five people. The Pave Hawk has been in operation since
1982.

complicated feelings. They are grateful for the sudden flood of
recognition being paid their cherished hero, but achingly aware it
is more of a requiem than a coronation. It's not just that Roger
Maris, who died in 1985 of lymphatic cancer, was one of their own.
It's also that people from this modest prairie town are moved by
some of the sadder particulars of the Maris story: that he felt

SHAHEEN BACKS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN SCHOOL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Governor Jeanne Shaheen reversed course Friday
and supported a constitutional amendment that would avert a fiscal
crisis over school funding while avoiding the kind of broad-based
tax the state has long scorned.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment proposed by Republican House
Speaker Donna Sytek of Salem would preserve New Hampshire's
reliance on local property taxes, which now fund 90 percent of the
cost of public education. The state Supreme Court last year ruled
that that system is illegal because it has resulted in poor
communities paying tax rates up to 15 times higher than the rates
paid in the wealthiest towns to fund the costs of education.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which must be passed by three-fifths of the
Legislature and two-thirds of the voters in November, also calls
for roughly doubling the state's limited aid to schools. That aid
would be targeted to property-poor &UR;  &LR; communities.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who in the past has said that amending the constitution
was the wrong approach, blamed a legislative logjam for forcing her
to change her position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If local school property taxes cannot be set or collected,
communities will not be able to fund public education in the next
school year,'' Shaheen said at a news conference at the State House
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts will not be able to issue bonds to fund
capital improvements. School districts will not be able to issue
tax anticipation notes to cover school expenses. This would cause a
fiscal crisis for our communities. We cannot let that happen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court &UR;  &LR; has given the Legislature until April 1999 to
enact a school funding system under which taxes would be
``reasonable and proportional.'' Shaheen's own proposal _ the
Advancing Better Classrooms Plan _ was also found to be
unconstitutional in an advisory opinion issued by the high court
last June.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ABC Plan would allowed wealthy towns to keep low
tax rates. Poor towns would be helped by state revenue from taxes
on alcohol and cigarette sales and other sources. But because the
ABC Plan reduced but did not eliminate the tax disparities between
rich and poor communities, it would not be legal, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen defended her plan again Friday. ``I believe the ABC Plan
would have been found constitutional by the Supreme Court if it had
been passed by the Senate and signed into law.'' The state Senate,
however, voted against the plan after the court's ruling, which led
to the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the current Legislature believes that the
choice is now between a constitutional amendment or a new
broad-based tax. It's time to break the gridlock,'' Shahee said.
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day _ Nov. 3 _ less than two months away,
persuading two-thirds of the electorate to amend the constitution
may prove a challenge. Three of the four Republicans seeking to
oppose Shaheen support a constitutional amendment. The fourth has
actively campaigned against any move to change the constitution,
favoring instead a statewide property tax to deal with disparities
among communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' said Shaheen spokesman Douglas Hattaway
when asked what the governor's support will do for the amendment's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will vote for it. I think people will be relieved that
progress is being made on the issue,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the governor had any back-up plan to resolve the crisis
should the amendment fail, Hattaway said, ``She is going to work as
hard as she can to make it pass.''

COMPANIES MAKE PHOTO-COMPUTER LINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you can't quite make that roll of snapshots
from last month's vacation fit into your computer, or onto a
T-shirt to send Grandma for a present. Well, Sony has some nifty
new services to help at its Imagestation on PhotoNet
(http://imagestation.sony.com).
</P>
<P>
   Sony is one of a handful of companies offering development and
digitization services for people trying to move their pictures back
and forth between the real world and the computer one.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way, of course, is with your own digital camera,
which will take electronic pictures that can be dumped directly
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cheapest and least of these costs a few hundred
dollars, as much as a decent 35mm single-lens reflex camera. And
the SLR camera offers far more filter and lens options and
higher-quality pictures, assuming you keep your finger out of the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   A simpler, far cheaper approach, as you await the inevitable
fall in price and rise in quality for digital cameras, is to use a
service such as Sony's. Once your pictures are in a
computer-readable format, cheap software such as Adobe's Photo
Deluxe or MetaCreations' Super Goo will allow you to eliminate
small flaws such as ``red eye,'' apply a variety of special
effects, even combine several photos into one composite shot.
</P>
<P>
   The finished products then can be printed out on inexpensive
color ink-jet printers, or sent to Sony or its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Imagestation will either print your digital photos to
high-quality paper, or convert film to digital format. The
computerized pictures are returned by way of the Net, stuck in a
private folder accessible from your Web browser for review and
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   One handy feature allows the customer to create a public folder
with some or all of the pictures, so friends and family can view or
even order paper or electronic copies of the pictures. My
technologically impaired father reported a series of problems
downloading the shared folder, however, so you may instead choose
to download them yourself and e-mail copies.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 days online, you can pay a small sum to keep the folder
available, though the smarter thing for the Net-savvy is to move
the pictures to a personal Web site available free at any of the
many Web locations offering free space to cyber-homesteaders.
</P>
<P>
   Imagestation takes a couple of weeks to return developed
pictures, a little less to return the easily downloaded digital
versions. Printed versions of the electronic photos are fairly
sharp, even on an inexpensive ink-jet printer.
</P>
<P>
   And Imagestation also will print the photos on such things as
coffee mugs, T-shirts and hats.
</P>
<P>
   The service is competing with Seattle Filmworks, which has been
providing digital photos over the Net for a few years now. The
difference is that Seattle Filmworks always develops the film as
slides or prints and charges a few dollars extra for digital
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ImageStation provides the option of having the pictures only
digitized, with no negatives or printed versions.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that Filmworks' pictures are in a
proprietary format it claims is quicker to download and more
compact than the widely used, Internet-friendly JPEG format that
Sony has used.
</P>
<P>
   Filmworks provides a free small program called Picture Works
that organizes the photos into albums and slide shows and can
convert them to more common formats, which in turn can be converted
to JPEGs with another program.
</P>
<P>
   Filmworks also sells an array of other inexpensive programs,
including editing, retouching and publishing titles, for $29.95 to
$39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Another program, Photoworks Composer, comes with templates to
create personalized greeting cards, calendars, stationery and more
that can then be uploaded to Seattle Filmworks for printing.
</P>
<P>
   Filmworks' prices are competitive and also give the option of
returning the digitized pictures on a floppy disk instead of
through the Internet. The company also sends a free roll of film
with each roll it develops.
</P>
<P>
   Filmworks will send you two free rolls of film for trying out
their service; just check the Web site at
!bold!www.filmworks.com!off! for more information.
</P>
<P>
   And for other photo-based gifts, you also can try Reliance Color
Labs in Swansea, Mass., (www.reliancecolor.com/). The longtime
photo-developing house will turn your pictures into cards,
calendars, watches, wall clocks, puzzles, placemats, mouse pads and
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the oddest little song on radio these days, but I love
it. And it comes with its own Internet hoax hook for extra juice.
The song is ``Everybody's Free (To Use Sunscreen),'' and has been
popping up on KCRW-FM (89.9) playlists and a few other places.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the song is a wonderfully whacked fake graduation
speech that originally was a column by Chicago Tribune writer Mary
Schmich. Somehow, the Internet claimed the column for its own,
transmuting it into an alleged speech by novelist Kurt Vonnegut to
graduates at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, read by Tim Perry over wonderful dance music,
includes some great nuggets of wisdom, such as: ``Don't worry about
the future, or worry but know that worrying is as effective as
trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real
troubles in your life are as apt to be things that never crossed
your worried mind.'' and ``Do not read beauty magazines, they will
only make you feel ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The song was put together by Quindon Tarver and appeared in
director Baz Lurhmann's film ``Romeo + Juliet.'' More recently, the
eclectic Lurhmann included it in a wildly diverse collection of
music from his films, plays and opera work called ``Something for
Everybody.'' Check it out.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable, probably, but now the Muscular Dystrophy
Association's annual Labor Day Telethon, hosted by Jerry Lewis for
33 years now, is being carried on the Internet for the first time
at the organization's Web site (www.mdausa.org).
</P>
<P>
   The telecast begins at 6 p.m. Sunday and runs for 21{ hours and
is TV's most successful fund-raiser, bringing in $50 million last
year to finance research on a series of wasting diseases such as
myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and polymyositis,
as well as muscular dystrophy itself.
</P>
<P>
   You may not spend much time on the Internet in chat rooms, but
someone sure is.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting ranks third behind information searches and e-mail as
the most-used activities on the Net, according to Myra Stark, a
senior vice president and director of knowledge management and
consumer insights at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And chat rooms consume 26 percent of all the time spent on the
Net, according to Stark. So if you do use chat rooms, take heart.
You really aren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   And that chat is taking people away from their television
screens, according to a study by Nielsen Media Research that was
commissioned by America Online. Nielsen surveyed about 4,700
households that use its People Meters and found that those with
Internet access spent about 15 percent less time watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year of Internet users said the television was the
activity they were most likely to reduce while on the Web. Though
AOL used the most recent study to tout itself as a place for
advertising targeting wealthier households, the real question will
be what this all means for the rapidly diminishing market share of
network television.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen also reported that 79 million people are now using the
Internet, a 36 percent jump in just nine months. For the first
time, more than half the people between 16 and 34 are using the
Internet as well, Nielsen reported. And 13 million people above the
age of 50 are using the Internet.

NBC STILL RULES IN NEW LINEUP  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
 SEASON-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Newsmagazines just keep eating away at prime time, and
when you consider the staggering failure rate of comedies and
dramas, it's no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   You can count the survivors from broadcast TV's 1997 freshman
class on one hand (``Veronica's Closet,'' ``Working,'' ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ``Ally McBeal'') with the thumb left over.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be needing that thumb soon. Although most new TV shows
are born to die, there will be more survivors this season compared
with the past few.
</P>
<P>
   As the countdown continues to the official start of the 1998-99
TV season (Sept. 21, according to Nielsen Media Research) and a
boffo premiere week (with more than a dozen shows making their
debuts, plus dozens more fresh _ finally! _ episodes of returning
series), let's grab some face time with some of the men and woman
who make the prime time schedules for the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting, of course, at the top. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NBC  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warren Littlefield picks the programs for the peacock network,
and he's riding an unprecedented wave of ratings success.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, NBC must get by without ``Seinfeld'' or
the promotional platform of professional football. It also faces
the final go-round for ``Mad About You'' and ``ER's'' George
Clooney, significant cast changes in ``Law &AMP; Order'' and
``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' and questions about its most
high-profile new series, ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   To Littlefield, zero ratings slippage this season would be
``sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is really to hold'' the existing audience, he said in
a recent meeting with TV critics.
</P>
<P>
   Not growing it. Not piling on more runaway ratings victories.
When no-growth is good news, you know the business is depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC rules TV Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' the best show on TV even during the ``Seinfeld''
years, moves into the 8 p.m. Thursday time slot. And the cast and
creative crew behind ``ER,'' bolstered by massive pay increases,
should be poised to deliver another heart-stopping (and
re-starting) season.
</P>
<P>
   On the comedy front, ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``Working'' have done
big numbers during rerun season. The network's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has
the elements to be a breakout success.
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, Littlefield can call the boiler room and
have 'em crank up another hour of ``Dateline NBC,'' which this fall
will be seen five nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CBS  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ready! Set! Hung one! Hung two! Hike!
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television,
will work with the promotional pro football platform that
Littlefield lost, and has scheduled accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the wholesome but aging feel-good series ``Dr. Quinn,
``Medicine Woman.'' In its place, Moonves offers ``Martial Law.''
Featuring the glowering Sammo Hung (who can't seem to pose for a
publicity shot without making a menacing fist), ``Martial Law''
isn't about feel good. It's about feel bad. As in making bad guys
feel that way by pounding them with your flying feet.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, pro football isn't about feel good, either. It's
a ticket to the young male viewers who all but abandoned CBS when
the network lost football in mid-decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't overestimate what football's going to do for
us,'' Moonves said. ``We discovered in our research that men age 35
and younger weren't watching anything on CBS over the last four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has also likely found some young-male appeal in the new
series ``Buddy Faro,'' starring Dennis Farina as a private eye
stuck in a '70s time warp. Moonves counts the continuing ``JAG'' as
another dude-appeal show, and the new ``Brian Benben Show'' could
be considered a maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the CBS ship, so recently run aground by aging shows
and creaky audience demographics, continues to slowly turn. Without
completely abandoning the network's long-standing core audience of
older viewers, Moonves must attract more younger viewers to his
programing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to program for all audiences, and our current
lineup . . . reflects that,'' he said. ``We have edgy comedies,
with ``Brian Benben,'' family comedies with ``Cosby'' and ``The
Nanny,'' mature dramas in ``Chicago Hope'' and family dramas in
``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   And, this year, pro football and that unhappy Mr. Hung. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABC  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of this network's most promising new shows _ late-summer
start-ups ``Maximum Bob'' and ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' _ are
already airing, so does the ailing ABC have anything to look
forward to?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, surprisingly, is yep.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night comedy newcomers ``The Hughleys'' and ``Sports
Night'' have serious potential. The Saturday night remake of
``Fantasy Island,'' believe it or not, will be intriguing at the
least. And its lead-out, ``Cupid,'' could be flat-out great.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also has continuing greatness in ``The Practice'' and ``Spin
City,'' continuing pretty goodness in ``The Drew Carey Show,''
``Home Improvement'' and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' and the
sure-to-be-buzzy Jimmy Smits-to-Rick Schroder transition on ``NYPD
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on its sad treatment of ``Nothing Sacred'' last season,
however, ABC can't necessarily be trusted to handle greatness or
near-greatness. ABC is also giving us a truly looney drama titled
``Vengeance Unlimited,'' starring Michael Madsen as a borderline
insane vigilante. ``Violence Unlimited'' is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   And there's that lingering ``TV is Good'' promo campaign, which
is clever but ultimately insulting to both TV fans and TV haters
alike.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fox  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His most promising new show (``Futurama,'' from ``Simpsons''
creator Matt Groening) won't be on the air until mid-season, so
Peter Roth, president of Fox Entertainment Group, instead pitched
the cause of year-round series development.
</P>
<P>
   The true fall-season scramble runs from February to May, as
networks compete for fresh concepts, producers, writers and stars
for their new fall shows. Because of expanding cable and broadcast
demands for programing, creative resources are spread way thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to have a much more effective, better system
where we can spread the talent pool out more effectively, and I
hope finally offer for all of us simply better, more compelling
viewing for the consumer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better supporting evidence for Roth's campaign than
his own new schedule.
</P>
<P>
   You know, ``Holding the Baby.'' (It was the first new show to
premiere, which gives it an excellent shot at being the first show
to be canned.)
</P>
<P>
   The one you may not know yet is ``Costello,'' a Tuesday night
sitcom that will be the TV equivalent of that cool sound modems
make when they're connecting to a network.
</P>
<P>
   There are more where that came from. Plus, new episodes of ``The
X-Files'' don't start until Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The lone potentially unawful new Fox series, ``That 70's Show,''
has already debuted to decent ratings. It will have to overcome its
awful title and thin premise (a flashback to teen life in That
Decade), but the cast is cool.
</P>
<P>
   In his address and Q&AMP;A session with the critics, Roth used the
word ``compelling'' 17 times, edging ``distinctive'' (nine times),
``worthwhile'' (six), ``well-crafted'' (five), ``daring'' (three)
``unique'' (three), ``bold'' (two), ``different'' (two) and
``eventful'' (two) in the superlative ratings race. (I didn't count
'em, but someone from the trade journal ``Electronic Media'' did.)
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who's breaking up a great Sunday night lineup by
moving ``King of the Hill'' to Tuesday. Except for an occasional
moment on ``That 70's Show,'' none of his fancy words fits Fox
newcomers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WB  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The start-up network has the most anxiously awaited new series
(``Felicity'') and an apparent lock (with shows such as ``Buffy,
the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek'') on America's teen
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   As a piece of the Time Warner media empire, the WB occupies a
lower rung on the massive corporation's womb-to-tomb viewership
ladder (just after the Cartoon Network, but well before CNN) and
has yet to turn a profit, but the bucks are starting to roll in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the most competitive marketing areas _
the sneakers, the movies, fast food, beverages, computers _ all
these really hot marketing areas, they tend to be very focused on
younger people today,'' said Jamie Kellner, the WB's chief
executive. ``I think it's the battleground, in effect, of the
future of marketing in our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the networks will eventually select certain targets,
and try to attack those targets, and be very specific towards those
groups of people. And advertisers are going to do the exact same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he really say ``sneakers''? &QL; 
 &QL; 
UPN  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother with the target talk around Dean Valentine, chief
executive and president of UPN, the other start-up network. (Pax TV
won't officially inherit this designation until it becomes
available in the Valley.)
</P>
<P>
   Valentine met the critics to say that he's programing a big-tent
network. It's still a comparatively small big tent, for now, but
UPN has ambitions to become a full-service TV entertainment
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's got a new sitcom about a New York transit cop
(``DiResta''), a new sitcom with a cute kid (``Guys Like Us'') and
a period drama about Kentucky horse folk (``Legacy''). Plus he's
got the continuing ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' which incorporates alien
species into the grand programing parade.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he disagrees with the narrowcasting approach
``profoundly, on every level.''
</P>
<P>
   On a business level, narrowcasting makes sense only for cable
nets that can add income from cable operators to their target-niche
advertising sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a larger and more social point of view, I believe that
there has to be something that brings Americans together. I think
people are always looking for a great story that they can talk
about the next day at the infamous water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for compelling stories to share, and in a
world where everything is fractionalized, and 18-year-olds are
watching the 18-year-old network and 26-year-olds are watching the
26-year-old network, I think there's fewer and fewer things to talk
about.'' &QL;

COMPARABLE BEAUTY AT DRUGSTORE PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Upscale cosmetics are swell, for sure, but
drugstore beauty has its charm. And it's mainly low prices.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, this week at Rite Aid in Woodland Hills, Miz
Hottips noticed that L'Oreal's new Espresso lipstick for $7.59 is a
dead ringer for Chanel's new fall lipstick shade at one third the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   And although she loves Chanel's new body gloss for $25, she
found a similar version by Fetish for $3.79.
</P>
<P>
   Major department stores carry a cool kit with CD packaging that
contains tiny decals for your nails for $20, but you can buy
packages of similar decals (the champagne bottle and party favors
images are way-cool) by Cosmar for $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Those same upscale stores offer trendy hair mascaras for about
$20 to produce temporary color highlights, but there's a drug store
version called Hair Color Candy Pomade, for $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea from the drugstore is Pond's Cucumber Eye
Treatments to diminish eye puffiness. The pads treated with
chamomile extract, aloe gel, orange peel and rose hips, actually
look and smell like cucumbers and work great if you keep the jar in
the fridge. They're $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips also discovered some trendy Euro-wire earrings with
little jet beads for $3.99, and jeweled barrettes and hair pins for
$5.50, compared to those at Nordstrom and other stores for $20 to
$30.
</P>
<P>
   EMMY TRIVIA: So, when you're huddled with friends in front of
the tube on Sept. 13 to watch the 50th annual prime-time Emmy
Awards, don't feel too bad for the nominees who don't win. Miz Hot
Tips learned they all receive gifts, including a huge basketful of
Laila fragrance products made from Norwegian wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to feel like a star, you can find the statusy scent
at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And just so you'll be up to speed on Emmy trivia, check out the
new book ``The Best in Television: Fifty Years of Emmys'' (General
Publishing Group; $30) by Morrie Gelman and Gene Accas. It's packed
with behind-the-scenes anecdotes, personal interviews and fashion
photos.
</P>
<P>
   HIPSTER ALERT: Always wanted to get into those swank L.A. clubs
where the stars hang out, but never even made it to the front of
the line?
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Megastores in Burbank and West Hollywood are offering
free MTV Ignition Key Cards that will give you front-of-the-line
privileges now through Thursday at the Derby, the Garage, Garden of
Eden, the Gig, Hollywood Athletic Club (former home of the Emmy
Awards), Luna Park, Martini Lounge, Opium Den and the Troubadour.

REAL LIFE WITH THE HUGHLEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was late on Christmas Eve when D.L. Hughley
sneaked out to set up his surprise gift to his then 7-year-old son
Kyle.
</P>
<P>
   A basketball hoop. Something extra special, because this wasn't
just any Christmas. This would be the first one the family would
spend in West Hills after moving from Baldwin Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley was struggling with the 10-foot monster late into the
night when, out of the darkness, came his neighbor Jim, a ratchet
set in hand and eager to help.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., the basket was in place in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle was psyched. The homeowner's association wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Hughley received a $1,000 fine for breaking one of
the Codes, Covenants and Restrictions that govern everything from
maximum height for shrubs to how many hours a car is allowed to be
parked in a driveway in his new neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Hughley said. ``They hadn't even
given me a copy of the CC and Rs yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't fight the basketball ban, though. In between games,
the hoop now rests on its back alongside Hughley's pool. But it
wasn't a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000 experience two years ago gave Hughley both a new
friend he thought he'd never have !ital!and!off! the added bonus of
a story line interesting enough for the network to order his new
sitcom, ``The Hughleys,'' which premieres on ABC at 8:30 p.m. Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels between D.L. Hughley and his TV character, Darryl
Hughley, are not accidental. The half-hour show is more than
loosely based on Hughley's life.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Darryl moved from the inner city to West Hills.
D.L., who grew up at 135th Street and Avalon Boulevard, near
Compton, moved from a 900-square-foot home in Baldwin Hills to a
4,400-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bath house with a swimming
pool, a view and a three-car garage that shelters his new Lexus
sport utility vehicle, a Lexus sedan and a Mercedes sedan in a tony
planned community.
</P>
<P>
   His TV persona grapples with the race dilemma when his daughter
chooses a white doll over a black doll. The real-life Hughley, much
like the television Hughley, was embarrassed when his daughter
picked the white doll and he later found out it was because the
white doll came with more outfits than the black one.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl voices fears that his children are spoiled and may not
grow up to be good people because they haven't had to face the
struggles that made Darryl the man he is. D.L. Hughley tries to
prevent the same thing from happening to his children _ Ryan, 11;
Kyle, now 9; and Tyler, 7 _ by making sure they know how fortunate
they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do a show that's true to his life, and is a really
funny family show,'' said Matt Wickline, executive producer of the
show. ``When we do deal with race, we try to do it in an
intelligent way, not just do it for the sake of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike real life, every dilemma in the sitcom ends with a
laugh. The hardships and conflicts last less than 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this show at the end of this experience for people to
come away and laugh,'' Hughley said. ``You know, I'm not trying to
do a show that, at the end of it, people wonder what they were
taught. I'm there particularly to speak from a voice that was my
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition to a new neighborhood _ for that matter, a new
lifestyle _ hasn't been as tidy and simple as reciting that
clarifying moral of the story at the end of a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Hughleys get to wallow in the lap of luxury now. The
home with an open floor plan is tastefully decorated in neutral
colors, with traditional and modern African art adorning the walls
_ a far cry from the crammed confines of their last house.
</P>
<P>
   George and Weezy never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   But the new home also has raised Hughley's awareness of the
inequities dealt to those who can't afford the good life.
</P>
<P>
   The new neighborhood has a milkman, Hughes Market sent a voucher
for $300 in groceries (``Nobody gave me groceries when I was
poor,'' he said), and the Young Republicans sent a welcome letter
(``If they only knew. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   And where there wasn't special treatment based on economic
strata, Hughley faced what he's convinced was clear and simple
racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley and his wife, LaDonna, visited their dream house one day
while it was under construction, only to be snapped right back into
an ugly reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in there wearing a baseball hat and jeans, and the guy
laying the carpet was a rude cat. He said, `You can't be in here.'
I told him, `I'm Mr. Hughley, and whether I am or not, you
shouldn't speak that way at all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to let an injustice go by, Hughley walked into the
development's office and, soon after, another man was laying
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Hughley has learned to mellow somewhat, and has begun
to see past his own racial prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   When an elderly neighbor asked him to take in her trash cans
shortly after he moved in, the over-sensitive Hughley thought it
was because he was black. It turned out to be because she was old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he realizes that his neighborhood, like so many others,
resembles the United Nations. One family is Taiwanese, another
Jewish, one is Chinese and another is from Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   To Hughley, these are not people from different ethnic
backgrounds anymore. They're simply young families at the same
stage of life as he is, all starting to gain success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was determined when I first moved here not to make any
friends,'' Hughley said. ``I was just going to go to work and do my
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But that Christmas Eve night, with Jim helping out, would be the
first of many friendships the Hughleys were about to make.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Hughleys have become the unofficial welcome wagon for
any African-American family considering buying in the neighborhood.
It's a comical scene to him and his wife as they remember going
around to meet other similar families when they were shopping in
the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has changed my picture of what race is in this country,''
Hughley said. ``For a long time, I thought black folk were the
poster children for poverty in this country. I grew up thinking all
white people were rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even knew white people lived in Los Angeles. I watched
`Price Is Right,' and they would say, `We live in L.A.' and I'd go,
`I've never seen you around here.' That was true. I never saw white
people until I was 19 years old and I went to the other side of the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, back on the !ital!other!off! side of the city, where
his mother still lives, many from his old neighborhood have shunned
him, accusing him of being a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   While he's brought three of his longtime friends along and
gotten them jobs, people he hasn't seen since high school go around
calling him stuck up. His own aunt refused to talk to him, Hughely
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when people cross social and economic lines,'' Hughley
said, ``it makes people look where they are at. People have always
bused their kids to school in these neighborhoods to get them every
advantage, but they won't live here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypocritical. Some kids spend five hours a day on a bus.
I think my kids can be doing more productive things than being on a
bus.''
</P>
<P>
   From that serious observation on the effects of self-imposed
social barriers comes, believe it or not, more fodder for a funny
sitcom story line _ the things you miss out on while you're stuck
with an extended commute. For Darryl Hughley, it's his sex life
that suffers.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of seeing snippets of their real life recast as
sitcom one-liners is still new to the Hughley family. His daughter,
Tyler, asked him if he will be leaving them for his television
family. LaDonna interrupted a recent interview at the family home
to report that ``Monday Night Football'' announcer Al Michaels had
just promoted ``The Hughleys.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all unique for now, but the issues Hughley tackles in his
sitcom have been around for a long time and will not likely go away
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When black people move up,'' Hughley said, ``they have to
leave the experiences that they had and move around people who look
a lot different than they do, for the most part. When white people
tend to move up, they move around people who tend to look just like
them. ... (The show) comes from my experience. And you know what?
The one thing that I have always been able to maintain is that even
though these experiences may make people uncomfortable, we all
recognize something about the show. We all do.''

FIRST WEEKEND'S FOOTBALL A GRAND SLAM FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Here's how much the alleged renewed interest in baseball because
of a home run-hitting contest has hurt the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, all 15 games will be sold out on
this opening weekend. For the first time in NFL history, more than
1 million fans will attend the games. And it's only the opening
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NFL is so unconcerned about the home run-hitting
contest that when Fox TV asked permission to cut into the St. Louis
Rams-Dallas Cowboys game to show Mark McGwire's at-bats as he
threatens to break Roger Maris's record of 61, the NFL said, ``Go
right ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   So when McGwire is at the plate, the football and baseball games
will share a split screen.

   A solid source says Larry Bird has picked the man to present him
to the Hall of Fame for induction next spring in Springfield, Mass.
_ Bill Walton. Walton and Bird were close when they played together
on the Celtics, and the rule is that the presenter must also be a
Hall of Famer. Walton is ... When Harry Sinden and Ray Bourque get
down to talking about the future for the Bruins' great, they'll
also discuss the possibility of Bourque working for the team in
some capacity after his playing career. The Bruins want Bourque to
finish his career in Boston and hope to make his final years as a
player part of an overall financial package ... Pete Carroll has
three ``musts'' for the Patriots to win in Denver Monday night.
One: ``Find some way to stop their running game.'' Two: ``Eliminate
big plays in the passing game and special teams. Keep their wide
receivers in front of us to make them work the ball up the field.
Don't let their returners (Darrien Gordon is one of the best ever)
make big plays to get field position on us.'' Three: ``Take
advantage of our big-play opportunities on offense and score points
any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's an updated Denver scouting report from two sources. The
first is from a pro scout for an NFC team who has followed the
Broncos through the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Shanahan was concerned about a letdown after they won the
Super Bowl, and he has done a great job of not letting it happen.
These guys have practiced very hard in training camp and played the
preseason games with great intensity. I think they are just as good
as they were a year ago. The theme seems to be, `Let's win one for
John (Elway).'
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very tall receivers, and this might hurt the
Patriots. In every matchup, the Denver wide receivers will have a
big height advantage over the Patriot corners. A great matchup will
be (Shannon) Sharpe against (Lawyer) Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Denver offensive line is going through some changes, but
Alex Gibbs is as good as any offensive line coach in the business.
The guy is terrific. They have some new guys but they have played
well. Their defense has eight linemen and they will change them all
the time. This is a big plus for them at altitude in that stadium.
They keep their guys fresh. Your guys start to fade unless you can
have that many yourself to keep substituting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots will have a problem if they try to stack it (the
defense) against the running game to stop (Terrell) Davis. The
Broncos are executing the passing game well. Elway looks sharp. He
will have the chance to audibilize at the line of scrimmage to
change the play. (Drew) Bledsoe won't. The crowd will be too loud.
So when the Patriots make the call in the huddle, it better be the
right one because they won't have a chance to change it. I think
Denver might come out in a three-receiver set _ (Ed) McCaffrey,
(Rod) Smith, and (Marcus) Nash _ and work over whoever the Patriots
bring in at the other corner (Chris Canty) and the nickel back.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFC coach, who is well versed on Denver, offers this
assesssment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a well-coached, very deep football team. They have
guys coming off the bench who could start on other teams. Mike has
a terrific offensive mind. Very creative. (Coordinator) Greg
Robinson is the perfect complement for him on defense. As a group,
this whole team _ coaches, players _ all trust one another. The
players think the coaches will put them in position to win, and on
the field, the players trust each other. They don't feel that they
have to run around and make plays on their own and gamble on
getting out of position.''

   Rick Pitino had a charity golf tournament two weeks ago that
topped anything ever done in the Boston area by a sports celebrity.
The night before the tourney, Pitino had an auction at Mistral,
Boston's most upscale eatery, and raised $238,000. Most of the
money came from his Kentucky friends, who showed the locals how to
dig deep. Overall, the tourney netted more than $350,000 ($10,000 a
foursome), and all the net proceeds will go back to children's
charities in the name of Rick's late son, Daniel ... Sinden on Cam
Neely's possible comeback: ``I would love to see that happen.
Nothing could make me happier. I'm thrilled that he is able to work
out to a point where he doesn't have the pain he had when he had to
stop playing. It would be unbelievable to see him play for the
Bruins again, but to me, that would be a miracle. Cam not only
hasn't played the last two seasons, he missed many of the games in
the years before that. I wish him nothing but the best.''
Meanwhile, the Bruins are still in court fighting an insurance
company over the payments made to Neely when he was forced to
retire. The Bruins have paid Neely in full. But the insurance
company is trying not to pay off on the policy the Bruins had on
Neely.

   Even though the kid is costing him a lot of money, Joe Gibbs is
a Jeff Gordon fan. Gibbs, the Hall of Fame football coach, now owns
a string of racing teams, including a Winston Cup outfit that
competes with Gordon on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``His crew chief is a friend of mine,'' said Gibbs after Gordon
won last week's race in Louon, N.H., ``and he asked me one time why
they (the fans) boo Jeff so much. I told him this. Jeff probably
has the largest group of fans rooting for him of any driver. Let's
say that is 20 percent. That means the other 80 percent are going
against him because they are rooting for other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon is just so good. He is special. There are only a
handful of guys in the world that have the feel for a race car that
this kid does, and it shows. He's young, good-looking, and wins all
the races. He and his crew have it going. All of the decisions they
seem to be making at crucial times in the races seem to be the
right ones. We (the team for driver Bobby Labonte) have been right
there with him in three or four of these races and they just beat
us. These things run in circles. His team has the right chemistry.
What they are doing is fantastic. In football, you just have to
beat one other team each weekend. In NASCAR, you have to beat 40
other teams each weekend. It's a lot tougher to win here than it is
in the NFL.''

   What do you think the chances are that Roger Clemens will end up
with some team that will pay him more money next season? Clemens
says that even though he is content in Toronto, he would accept a
trade next season if it would help the Blue Jays. Of course, this
has nothing to do with the fact that Roger has collected the big
money already from his Toronto contract, which included a large
bonus up front. If he stayed in Toronto, he wouldn't be worth what
he could get in the open market coming off two sensational seasons
in which he unquestionably has been the best pitcher in baseball.
With a new club, Roger could get another bonus plus a bump in his
base pay.

   Nice story today. Khalid Riley, one of the 70 football players
shortchanged when Boston University terminated the program last
year, will line up as a starter for the University of Connecticut
against Colgate. And he will have a chance to play against his
brother Ameer, a Colgate defensive back. A large contingent from
his hometown of Norwood is on the way to the game ... And two weeks
from today, when Nevada-Las Vegas travels to Wisconsin, the two
White brothers will face each other. Former Harvard quarterback
Brian White coaches the offensive backs at Wisconsin. Brother
Christoper coaches the linebackers at UNLV. Their father, Don,
played QB at Notre Dame and now teaches in Belmont.

RECORDINGS DETAIL FINAL MANEUVERINGS OF DOOMED AIRLINER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia -- As grieving family members from the
United States and Europe started gathering on this fog-shrouded
shore Friday to mourn loved ones lost in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111, searchers continued the grim task of plucking bodies
and wreckage from heavy seas that hampered the massive recovery
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials revealed that recordings of the final radio
communications from the doomed plane showed the pilot made looping
``orbits'' over land and sea while dumping tons of fuel in
preparation for an emergency landing at Halifax International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch maneuverings occurred in the final minutes of a
tragedy that started when the pilot sent his first emergency
broadcast at 9:14 p.m Eastern time Wednesday, roughly 15 minutes
before the passenger craft plunged into the cold Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot indicated that he had an emergency condition and
that he was going to land,'' said Vic Gerden, the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board. ``It would have been very risky to
land with that amount of fuel aboard. So he was dumping fuel while
making an orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials angrily dismissed media reports that the pilot started
a turn toward Boston before being diverted to Halifax. The reports
suggested that precious time was lost that might have made the
difference between life and death for the 229 passengers and crew
members aboard, all of whom were killed in crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden confirmed that Swissair pilot Urs Zimmermann initially
suggested reversing course for Boston after reporting smoke aboard
the MD-11 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were offered the information that Halifax was closer, and
the crew elected to fly to Halifax,'' said Gerden. ``The only turns
made were toward Halifax.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was 58 miles southwest of Halifax airport when the
pilot issued a ``Pan-Pan-Pan'' warning, indicating a dangerous
condition aboard. Because the plane had to descend from a cruising
altitude of 33,000 feet -- as well as dump fuel -- it took a
quarter-hour to close the relatively short distance. Officials have
placed the time of the crash between 9:28 and 9:30, although there
still seemed some confusion as to time sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Zimmermann and his flight crew were operating the
craft while smoke filled the cockpit. It was unclear whether there
was smoke in the main cabin, although passengers had donned
emergency gear.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before hitting the water, the three-engine
McDonnell-Douglas aircraft was flying so low that it sheared off
the top of a 16-foot buoy marking a shipping channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said the pilot never issued a call of ``Mayday,'' the
signal for the most serious of emergencies in which a crash is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was clear that he had an emergency aboard and that he
was going to land,'' Gerden said. ``The recordings show they were
dealing with the situation in a very professional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the around-the-clock search under way a few miles
offshore from this tiny fishing village Friday officially shifted
from a ``rescue effort'' - with the emphasis on seeking survivors -
to a salvage mission.
</P>
<P>
   The change represented formal acknowledgement of what searchers
had known but were reluctant to admit: There is no chance that
anyone lived through the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to abandon hope, but it's necessary,'' said
Lt.-Commander Glenn Chamberlain, a Canadian naval officer assigned
to the Halifax-based Rescue Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts will now focus on recovering bodies and probing the
cause of a disaster believed to be an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Joining scores of vessels and aircraft already scouring the
seas, a Canadian submarine probed the depths seeking flight
recorders and other instruments that might explain what caused the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary examinations of wreckage recovered so far has shown
no sign of burning or scorching, suggesting that the three-engine
jetcraft was not brought down by an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of fire on the parts we've seen,''
Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials in Canada, the US and Switzerland have played
down the possibility of a terrorist bomb, Royal Canadian Mounted
Police explosives experts are on the scene looking for any sign of
a blast.
</P>
<P>
   In an eerie coincidence Friday, a Boeing 757 en route from
Toronto to Scotland was forced to make an emergency landing at a
Canadian military base after the pilot reported smelling fumes in
the cockpit. The Royal Airlines flight, with 225 people aboard,
touched down safely in Goose Bay, Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's on the ground safe,'' Capt. David Muralt, pilot for
the Montreal-based charter airline, told the Canadian Press news
agency. ``And everyone's very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was far less cheerful 600 miles to the south as tides
and wind started pushing corpses and body parts ashore on islands
and bayfronts in the vicinity of Peggy's Cove. Soldiers combed
miles of the rugged coast, stuffing human remnants into black
plastic body bags.
</P>
<P>
   Flotsam ranging from postcards to baby bottles was still spread
for miles over waters smeared with aviation fuel. Roughly 100
suitcases have been pulled from the water.
</P>
<P>
   As family members of the victims arrived in Nova Scotia aboard
free flights provided by Swissair, investigators made a determined
effort to play down the grisly discoveries of body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with remains and partial remains,'' said Cpl.
Frank Skidmore of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ``The fact
that we have some 60 body bags containing remains doesn't mean we
have 60 bodies. Out of respect for the families, we're not going to
be providing explicit details of what we are finding.''
</P>
<P>
   A Swissair official, Philippe Bruggisser, said that the only
body found more or less whole so far is that of an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members face the terrible task of picking out
spouses, siblings, parents or children at the makeshift morgue at
Shearwater military base, near Halifax, where 20 forensic doctors
and dentists are examining -- and reassembling -- bodies both to
speed identification and gain information about possible causes of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bodies recovered so far has been officially
identified. Medical officials said most victims appeared to have
died from traumatic injures as the result of huge impact.
</P>
<P>
   But many families arrived in Nova Scotia Friday simply to make a
sad pilgrimage to the site where they had lost so much.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the hundreds of mourners will not visit the
site until Saturday, a few families gathered on a rocky outcropping
by the edge of the sea Friday afternoon, gazing off across the gray
waters where Canadian naval ships and Coast Guard vessels rose and
fell on seven-foot swells as crews labored to hoist bits and pieces
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   When weather permitted, military helicopters carried wreckage
and bodies back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're finding ourselves turned from the scene by thunder
showers,'' said Lt. Erin O'Toole, one of hundreds of Canadian
aviators, soldiers and sailors deployed on the salvage mission.
``It's frustrating. The weather is making a difficult job even more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, said that searchers want badly to find large sections of
fuselage in waters that range from 70 to 150 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed disappointment that the naval submarine HMCS
Okanagan, an aging vessel pulled from retirement to perform one
last mission, failed in its first attempt to detect flight
recorders and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet received any signal from the body of the
aircraft,'' said Bouchard. ``What we want most urgently is to find
the black box recorders. But also if we find a very, very big piece
of the aircraft, it could give us some important information about
what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the relatively few bodies that have been
recovered suggest that a large section of fuselage might have
remained largely intact and may contain many of the victims as well
as flight recorders. However, they backed down on earlier
statements that big section of plane had been detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sonar search is showing a lot of large objects, but there
are many shipwrecks from years and centuries past, as well as
underwater geographic features, so we don't know what we're
seeing,'' said Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   A small submersible search vessel equipped with video cameras
was flown to the scene late Friday, and more than 40 military
deepwater divers were preparing to explore the search area.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest fragment pulled from the sea ``is only about
the size of a small car's roof,'' said Lt.-Commander Jacques
Fauteux.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair announced that there were only 132 Americans aboard the
ill-fated craft, not the 137 the airline reported Thursday.

 &HT;    CLINTON RETURNS HOME 'SORRY,' BUT WITH BATTLES STILL AHEAD
 &HT;    780&AMP;add
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An embattled President Clinton returns Saturday
from a week abroad to face increasingly restive voices within his
own party and a potentially damaging report as early as next week
from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats moved to distance themselves from Clinton, not even
the president's admission Friday that he was ''very sorry'' about
his affair with Monica Lewinsky satisfied some of his party
colleagues, who fear the political fallout from the scandal in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials conceded that the president had a long
road ahead of him in trying to repair the damage the scandal has
done to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president clearly does not believe that one conversation,
one statement, one speech is going to be sufficient in addressing
this matter the way he wants to,'' White House spokesman Michael
McCurry told reporters traveling with Clinton in Dublin, Ireland.
''He intends to keep addressing it both personally and, to the
degree he needs to, publicly, as he sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said, however, there is no ''concrete plan'' for trying
to contain the fallout from the Lewinsky scandal, adding ''the
president is taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the scandal dogged Clinton on Friday as he posed
for news photographers with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin.
Asked to respond to withering criticism from fellow Democrats,
Clinton said for the first time that he was ''sorry'' about his
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible, and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said, ''so I have
nothing else to say except that I can't disagree with anyone else
who wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In some of the most biting criticism of Clinton's activities to
date, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., delivered a speech on the
Senate floor Thursday in which he described Clinton's behavior as
''immoral'' and ''disgraceful,'' adding that it called for a
''public rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to Lieberman's comments, Clinton sounded edgy
and replied, ''there's nothing that he or anyone else could say in
a personally critical way that I, that I don't imagine that I would
disagree with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And
I'm very sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's remarks touched a chord around the country and on
Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were deluged with calls from
constituents and rushed to fire off statements aligning themselves
with Lieberman's views.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's behavior was wrong and indefensible,'' stated
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who faces a tough battle for
re-election in November. ''I feel deep sadness personally, and for
the nation, about this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Max Cleland of Georgia, issued a terse
statement saying, ''I agree with Senator Lieberman's statements,
both that the president's conduct was wrong, and that members of
Congress should refrain from commenting on what action should be
taken,'' until Starr issues his report.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Democrat, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut urged
Clinton to speak formally and directly to the nation once again.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said Clinton's apology Friday ''was a step in the right
direction,'' but dribbling out contrite comments won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't go day to day just responding to reporters'
questions,'' Dodd said in a telephone interview. ''He needs to have
a conversation with the country, much more so than occurred on
August 17,'' when Clinton delivered his widely criticized
four-minute address to the nation admitting to an ''inappropriate''
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs to ''look the American public in the eye and speak
from the heart,'' said Dodd. ''And I don't think you can do it in a
photo op.''
</P>
<P>
   Lines into the Senate switchboard were jammed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had a break all day,'' said one operator.
''Seventy-five percent of the calls today have been to that
office,'' she said, referring to Lieberman's line.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the moment he is surprised, and appreciative, of the way
in which his remarks have been received, and he's trying to let all
of that sink in,'' said Lieberman's press secretary, Eric
Federling, who characterized the calls as ''overwhelmingly
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders on Capitol Hill, however, said some of the
president's detractors would never be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it again, he apologized again,'' said Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga. ''I don't know what people want him to do _ sit on
Pennsylvania Avenue in sackcloth and ashes and say, 'I repent?' I
don't know what we're demanding from this man.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he respected Lieberman's opinion but disagreed with
his decision to make remarks that might have embarrassed the
president while he represented the country abroad. Clinton visited
Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday for a summit with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, and continued to Northern Ireland and the Republic
of Ireland on Thursday. He was scheduled to return to Washington
late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he (Lieberman) could have waited until the president
returned home,'' said Lewis. ''No one condoned the action of the
president, but you just don't go around kicking people when they're
down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry acknowledged that White House Chief of Staff Erskine
Bowles had urged Lieberman earlier in the week to hold off on his
criticism. In an apparent concession to those concerns, Lieberman
waited until Clinton left Moscow on Thursday, but was unwilling to
put off his remarks until after the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was scheduled to appear Sunday morning on the NBC-TV
program ``Meet the Press,'' but many other Democrats were lying low
until they return to work on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Wednesday, Starr is expected to present the House
Judiciary Committee with a report of the findings of his
eight-month investigation into allegations that Clinton conducted
an 18-month affair with Lewinsky and later urged her to lie about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied the affair when the allegations first surfaced in
January, but admitted to it in his Aug. 17 address. He has
continued to deny, however, charges that he urged anyone to lie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a sagging stock market and a growing trade
deficit, America's labor market remains very solid.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the return of workers
idled by the 54-day strike at General Motors helped to keep the
unemployment rate at 4.5 percent in August, close to its 30-year
low, and helped to swell payrolls by 365,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not surprised by Friday's report and digested its
most obvious implication _ that it reduced the likelihood of an
immediate interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board _ with
apparent equanimity. By the end of the day, stock prices had fallen
modestly in volatile trading, while the bond market had rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the effects of the GM strike, the economy churned
out an average of 217,000 new jobs a month in July and August,
slower than the 244,000 monthly rate in the year's first half but
still a strong pace. Pay is rising at a good clip, too; hours are
up and first-time unemployment claims have fallen to a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of everything that's out there, the general economy
is growing at a pretty good pace,'' said Mitchell Fromstein, chief
executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of
temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, said:
``We're where we've been for the last four months. It's still a
very tight labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Fed's primary concern has been whether the
economy would slow enough to head off the threat of inflation as
companies compete for relatively scarce workers. To prevent
inflation, the Fed could raise rates. Financial troubles abroad,
though, have cast the domestic situation in a new light, raising
questions whether lower rates might be needed to encourage
Americans to keep buying products made here and abroad to head off
a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in this report that says ease,'' said Robert
Barbera at Hoenig &AMP; Co., an investment consulting firm, in White
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is how long the U.S. labor market will stay this
robust. Job numbers provide a better look at where the economy has
been than at where it is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as it gets,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. ``All the risks are on the
downside. If we're lucky, unemployment will stay this low. If we're
not, more of the effects of the global recession will reach us.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark spot in the otherwise bright labor picture is a
troubling weakness in manufacturing. Asia's economic woes are
starting to take a bigger bite. Although manufacturing hours rose
sharply in August, suggesting that monthly industrial production
may rise for the first time this summer, a total of 100,000 factory
jobs disappeared in July and August, even taking into account the
effects of the GM strike.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Nardone, an economist at the Labor Department, said that the
pace of job losses had doubled from the two previous months. The
biggest losses occurred among makers of clothing and electronic
equipment and in food processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing is in a pricing recession,'' Yardeni said. ``Not
only can't they raise prices, but they're under a lot of pressure
to cut prices because of the collapse of exports to Asia. As a
result, profits are under pressure, and companies are starting to
cut back on hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, he added, is that the weakness in manufacturing
could spread to services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Services don't operate in a vacuum,'' Yardeni said. ``Many of
their customers are manufacturers.'' Manufacturers employ less than
15 percent of the work force, he points out, but account for 30
percent of all business activity.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everywhere else in the labor market, however, jobs
were sprouting like weeds last month.
</P>
<P>
   Services _ from day care to management consulting _ added
135,000 jobs. Temporary-help firms accounted for 42,000 of that
number, reversing a loss of a similar magnitude in July. Computer
and data processing added 11,000 jobs. Transportation and public
utilities added 24,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Finance, insurance and real estate added 13,000, substantially
less than the pace of the last year or so. Mortgage lenders
probably account for much of that gain, as low rates keep the home
loan business humming.
</P>
<P>
   A gain of 16,000 construction jobs reflects the continued boom
in the building and buying of homes. Since last fall, construction
has added 261,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Government jobs rose by a strong 57,000, although that figure
was probably exaggerated as early school starting dates in some
parts of the country complicated attempts to make seasonal
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   One-fifth of small businesses say their most pressing problem is
an inability to find enough skilled help, according to the latest
survey of the National Federation of Independent Business.
Nonetheless, hiring in August was extremely strong.
</P>
<P>
   The wage picture is positive. The increase in workers' average
hourly earnings was half a percent, or 7 cents, in August, after a
gain of two-tenths of a percent in July. But looked at for the
latest 12 months, the wage numbers have been flat for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Even though wage inflation is not accelerating, pay is rising
fast enough to grant workers some of the best gains in real income
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Fromstein of Manpower said there was a tremendous amount of job
hopping as low-wage hotel, fast-food and service workers took
advantage of the extremely tight labor market to obtain better pay.
``There just aren't enough people to fill these jobs,'' he said.
``In an economy like this, when people making $7 an hour can get a
job for a dollar more, they're getting a 15 percent raise.''

NEW YORK POLICE GEARING UP FOR YOUTH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN KIFNER and KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Intent on preventing any outbreaks of violence, the
New York City Police Department plans to saturate the site of
Saturday's planned rally in Harlem with as many as 250 officers
along each of the six blocks set aside for the event.
</P>
<P>
   And, officials said, they intend to clear the streets promptly
at the demonstration's court-ordered finish at 4 p.m., whether the
event _ being billed as the Million Youth March _ has ended or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in charge,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir declared on
the eve of the rally being led by Khallid Abdul Muhammad, who has
warned that he will bring gangs to the event. ``Large or small,
we'll have a sufficient number of personnel and a plan to ensure
that both marchers and the public are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Safir refused to divulge specific security plans, a senior
law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the police were preparing to station more than 1,600 officers
at the rally itself, with a nearly equal number of extra police
officers in surrounding areas. The large deployment is planned even
through city officials now expect fewer than 10,000 participants to
show up for the long-litigated rally, far fewer than even the
50,000 revised figure now offered by Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   If these numbers hold, it would mean about one officer for every
seven participants, compared with the usual deployment of one
officer for every 30 to 50 participants in similar gatherings. In
addition, police plan other precautions, such as using heavier
metal barricades instead of the more commonly used wooden ones,
which can be broken apart and used as weapons or projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent confrontations, police plan to avoid making arrests
for minor offenses during the event. And the officers will be under
tighter command than normal, with one supervisor for every four
officers, rather than the usual ratio of one supervisor to every
eight officers at other rallies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment comes on a busy Labor Day weekend in which the
37,000-member department is expected to run up more than $1 million
in overtime costs. In addition to the Harlem rally, more than 100
other events are scheduled, including the huge Caribbean Day parade
on Monday. And the department has been stretched further by fears
of terrorism, with hundreds of officers stationed around new
concrete barricades set up around City Hall, Federal courthouses
and other government buildings in downtown Manhattan, including
police headquarters itself. The additional weekend manpower put in
place is the equivalent of adding 14,000 extra officers, said Lt.
Sean Crowley, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of acrimonious dialogue in which Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani repeatedly denounced the rally as a `'hate march,'' a
federal appeals court on Tuesday cleared the way for the event, but
the ruling significantly curbed the scope of the event. What
Muhammad originally envisioned as a 12-hour rally drawing 150,000
to 3 million people to a 29-block area was scaled back to four
hours along six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court ruling, legal skirmishes over the march
continued Friday, with city Corporation Counsel Michael Hess
releasing a letter accusing the organizers of having failed to
secure contracts or permits to build a stage or install a sound
system or arrange for electricity from Con Edison. In addition,
Hess said, the organizers were still broadcasting and distributing
material asking participants to show up at 8 a.m., rather than at
noon.
</P>
<P>
   This, the corporation counsel warned Michael Warren, the group's
lawyer was `'an unacceptable and dangerous invitation to confusion
and possible confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally is set for noon to 4 p.m. on Malcolm X Boulevard from
118th Street to 124th Street. One lane of the broad boulevard is to
be kept open with barricades as an emergency corridor for
ambulances and police and fire vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   `'The idea is to give them the six-block area from noon to 4,
like the court has ordered and then at 4 o''clock pull the plug and
say goodbye,'' a senior law enforcement official said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to inflame the crowd. But if the people want to
stand firm and not leave at 4 o'clock, then the commanders will
announce that they are taking the podium down. Once the podium is
down, officers will announce they are reopening the street for
traffic and direct people to leave for the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they don't do that,'' he added, ``then the details will
form up and push them onto the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added that `'with all the rhetoric going back and
forth, the mayor's not about to say `Let's handle them with kid
gloves and go easy.' So when the time comes to move these people,
we want enough supervisors to make sure the cops handle it in as
orderly a way as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will there be a large police presence at the rally, but
transit officials, at the urging of City Hall are shutting down
four subway stations near the rally location on the No. 2 line.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the officers assigned to the event are to be deployed
behind the barricades, maintaining a kind of perimeter, with only a
handful of community affairs officers and undercover detectives
actually in the crowd. Officials said that officers would be
stationed on rooftops to keep debris from being thrown down onto
the street, and a contingent of mounted police would be deployed
nearby in case a riot erupted. In order to avoid provocation,
officials said, police would store helmets and other riot gear out
of sight, in vans and patrol cars.

CLINTON APOLOGIZES FOR AFFAIR WITH LEWINSKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Under fire from his own party for his behavior
and lack of contrition, President Clinton for the first time said
``I'm sorry'' for his affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But still the words Friday appeared to come hesitantly and only
a day after a dramatic Senate floor address by Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., a Clinton ally, who denounced the president's behavior as
``immoral'' and worthy of a ``public rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, questioned by reporters while standing beside Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, said: ``I've already said that I made
a bad mistake, it was indefensible, and I'm sorry about it. So I
have nothing else to say except that I can't disagree with anyone
else who wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged
was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   But pressed with questions again, Clinton said, ``There's
nothing that he or anyone else could say in a personally critical
way that I don't imagine that I would disagree with, since I have
already said it myself to myself. And I'm very sorry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, his hands clasped behind his back, answered
questions calmly, with Ahern looking on, as the White House
anticipated questions about Lieberman's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comments signaled a critical meltdown of support in
Congress for Clinton as the White House tries to salvage his
presidency amid calls for his resignation or impeachment.
Lieberman's remarks drew immediate praise from other key Democrats
such as Sen. Daniel Moynihan of New York and Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in a 24-minute address, said Clinton ``apparently had
extramarital relations with an employee half his age, and did so in
the workplace, in the vicinity of the Oval Office. ... Such
behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transgressions the president has admitted to are too
consequential for us to walk away and leave the impression for our
children and our posterity that what President Clinton acknowledges
he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our
nation's leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after hearing Clinton's words, Lieberman released a
statement saying only: ``I appreciate the president's comments.''
</P>
<P>
   More trouble looms for Clinton as independent counsel Kenneth
Starr prepares to turn over his report to Congress at the end of
this month. Starr since January has investigated Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and whether he perjured himself
or obstructed justice in an attempt to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lieberman nor other Democrats called for Clinton to step
down as Republicans have. Instead, one alternative that could
gather bipartisan support would be a censure by Congress that would
allow members to condemn Clinton's behavior without forcing him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a censure by Congress was appropriate, Clinton said:
``I shouldn't be commenting on that while I'm on this trip. My
understanding is that was not a decision that was made or advocated
yesterday. If that's not an issue, I don't want to make it one, one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, refused to expand on
Clinton's comments, but he suggested the president will have even
more to say on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president clearly does not believe that one
conversation, one statement, one speech, is going to be sufficient
in addressing this matter the way he wants to. And he intends to
keep addressing it both personally and to the degree he needs to
publicly, as he sees fit,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry mostly offered sharp, short answers to reporters'
questions. ``I don't believe it is the role of staff, on a matter
that is as intensely personal being dealt with in an intensely
public way, for us to comment, spin, amplify, comment further. The
president said what he said. It's heartfelt, and I'll just let it
stand for what it is,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, however, said Clinton will not resign.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 17 address to the nation, Clinton expressed
``regret'' for misleading the public and his family with his
denials of a relationship, but he did not specifically apologize
nor did he ask for forgiveness as he has since maintained. However,
he maintained his earlier denial of a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky was ``legally accurate'' but ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the president that question, I think that he
believes his tone has been consistent on this, but it's been
interpreted differently,'' McCurry said. ``He believes he's been
clear on that all along, but others take a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that some people believe he didn't address it
adequately. And I think the president understands that he has some
obligation to address the concerns that they express. And he took
very seriously, obviously, what Sen. Lieberman had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The sex scandal dogging Clinton dominated what should have been
a day for him to champion his successful policy toward peace in
Ireland. Still, the Irish provided accolades to Clinton for his
administration's efforts to secure the Good Friday peace accord
made last April.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to Dublin to highlight the Irish Republic's booming
economy with a facility operated by computer company Gateway 2000.
He and Ahern became the first heads of state to sign a pact
digitally. Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton later flew
to Limerick, where the president will play golf Saturday at
Ballybunion Golf Club, one of the world's renowned courses.

LOWER OIL PRICES ARE SAID TO IMPEDE IRAQ'S SUPPLY OF FOOD,
MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sharp drops in oil prices have undermined a
program under which Iraq can sell its oil to raise money for urgent
civilian needs like food and medicine, the senior official in
charge of the program told the United Nations Security Council on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Benon Sevan, briefing the Security Council on a
report on Iraq from the U.N. secretary general, said the reduced
earnings from oil sales would mean that the United Nations could
not meet a higher nutritional target in food supplied monthly to
every Iraqi.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food and medicine have
been shipped to Iraq since the program began a little over a year
ago, said a U.N. spokesman in Baghdad, Eric Falt, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the largest ship to arrive in Iraq under the program,
a 52,000-ton Greek freighter, brought a shipment of American red
winter wheat. American companies have won nearly $35 million in
grain contracts with Iraq under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``oil for food'' program was increased substantially in
February, to $5.2 billion from $2.1 billion in oil sales every six
months. This followed growing reports of malnutrition and deaths
caused by lack of medication and medical supplies. The quantities
were fixed in a formula based on the price of oil in February.
</P>
<P>
   After subtracting money set aside for compensation to victims of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and other built-in deductions,
Iraq should have had several billion dollars for aid expenditures.
But lower oil prices have reduced the expected amount available to
about $1.79 billion for this six-month period.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To complicate matters, there have been delays in the
distribution of supplies, especially medicines. In the case of
medical supplies, the Iraqi government is responsible for
distribution in the center and south of the country but not in the
Kurdish areas of the north, where the United Nations does the job.
The reasons cited in the report included poor communications with
health centers, Iraq's extended quality control testing of imports,
and the tendency of Iraqi officials to hold back stocks for what
they say are emergency needs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Iraq is not able to pump all the oil permitted under
the expanded agreement because of the run-down condition of its oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of increasing the volume of oil sales to compensate in
some part for the lower prices have not been met because of delays
in approving contracts for spare parts. The delays are taking place
in the Security Council's sanctions committee on Iraq, where the
United States has challenged contracts despite the recommendation
of oil experts hired by the United Nations to review Iraqi
purchases. Iraq is often suspected of trying to import items beyond
what it needs. The country has been under stringent sanctions for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole program is being run in a politically suspicious
atmosphere,'' Sevan said. ``and that makes it difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, who is departing as the U.S. representative to
the United Nations to become the Clinton administration's new
energy secretary, said that there was no change in U.S. support for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is ready to assist the Iraqi people with
humanitarian needs,'' Richardson said after Sevan's briefing.
``We're ready to approve oil spare-parts contracts provided that
they deal with improving the oil delivery efficiency system for the
Iraqi people to get humanitarian assistance. For other purposes we
will not approve them _ for frivolous purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats cite as unnecessary such purchases as valves for
liquid petroleum gas tanks, which they see as intended for the
civilian market and which should be moved out of the spare parts
category. U.N. oil experts disagree, saying that the tanks are used
as sparkless, and therefore safe, mobile energy sources in the
Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also cited Iraqi delays in distributing goods. ``The
problems with the oil for food programs do not change,'' he said.
``Iraq refuses to manage the program efficiently, in many instances
does not cooperate with the U.N. oil-for-food administrators and
continues to use the humanitarian issue as a political weapon.''

SEASON OPENS WITH BANG-UP SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely does a college football season's first full weekend offer
so many important games.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of The Associated Press' Top 25 teams play each other (and
that doesn't count Thursday night's game between No. 16 Virginia
and No. 25 Auburn). Top-ranked Ohio State has a dangerous game at
No. 11 West Virginia, and No. 5 Michigan carries its national
championship reputation to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But today's blockbuster lineup is more happenstance than
planning. Schedules are made years before the rankings make these
games more relevant. And don't for one moment think that a coach
wants to risk starting the season with a debilitating loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'd rather be playing a lesser opponent at home,''
said philosophic Ohio State coach John Cooper. ``This is a payback
game; West Virginia came in here in 1986 and this returns that
game. I can't worry about playing a game like this on the road to
start the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone we play, it seems like we're their game of the year.
This is a rivalry because we're not that far away. It will be a
hostile place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's Buckeyes have the most to lose. A loss in the opener
doesn't necessarily end national championship hopes. It just
eliminates the margin for error. One loss can be overcome; two
losses can't.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State and Michigan both carry burdens into battle. For the
Buckeyes, it's the No. 1 ranking. For the Wolverines, it's the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bull's eye on our backs and everyone on our team
needs to raise his level of play,'' Michigan senior safety Marcus
Ray said. ``We can't let these teams catch us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame, their attitude will be that they should have beat
us last year, they were national champions, they're going to be
fired up. And we're going to have to match that.''
</P>
<P>
   A season opener has held the key to the Pacific-10 Conference
title each of the last two seasons. Arizona State (1996) and
Washington State (1997) each defeated contenders on opening day and
rode the momentum to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight in Tempe, Ariz., No. 8 Arizona State hosts No. 18
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, it's a great way to start the season,''
Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder said. ``But I don't know that any
of us prefer to open with a dramatic game. Most of us want to get
the bugs worked out a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win it, you have such great momentum and it forces
everybody else to chase you. The team that doesn't win the game is
certainly not out of it. But you need to rally your troops and it
can be kind of difficult.''

   Two games off the national radar screens should be entertaining.
Central Florida visits Louisiana Tech, and Kentucky is at
Louisville. Last year, those teams' four quarterbacks combined for
more than eight miles of passing.
</P>
<P>
   In Ruston, La., the spotlight is a little brighter, thanks to
Louisiana Tech's season-opening loss at Nebraska. The Bulldogs'
passing combo of quarterback Tim Rattay and wide receiver Troy
Edwards drew national attention as Rattay passed for 590 yards and
four touchdowns while Edwards set an NCAA record with 405 yards
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida quarterback Daunte Culpepper knows a little
about playing well at Nebraska. Last season he passed for 318 yards
in a 38-24 loss to the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is that Culpepper is dangerous no matter
what strategy you use,'' Louisiana Tech coach Gary Crowton said.
``Devise a defense to stop his passing and he turns into a running
back. Move up to stop the running and his passes will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida coach Mike Kruczek won't discuss his team's
defensive plan, but he said his team wouldn't let Edwards repeat
his record-setting day. Central Florida defensive coordinator Gene
Chizik says the plan is practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody stops them, so you look for ways to slow them down,''
he said. ``You keep everything in front of you, and don't give up
the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, Kentucky's record-setting quarterback Tim Couch
(a national-best 3,884 yards last season _ goes up against the
Cardinals and quarterback Chris Redman, who passed for 3,079 yards
last season.
\Nrailhed:Marketing 101
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which has won four Big Ten Conference games the last
four seasons, realizes it doesn't have any steak, so it's selling
sizzle. In this case, it's promoting its mascot.
</P>
<P>
   The school is airing local television spots and purchased an
eight-page regional insert in ``Sports Illustrated''. The ads try
to explain the school's ``misunderstood'' mascot, the Angry Gopher.
</P>
<P>
   For tonight's opener against Arkansas State, Minnesota is
staging a ``Halleumooya'' promotion. For $19, fans can get two game
tickets, two tickets to the state fair and two half-gallons of
milk. School officials hope for a crowd of 50,000 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford also has a ticket deal. It's offering a money-back
guarantee on season tickets. Season tickets go for $185. The
money-back deal is for new buyers only.
</P>
<P>
   And Northwestern is making coach Gary Barnett into a Web
crawler. At 7 p.m. each Wednesday, Barnett will be available for
Internet chat at the school's Web site (www.nusports.com).

   Paul Hackett became the first Southern California coach in 47
years to win his debut game when the Trojans rallied to beat
Purdue, 27-17, Sunday. Jess Hill won his opener in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's 16-0 loss to Virginia on Thursday night was the
school's first shutout loss in a home opener since 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, Indiana and Louisville have switched from artificial
turf to grass fields this season. Of the 112 Division I-A teams,
just 39 (or 37.5 percent) are playing on an artificial surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's 27-6 loss Thursday night to No. 24 Arizona shouldn't
have come as a surprise. The game was televised on ESPN2; the
Rainbows are now 1-16-2 in nationally televised games.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's loss to Colorado State last Saturday was its
first in school history in eight games against WAC teams.
\Nrailhed:Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State Heisman Trophy candidate J.R. Redmond hoped to be
on the field for 15 to 20 plays a game as a defensive back.
However, the junior running back might not see much action on
defense in tonight's opener against Washington. He has tendinitis
in his knees and might be limited to offense only.

   Paul Feller's California-based Pro Sports International owns the
rights to the Freedom Bowl, which was last played in 1994. Feller
has applied to the NCAA to re-certify the bowl. The target date for

opponents could come from the Pacific-10, the Big Ten or the new
league that is breaking away from the Western Athletic Conference.

   Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles wants to expand
Razorback Stadium and never mind that the team rarely sells out the

<P>
   Long odds to No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State opens the season at West Virginia tonight. The
Buckeyes are ranked No. 1, but they face long odds of finishing the

PRIEST DEEMED TOO LIBERAL CELEBRATES FINAL MASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ When the Rev. James Callan celebrates his last
Mass at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church on Sunday, he can look
back on a 22-year ministry that packed the pews on Sundays and
created a battery of programs to help the poor, but that also moved
so far away from standard church practices regarding the roles of
women, gays and non-Catholics that he has been removed from his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Callan has told his congregation it was the Vatican that
requested he be removed from his parish. In an interview, he said
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's powerful
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, wrote to Rochester
Bishop Matthew Clark requesting that Callan be removed from his
parish.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said he made the decision to remove the priest, after
asking Callan, unsuccessfully, to change certain practices to
conform with church rules. ``As diocesan bishop here,'' he said,
``I take responsibility for pastoral directions I issue and for
clergy transfers I make.'' A Vatican spokeswoman referred inquiries
back to the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   As the news has spread, Corpus Christi has emerged as the focus
of a wider debate in church circles, gaining attention as a parish
that pushed far into liberal territory in regard to sacraments and
liturgy, even as Rome was telling bishops, theologians and priests
to adhere to tradition. Callan said the parish has been contacted
by some liberal Catholic organizations expressing their support.
</P>
<P>
   During a time when Pope John Paul II has been emphatic that the
priesthood is reserved to men, Callan allowed women to play a
prominent role at the altar. He invited all people who considered
themselves followers of Jesus to partake of communion, even though
church rules generally restrict it to Catholics. And, as part of a
ministry to gay men and lesbians, he occasionally blessed same-sex
unions. ``We've tried to build an inclusive church over the
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such actions place Corpus Christi at
Catholicism's most liberal edge, but many parishioners seem to
share this theological vision. A ``statement of faith'' by
parishioners declares that the priest's removal punishes them all
``for what we believe.'' It adds: ``As such, we see this as a
serious affront to Jesus Christ and all He stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   That the controversy is occurring here strikes some as ironic,
because Clark is counted among the diminishing number of moderates
within an increasingly conservative American Catholic hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America magazine, said the
bishop is known for an interest in ecumenical relations, a
sensitivity to issues of women in the church and a desire to
welcome homosexuals into the church. Last year, Clark held a Mass
for gay Catholics in Rochester's cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   For such actions, he has been criticized by local conservatives,
who have taken their complaints to the Vatican. One group, Citizens
for a Decent Community, called for a letter-writing campaign to
Pope John Paul II to protest a meeting the Rochester diocese will
soon host for people who minister to homosexual Catholics. ``We
urge our readers to inundate the Vatican with letters of protest
over this outrage,'' declares a flier that urges writers to ask for
Clark's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Michael Macaluso Jr., said members had
also complained to Vatican officials about Callan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, Corpus Christi was thriving. But when Callan
arrived as an assistant pastor in 1976, the 110-year-old parish
seemed on its last legs. To revive it, he launched an informal
Thursday night Mass, canceled bingo games and persuaded
parishioners to give away 12 percent from the collection plate to
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he and a growing flock established such ministries as
a free clinic, a homeless shelter, a home for former prisoners, a
hospice and a clinic in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The work won plaudits. In a guest column in the Rochester
Democrat and Chronicle, in which he discussed his decision to
remove Callan, Clark praised the priest for developing
``extraordinary ministries.''
</P>
<P>
   The good works also drew people from far and wide. Not everyone
who came to the church was Catholic, which pleased those who liked
the idea of a religious community with an unusually wide embrace.
``Everybody was welcome,'' said Mike Martella, 42, a commercial
real estate broker and father of four. ``There was no difference
from being Protestant, a woman, being gay, being Jewish,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bickel, 54, described the parish as ``Vatican Three'' _ a
grass-roots progression from the Second Vatican Council, which
enacted sweeping reforms in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   She made her comment after a communion service at Corpus Christi
at which the associate pastor, Mary Ramerman, presided. Ms.
Ramerman, 43, who is married with three children and holds a degree
in theology, wore what she called a banner, an emerald cloth strip
hung over one shoulder, which was given to her by parishioners five
years ago and is a garment with a certain symbolism. (Priests wear
a stole, which hangs over both shoulders as a symbol of their
ordination.)
</P>
<P>
   After delivering a homily, she invited about 100 parishioners to
receive communion, partaking of bread and wine previously blessed
by a priest. ``If you love Jesus and seek to follow Jesus, you are
welcome to come and receive the gift of his life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said one of his concerns about Corpus Christi was that the
parish was ``leaving the impression that someone other than
ordained priests are providing Eucharist.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Corpus Christi's open invitation to communion
went beyond what a priest may do in using his judgment about who
may partake. As for the blessing of same-sex unions, he said that
they went well beyond what the church allows.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi's practices have never been secret. Callan
described the parish in a book he wrote last year, ``Can't Hold
Back the Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that having women at the altar sent the message ``that
God calls both men and women to be priests and preachers.'' As for
allowing non-Catholics to take communion, he wrote that all were
``the guests of the Lord Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Callan would be removed, Corpus Christi's
parishioners formed a ``media committee'' that created a videotape
and sent it to television news programs. One parishioner, Bill
Berry, 54, vice president of an advertising agency, said, ``Most
simply and succinctly, our strategy is to generate dialogue with
the Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said in interviews that the parish would continue without
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Callan said he did not know what his new assignment would be,
but he said he believed Corpus Christi represented the church's
future. ``My removal will look silly 10 years from now,'' he said.
And referring to a former television news commentator, he added,
``Like Eric Severeid used to say, `I'm a pessimist about tomorrow,
but I'm an optimist about the day after tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would ask the next pastor to take note of certain
concerns, such as ``the governing authority of the bishop and
accountability of the community to the bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was important for a parish ``to stay in
reasonable union and harmony'' with the diocese, adding, ``It is
simply not acceptable to plant your own flag without that kind of
rigorous dialogue with the whole community.''

 &HT;    Architect of his own success comes back to UT
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a career marked by firsts, John Chase has
gone from University of Texas pariah to ultimate insider.
</P>
<P>
   Chase made history at UT when he walked through the door in 1950
under the watchful gaze of federal marshals. Half a century later
at age 73, Chase is a prominent Houston architect and making
history at UT again. He was the first African American to enroll,
to be licensed as an architect in Texas, to be appointed to the
U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, to be named a UT Distinguished
Alumnus. But a milestone Chase could not have foreseen a
half-century agois this: He's the first African American president
of UT's66,000-member Ex-Students' Association.
</P>
<P>
   An admired businessman and civic leader, Chase leads an
association of manyinfluential Texans, including business and
government leaders. These well-connected alumnihave the ear of
regents, lawmakers and administrators on the UT System's 15
campuses. They understand how the university is run and financed.
They make things happen. ``I think you can achieve more by being
inside than by being outside,'' said Chase, in Austin on Thursday
to honor alumni scholarship winners. ``It's just that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Chase has been actively supporting the
alumni association, encouraging UT students to graduate and
recruiting minorities. He leads the alumni at a time when UT's
image among blacks and Hispanics has suffered and when gains in
diversity have been set back by the federal court's Hopwood ruling,
which effectivelyended affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   While the timing may be ironic, Chase was in line for the
high-profile post long before the ruling. And now he's working to
blunt its effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy coincidence that John is here to help us when we
need help,'' Architecture School Dean Larry Speck said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, who took office July 1, said he will build on the work of
his predecessor, Austin attorney Larry Temple, who spearheaded the
creation of alumni-sponsored scholarships to attract minorities to
UT. At the alumni center Thursday, Chase and Temple celebrated more
than $1.09 million in alumni-sponsored scholarships given this
fall, including $443,250 in Texas Leader Scholarships to 134
students.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said it wasn't hard to reconcile two painful years he
spent at UT getting a master's degree in architecture with his
leadership of a group that had no blacks when he graduated in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you achieve anything by getting mad or getting
angry or holding grudges,'' he said. ``My effort has always been to
try to work together with people for the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Chase describe him as irrepressibly positive, fun
and passionate about UT.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney John Adkins recalled how Chase and his wife
invited a group of inner-city youth to their home in the early
1980s and encouraged them to attend UT. ``He gave the most
inspiring speech I have ever heard about the value of higher
education, and it reflected a love for the university I have never
heard before,'' said Adkins, an Ex-Students' Association board
member.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, an Annapolis, Md., native, had already earned a
bachelor's degree in architecture from Hampton University in
Virginia when he came to Austin with a desire to work in the ``deep
South.'' He took a teaching job but decided to get a master's
degree in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But first he had to await the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court
case.
</P>
<P>
   Heman Sweatt, an African American, had sued then-UT President
T.S. Painter after being refused admission to the Law School.
Within days of the court's ordering UT to admit Sweatt, Chase
registered for classes in the spring of 1950 and made national
news.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatt enrolled that fall, several months after chase, but
dropped out after being taunted and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said he experienced some hostility and has kept hate mail
from people who said he had no business at UT. The letters were
filled with racial slurs, and some mentioned his wife, Drucie, whom
he met in Austin and married during the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were not allowed to live in the dorms, and the Drag was
segregated. At UT football games, a row in the end zone _ the worst
seats in the stadium _ was set aside for black fans, said Chase, a
sports enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would always cheer for the black players who came in from
other schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that cut deep and hurt _ not being able to live on
campus or go to places on the Drag to get a soda,'' he went on in a
more serious tone. ``I knew Sweatt, and if the case had been built
on me, I would not have graduated, either.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt some resentment toward UT, but it did not linger. He had
made some great friends and joined The Ex-Students' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Chase moved to Houston, which was growing, but no architect
would hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a firm suggest I go to Africa,'' Chase said. ``I just
said, `Heck, if they won't hire me, I'll get my license and hire
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   He became the first black architect to be licensed in Texas, in
1954, and opened his own firm. The work came.
</P>
<P>
   He designed the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston and
about half the buildings at Texas Southern University. At UT, he
designed the parking garage at 25th and San Antonio Streets, a
$13.8 million soccer/track stadium, now under construction, and a
just-completed $12.7 millionstadium parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Chase co-founded the National Organization of Minority
Architects and was appointed by President Carter to the U.S. Fine
Arts Commission, serving from 1976 to 1981. The commission reviews
building designs in Washington, D.C., and approves the coins used
at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of getting the likeness of an African American
athlete on the gold coins at the Olympics in Los Angeles and for
ensuring that one of the three soldiers on a statue beside the
Vietnam Memorial represented an African American. A highlight of
his career was designing the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's among the top two, three or four African American
architects in the country,'' Speck said.
</P>
<P>
   Speck and others said they hope minorities will get the message
from Chase that they are wanted at UT and can succeed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is the message,'' Temple said. ``John, all his life, has
been a hero to young people.''

NOTRE DAME LEADER VOWS TO BE PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Jarious Jackson has played on the punt return
team, returned an onside kick for a touchdown and, in 28 minutes 41
seconds as Notre Dame's quarterback, managed four touchdown passes
while completing 18 of 32 attempts. He has also been upbraided on
national television by Lou Holtz, then the Fighting Irish coach,
for capping a magnificent 21-yard run with a fumble in a game that
Notre Dame had already won.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard Notre Dame fans chant for him to enter the game,
and then heard them grumble when he was tripped up for a 4-yard
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a senior, will lead Notre Dame against the defending
national champion Michigan Wolverines here Saturday. He is expected
to bury the disappointing memory of the Ron Powlus years and
resurrect the glory of the Tony Rice era, which produced a national
championship 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he plans to emulate another Irish quarterback, Kevin
McDougal, who was probably the least glamorous player to assume one
of the nation's most glamorous positions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, McDougal, an unheralded senior, replaced Rick Mirer and
led the Irish to an 11-1 season and the brink of the national
championship. He is nowhere to be found in Notre Dame's record
books, but he still appeals to the Irish's new quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was patient and I can understand that,'' Jackson said.
``And he won, and that's what I want. I honestly didn't think it
would take this long. But it is what I came here to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The college football season begins in earnest this weekend with
many marquee matchups, and there are missions to be fulfilled
around the country. The Ohio State Buckeyes, with their all-America
linebacker, Andy Katzenmoyer, finally declared academically
eligible, go to West Virginia determined to show that they deserve
the No. 1 ranking they received in many preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   A young Penn State team plays host to Southern Mississippi as
the Nittany Lions try to get the two victories Joe Paterno needs to
join Bear Bryant, Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg in Division I's
300-victory club. Out west, Arizona State's national title hopes
will be tested early against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At Notre Dame Stadium, the second-year coach Bob Davie will send
out a new starting quarterback to avenge last season's loss to
Michigan. That defeat set the tone for the Irish's disappointing
7-6 season last year.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame will also be trying to return the spotlight to what
happens on the field. In one of the most difficult off seasons in
the school's history, Notre Dame lost an age discrimination suit
filed by a former coach, which made public details of player abuse
and embarrassing internal squabbling among Davie and the coaching
staff under Holtz. The program also reported itself for violating
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules involving gifts
given to a dozen players by a woman who pleaded guilty to
embezzling $1 million from her employer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his limited experience, Jackson may be the perfect
leader. As Powlus' backup, he saw how viciously both the news media
and the Notre Dame fans turned on the four-year starter when he did
not live up to expectations. Jackson also experienced a consuming
frustration as a backup, exacerbated by his own missed
opportunities when called upon.
</P>
<P>
   Highly recruited out of Tupelo, Miss., Jackson is still haunted
by the humiliation Holtz heaped on him as a sophomore after the
fumble against Purdue. Holtz followed an on-field tirade with a
summation of Jackson's performance in his post-game comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jarious Jackson's an excellent fourth-string quarterback,''
Holtz said. ``We just don't have a second- and third-string
quarterback right now.''
</P>
<P>
   By then Jackson was already calling home, wondering if he had
made a mistake. He thought of returning to one of the Mississippi
schools or to Tennessee, which recruited him to succeed Peyton
Manning. He told his mother, Karen, not to bother coming to see him
because he wasn't playing.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Jarious Sr., saw some of his own impatience in his
son. Once the roommate of the future Hall of Famer Walter Payton at
Jackson State, he transferred to Alcorn State to find playing time.
``Like me, he wanted to play now,'' Jackson Sr. said. ``I told him
to wait his turn and learn, that he would have his time to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the off season, Jackson added 10 pounds, worked on his
throwing and welcomed a shift in offensive philosophy by Davie. The
Irish will return to the option offense that they had abandoned
during the lead-footed Powlus' reign.  &QL;

STAR-CROSSED CAREER: MURDER CHARGE LATEST CHAPTER IN TROUBLED LIFE
OF TEXAS SINGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Monday, Sept. 7) 
(Attn: Nashville) 
(See optional trim) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SABINAL, Texas _ His accomplishments were nothing short of
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The young South Texas singer named Johnny Rodriguez was not only
an ethnic trail blazer but a prodigious hit maker, racking up 15
Top 10 country singles and releasing more than 30 albums, many on
nationally known record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville fawned over the handsome Hispanic phenom, welcoming
him into the Country Music Hall of Fame's coveted Walkway of the
Stars, while Billboard magazine awarded Rodriguez its Trendsetter
Award for becoming the first Mexican-American singer to capture a
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has played Carnegie Hall, and one notable gig was the
Inaugural Ball for President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But just as surprising was the image last week of the nationally
known country star, trudging meekly out of the Uvalde County Jail
in South Texas after posting a $50,000 bond on a murder charge.
Escorted by sheriff's deputies who shielded him from enraged
relatives of a young acquaintance he is accused of killing Aug. 29,
Rodriguez looked drawn and older than his 46 years as he carried
his belongings in a plastic shopping bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when the road ahead of Johnny's tour bus was
paved in gold and platinum,'' said Casey Monahan, director of the
Texas Music Office and a former Austin music critic.
``Unfortunately, he took a few sharp turns.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not altogether unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's career has been a roller-coaster, shooting upward in
the early 1970s with a string of hugely successful country hits,
and then stymied by drug abuse, unsuccessful rehabilitation
programs, public arrests for drunkenness, and a string of failed
marriages. Of late, Rodriguez has been performing at small clubs
around Texas without a band, still packing them in but a shadow of
his past popularity, his latest record a flop.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few noted the tragic irony of last week's jailhouse
scene. After all, Rodriguez's legendary ascent to stardom and fame
were launched decades after an earlier stay in the Uvalde County
Jail.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in 1969, Rodriguez was locked up for stealing an
expensive Angora goat from a local rancher and grilling it at a
roadside park with a group of friends. Texas Ranger Joaquin Jackson
recognized him in jail as the teen who put on impromptu singing
performances on park benches at nearby Garner State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ranger posted bond for Rodriguez, and helped him land a job
singing in weekend Western skits at Alamo Village, the elaborate
set built in Brackettville for John Wayne's epic movie about the
fall of the Texas mission.
</P>
<P>
   Today, another Texas Ranger, Coy Smith of Uvalde, has taken an
interest in Rodriguez, too, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The ranger is helping Uvalde County prosecutors assemble a
murder case against Rodriguez, who is charged with the fatal
shooting of Israel ``Bosco'' Borrego, 26, early on Aug. 29. The
singer's attorney, Alan Brown of San Antonio, insists Rodriguez was
startled to find an inebriated Borrego inside his mother's Sabinal
frame house at 4:30 in the morning. Believing him to be an
intruder, Brown said, Rodriguez shot him in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego's family disputes that, saying the shooting victim was a
friend of Rodriguez's who frequently stayed at the house and
partied with Rodriguez. District Attorney Tony Hackebeil said both
men had been drinking when the shooting took place. He said he
expects to present the murder case to a grand jury Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Rodriguez's supporters are confident the grand jury will
clear him of murder charges, and that the killing will not end his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is waiting to see what the grand jury says.
If he's no-billed (no indictment returned), I don't think it's
going to hurt at all,'' said an optimistic Randy Willis, an Austin
booking agent who was Rodriguez's manager and went to junior high
school with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in today's society can be put in a position to defend
themselves, and I believe that's what happened to Johnny,'' Willis
said. ``It's just a terrible tragedy, but again, it's not anything
anyone planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabinal residents say Rodriguez returned to his boyhood home
several months ago, and the aging home on Pickford Street was the
venue for occasional front-porch guitar-picking and drinking
parties hosted by Rodriguez. Prosecutors are now investigating an
earlier shooting incident weeks ago at the home in which the singer
allegedly shot at another local man, but did not hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking and drug use are twin demons that have stalked
Rodriguez for years. He has been largely unsuccessful in
vanquishing them, and they had all but ended his once promising
career, say fellow musicians, industry executives and observers of
the country music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid had it all. He had the looks, the personality, and he
could sing,'' said San Antonio vocalist and song writer Johnny
Bush, himself a country legend. ``He was this good-looking kid, he
had charisma like (Elvis) Presley. The girls would scream and throw
their car keys and panties on the stage, although I'm sure some of
that was arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, as I watched his career progress, I watched the
alcohol and drug thing set in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes when confronted with the unexpected rigors of
stardom, Rodriguez sought shelter in substance abuse, the same
self-destructive refuge that has attracted other country stars from
Hank Williams to Johnny Cash to George Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never thought about the star route, and with that comes a
lot of pressures they never thought of. The commitments that come
with being a star, some guys never know about and they can't handle
that ... and then the worst part is standing up on a stage in a
strange part of the country you've never been to before, and baring
your soul to strangers,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to deal with it was the drugs and alcohol, and I
think that was what happened to Johnny, and it happened early.
Everything he ever made went up his nose, and his career peaked
early.''

</P>
<P>
   In Sabinal, the slaying has shocked the small peaceful South
Texas town of 1,500 residents, located about 60 miles west of San
Antonio. Violent crime is a rarity in this close-knit farming town
shaded by enormous live oaks and pecans, where local police say the
last murder occurred two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's slaying was especially troubling because it
involved members of the Rodriguez and Borrego clans, well-known
families who have lived here for generations, attend the same
Catholic church and go to the same public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both families were real nice. It's just a real sad deal,''
said Dora Dominguez, the town's utilities clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Sabinal, Rodriguez is the second-youngest of 10
children. His father, a former San Antonio police officer, is
deceased, and his mother is in a nursing home, acquaintances say.
Two of the singer's sisters work for the local school district, and
one brother is a member of the Sabinal City Council. Rodriguez's
older brother, Reynaldo Rodriguez, is a retired Air Force veteran
who until May was Sabinal's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed sadly resigned to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm am (sorry), too,'' he said, ``but it's done, and you can't
do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   About two years after his unlikely discovery in the county jail,
Rodriguez left Uvalde County and boarded a plane to Nashville with
his guitar and $14 in his pocket, recalls former manager Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez called country star Tom T. Hall, whom he had met while
singing in the western skits at the Alamo Village. Hall took him in
and hired Rodriguez to open his act. In 1972, the novice singer had
a hit on his hands with ``Pass Me By,'' a song written by Hall's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rodriguez had arrived, and he was only 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The next few years were a time of almost unlimited success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded me of a Mexican-American Ricky Nelson,'' recalled
Rick ``Casper'' Rawls, a lead guitarist from Austin who played with
Rodriguez in the early 1970s. ``He was a good singer, really
charismatic, and he looked great. He could really deliver the
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawls recalled a ``sweet guy'' who ``seemed like a very
well-grounded man. He had good family roots, and you could tell he
came from good stock.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1979 Rodriguez signed a record contract with CBS records. But
the anticipated stardom failed to materialize as Rodriguez
struggled with drug and alcohol use; the record company dropped him
in 1985. In 1987, he was clean and attempting a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I go on stage now, I wouldn't take nothin' for
nothin','' he told the Chicago Tribune in a December 1987
interview. ``You couldn't shove it down my throat. There's not a
better feeling than getting up there and being able to feel the
excitement and response. Before, I was so paranoid I didn't want to
look them in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sobriety didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Weslaco police arrested Rodriguez for public intoxication in
1994 in a hotel lounge, after a fight broke out between the singer
and a guitar player from Nashville. Rodriguez, who had played at a
musical festival in the Rio Grande Valley city earlier, pleaded
guilty and paid a $145 fine, Weslaco police said.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, on Jan. 10, 1995, Rodriguez married Lana
Nelson, the oldest daughter of Willie Nelson. &UR;  &LR; The couple had
separated by July, and were divorced in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, they didn't date very long. They only dated three
weeks before they got married,'' said former manager Willis, who
was the singer's best man at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rodriguez's second failed marriage. In 1977, he had wed a
Nashville airline stewardess; Tom T. Hall was best man. The couple
divorced after two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Rodriguez released his last album ``You Can Say That
Again,'' a collection of progressive country material, which
received critical acclaim but failed commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly, really fine work,'' said Los Angeles record
executive Larry Sloven, whose HighTone Records released the album.
``Why didn't it sell? It's because of the nature of country radio
these days. It's almost impossible to get record play in any
meaningful way unless it's a record from a Nashville record company
with some 25-year-old guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians who have played with Rodriguez over the years have
come to his defense, and insist he is not prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy must have scared the dickens out of Johnny because
that's not him. That's out of character for him to do something
like that, and I've known him since 1972,'' said Jerry Blanton, a
steel guitarist from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton, who last played with Rodriguez at a spring performance
in Corpus Christi, insists he has never witnessed any drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured one of these days I'd see him in his bad mode, but I
never saw him when he wasn't clean and ready to work,'' Blanton
said. ``He drank a little beer, and he loved to visit with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Rodriguez remarried and the couple had a
child in April. Before a June gig in San Antonio he told the San
Antonio Express-News he was living clean and trying to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even drink around my family,'' the singer said.
``They're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm going to
concentrate on my music and try and mend some of the rips I've
caused over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, the singer's fate lies in the hands of
a legal system that gave him a chance decades before.

<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ If this had to be the baseball season when the
home-run record was smashed, Sandy Thiel had a small request:
Please don't let it happen on her birthday, which is coming up in a
few days. That, she says, would force her ``to remember it for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid Cichy had stopped watching baseball games altogether,
figuring it would be easier to take if he did not actually see it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Olson had bet a candy bar and a soda that the
history-making home run would not happen and, in less delusional
moments, tried to tell himself that it was not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt this way about baseball since I was in fifth
grade,'' said Olson, 45. ``I can hear the baseball cards rattling
through my bike spokes again, like when I was a kid and you put
them there with clothespins to make your bike sound like a
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much resigned myself that they'll probably break
the record, and I keep reminding myself that it's not mine,'' Olson
added, referring to Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, who
hit his 58th and 59th home runs in Florida on Wednesday night, and
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, who hit No. 56.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the emotional calisthenics that people were putting
themselves through in the hometown of Roger Maris, whose record of
61 home runs in a season had stood for 37 years but was fast
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the country was gripped by irrepressible
excitement as McGwire and Sosa moved ever closer to the magic
number, people in Fargo were wrestling with more complicated
feelings. They were wistful and nostalgic, grateful for the sudden
flood of recognition being paid their hero, but achingly aware that
it was more of a requiem than a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Maris, who died in 1985 of lymphatic cancer,
was one of their own. It's also that people from this modest
prairie town, tundra-cold and table-flat, are moved by some of the
sadder particulars of the Maris story: that in 1961, when he played
right field for the New York Yankees, Maris felt hounded by
reporters and denigrated by those who did not want him to break the
record of 60 home runs set by another Yankee right fielder, Babe
Ruth, in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   People here are also keenly aware that Maris was never elected
to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and that the baseball commissioner
relegated his achievement to a footnote in the record books because
the regular season had been extended by eight games at that time _
a notation (since removed) that came to be known as the
``asterisk.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, people here believe that Fargo is considered to be
an asterisk, too. Although it is North Dakota's largest city, with
nearly 80,000 people, Fargo is rarely in the national spotlight.
People thought the movie ``Fargo'' made fun of them, and on top of
that, most of the film was shot in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of Fargo's record as well as Roger's,'' said Dick
Savageau, 64, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carney, 82, who knew Maris when he was a star all-round
high school athlete, said, ``We don't get many big heroes out of
North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, Roger Maris is as big as they come _ bigger still,
people say, because he never forgot his friends or lost his
down-to-earth demeanor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a Roger Maris charity golf tournament and a Roger Maris
Cancer Center. And there is his baseball-diamond-shaped gravestone
in Holy Cross Cemetery, with its inscription, ``Against All Odds.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the Roger Maris museum, a 74-foot glass case in the
West Acres shopping mall, sandwiched between a Pet Center and a
Spencer Gifts store. It was placed there, said Jim McLaughlin, the
curator, because Maris wanted his plaques, bats and home-run balls
in a place where the admission was free and lots of people would
see them.
</P>
<P>
   Maris even designated 100 autographed postcards for visitors who
``understand who Roger Maris really is,'' said McLaughlin, who
bestowed one on a couple stopping by on their honeymoon and gave
another to a devoted elderly fan.
</P>
<P>
   A whole trove of Roger Maris folklore permeates Fargo. How
Maris, whose family was originally from Minnesota, played football
for Shanley High School and ran five kickoffs back for touchdowns
in one game, causing the opposing coach to say he dreaded when his
own team scored.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and classmates remember the young Maris as a prankster,
who once put pancake batter in the overshoes of the nuns at Shanley
High. And Bob Wood, a close friend, talks of the time they got
tired of hooligans pestering them and their dates when they parked
on Lover's Lane. Wood put on his sister's kerchief and he and Maris
pretended to be a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started harassing us, we'd jump out and have a nice
little fight with them,'' said Wood, now 63.
</P>
<P>
   Lover's Lane has since been renamed; now it's Roger Maris Drive.
</P>
<P>
   There is even ``Maris,'' the musical, created in part by Olson
and produced by Ms. Thiel, who are hoping it might get a nibble
from a New York theater someday. It's got a Mickey Mantle-Roger
Maris song-and-dance number, and a ballad about unflinching
loyalty:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long after the cheering fades
</P>
<P>
   And after the big parades,
</P>
<P>
   And long past all the accolades
</P>
<P>
   I'll still believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing better expresses Fargo's feelings for Maris, exalting in
his accomplishments, commiserating over the pressure he weathered
in that 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really felt sorry for the guy,'' Savageau said. ``He'd get
that same question every day: Are you going to hit a home run
today? Are you going to break Babe Ruth's record? `How do I know?'
That would be his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it got personal,'' Savageau added. ``Do you womanize when
you're on the road? He was losing his hair, just getting so
uptight. He wanted out of the glass bowl that he was in, to go back
home and find his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people have been worried that when someone
smacked number 62 out of the park, it would steal the recognition
from Fargo and its hero. Others hoped that this year's pursuit of
Maris' record would have the opposite effect, maybe even get Maris
into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people throughout the country know Roger now than did
before, and that might give him a better chance to finally get
in,'' said Wayne Blanchard, 63, who played high school football
with Maris and is chairman of the charity golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Fargo will probably face the post-Maris future with
the kind of affable, weatherproof fortitude that greeted Yogi Berra
in 1985. Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher and onetime teammate of
Maris, was in Fargo for the charity golf tournament, and he
reportedly remarked that he did not believe such flat land could
produce enough potatoes to fill up his front yard. A few months
later, 900 50-pound boxes of North Dakota potatoes were trucked to
Berra's home in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the record is broken and we're no longer the site of the
fellow who hit the home-run record?'' asked Cichy, who coached
Maris in all his sports at Shanley High. He paused, considering the
question, and then replied: ``We'll get our snow shovels out. It's
going to be winter before long.''

CORPUS CHRISTI METHODICALLY BUILDS A TOURIST INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ The world surely is wide enough to hold
a few more tourist attractions, and this city of 400,000 people has
tried mightily to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? After all, other U.S. cities have fashioned
successful tourist industries by virtue of natural setting, vision
or sometimes good luck.
</P>
<P>
   These include Branson, Mo., a year-round country music capital;
Tunica, Miss., a town that is climbing out of rank poverty with
glitzy hotels and glitzier gambling casinos; and such shopping
meccas as Potomac Mills outlet mall in Dale City, Va., which draws
more tourists than Colonial Williamsburg. Then there is Newport,
Ore., where the arrival of Keiko the whale (of ``Free Willy'' fame)
has attracted an additional 1 million visitors to the Oregon Coast
Aquarium and has the town's 9,000 residents pondering what will
become of its multimillion-dollar tourist industry after Keiko is
returned to a sea pen in its native Iceland on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   But Corpus Christi, a socially conservative and heavily Hispanic
city, has few spectacular natural assets or claims to fame.
Instead, it has gone about its pursuit of tourism in a methodical
manner, investing millions to try to overcome some difficult
strokes of geographical misfortune. And success is already evident
in the rising number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever expect to become another Orlando or Las Vegas,
because we understand what kind of tourist destination we are _
primarily a beach town,'' said Mike Crouch, director of public
affairs for the Business Alliance. ``But we hope to attract lots
more tourists and convention delegates and have them stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Known mostly for its oil industry, which fell on hard times
starting in the late 1980s, the city is tucked within a lovely bay
behind Padre Island on the Gulf of Mexico, way down in southeast
Texas, more than 200 miles from Houston and almost 400 miles from
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   As a former tourist official said, ``You don't get to Corpus
Christi by accident, you have to work at getting here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most air service to and from the city is on regional carriers,
and nonstops to other states are nonexistent. Even a flight to El
Paso, for example, 720 road miles away, typically takes four to six
hours, depending on connections and stops.
</P>
<P>
   Though a number of Corpus Christi hotels and attractions are
worth bragging about _ one is a life-size statue of Selena
Quintanilla Perez, 23, the Queen of Tejano, or Texas-Mexican
borderland music, who was shot dead by her fan club president in
1995 _ they are a far cry from the snazzy theme parks or casinos
that pack in the crowds elsewhere. Thus, the great bulk of Corpus
Christi tourists are still likely to come from within a 150-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
   With its large Hispanic population and proximity to Mexico,
Corpus Christi is especially determined to attract a larger share
of the 3 million Mexican tourists and convention delegates who
spent almost $900 million in the state last year.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that city officials in set about building a
tourist industry that did more than attract penny-pinching college
students on spring break or day-trippers to its many beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dead set against the ``build it and they'll come'' mentality,
Corpus Christi officials have been careful to order economic impact
studies before plunking down a dime to buy attractions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the go-ahead for a $33 million aquarium, which
opened in 1990, was given only after studies projected that it
would make money _ and after a look at the success of Baltimore's
aquarium and Inner Harbor. Averaging about 440,000 visitors a year,
the aquarium is now credited with adding $50 million a year to
Corpus Christi's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The city also shelled out $4.1 million for the World War II
aircraft carrier USS Lexington after spirited bidding with Quincy,
Mass., and Mobile, Ala. But first the city received reassurance
from Debbie Prost, head of what is now Prost Marketing Inc., a San
Antonio consulting firm, that the ship would draw far more than the
270,000 visitors a year needed to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, officials also studied the success of six other
cities that had former Navy ships as tourist sites. Since opening
in October 1992, the Lexington has averaged almost 350,000 visitors
a year and has contributed $62 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The ship and the aquarium have also spruced up North Beach, a
section of the city that was badly damaged in a hurricane in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up in this city,'' said Frank Stanford of College
Station, Texas, ``North Beach was infested with drugs and crime.
But as you can see, today it's filled with families.'' Stanford was
showing Corpus Christi's attractions to a friend, Diane Havalda of
Austin. As he spoke, lots of children scampered around the
aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million Greyhound Race Track, opened in 1990 and owned
by a Florida corporation that was able to qualify for certain tax
rebates available under a state enterprise zone, continues to
attract many out-of-staters who spend the winter months in Texas.
But the track has been overshadowed somewhat since the state
lottery began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The only sizable investment that has not lived up to promise is
the $1.1 million paid to Spain for the right to operate and manage
replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, the fleet that
Columbus sailed to the New World more than 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fleet has attracted 650,000 paying customers since
opening five years ago, the Pinta and the Santa Maria were damaged
in 1994, when a tow cable snapped and a barge crashed into them.
Repairs by Spanish shipwrights were completed only this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A small zoo and a botanical garden have recently been added to
Corpus Christi's tourism mix, the Asian Cultures Museum moved into
a new building, and the Museum of Science and History was
extensively remodeled and expanded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these efforts, the number of visitors grew to
5.5 million in 1997, from fewer than 2.3 million in 1986 _ a 139
percent increase during a time when total U.S. tourism grew about
89 percent. Hotel room revenues doubled, to $100.4 million.
Tourism-related jobs also doubled, to 10,200, and the
tourism-related payroll almost tripled, to $152 million. The
average visitor's stay, which had never been more than a day, grew
to 2.5 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention Center in Bayfront Plaza booked 151,679
convention delegates in 1996, the last year for those figures
available, a 60 percent increase over 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the growth, Corpus Christi doesn't approach the
number of visitors to Orlando, Fla. (35.6 million in 1996), Las
Vegas (30.5 million) or even San Antonio, which recorded 7 million
visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, not all the improvements, including the trendy
restaurants, sleek office buildings and modern hotels along the
two-mile-long white waterfront seawall and walkway, are a result of
tourism. The petrochemical industry, for example, pumps more than
$1 billion into the local economy, while the city's growing health
care services employ about 24,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   It was the collapse of Corpus Christi's decades-long dependence
on gas and oil that sent the city reeling when the price of
domestic oil plummeted from $40 a barrel in 1980 to $10 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1986, unemployment reached a decade-high of 12.2 percent,
and we lost 5,000 jobs in the oil and gas exploration industry,''
said Gary Bushell, president of the Greater Corpus Christi Business
Alliance. Just between 1986 and 1988, hotel revenues fell from
$45.5 million to $38.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pruet, a small business owner, former city councilman and
chairman of the business alliance's tourism committee, said: ``For
almost 100 years oil and gas provided our tax base, funded our
schools and created our jobs. Every big oil company was here. But
when oil went down the chute, they just abandoned those offices and
pulled out. When it was agreed to really go after tourists, we knew
we had to go beyond just T-shirts and kids on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism indeed remains at the forefront of Corpus Christi's
effort to make a name for itself while adding jobs and earning
money.
</P>
<P>
   While hoping (and lobbying) to attract cruise ships, the city
has formed a partnership with San Antonio whereby cruise passengers
can also fly to that mission city before or after their cruise, to
visit the Alamo or the city's acclaimed River Walk.
</P>
<P>
   It has also established a tourism and trade office in Monterrey,
Mexico, together with its Texas neighbor, Loredo, and the Port of
Corpus Christi, the nation's sixth-largest port.
</P>
<P>
   A big drawing card for Mexican and Mexican-American tourists is
the Selena statue. In the middle of the nine seawall pavilions
along Ocean Drive, the bronze statue continues to attract legions
of fans, young and old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came mostly for the beach,'' said Roberto Leal of
Monterrey, on his first visit here recently with two related
families that together consisted of 10 adults and 12 children.
``But we don't want to go home without seeing the aquarium and the
memorial to Selena.''

 By NOELLE KNOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the mutual funds that find themselves in good stead as
of late have something in common: big short positions.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell &AMP; Orkin Market Opportunity, for example, bet 40 percent
of its portfolio on falling stock prices, and was up 3.6 percent
from the market peak on July 17 through last Thursday, according to
Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Lindner
Bulwark, shoting 25 percent of its assets, saw its shares climb 5.8
percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Investors short a stock as a way to profit from its decline.
They borrow the shares from a broker for a small fee and sell them
on the open market. After the share price declines, they buy back
the shares at the lower market price and return them to the broker,
pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risky game. If the shares rise, the investor has to buy
them back for more than he paid and take a loss. That is what
happened to William J. Nasgovitz, whose Heartland Small Cap
Contrarian fund, despite the vicious selloff in small and
micro-size stocks, has been crippled by unprofitable short
positions coupled with the overall market decline.
</P>
<P>
   The fund lost 18.7 percent from the July 17 peak through
Thursday, worse than the 17 percent loss for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index over that period.
</P>
<P>
   Situations like this underscore why many funds swear off
shorting stocks _ and how the strategies of shorting seem as varied
as the managers who make such bets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for companies that we believe have misled investors
about their potential in the future,'' said Andrew F. Boord,
co-manager of Lindner Bulwark, &UR;  &LR; which has $28.8 million in assets
under management. ``We try to go short on those kind of stocks,
regardless of what the market does.''
</P>
<P>
   Boord loves to hate Daou Systems Inc., a San Diego-based
information technology consultant to health care companies. From a
high of $34.375 last Sept. 23, Daou's stock closed at $6.625 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Boord, 26, started shorting shares at the beginning of the year.
By the end of June, at an average price of $18, Daou had become his
largest short position.
</P>
<P>
   Daou's earnings have met Wall Street's expectations, but Boord
said, ``When you look at how they made their numbers it's almost
laughable; it's pretty strange.'' In particular, he points to a
fast-growing line on Daou's balance sheet called ``work in
progress,'' under which Daou includes a percentage of revenues from
unbilled contracts. ``It shouldn't grow that much more than
revenues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rieger, a spokesman for Daou, said the practice is
required under generally accepted accounting principles and was
validated by its accountants, Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   But such bookkeeping has apparently raised concern among other
investors. On Aug. 14, the company's stock plunged 31 percent on
rumors that Daou would have to restate its second-quarter earnings.
The company issued a news release defending its financial
statements. Nevertheless, the company was hit with two-class action
lawsuits contending accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   (Daou has issued a statement saying it had ``meritorious
defenses'' against the claims and planned to defend itself
vigorously.).
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, Lindner Bulwark's numbers display the ugly
battle scars of shorting in a bull market. Since its February 1994
inception, it has lost 1.4 percent annually, on average, versus a
20.2 annual return for S&AMP;P 500. And in 1998, it has lost 1.9
percent, through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved it's very difficult selling short Wall Street's
most-loved, over-owned, and over-valued growth stocks,'' said
Nasgovitz, 53, president of Heartland Advisors, which manages $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   His Heartland Small Cap Contrarian mutual fund, with $113.4
million in assets, can hold up to 25 percent of its assets in short
positions, and was off 26.2 percent for this year as of Thursday.
On Aug. 18, Nasgovitz announced plans to merge the fund with the
$1.6 billion Heartland Value fund, which does not short stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent the last few weeks buying stocks to cover some 20
short positions. On Sept. 1, he closed out a successful
300,000-share short positions on Organogenesis, which he shorted at
$18 a share and bought back at $9. And he also won big betting
against Micron Technology. He bought 85,000 shares at about $23 a
share, covering a short at $33.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he bought 100,000 shares of Compaq Computer at about
$30 a share, taking a small loss. He shorted all three companies
because he thought they were overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Nasgovitz has three shorts remaining on Heartland's books: Clear
Channel Communications, Consolidated Graphics and Dollar Tree
Stores. He sees them as trading at inflated prices, yet their
shares have continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Since its April 1995 inception, the fund has returned 5.7
percent annually on average, through Thursday, versus 11.8 percent
for its average small-cap value peer, according to Morningstar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Orkin, 39, manager of Caldwell &AMP; Orkin Market
Opportunity, is a big-picture thinker. He looks at the economic
crisis in Asia and shorts large companies in the United States
involved in cyclical industries like steel, engineering and
construction that will be hurt by it.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, he also has been increasing his short positions in
companies that lend money to people with less-than-stellar credit
histories. These sub-prime lenders, as they are known, can have
problems when the economy sours and people cannot afford to pay
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're in a bear market now, or just a
correction,'' he said. ``But I do expect a significant bear market
between now and the next 10 years, with a 60 percent-plus
downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin declined to name specific stocks that he is shorting. But
according to the fund's annual report, as of April 30 its largest
short positions were in Caterpillar and PMI Group, a mortgage
insurer. They have since fallen 19.3 and 32.1 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was closed to new investors on Aug. 27, after it was
flooded with $150 million, almost doubling its assets in 10 weeks.
Small wonder: The fund has sizzled, returning 20.2 percent for the
year through Thursday, according to Morningstar.

   Labor Day is still seen largely as a blue-collar, big-shoulders
kind of holiday, even though the overwhelming majority of its
celebrants are largely disassociated from the principles of the
organized work force.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Labor Department, there were just over 16
million union members at work in the country last year, about 14.1
percent of all workers. The proportion of union workers has been
steadily declining since 1953, when it was nearly 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these grim statistics, labor lives. Witness recent
strikes against General Motors and Bell Atlantic and the current
action against Northwest Airlines. Even the mutual fund industry is
taking labor seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, MFS Investment Management embraced an investing
strategy formulated by a member of the longshoremen's union in
Savannah, Ga., and created the Union Standard Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eason, a longshoreman and a trustee of his union's
pension fund, was frustrated at the sight of his pension money
being invested in companies with bad labor relations. So he
developed a number of litmus tests to determine a company's
relative labor friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invest in a list of companies that meet certain criteria
that are labor-friendly,'' said Mitchell Dynan, who has managed the
fund since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, labor unions are likely to warm to such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions have always had tremendous pension power,'' said A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. ``But I
don't think that in the past it has been used terribly effectively
for the rank and file.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the labor-friendly benchmarks for the portfolio: at least
5 percent of a company's employees must be unionized; the company
cannot be involved in a strike or lockout; it cannot make products
that are on the boycott list of the AFL-CIO; it must meet certain
health, safety and labor laws, and it must not show a pattern of
outsourcing _ the transfer of work to other companies. The fund
only buys American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Screening is done by an advisory board of senior labor
officials, academics and outside company managers; Labor Research
Inc., a division of American Capital Strategies of Bethesda, Md.,
supplies the results to Dynan.
</P>
<P>
   The list that they compile, the Labor Sensitivity Index, has a
total of about 540 stocks. Dynan culls that list to 65 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   But last December, the investment parameters were relaxed
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until December 1997, I had to be 100 percent invested in the
companies on this list,'' Dynan said. ``At that point the board
gave me a little more flexibility, and now allows me to invest up
to 20 percent of the fund's assets in financial services and
technology, industries in which there is very little
unionization.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially created only for public and labor union pension plans,
the fund was opened to retail investors in August 1997; the minimum
investment is $1,000. It now has about $100 million under
management.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 90 percent of the money in the fund is from unions,
including the American Federation of Musicians and Employers
pension fund, the Transportation Workers Union, and the
International Alliance of Theater Stage Employees.
</P>
<P>
   For individuals, the fund carries hefty sales charges _ a 5.75
percent maximum front-end sales charge on its class A shares, for
example. But results have been attractive. For the three years
ended Thursday, the average annual return of the fund's
institutional shares was 21.5 percent, versus 16.7 percent for the
average fund in its category of large-capitalization blend funds,
which tend to buy big-company stocks and have both value and growth
investing styles, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund lagged behind the 22.2 percent return of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 over that period, it has beaten the index's
return so far this year _ 2.8 percent versus 2.2 percent as of
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dynan and his predecessor, William Harris, have achieved this
record by concentrating their holdings in large-cap stocks that
until recently, at least, were among the best performers in the
steady advance of major market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Dynan also likes to see a large amount of executive and employee
ownership of a stock and prefers high-visibility companies in
``recurring revenue'' businesses, like supermarkets, which can be
fairly certain what they are going to earn over the next six to
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Dynan also likes businesses that generate free cash, or cash
after capital spending and dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty conservative portfolio, and I want to
maintain it that way,'' Dynan said. ``That is my investment style.
Also, right now I am cautious about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's four biggest holdings are citadels of American
capitalism: General Electric, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Exxon and
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Since being allowed to invest in financial-service and
high-technology companies, Dynan, who also serves as co-manager of
the Massachusetts Financial Services Investors Trust, has added
insurance companies like Allstate Insurance and Hartford Financial
Services Group and banks like U.S. Bancorp, National City Corp. and
Washington Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   He also put about 1.5 percent of the fund into Microsoft and 1
percent in BMC Software. ``Those stocks have definitely
contributed'' to the fund's performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the market's recent downward spike is a source of concern,
Dynan said that as a buy-and-hold investor, ``I don't try and call
the market; I invest in companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting his cautious view about the economy, Dynan has
overweighted the fund in consumer staples companies, the largest
sector grouping, at nearly 20 percent of the portfolio. Industrial
cyclicals account for nearly a quarter of the portfolio, and energy
stocks are well over 10 percent, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last week, Dynan said he was not selling stocks to
raise cash, despite the market's recent slide and his worries about
the effects of the Asian and Russian financial crises on corporate
earnings.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Bear markets never happen when interest rates
fall.'' This argument has been trotted out in the last few months
by all manner of Wall Street strategists, perhaps to calm nervous
investors as they watched their portfolios drift lower.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, it's not exactly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unusual for stocks to decline in tandem with
interest rates, it is by no means impossible, as recent weeks have
shown. From the peak of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index on
July 17 to Friday's close, the market has lost 17.9 percent of its
value. At the same time, interest rates have made a huge move down,
with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.28 percent,
from 5.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate befell stock and bond investors in another great
bull market, said Louise Yamada, director and senior technical
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney _ the run in stocks that began in
1860 and lasted into the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bull market of that century is depicted in the
accompanying chart, courtesy of the Security Research Co. in
Wellesley Hills, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After moving up smartly during the 1860s, the stock market
reached a peak in 1872. At the time, bond yields were falling.
There was no federal debt yet _ imagine! _ but yields on railroad
bonds and other benchmark issues fell to 4 percent, from about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the decline in interest rates, stocks lost 34
percent of their value in a bear phase that lasted until 1877. Then
stocks began to climb again.
</P>
<P>
   This history lesson helps explain why, contrary to popular
wisdom, stocks can, indeed, fall alongside bond yields. The reason,
in a word, is disinflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1870s through the 1890s were one of the nation's longest
periods of steady, even falling, prices, not too different from the
situation today. As the Industrial Revolution unfolded, the United
States General Price Level, that day's version of the Consumer
Price Index, fell 1.3 percent a year, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while consumer prices are up about 1.5 percent, producer
prices have fallen about 0.5 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier period also parallels ours in that lower prices were
accompanied by real gross domestic product growth and higher wages.
Today it's a technology revolution that is producing those results.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 50 years, investors have grown unfamiliar with the
effects of deflation on stocks and bonds. In most people's
memories, the American economy has been driven by scarcity; demand
for goods has led supply. Manufacturers followed scarcity,
producing goods that fetched the highest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, excess capacity around the world is driving demand, argues
James Paulsen, chief investment officer of Norwest Investment
Management in Minneapolis. ``Wherever prices are falling fastest,
like technology, it brings more demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Great for consumers, but not for corporations. Those unable to
cut costs fast enough show profit declines. ``As long as prices are
falling slowly, corporations can adjust,'' Paulsen said. ``If
prices fall sharply, they can't.'' Which is where we may be now.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock price recovery in 1877 proves, companies can adjust
to disinflation. As demand catches up with supply, stocks
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave investors today? ``There are certainly
signs that this is a bear market,'' Ms. Yamada said. ``But we don't
have enough evidence to suggest that it's the end of the secular
bull market that began in 1982.'' It may simply be a painful but
temporary period in which companies adjust to falling prices. When
they do, stocks can move up again.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats, stocks have further to fall. Then, get ready
for the rebound.

   Washington _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt will meet next Wednesday to review plans for
receiving a report on President Clinton from independent counsel
Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which will include Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and ranking Democrat John Conyers of Michigan,
also will cover the impeachment process and ways to ensure that any
such proceedings are bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gephardt called Gingrich, who was on a dinosaur dig
in Montana, to set up the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's spokesman, Erik Smith, quoted the Missouri Democrat
as saying: ``If this process must begin, it is among the most
serious responsibilities Congress will undertake, and it must be
conducted in a truly bipartisan manner.''
</P>
<P>
   House rules call for an impeachment inquiry to be carried out by
the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been working on a report to Congress for some time,
but there is no indication he has yet notified Congress that it is
complete.

VOTE ON PRIME MINISTER PUT OFF UNTIL MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the ruble kept plunging and prices skyrocketed,
Russia backed away from the political abyss Friday after the
opposition-dominated lower house of parliament postponed its vote
on President Boris Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, had appeared certain to reject Chernomyrdin,
which would have intensified a standoff with Yeltsin that has
already left the country without a working government as its
financial markets collapse and panic buying spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Duma put off its vote until Monday after Yeltsin
agreed to hold talks with opposition leaders on giving them more of
a say in naming a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after Chernomyrdin disclosed vague details of the
``economic dictatorship'' to save the Russian economy. The plan
involves stabilizing the ruble by linking it to Russia's hard
currency reserves, a concept similar to the ``currency board'' that
has been used to halt rapid currency devaluation in other
countries. Chernomyrdin's program also sought to improve tax
compliance and take on a long overdue strutural overhaul of
industry by declaring bankrupt any company that could not pay its
debts. But first, the government would increase its hard currency
reserves and then pump rubles into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding the money supply, Russia would be embarking on a
policy President Clinton and international lenders had warned
against, fearing it could lead to hyperinflation. Government
officials acknowledged that expanding the money supply was bound to
lead to an rapid increase in prices, but that the money was needed
to meet the goals of paying off workers and ending a nonpayment
crisis that has paralyzed the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea sounded good enough to the upper house of parliament,
the Federation Council, which gave the acting premier a 91-17 vote
of confidence. The vote was non-binding, but it appeared to
convince the Duma, which has the final say on whether to confirm
Chernomyrdin, to postpone a showdown and enter negotiations with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's author, acting Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov,
said by expanding the money supply, the government could pay off
its debts to workers, industry and investors.

   ``We have to settle accounts with the past,'' Fyodorov said in
an interview on NTV television. ``Today we have an enormous
quantity of debts, the budget is not balanced. Everybody wants
(monetary) emission. Just look at parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   With a clean slate, Fyodorov said, the government could take on
long overdue efforts to overhaul industry and balance its budget by
improving tax compliance.
</P>
<P>
   A larger problem will be whether Chernomyrdin's government can
carry off the plan. Many observers blame Chernomyrdin, who was
prime minister for over five years until this March, for the
widespread graft and misuse of funds that contributed to Russia's
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For the new plan to work, Fyodorov said, Russia's hard currency
reserves would have to be increased from their current level of $12
billion, but he did not say where the money would come from. The
International Monetary Fund and other lenders backed a $22.6
billion loan to Russia in July, but the IMF has said it would delay
the next $4.3 billion tranche unless Russia undertook painful
stabilization measures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of printing money to pay debts has long been advocated
by parliament, as well as some Western economists, who argue that
the Russian economy has been dangerously deflated in recent years
as the government fought to keep prices, and the ruble, stable.
Barter had replaced cash as the form of payment of choice, and
firms ignored their debts to each other, and to their employees.
The result was something commentators begin referring to a
``virtual economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The stable ruble disappeared on Aug. 17, when the government
announced it would no longer defend the currency. Since then, the
ruble has lost over two thirds of its value and Friday dropped to
around 19 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have also shot up _ the government reported a 15 percent
increase in August. But in Moscow shops, a more vivid indicator of
the price rise could be found in such once abundant imported items
as instant coffee or diapers, which have tripled in recent days as
importers and wholesalers, wary of losing money on the rapidly
crumbling Russian currency, have halted shipments.

 &HT;    LEADERS TO MEET WEDNESDAY AS CONGRESS PREPARES FOR STARR REPORT
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR AND CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Gearing up for possible impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton, the first order of business next week
will be a huddle between House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., over how best to
handle an impending report about the president in icy partisan
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the points of contention expected at that meeting
next Wednesday morning is an attempt by Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee, responsible for overseeing any impeachment
inquiry of Clinton, to seek the power to hold any witness in
contempt of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That power, unprecedented for a member of Congress, would allow
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, the right to order
the sergeant at arms to arrest and jail any potential witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal is startling,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for
the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee. ``I feel certain
that Democratic members will have very grave concerns about the
assumption about the sweeping and unchecked power even by a member
as respected by Chairman Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans are balking at the notion. House Rules
Committee Chairman Jerry Solomon, R-NY, said he is resisting Hyde's
request because he does not think that any member ``ought to have
the right to lock up anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and Hyde are now negotiating a resolution that would
give the Judiciary Committee the ability to review the charges set
forth in the much anticipated report from Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has spent more than $40 million on a wide-ranging probe of
the president, including whether Clinton committed perjury by lying
about an affair with a former White House intern and then
obstructing justice by trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful not to set an unfair precedent,'' said
Solomon, confirming that Hyde is seeking the contempt of Congress
power. Solomon said the resolution could be ready for a vote in his
committee as early as Thursday, but he added it all depended upon
when Starr delivered the report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully Mr. Starr will call us and let us know when we might
expect it,'' said Solomon, noting that Gingrich has had no hand in
discussing the impeachment process. Solomon released details of
what the resolution looks like now. Still subject to major changes,
it calls for giving the Judiciary Committee the sole jurisdiction
over handling the report, but an executive summary of the report
would be made available to all 435 members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde supports issuing an executive summary, but he does not
favor making the entire report public out of respect to the
witnesses who were questioned before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a member of the Judicaiary Committee,
said he believes the full report should be public: ``Here you have
the highest elected official in the United States, acting
inappropriately with the holder of one of the lowest offices in the
government, in the workplace, and the public has right to know all
the facts and the whole story and the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday meeting will include Hyde and John Conyers, the
ranking Democrat from Michigan, who has already complained about
the partisan nature of the panel. Gephardt located the speaker on a
dinosaur dig in Montana to ask for the meeting, ending what has
been described by aides as a testy period of their relationship as
the two most powerful members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is also the day that Starr is rumored to inform
Gingrich that he has completed his report.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report, even if it is delayed, is likely to overshadow
the work of the House and its members, most of whom were away from
Washington when Clinton made his Aug. 17 admission that he had lied
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a point of frustration for Georgia Democratic Rep.
John Lewis. He is concerned that the controversy will keep the
House from passing important legislation, such as the 13
appropriations bills that fund the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Democrats who are privately saying they are on
the fence about supporting Clinton, Lewis said it was important for
the party to stand behind the president. ``You just don't go around
kicking someone when he's down,'' he said. ``We will stand together
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr, who sits on the Judiciary
Committee, said that no business is as important as upholding the
congressional responsibility of making the president accountable
for lying to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, Barr said he is bracing for what will be an
increasingly partisan attack on the GOP by Democrats trying to
deflect attention from the scandal. ``I think we will see several
things: some individuals who will take a very partisan attack, but
I think most members will take a sober look at this. It's one thing
to talk theoretical about this, it's another to actually receive a
report which certifies that there is credible evidence of
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is not expected to
attend Wednesday's meeting, although he's in charge of rounding up
Republican votes. He may be excluded because, of all the Republican
leaders, he has staked out the strongest position on Clinton,
calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's staff members said they're feeling no backlash from
other House leaders for DeLay's stance, but they do suspect
retaliation from the White House: no White House tour passes have
been approved for DeLay's constituents since he called for the
president's job.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv disputed the complaint:
``Congressman DeLay has been attacking this president for 5 1/2
years, and during that time, he's gotten hundreds if not thousands
of his constituents through the White House. There is a process
here. When they apply for tickets late and don't get them, they
should know better than to cry politics.''

TRUTH BEGINS WITH THE FACT OF DEATH  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - This is the Information Age, a century choked with
facts and factoids, bites and gigabytes. Yet, for all the blizzard
of data, it has been a century of drought for truth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a big difference, of course. Facts are true locally _
at a certain time and place, like the Oval Office _ but what we
call truth covers those big things that we believe never change.
Politics and courtrooms are concerned with fact; art and religion
care about truth.
</P>
<P>
   But as the century has progressed, we have become increasingly
suspicious of the very idea of truth to the point that many younger
people simply no longer believe there is such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into this attitude in a seminar I addressed at Arizona
State University. The brightest and most talented student in the
class took exception to my exhortation to use art to discover
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing universal,'' she said, giving words to the
common belief, which in itself is a sweepingly universal statement.
``It's all just personal preference.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her if she didn't think that her art had validity for
her viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just my version,'' she said. ``I don't expect anyone
else to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, I wondered, did she bother to make art? What was the point
beyond self-gratification?
</P>
<P>
   It was, as I saw it, utter capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I still understood why she might think that way. It was a
previous ``universal truth'' held by everyone from Aristotle to the
Southern Baptist Convention that prevented women from making art in
the past _ or at least kept them from being taken seriously.
Universal truths held people back, subjected, disenfranchised and
enslaved them, justified the status quo and glorified local
circumstances _ that is all she cared about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The century has had its fill of horror perpetrated in the name
of ``universal truths.'' Cambodia cleared out its cities and
slaughtered citizens in the name of a great truth. The Soviet Union
starved its provinces and imprisoned its best in the name of a
``historical truth.'' Germany's big truth ended in genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And in the centuries before ours, truth had a nasty habit of
justifying colonialism, war, racism, the subjugation of women and
the worst aspects of jingoistic nationalism. Read any 19th-century
justification of slavery. Is it any wonder we become nervous and
twitchy about anyone claiming a franchise on truth?
</P>
<P>
   Even in our own time, those who profess to know the truth
habitually kill those who don't agree. It doesn't matter if they
are Christian or Muslim, Tamil or Sikh. Truth is too often just a
good excuse to blow each other to kingdom come.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the loss of a sense of universal truth is just as bad in
some ways. We have no core beliefs to unify our culture; it
fragments into interest groups and the groups fragment into
individuals, each with his or her own desires and directions. The
groups quarrel and soon, like Tutsis and Hutus, they are at each
other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   There are 5.9 billion screaming ids. Either way, people wind up
dead.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be one of the functions of art and literature that
they tested the veracity of purported truths, taking exception to
ideas that had become outworn and making provisional stabs at
creating substitutes. Art was the attempt to find universal truths
that could stand up to the sulfuric acid used to separate the gold
from the dross.
</P>
<P>
   As D.H. Lawrence said about the novel, meretricious ideas are
easier to spot in fiction than in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem now is that it isn't that we no longer know
which truth to believe, but that we simply don't believe there is
any truth.
</P>
<P>
   We have reached an uncomfortable impasse. We need belief to make
life meaningful, yet we cannot allow ourselves to believe in
anything. Every faith, institution, political faction and ideal has
proved at some level to be a tissue of hypocrisy. We decry our own
cynicism, but recognize that, at some level, it is merely realism.
</P>
<P>
   Some retreat into conventional orthodoxies; others free-float,
aimless in an increasingly valueless society.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another alternative: starting from scratch to see
if we may discover for ourselves something like universal truth and
build the whole thing all over again.
</P>
<P>
   If we could only find a starting point, a single truth that
everyone can agree is universal.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest there is one such truth: We all die. Death, if nothing
else, is common to all 5.9 billion people on this planet. It is
common to all living things and, metaphorically, common to all
inorganic things, too. Perhaps if we recognize the universality of
death, we can allow the possibility of other universals, even if we
tread such territory gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one truth, perhaps there are others. At the very
least it puts the lie to the canard that ``it is all just personal
preference.'' At least one thing isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Death may seem a grisly place to start, but it doesn't have to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The raw fact of death, when we are willing to be aware of it,
also brightens and colors the gray ordinariness of daily life. It
is what philosopher Martin Heidegger meant by ``authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms: Death makes life more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   If we ignore the fact of death, we can become bored with small
things. But if we keep our death in mind, even mud becomes magic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important, it isn't our own death that we feel
most poignantly. We may not experience our own deaths at all _ at
least we have no reliable reports from anyone after the fact _ but
we do feel the deaths of those around us in a profound sense of
loss.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of loss may be our second universal truth: It is
certainly at the root of much mythology from the expulsion from the
Garden of Eden to the current New Age belief that Native American
culture is somehow ``in harmony with nature'' and that our own
culture is somehow cut off from it.
</P>
<P>
   This loss is not merely generated by our awakened sense of
mortality _ in the face of loss our own deaths often become
insignificant _ but of the recognition that we extend beyond our
egos: We love.
</P>
<P>
   This opening up beyond self-interest is perhaps a third truth
for whatever cultural inflection it picks up _ and, make no
mistake, despite rumblings of the Republican right, love is
manifested in a million forms _ the basic truth is we all manage to
break out of blind egos and forge connections with others.
</P>
<P>
   From love, we can begin to build a sense of morality. By
breaking from our own egos, by imagining what it is to be other
than ourselves, we begin to understand how our behavior affects
those around us.
</P>
<P>
   Young artists often deal with death in a symbolic fashion:
skulls and blood. It is the mainstay of prison art, tattoos,
heavy-metal music and adolescent _ primarily male _ fantasies. Yet
such doodling has as little to do with death as with art. Such
things are mere conceit.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until we are older and come face to face with loss that
we begin to understand the meaning of death and the hundreds of
emotional consequences that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with one uncomfortable truth and wind up with a
complex web of things, including that which makes us happiest.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend to artists not that they get all morbid _ quite the
opposite _ but that, starting with the universality of death, they
may begin to build once more a fabric of belief that sustains human
spirit. &QL;

CLINTON OFFERS APOLOGY   FOR `INDEFENSIBLE' ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, facing a rebuke from a key
Democratic senator back home, offered _ and then repeated _ his
first explicit apology Friday for his adulterous affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, and termed his actions
``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another awkward moment played out on an international stage,
Clinton stood beside Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern at what was
designed to be a triumphant photo opportunity. Instead, he found
himself peppered with questions over his Lewinsky affair, this time
fueled from within his own party by the strong indictment Thursday
by Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) basically agree with what he said,'' Clinton said through
a thin smile, standing in the prime minister's office in Dublin.
``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was indefensible,
and I'm sorry about it. So I have nothing else to say except that I
can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of what I
have already acknowledged was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Clinton added: ``There's nothing that he or
anyone else could say in a personally critical way that I don't
imagine that I would disagree with, since I have already said it
myself, to myself. And I'm very sorry about it. There's nothing
else I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Friday he was ``grateful'' that the president had
accepted his criticism. But it was far from clear whether the
Clinton's statement would be enough to halt the effort by some in
Congress to vote to censure or impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, White House officials had actually been bracing for
Lieberman to call for a censure, which he stopped short of doing in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats, including Lieberman, said they were
waiting to see the report from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
before deciding whether to back a congressional vote for censure,
which amounts to a formal reprimand, but does not include any
specific punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments Friday came as part of what appears to be a
steadily rising level of remorse felt by the president, all in the
face of rising outrage for his actions within the political
community and the public at large. In his first admission, on Aug.
17, the president appeared defiant during a four-minute televised
address, challenging Starr to finish his investigation and telling
the public that his affair was private, between himself and his
family and their god.
</P>
<P>
   In Martha's Vineyard, in a complexly worded speech to a
gathering of civil rights activists on Aug. 28, Clinton struck a
softer tone, talking in more depth about offering forgiveness,
presumably to Starr, and being forgiven by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the first time Clinton explicitly used the term
``I'm sorry,'' though some White House aides insisted that an
apology was what he meant all along, and thought he was giving. For
more than two weeks, even some of Clinton's closest allies in
Washington were urging him to offer the apology and strike a less
defiant tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he believes his tone has been consistent on this,
but it's been interpreted differently and variously by other people
commenting on it,'' said Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary. ``I think he believes what he said today is consistent
with how he's addressed it in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a briefing with reporters in Dublin about the timing of
the president's apology, McCurry tersely replied, ``I think he said
he's sorry because he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sequence appeared remarkable. Thursday afternoon,
Lieberman took to the Senate floor to deliver a scathing speech
that the White House had been trying to postpone for days. With
several Democratic colleagues sitting in the chamber to lend
support, Lieberman was as critical of Clinton as nearly any
Republican who has spoken out in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the
president has admitted to on our children, our culture and our
national character,'' he said, adding later that Clinton had
``compromised his moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was especially stinging because of the nature of the
relationship between Lieberman and Clinton. Lieberman, a moderate
voice of moral authority, is considered a bellweather member of the
Senate, a lawmaker to whom others often look for guidance on
sensitive votes. In his second term, he is also cut from the same
political ideology as Clinton, and even succeeded Clinton as head
of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that espouses
moderate strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, his speech triggered alarms within the White
House, where there is a growing sentiment that Clinton faces at
least a censure over his affair with Lewinsky and subsequent seven
months of lies, and possibly worse, depending on what Starr
concludes in a report that may be issued to the Congress as early
as this month.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry Friday again dismissed any notion that Clinton is
contemplating his resignation. ``None whatsoever,'' he said when
asked by a reporter if Clinton had discussed the possibility with
advisers or allies.
</P>
<P>
   The apology Friday, combined with Lieberman's floor speech
Thursday, put a smudge across what was supposed to be a victorious
tour, one that took him from the province of Northern Ireland down
to the republic in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had one of his best days in recent memory Thursday,
hailed as an architect of peace at every stop. But by day's end,
much of the good feelings were washed away as aides watched
Lieberman take to the floor in the late afternoon and deliver his
devastating speech.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Clinton's most senior advisers had been trying to
persuade Lieberman to hold off on the speech until the president
returned to the United States over the weekend, White House
officials said. Clinton himself talked to Lieberman on Aug. 27,
days before flying off to Moscow for a two-day summit, imploring
him to delay the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked Lieberman not to say anything until after the
president left Russia, according to a source familiar with the
conversation. Lieberman agreed to wait, which led to an agonizing
five days for the senator and many drafts of his Senate floor
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman seriously considered calling for a formal censure of
Clinton, the source said, but he decided to delete such a proposal,
bowing to pressure that he wait until there is a chance to review
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles also called Lieberman
throughout the week and asked him to wait to speak until the
president arrived back in the US, according to McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Mr. Bowles inquired whether or not Senator
Lieberman could hold off until the president was back home on US
soil,'' McCurry said. ``But the president didn't take any issue, as
you know, with Senator Lieberman's statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Clinton was said to be furious that Lieberman would
deliver the speech while Clinton was abroad and mar what Clinton
was hoping would be a triumphant day that would garner him positive
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, he did not seem as bothered. Friday night, on a short
flight from Dublin to Limerick, where he plans to play golf
Saturday at the hallowed Ballybunion links course, Clinton relaxed
with reporters in the press cabin and compared the current trip to
Ireland with his 1995 visit, when 100,000 people turned out in
Belfast to hear him speak of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited last time I was here, but I loved this,'' he
said, wearing a green sweater acquired in Ireland. ``I had a
wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his golf game, Clinton said: ``I'll be lucky if I don't lose
a dozen balls. ... I'm going to be glad to get through it. I'll
just have fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day Friday, Clinton rededicated himself to his
Ireland triumph, meeting with Ahern in the morning, then delivering
a speech at the European facility of Gateway Computers lauding the
booming Irish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, back home, Democrats were worried that Lieberman's speech
_ and Clinton's acceptance of it _ will lead to a parade of party
members taking to the floor of the House and Senate to condemn
Clinton. Republicans will be even more likely to follow Lieberman's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad,'' a congressional Democratic official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Lieberman has laid the
foundation and I'm afraid we're going to have a ton of Democrats
come back and feel obligated to repeat that exercise.''

AMWEST MECHANICS SENT HOME OVER SAFETY STICKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - America West Airlines sent 64 mechanics home in
Phoenix and two other cities early Friday because they refused to
remove stickers they were wearing that focus on mechanical safety
issues, according to Teamsters union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At least 43 were ordered off the job in Phoenix, along with 17
in Las Vegas and four in Columbus, Ohio, Teamsters spokesman
Patrick Lacefield said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mitch Barker said the
agency has assigned inspectors to oversee the dispute between
mechanics and the airline and expect it to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   All of the mechanics will be back at work Saturday, America West
spokeswoman Patty Nowack said, adding that the company had no other
comment about the dispute with the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   America West is eager to continue negotiations with the union
and is confident it will reach agreement, but the airline is not
going to negotiate in the newspaper, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The action to send the mechanics home came less than a day after
America West announced it had hired 100 more mechanics, increased
overnight work stations to 13 from four, and added two spare
aircraft to deal with a rash of flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Goodmanson, America West president and chief executive
officer, cited the labor troubles Thursday in explaining a poor
on-time performance the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   The company's pilots criticized Goodmanson's comments in a
written statement Friday from Donald Steinman, chairman of the Air
Line Pilots Association unit at America West, which represents
1,500 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blaming the Teamsters for the airline's operational problems
demonstrates a genuine head-in-the sand approach to management,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments further the perception that America West is
unwilling to address the airline's operational problems, Steinman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowack said America West is ``sorry that Captain Steinman feels
this way, but he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The stickers the mechanics were wearing point out the number of
mechanical problems that must be fixed before a plane is put back
in service. A minimum equipment list, or MEL, refers to each
mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
   The stickers say ``MEL's (blank) and rising.'' The blank is
filled in with the number of MELs.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the stickers, Lacefield said, is to focus attention
on the high number of MELs that America West mechanics fix on
planes that have been serviced by outside contractors. The union,
representing about 450 mechanics, has been battling with America
West over outsourced mechanical work since 1995 when the company
laid off 375 mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The graveyard-shift mechanics were planning to return to work
late Friday without the stickers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have the right to wear the stickers, the
mechanics are not going to let the issue get in the way of their
jobs, Lacefield said, adding that it was a question of principle to
keep the stickers on late Thursday and early Friday. &QL;

MD-11 JET HAS GOOD SAFETY RECORD, BUT SOME FLAWS THAT COULD POSE
FIRE HAZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CRASH-RDP, CRASH-INQUIRY, CRASH-VICTIMS, CRASH-DITCH and
CRASH-SWISSAIR) 
(js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The widebodied MD-11 jet designed by McDonnell
Douglas has been in service since 1990 and is widely regarded as
safe and reliable, but it has had its share of mechanical problems,
including some that posed fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot on Swissair Flight 111 reported smoke in the cockpit
to air traffic controllers before the jet crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia on Wednesday night. How the fire
started, or where on the airplane it occurred, are not known.
</P>
<P>
   As with other models, there have been several instances in the
past of flaws in the MD-11 leading the manufacturer and the Federal
Aviation Administration to call for inspections, repairs or
alterations to prevent electrical short-circuits, fuel spills,
overheating or other potential fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these directives were sparked by reports of smoke or
fire in a plane while it was in service, or by the discovery during
maintenance of electrical wires that were chafed or charred or of
some other tell-tale sign of damage.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, FAA records show cases of smoke and fire in the
avionics compartment's floor area caused by electrical arcing from
chafed wire; a potential fire hazard from burning and arcing in
electrical contacts between a cable and a generator; smoke in a
cargo compartment during loading caused by damaged cables feeding
power into the plane while on the ground; damage to fuel conduits
in the fuselage; a malfunction in a vacuum waste exhaust heater
that could ignite surrounding insulation blankets in the cargo
liner; and several instances of chafing of various wire bundles
that posed the threat of electrical fires or smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   FAA airworthiness directives are not binding on foreign airlines
unless the aviation agencies in those countries issue similar
orders. But most developed countries and large airlines, especially
those flying into the United States, comply with them.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also generally comply with safety and mechanical
recommendations from airplane manufacturers, known as alert service
bulletins, which normally form the basis for any FAA directives.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair spokesman Roland Breitler said Friday that the airline
routinely complies with all directives, even those that are not
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swissair always follows each directive,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``If we hear of a potential problem then we
immediately take action.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign airlines flying to and from airports in the United
States are required to meet international safety standards set by
the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency,
although in some cases these rules are not identical to regulations
issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The international rules are meant to provide a common level of
protection while preserving each nation's right to regulate and
inspect its own airlines. The FAA, in turn, reviews each foreign
nation's enforcement practices before allowing airlines from that
country to operate here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, many important safety regulations issued by the FAA
apply to all airlines operating in this country, agency officials
said. Among these are rules governing hazardous cargo, including
materials that might cause fires.
</P>
<P>
   After oxygen generators carried in the cargo hold of a Valujet
Airlines DC-9 in Florida in 1996 started a fire that caused the
plane to crash, killing all 110 people on board, the FAA issued a
regulation prohibiting both foreign and domestic airlines from
transporting them on passenger flights with at least one stop in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the FAA disclosed that both domestic and foreign
airlines may have unwittingly violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   After Boeing acquired the manufacturer in 1990, it announced
that it would stop making the three-engined MD-11, which is a
larger and more efficient variant of the DC-10, in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair plane that crashed was 7 years old and had flown
35,000 miles on 6,400 flights.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Transportation Safety Board, there
have been several accidents involving MD-11s. But the planes'
safety record is not significantly better or worse than other
models in widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge slats on the wings of a China Eastern Airlines
plane deployed improperly in 1993, causing the plane to buck
violently in the air over Alaska. There were several dozen injuries
and two people died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   A fire on an American Airlines MD-11 at New York's Kennedy
Airport in 1995 forced an evacuation of the plane, injuring two.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Federal Express cargo plane crashed, flipped over,
and burned at Newark International Airport during landing. The two
pilots and three crew members survived.

PASSENGERS MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE CRASH ON LAND THAN IN WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CRASH-RDP, CRASH-INQUIRY, CRASH-VICTIMS, CRASH-SWISSAIR
and CRASH-PLANE) 
(lh) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As investigators Friday continued to study radar traces and
other clues to determine what caused Swissair Flight 111 to plunge
into the Atlantic on Wednesday, experts in aviation accidents said
it was not surprising that no one survived the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilot still had control of the wide-body jet and
tried to ditch, aviator parlance for setting it down on the sea,
chances were slim that it would have held together, several crash
investigators and aviation engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline crashes at sea tend to end badly even if the plane is
still intact as it hits the water, said Gary Frings, who directs
research into the ``crashworthiness'' of airplanes at the Federal
Aviation Administration Technical Center, in Atlantic City, N.J.
``Even in the best circumstances, landing on water is very, very
risky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing certificates for aircraft like the Swissair MD-11
that crashed, the FAA has in theory deemed that the plane is strong
enough to survive a water impact, Frings said. But he emphasized
the word ``theory,'' saying that there is no practical way to know
what designs will survive or disintegrate in such a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I crash airplanes for a living,'' Frings said. ``We just did
one here two weeks ago. But I wouldn't even begin to try and figure
out how you would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Any number of factors _ from the size and direction of waves to
the rate at which a plane is descending into the water _ can in one
instance lead to a survivable landing or in another cause the
fuselage to ``shatter like an eggshell,'' said Harry Robertson, who
has investigated airplane accidents for 40 years and runs the Crash
Research Institute, a school for crash investigators in Tempe,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the surface of the sea might seem more forgiving
than a concrete runway during a crash landing of an airliner, the
opposite is often true, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The corrugated surface of a wind-roiled bay can rip into the
fuselage of a jetliner like a can opener, shattering the aluminum
sheeting, Robertson said. This is more true of modern jets than
older planes, he said. The aluminum alloys used today, he said, are
stronger but more brittle than those in older planes, which _ being
thicker and softer _ would tend to bend or dent instead of break as
the plane struck the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in jumbo jets like the MD-11, which have large engines
slung beneath the wings, the engine cowlings tend to catch in the
sea surface and violently tear backward at the wings, contributing
to the disintegration of the main body of the plane or causing it
to somersault.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot has some control, he can potentially lessen the
risks in a water crash by aiming the plane along the waves instead
of nosing into them. But overall, Robertson said, ``As a pilot or
passenger, if I had a choice where to make a crash landing, I would
never pick water. I'd pick the hardest surface I could find _ like
even a runway.'' When a fuselage hits a runway, it tends to crush
instead of shred, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a handful of airliner crashes in water, some passengers or
crew have escaped alive, leading safety experts in the airline
industry to defend the often-ignored briefings at the beginnings of
flights, when attendants or tape recordings note the position of
life vests, rafts, and exits.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent crash landing of a wide-body jet in the water
occurred on Nov. 24, 1996, when a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines
Boeing 767 ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea a few hundred
yards from a tourist beach in the Comoro Islands, in the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The plane split into three pieces, killing 127 people. But 48
people survived, many of them emerging from the wreckage with only
cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, because there is at least a slight chance of surviving, it
is worth listening attentively to the safety briefing, said James
Burin, a spokesman for the Flight Safety Foundation, an industry
group in Washington that represents airlines, including Swissair,
plane manufacturers, and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt to look and see where those exits are,'' he
said. ``When you're ditching at sea, it's a little late to get out
that safety card and read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Wiemeyer, one of the investigators of the Trans World
Airlines Flight 800 crash for the National Transportation Safety
Board, said that by the time an airplane is in the water, it is too
late for passengers to start learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the water, you've got a tremendous amount of turmoil and
confusion and stress,'' he said. ``Even if the passengers held a
class before they got on board, it probably wouldn't help much.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a helicopter crash in Hawaii that he investigated
several years ago. Everyone survived the initial impact unscathed,
he said, but several people _ including the pilot _ drowned because
they had not donned life vests.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Flight 111, Canadian investigators said Friday
that it was still not clear if the pilot had control in the last
moments as the jet descended toward the Atlantic after dumping
spare jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he did, with the plane going down in the dark, off a
part of the Nova Scotia coast known for tumbling seas, it was
highly unlikely that the jet could have been set down intact, said
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Burin, at the Flight Safety Foundation, said that if Flight 111
went down under the pilot's control, it was clearly as a last
resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason you would ditch like that,'' Burin said, ``is
because you've lost the ability to fly,'' he said.

NOVOTNA HEATS UP OPEN WITH WIN OVER TESTUD  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beguilingly, the man said to Jana Novotna, ``Come up
to my castle and see me sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the man was Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic
_ and leader of the movement that junked the country's Communism in
the Velvet Revolution of 1990 _ Novotna didn't have to be asked
twice. You don't get invited to a castle every day by a historic
figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna is a historic figure herself: the lone righthanded
Czech female to give away the Wimbledon championship (twice) and
then decide that charity begins at home when she seized it two
months ago. Abruptly, she was the prodigal daughter-with-volley,
the kind of person presidents wish to coopt in a photo op while
everybody else coos, ``Welcome home _ all is forgiven!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt such a warm welcome coming back to Prague in all
those years (13 as a pro) that I've been playing tennis, even
though I've won big tournaments _ the (season-ending) Chase
Championship at Madison Square Garden last year. I just felt
enormous warmth from everybody,'' Novotna said Friday after a 6-2,
6-3, win over France's Sandrine Testud landed her among the US
Open's last sweet and sweltering 16.
</P>
<P>
   That is how dethroning Martina Hingis in the Wimbledon
semifinals and then flattening Nathalie Tauziat for the title
changed Novotna's life. ``Changed it in a way that I'm just feeling
incredibly relieved ... just happy over what I've achieved ... but
nevertheless, this kind of achievement pushes me to work harder, go
for more.''
</P>
<P>
   If Milan Kundera, the Czech author, wants to do her book, he'll
probably call it ``The Incredible Lightness of Being No Longer
Considered a Choker.''
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs, with their dreary history of being overrun by one
oppressor or another, most recently Germans and Russians, tend to
be pessimistic, and Novotna, despite many stellar achievements,
gave them numerous opportunities to indulge in an American
specialty: the CWBO hoot _ Can't Win Big Ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same in our country as yours,'' said Czech
journalist Blanka Rokosova of Radio Europa 2. ``Jana came so close
to Steffi Graf in 1993 (4-1, 40-30 in the third) and Hingis in 1997
(2-0 in the third) but couldn't make it. Nobody believed she would
win when the third final came around. Nobody. She was the kind of
person we call maly clovek _ the little person who can't do the big
job. Not now.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't like the days of the historic lefthanded Czech
female, Martina Navratilova. She won so many Wimbledons that she
could have held a clearance sale on trophies. She was Can't Lose
Big Ones. But she could have gotten more warmth from a birthday
cake than the homeland. As a 1975 defector, Navratilova won
classification as a nonperson where she grew up. If Moscow's
stooges who ran Czechoslovakia had lured her to Prague Castle, it
would have been to throw a dungeon party for her, complete with leg
irons.
</P>
<P>
   Havel was a better host at the ancient castle that looms on a
crag above the capital city. Tea was served, but without hemlock.
The only cuffs were on his shirt. The country was genuinely proud
of Novotna. You could see it in her animated blue eyes and toothy
grin, the way her straight platinum tresses swished as she recalled
her own Velvet Visit and deliverance from the shackles of CWBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Havel doesn't know much about sports, but he was very kind,
complimentary. He's very pleased, like the rest of us about what a
wonderful year in sports this is for our country. First it was Petr
Korda winning the Australian Open. Then the Olympic gold medal in
hockey. Then,'' she smiled, ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the year she's the queen on both sides of the East
River, following up her November Chase triumph in Manhattan by
crushing at Flushing?
</P>
<P>
   Winner of 25 of her last 27 matches (titles at Prague,
Eastbourne, and the Big W), Jana said, ``One enormous dream has
come true for me, but I'm still hungry for another. I was so
pleased with my forehand and net game at Wimbledon, and everything
is still together.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fans hope it stays together because nobody in this town is
better to watch. Novotna plays in daring, headlong rushes, volleys
like a laser lady, and springs toward the clouds to clout
spectacular backhand overheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I hadn't won Wimbledon this time, I might have said
someday that I missed my chance. It's a relief that won't happen.
But I didn't worry about it this year. I was still confident. I
didn't think I was too old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting now, after winning, I see more respect from my
opponents. I see it on their faces. That's nice. I'm enjoying
myself more on the court. I'm more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very good to see the occasional mature woman around this
nursery school. Novotna will be 30 next month, which makes her seem
like Madeleine Albright or Katharine Hepburn to the mean teens
trying to take over. Can't you hear Anna Kournikova screeching,
``Thirty! Shouldn't we chip in to send her to a nursing home?''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, kid. Just watch out for Jana's chip-and-charge. There's
still room for a woman amid the Open children's crusade.

CLINTON OFFERS APOLOGY   FOR `INDEFENSIBLE' ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, facing a rebuke from a key
Democratic senator back home, offered _ and then repeated _ his
first explicit apology Friday for his adulterous affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, and termed his actions
``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another awkward moment played out on an international stage,
Clinton stood beside Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern at what was
designed to be a triumphant photo opportunity. Instead, he found
himself peppered with questions over his Lewinsky affair, this time
fueled from within his own party by the strong indictment Thursday
by Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) basically agree with what he said,'' Clinton said through
a thin smile, standing in the prime minister's office in Dublin.
``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was indefensible,
and I'm sorry about it. So I have nothing else to say except that I
can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of what I
have already acknowledged was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Clinton added: ``There's nothing that he or
anyone else could say in a personally critical way that I don't
imagine that I would disagree with, since I have already said it
myself, to myself. And I'm very sorry about it. There's nothing
else I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Friday he was ``grateful'' that the president had
accepted his criticism. But it was far from clear whether the
Clinton's statement would be enough to halt the effort by some in
Congress to vote to censure or impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, White House officials had actually been bracing for
Lieberman to call for a censure, which he stopped short of doing in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats, including Lieberman, said they were
waiting to see the report from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
before deciding whether to back a congressional vote for censure,
which amounts to a formal reprimand, but does not include any
specific punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments Friday came as part of what appears to be a
steadily rising level of remorse felt by the president, all in the
face of rising outrage for his actions within the political
community and the public at large. In his first admission, on Aug.
17, the president appeared defiant during a four-minute televised
address, challenging Starr to finish his investigation and telling
the public that his affair was private, between himself and his
family and their god.
</P>
<P>
   In Martha's Vineyard, in a complexly worded speech to a
gathering of civil rights activists on Aug. 28, Clinton struck a
softer tone, talking in more depth about offering forgiveness,
presumably to Starr, and being forgiven by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the first time Clinton explicitly used the term
``I'm sorry,'' though some White House aides insisted that an
apology was what he meant all along, and thought he was giving. For
more than two weeks, even some of Clinton's closest allies in
Washington were urging him to offer the apology and strike a less
defiant tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he believes his tone has been consistent on this,
but it's been interpreted differently and variously by other people
commenting on it,'' said Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary. ``I think he believes what he said today is consistent
with how he's addressed it in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a briefing with reporters in Dublin about the timing of
the president's apology, McCurry tersely replied, ``I think he said
he's sorry because he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sequence appeared remarkable. Thursday afternoon,
Lieberman took to the Senate floor to deliver a scathing speech
that the White House had been trying to postpone for days. With
several Democratic colleagues sitting in the chamber to lend
support, Lieberman was as critical of Clinton as nearly any
Republican who has spoken out in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the
president has admitted to on our children, our culture and our
national character,'' he said, adding later that Clinton had
``compromised his moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was especially stinging because of the nature of the
relationship between Lieberman and Clinton. Lieberman, a moderate
voice of moral authority, is considered a bellweather member of the
Senate, a lawmaker to whom others often look for guidance on
sensitive votes. In his second term, he is also cut from the same
political ideology as Clinton, and even succeeded Clinton as head
of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that espouses
moderate strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, his speech triggered alarms within the White
House, where there is a growing sentiment that Clinton faces at
least a censure over his affair with Lewinsky and subsequent seven
months of lies, and possibly worse, depending on what Starr
concludes in a report that may be issued to the Congress as early
as this month.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry Friday again dismissed any notion that Clinton is
contemplating his resignation. ``None whatsoever,'' he said when
asked by a reporter if Clinton had discussed the possibility with
advisers or allies.
</P>
<P>
   The apology Friday, combined with Lieberman's floor speech
Thursday, put a smudge across what was supposed to be a victorious
tour, one that took him from the province of Northern Ireland down
to the republic in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had one of his best days in recent memory Thursday,
hailed as an architect of peace at every stop. But by day's end,
much of the good feelings were washed away as aides watched
Lieberman take to the floor in the late afternoon and deliver his
devastating speech.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Clinton's most senior advisers had been trying to
persuade Lieberman to hold off on the speech until the president
returned to the United States over the weekend, White House
officials said. Clinton himself talked to Lieberman on Aug. 27,
days before flying off to Moscow for a two-day summit, imploring
him to delay the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked Lieberman not to say anything until after the
president left Russia, according to a source familiar with the
conversation. Lieberman agreed to wait, which led to an agonizing
five days for the senator and many drafts of his Senate floor
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman seriously considered calling for a formal censure of
Clinton, the source said, but he decided to delete such a proposal,
bowing to pressure that he wait until there is a chance to review
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles also called Lieberman
throughout the week and asked him to wait to speak until the
president arrived back in the US, according to McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Mr. Bowles inquired whether or not Senator
Lieberman could hold off until the president was back home on US
soil,'' McCurry said. ``But the president didn't take any issue, as
you know, with Senator Lieberman's statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Clinton was said to be furious that Lieberman would
deliver the speech while Clinton was abroad and mar what Clinton
was hoping would be a triumphant day that would garner him positive
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, he did not seem as bothered. Friday night, on a short
flight from Dublin to Limerick, where he plans to play golf
Saturday at the hallowed Ballybunion links course, Clinton relaxed
with reporters in the press cabin and compared the current trip to
Ireland with his 1995 visit, when 100,000 people turned out in
Belfast to hear him speak of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited last time I was here, but I loved this,'' he
said, wearing a green sweater acquired in Ireland. ``I had a
wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his golf game, Clinton said: ``I'll be lucky if I don't lose
a dozen balls. ... I'm going to be glad to get through it. I'll
just have fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day Friday, Clinton rededicated himself to his
Ireland triumph, meeting with Ahern in the morning, then delivering
a speech at the European facility of Gateway Computers lauding the
booming Irish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, back home, Democrats were worried that Lieberman's speech
_ and Clinton's acceptance of it _ will lead to a parade of party
members taking to the floor of the House and Senate to condemn
Clinton. Republicans will be even more likely to follow Lieberman's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad,'' a congressional Democratic official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Lieberman has laid the
foundation and I'm afraid we're going to have a ton of Democrats
come back and feel obligated to repeat that exercise.''

DESPITE LATE RALLY, DOW ENDS A BAD WEEK 5.1 PERCENT LOWER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market again flirted with the bears Friday,
as the Dow Jones industrial average fell below where it closed on
Monday, the day of a 512-point plunge that shook up investors
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last half-hour, the Dow and other market measures
recovered, cutting their losses by two-thirds and more. Still, the
Dow was off 5.1 percent for the week and gave up most of Tuesday's
288-point rally. And with the 5.7 percent decline of the week
before, the Dow had its worst 10 consecutive trading days since the
two weeks before the stock market crash of 1987, according to
Birinyi Associates.
</P>
<P>
   And as investors left for the Labor Day weekend, they were still
haunted by the same problems: Russia, Asia, Latin America and their
impact on American corporate earnings. Estimates for third-quarter
profit growth show an expected 2 percent average gain from the
quarter a year earlier, down from 10 percent just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There was more bad news on this front as the week came to an
end. A major rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, downgraded
Brazil's credit rating Thursday, a move that led to a 6.13 percent
selloff in the Sao Paolo stock market Friday. There appears to be
no resolution in sight as to who is running Russia. And many
investors are getting more worried about the future for Latin
America, which is a market for about 15 percent of America's
exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most about this market is that
we don't know what all the problems are and we are not sure where
the ripples end,'' said Lazlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, which
manages money and tracks the market from Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a centipede market,'' he added. ``First one shoe drops,
then another and then another.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's modest selloff came amid signs that investors, on a net
basis, may have pulled money out of American stock mutual funds in
August, the first such negative flow since 1990. AMG Data Services
reported that there have been outflows for the last two weeks and
that the four-week moving average of flows is just barely positive.
Trim Tabs, another monitor of mutual fund flows, estimates that
there was an outflow of $1 billion from U.S. equity funds in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which fell as much as 186 points Friday, closed down
41.97 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, at 7,640.25. It is now
down 3.4 percent for the year. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's index
of 500 stocks fell as much as 25.75 points, but ended down just
8.37 points, 0.9 percent, at 973.89. It is up 0.4 percent for the
year. The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by technology stocks,
dropped 5.34 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,566.52. It was down 28
points earlier and is now off 0.2 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Small company stocks, which have been among the hardest hit this
year, rallied a little, with the Russell index of 2,000 smaller
company stocks rising 0.78 point, or 0.2 percent, to 347.07. It is
down 20.6 percent for the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bank and other financial stocks continued to lead the market
lower, in part because of the fear that banks could be hit by much
greater losses if the financial crisis that began in July of last
year in Asia fully engulfs Latin America. ``The performance of the
financial stocks is a clear sign that there is a lot of risk out
there,'' said Douglas Cliggot, a U.S. equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Citicorp, which had losses of about $200 million
related to Russia, fell 6, to 92{, and is off 31 percent in the
last two weeks. Chase Manhattan Bank, which expects $200 million in
losses because of Russia and Asia, was down 3~, to 45], and is down
29 percent in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clark, the head of U.S. equity trading at Credit Suisse
First Boston, said that the rally in the last half-hour might have
been sparked by speculation over a pending dinner meeting in San
Francisco of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa. ``The chatter was that there could be some good news over
the weekend,'' Clark said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ The world surely is wide enough to hold
a few more tourist attractions, and this city of 400,000 people has
tried mightily to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? After all, other U.S. cities have fashioned
successful tourist industries by virtue of natural setting, vision
or sometimes good luck.
</P>
<P>
   These include Branson, Mo., a year-round country music capital;
Tunica, Miss., a town that is climbing out of rank poverty with
glitzy hotels and glitzier gambling casinos; and such shopping
meccas as Potomac Mills outlet mall in Dale City, Va., which draws
more tourists than Colonial Williamsburg. Then there is Newport,
Ore., where the arrival of Keiko the whale (of ``Free Willy'' fame)
has attracted an additional 1 million visitors to the Oregon Coast
Aquarium and has the town's 9,000 residents pondering what will
become of its multimillion-dollar tourist industry after Keiko is
returned to a sea pen in its native Iceland on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   But Corpus Christi, a socially conservative and heavily Hispanic
city, has few spectacular natural assets or claims to fame.
Instead, it has gone about its pursuit of tourism in a methodical
manner, investing millions to try to overcome some difficult
strokes of geographical misfortune. And success is already evident
in the rising number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever expect to become another Orlando or Las Vegas,
because we understand what kind of tourist destination we are _
primarily a beach town,'' said Mike Crouch, director of public
affairs for the Business Alliance. ``But we hope to attract lots
more tourists and convention delegates and have them stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Known mostly for its oil industry, which fell on hard times
starting in the late 1980s, the city is tucked within a lovely bay
behind Padre Island on the Gulf of Mexico, way down in southeast
Texas, more than 200 miles from Houston and almost 400 miles from
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   As a former tourist official said, ``You don't get to Corpus
Christi by accident, you have to work at getting here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most air service to and from the city is on regional carriers,
and nonstops to other states are nonexistent. Even a flight to El
Paso, for example, 720 road miles away, typically takes four to six
hours, depending on connections and stops.
</P>
<P>
   Though a number of Corpus Christi hotels and attractions are
worth bragging about _ one is a life-size statue of Selena
Quintanilla Perez, 23, the Queen of Tejano, or Texas-Mexican
borderland music, who was shot dead by her fan club president in
1995 _ they are a far cry from the snazzy theme parks or casinos
that pack in the crowds elsewhere. Thus, the great bulk of Corpus
Christi tourists are still likely to come from within a 150-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
   With its large Hispanic population and proximity to Mexico,
Corpus Christi is especially determined to attract a larger share
of the 3 million Mexican tourists and convention delegates who
spent almost $900 million in the state last year.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that city officials in set about building a
tourist industry that did more than attract penny-pinching college
students on spring break or day-trippers to its many beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dead set against the ``build it and they'll come'' mentality,
Corpus Christi officials have been careful to order economic impact
studies before plunking down a dime to buy attractions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the go-ahead for a $33 million aquarium, which
opened in 1990, was given only after studies projected that it
would make money _ and after a look at the success of Baltimore's
aquarium and Inner Harbor. Averaging about 440,000 visitors a year,
the aquarium is now credited with adding $50 million a year to
Corpus Christi's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The city also shelled out $4.1 million for the World War II
aircraft carrier USS Lexington after spirited bidding with Quincy,
Mass., and Mobile, Ala. But first the city received reassurance
from Debbie Prost, head of what is now Prost Marketing Inc., a San
Antonio consulting firm, that the ship would draw far more than the
270,000 visitors a year needed to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, officials also studied the success of six other
cities that had former Navy ships as tourist sites. Since opening
in October 1992, the Lexington has averaged almost 350,000 visitors
a year and has contributed $62 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The ship and the aquarium have also spruced up North Beach, a
section of the city that was badly damaged in a hurricane in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up in this city,'' said Frank Stanford of College
Station, Texas, ``North Beach was infested with drugs and crime.
But as you can see, today it's filled with families.'' Stanford was
showing Corpus Christi's attractions to a friend, Diane Havalda of
Austin. As he spoke, lots of children scampered around the
aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million Greyhound Race Track, opened in 1990 and owned
by a Florida corporation that was able to qualify for certain tax
rebates available under a state enterprise zone, continues to
attract many out-of-staters who spend the winter months in Texas.
But the track has been overshadowed somewhat since the state
lottery began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The only sizable investment that has not lived up to promise is
the $1.1 million paid to Spain for the right to operate and manage
replicas of the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, the fleet that
Columbus sailed to the New World more than 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fleet has attracted 650,000 paying customers since
opening five years ago, the Pinta and the Santa Maria were damaged
in 1994, when a tow cable snapped and a barge crashed into them.
Repairs by Spanish shipwrights were completed only this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A small zoo and a botanical garden have recently been added to
Corpus Christi's tourism mix, the Asian Cultures Museum moved into
a new building, and the Museum of Science and History was
extensively remodeled and expanded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these efforts, the number of visitors grew to
5.5 million in 1997, from fewer than 2.3 million in 1986 _ a 139
percent increase during a time when total U.S. tourism grew about
89 percent. Hotel room revenues doubled, to $100.4 million.
Tourism-related jobs also doubled, to 10,200, and the
tourism-related payroll almost tripled, to $152 million. The
average visitor's stay, which had never been more than a day, grew
to 2.5 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention Center in Bayfront Plaza booked 151,679
convention delegates in 1996, the last year for those figures
available, a 60 percent increase over 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the growth, Corpus Christi doesn't approach the
number of visitors to Orlando, Fla. (35.6 million in 1996), Las
Vegas (30.5 million) or even San Antonio, which recorded 7 million
visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, not all the improvements, including the trendy
restaurants, sleek office buildings and modern hotels along the
two-mile-long white waterfront seawall and walkway, are a result of
tourism. The petrochemical industry, for example, pumps more than
$1 billion into the local economy, while the city's growing health
care services employ about 24,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   It was the collapse of Corpus Christi's decades-long dependence
on gas and oil that sent the city reeling when the price of
domestic oil plummeted from $40 a barrel in 1980 to $10 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1986, unemployment reached a decade-high of 12.2 percent,
and we lost 5,000 jobs in the oil and gas exploration industry,''
said Gary Bushell, president of the Greater Corpus Christi Business
Alliance. Just between 1986 and 1988, hotel revenues fell from
$45.5 million to $38.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pruet, a small business owner, former city councilman and
chairman of the business alliance's tourism committee, said: ``For
almost 100 years oil and gas provided our tax base, funded our
schools and created our jobs. Every big oil company was here. But
when oil went down the chute, they just abandoned those offices and
pulled out. When it was agreed to really go after tourists, we knew
we had to go beyond just T-shirts and kids on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism indeed remains at the forefront of Corpus Christi's
effort to make a name for itself while adding jobs and earning
money.
</P>
<P>
   While hoping (and lobbying) to attract cruise ships, the city
has formed a partnership with San Antonio whereby cruise passengers
can also fly to that mission city before or after their cruise, to
visit the Alamo or the city's acclaimed River Walk.
</P>
<P>
   It has also established a tourism and trade office in Monterrey,
Mexico, together with its Texas neighbor, Loredo, and the Port of
Corpus Christi, the nation's sixth-largest port.
</P>
<P>
   A big drawing card for Mexican and Mexican-American tourists is
the Selena statue. In the middle of the nine seawall pavilions
along Ocean Drive, the bronze statue continues to attract legions
of fans, young and old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came mostly for the beach,'' said Roberto Leal of
Monterrey, on his first visit here recently with two related
families that together consisted of 10 adults and 12 children.
``But we don't want to go home without seeing the aquarium and the
memorial to Selena.''

BOMBS AWAY

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS and GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another summer movie season comes to a close this
weekend. But it wasn't just another season of summer movies; the
hot-weather months of 1998 were marked by, surprisingly enough, a
few good films.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the usual batch of noisy, overproduced brain-melters,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was enough to make Daily News film critics Bob Strauss
and Glenn Whipp happy to spend much of the past four months inside
darkened theaters (and lots of other folks, too; this year's summer
box office is expected to hit a record $2.5 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, at least from Bob and Glenn's points of view, there
was something worth talking about for a change when the time came
to assess the summer films of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Whipp: I can't remember a better summer movie slate than
what we had this year, although I don't think it has dawned on most
people just how good the past few months have been.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to a woman before a screening last week and she
grumbled, ``Another terrible summer.'' And I said, ``What are you
talking about?'' and started ticking off all the good movies. She
considered what I said, paused for a moment and then muttered,
``Yeah. I guess you're right. But there were some bad ones, too.''
It's like people are so programmed to expect junk this time of
year, they haven't realized that the summer of '98 contained some
wonderful exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Strauss: Well, there was ``The Avengers.'' But yeah, in
general _ and I never thought I'd say this _ I don't want summer to
end.
</P>
<P>
   I usually spend this time of year splitting thin hairs over
which soulless, mind-numbing product had the best special effects
or one-liners with a passable resemblance to wit. But this time,
Hollywood released two great films, ``The Truman Show'' and
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which is two more than the decade summer
average.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't all. ``Mulan,'' ``Mask of Zorro'' and ``Out of
Sight'' were unusually smart, well-crafted and distinctive
entertainments. And the studios _ well, one studio, Fox _ actually
released two full-blown assaults on movie complacency, ``Bulworth''
and ``There's Something About Mary.'' Rude, subversive ``Mary''
even turned out to be the most tenacious and profitable hit of the
year, which should encourage others to break some rules.
</P>
<P>
   Whipp: It's just too bad more people didn't turn out for
``Bulworth'' and ``Out of Sight.'' It's hard to blame audiences
though, since there were so many decent movies from which to
choose. Even the second tier of films, movies like ``Ever After,''
``The Horse Whisperer'' and ``The X-Files'' had their pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   And movies you knew were going to stink _ ``Armageddon'' and
``Godzilla'' _ still couldn't hold a candle to the horrific duds we
endured last year. I'd see ``Godzilla'' again before suffering
through a repeat performance of ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' or ``Speed 2.''
``The Avengers'' ... well, at least it had Uma Thurman in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss: So do my dreams, and they're more coherent. Let's not
get too Pollyannish here: This summer, like all summers, was lousy
with listlessly squandered millions.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, things got off to the most dreadful start in memory
last May. ``Deep Impact'' _ which was just as dumb as
``Armageddon,'' but didn't possess the saving grace of knowing it _
was a dishearteningly huge hit, ``Hope Floats'' was pure emotional
pablum, ``Almost Heroes'' put the final nail in Chris Farley's
reputation as a comic, and ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' _
perhaps the most unpleasant movie experience of the '90s _ proved
that it isn't enough just to break the rules. You have to know what
you're breaking rules for.
</P>
<P>
   And the bad big movies kept on coming: ``Six Days, Seven
Nights'' (Harrison, give up on the romantic comedies already), ``A
Perfect Murder'' (if this is what Hitchcock remakes look like, I'm
very afraid of the upcoming ``Psycho''), ``Small Soldiers''
(director Joe Dante's lower-tech ``Gremlins'' films were funnier
and more anarchic), and every alleged ``outrageous'' comedy that
didn't involve a dog in a body cast.
</P>
<P>
   Whipp: Geez ... and you left out ``Dirty Work,'' ``Disturbing
Behavior,'' ``Snake Eyes,'' ``54'' and ``Air Bud: Golden
Receiver.'' Maybe it was a god-awful summer after all.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe there are just too many movies. Audiences seem
to think so. Most of the stinkers we've mentioned were roundly
ignored. And the event films, which were shoved down our throats by
fanatical studio marketing departments, typically had one good
weekend and then died. More people remember ``Godzilla's'' ad
slogan _ ``Size Matters'' _ than they do the movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice little trend, this apathy, and one that's been
building for the past few years. Audiences are tired of filmmakers
pandering to them, so they're embracing movies like ``Saving
Private Ryan'' and ``The Truman Show'' almost as an act of
defiance. It's like they're telling Hollywood: We're not as stupid
as you think we are. We can handle challenging topics. And, guess
what? We'd like to see more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss: As long as Hollywood keeps the talking-animal movies
coming, anyway. I wouldn't get too optimistic; pap still sells,
like ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``The Parent Trap,'' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and
the space-junk movies proved. And we know that next summer is going
to be all about ``Star Wars'' again.
</P>
<P>
   But yeah, if this summer proved anything, it was that
challenging subjects of all stripes _ graphically realistic war
violence, astute social satire, inspired gross-out lunacy _ can be
as rewarding as they are refreshing. Let's just hope it wasn't a
fluke, like the handful of decent summer movie seasons since the
late '70s have been.
</P>
<P>
   Whipp: And there's a disturbing mind-set going around town right
about now that would seem to indicate that this year could well be
an anomaly. The summer has produced a lot of decent hits for almost
every studio _ hapless Universal being the exception _ but nobody
seems happy. The hits weren't big enough. There were no
``Titanics.'' No ``Lion Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest to find that magical common denominator hasn't
changed, nor will it ever. If anything _ and this is truly
frightening _ the audience erosion for blast-'em-up effects movies
could give us more films that combine explosions and feelings (as
in whoa-oh-oh feelings), a la ``Titanic'' and ``Deep Impact.''
Martial arts heroes will be diagnosed with cancer. Space jockeys
will come down with a fear of flying. That sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss: I'm very afraid. But then, that's why we have indie
films. And at least this summer, they behaved, more or less, like
indies should. They presented truly unique, dangerous visions
rather than masquerading glorified sitcoms _ like ``Shall We
Dance'' and ``The Full Monty'' last summer _ as art films.
</P>
<P>
   Strong stuff like ``High Art,'' ``Buffalo 66,'' ``Pi'' and
``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' certainly wasn't for all tastes, but
the point is that those films weren't trying to be, and they made
summer moviegoing richer and more exciting in the bargain. And
except for maybe ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' the stuff the indies
tried to make more like studio fare _ ``The Governess,'' ``Polish
Wedding,'' ``Cousin Bette'' _ didn't leave much of an impression.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson there somewhere. But I doubt it's going to stop
visions of ``Monty''-size profits from dancing through independent
distributors' future summer fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Whipp: That's the thing that really grates on me about some of
these indies. They make these movies about eccentrics _ ``Polish
Wedding,'' ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' being the prime recent
offenders _ and then burnish the edges of the characters and turn
them into these lovable kooks who try so hard to be adorable that
they annoy the hell out of you.
</P>
<P>
   I'd much rather watch amoral types like Jason Patric's
fetus-tossing doctor in ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' and Christina
Ricci's unapologetic Lolita in ``The Opposite of Sex.'' No lessons.
No hugging. And unlike the adorable oddballs, you don't feel like
the characters are going to be marketed as plush teddy bears any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss: Perhaps most encouragingly, merchandisers are going to
think hard before signing on to the next batch of movie monster
toys, too. ``Godzilla's'' disappointing performance may prove to be
as healthy for summer movies as ``Ryan,'' ``Truman'' and ``Mary's''
success. It demolished the conventional wisdom that, as long as a
movie lends itself to cross-marketing fast food and junky kiddie
merchandise, it was everything a summer blockbuster should be.
</P>
<P>
   This summer proved that formula is no longer reliable and that
movies should be designed as movies, not promotional events. And
that making the best film you can is, at least to some degree, a
factor again.
</P>
<P>
   What a shock.

CHARITY'S $100,000 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Put a star on the sidewalk, and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's always worked for Hollywood, so the Thalians, a
philanthropic group formed by actress/singer/entertainer Debbie
Reynolds to support the Cedars-Sinai Mental Health Center figured
it would work for them. And it did.
</P>
<P>
   They offered a big pink and gold star that looks a lot like the
Hollywood version to anybody donating $100,000 or more, and several
people jumped at the chance. To honor them and unveil the new
star-studded Walk of Stars in front of the Los Angeles medical
building, the Thalians threw a street party.
</P>
<P>
   It was miserably hot, but hundreds of guests turned out in their
Sunday-afternoon best, which ranged from Robert Wagner's natty blue
blazer with a red pocket square, yellow tie and gray slacks, to
Ruta Lee's peach floral tea dress with picture hat. The pair were
the stars of the program but made sure we didn't forget Reynolds by
walking down the stairs with a life-sized cutout of her in a snazzy
red cocktail dress. Wagner told the crowd that he knew Reynolds was
really sorry she couldn't be there in person (she's working in
Alaska), because she's dedicated 43 years of her life to helping
disturbed children. ``The Thalians is her favorite _ and her only _
charity,'' he said, accepting an award on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Other honorees included donors-turned-sidewalk celebrities Donna
and John Crean, Kem Dibbs, John and Gloria Gebbia, Cynthia and Hal
Gershman, Linda Tallen and David Paul Kane, Sandra Krause, Paula
Kent Meehan, Margie and Robert Petersen, and Lee and the late Mitzi
Hughes. The latter bequeathed more than $1 million to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was the block party hostess, hopes for more stars so
the Walk of Stars will eventually wrap around the block. And
they'll take most anything, she says, including credit cards,
checks, cash, blood, diamonds, Rolex watches and real estate.
Honest.
</P>
<P>
   After the sidewalk ceremony, we danced to the music of Art Deco
and his Society Orchestra and feasted on a sunset supper of
chicken, salmon, Caesar salad and decadent bite-sized pastries
prepared by Sandy Krause and Crustacean restaurant. Then event
chairman Phyllis Friedman handed out souvenir T-shirts and lapel
pins.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrity guests were former PlaymateBarbi Benton, who
was there with gal pal attorney Gloria Allred. ``I flew in from
Sacramento just for this event, and it's even hotter there,''
Benton said.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering how she looks these days, she's still a 10.
At least in her simple but figure-revealing navy blue bodysuit. And
Allred? She went for the sweater-girl look in spite of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The next Thalians event is a black-tie gala on Oct. 17 honoring
actress Sally Field, who's the proud mom of Peter Craig, a newly
published author of ``The Martini Shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Group of Los Angeles threw a soiree Thursday night at
Lola's Martini Lounge and Restaurant in West Hollywood. It's one of
those chichi places with leopard print accents where the
cutting-edge crowd goes to see and be seen while sipping those
trendy pink Cosmopolitan cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, nobody drinks white wine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But they still eat pizza and saucer-sized cookies at Lola's.
</P>
<P>
   After the feeding frenzy and obligatory schmoozing, Fashion
Group director Kelly Bevan-Spire (she's also the fashion director
for Saks Fifth Avenue) introduced the guests of honor, California
Designer of the Year Janice Levin-Krok and her sister Diane Levin,
who's the CEO of their company called Poleci. They gave us a
preview of their new spring '99 collection and the scoop on their
hot company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diane, ``We began by working out of our apartment
and wrapping garments in plastic bags from the dry cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that was a long time ago, as their designs are now
sold around the world, including Africa and Europe.

SWISSAIR STILL WINNING PRAISE FOR SAFETY, EFFICIENCY

(jw) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both the airline and the aircraft involved in Wednesday night's
Swissair crash have solid safety records, aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you have heard about the Swiss, you can apply to
Swissair,'' said Stuart Matthews of the Flight Safety Institute, a
nonprofit group based in Arlington, Va., that monitors safety
issues. ``It is known throughout the industry for meticulous care
and the quality of its maintenance and its crews.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts and analysts who follow the industry said
Friday that Swissair is considered one of the world's top airlines,
particularly in the maintenance of its fleet of 62 aircraft. In an
industry that often uses planes for many years _ replacing parts
and overhauling entire aircraft _ Swissair is known for the
relative youth of its airplanes. Its maintenance procedures are so
well regarded that the company makes an unusually large amount of
money by selling its used aircraft to other airlines, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stems from their high standard of maintenance,'' said
Kevin Murphy, an airlines analyst with Morgan Stanley. ``They
maintain the aircraft rigorously. I would be surprised if this
incident is related to a maintenance problem or an engine
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The type of plane that crashed on Wednesday, a McDonnell Douglas
MD-11, is also considered reliable. The only other major accident
involving the craft occurred when a Federal Express jet landing at
Newark International Airport bounced, rolled and caught fire in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Swissair received praise from industry experts for its
maintenance record, it has also been credited for its quick
reaction to Wednesday's disaster, both by arranging to fly family
members to the crash scene and by offering immediate financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair's last fatal accident was in 1979, when a DC-8 landing
in Athens overshot the runway. The plane caught fire, and 14 people
aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's crash is the company's worst disaster since it was
founded in 1931. The company, born from the merger of two small
regional airlines, has worked to maintain its position in the
increasingly competitive market of European air carriers. Swissair
is much smaller than many of the other established European
airlines, such as British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa. The
Swiss carrier also has had to overcome the fact that Switzerland is
not a member of the European Union, which makes competing in Europe
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Like other European carriers, Swissair has faced an increasingly
competitive business environment as governments decrease
regulations and airlines struggle for passengers in an area packed
with major airports. The company has already taken some steps to
cut costs and increase efficiency, closing nonproductive hubs and
making personnel changes. It has also sought to make alliances with
other airlines to expand its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company hired an airline executive from the
United States to run its daily operations. Jeffrey Katz, a former
American Airlines executive, was original named chief operating
officer and then promoted to chief executive. While some analysts
said it is not unheard of for airlines, including American
carriers, to hire foreign chief executives, others said the company
was trying to bring in experience from the deregulated U.S. market.
The theory, analysts said, was that an executive who could survive
in the cutthroat world of American airline competition would be
better able to guide the company as Europe became more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are responding to the exigencies of the market,'' Murphy
said. ``You get somebody who can make it in the U.S. deregulated
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the relatively small size and low profile of
Swissair could prove to be an advantage. Michael Boyd, of the
aviation analysis firm the Boyd Group, said that Swissair is less
likely to be the focus of political violence than some other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no axes to grind there,'' Boyd said. ``They are not
flashy. They are just a well-run, Swiss-watch type airline.''

SENATOR DESCRIBES ANGER THAT LED HIM TO DENOUNCE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like many other Americans, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut went on vacation with his family in mid-August. As it
happened, the vacation began just after President Clinton had
admitted on national television to having an inappropriate
relationship with a White House intern and to lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   With four generations of Liebermans sharing a rented beach house
in Madison, Conn., off Long Island Sound, the family found itself
circling back repeatedly over meals to discussions of the
president's behavior. Lieberman's 83-year-old mother was the most
tolerant and protective of Clinton. His children, ages 30, 29, 22
and 10, were more upset.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a Democrat and longtime political ally of Clinton's,
said he was furious with the president _ first for bad behavior,
second for behavior that he said undercut the theme of ``personal
responsibility'' that Clinton and Lieberman had advocated over the
years as they tried to pull the Democratic Party toward the
mainstream values of the political center.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman thought that for someone of Clinton's vaunted
ability to communicate, his initial public comments Aug. 17 had
been ``remarkably inadequate'' to the task of articulating how
consequential his wrongdoing had been and how badly he felt about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said in a lengthy interview Friday in his office in
Washington that he was so angry that 10 days ago, while he was
still on vacation, he sat down with his laptop computer and started
composing his thoughts. He had so much to say that he rejected the
idea of issuing a short press release. What he wrote instead was a
stern, 3,000-word rebuke, the eighth draft of which he read
somberly Thursday on the Senate floor, becoming the first member of
his party to assert in a substantive, public way how what he termed
the president's ``immoral'' behavior had damaged the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Lieberman said in
his 24-minute speech, ``not only contradicted the values he has
publicly embraced over the last six years, it has, I fear,
compromised his moral authority.'' Moreover, he said, it reinforced
``one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular culture,
which is that values are fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lieberman's speech becomes a turning point in the
already seven-month-long national morality play that has engulfed
Washington remains to be seen, but he said he hoped it would
``start a process.'' Still, for several minutes while he was giving
his speech, Lieberman said, ``I felt lonely out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, two of his Democratic colleagues, Sens. Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, took to
the floor to support what he had said. Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle did not speak publicly, but put his arm around Lieberman
and shook his hand. Lieberman's longtime friend Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla., crossed the aisle and sat with him while other Republicans
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he has been bolstered by the generally positive
reaction to his speech, even as some in the Senate have privately
criticized him for what they say is a sanctimoniousness that
infuses his moralizing about society and the degrading effect of
popular culture on mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   His office phone lines were clogged all day with calls, many of
them supportive of his comments, others saying his speech did not
go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech also forced a reaction from Clinton, who was
traveling in Ireland. Prompted by reporters, Clinton said he agreed
with Lieberman that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was
``indefensible'' and he was ``very sorry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he ``appreciated'' Clinton's comments but thought
the president still needed to say more. ``As I saw him,'' Lieberman
said of watching Clinton on television on Friday morning, ``I felt
badly that he had to do it, but I knew he had to do it. This is a
process. It's not a one-time thing. It's like having someone in
your family with a problem. It doesn't end with a single statement.
It's a process _ of confrontation, repentance and reconstruction of
the ties within the family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said the president has called him twice since making his
televised admissions Aug. 17. Lieberman said that in the first
conversation, he told Clinton he was disappointed and angry with
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the second conversation, he told Clinton he planned to make
some public comments that would ``not be comfortable to hear.'' The
senator said, ``He never spoke to me about the content of what I
was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, called Lieberman
on Monday morning when word spread that the senator was about to
speak. Bowles asked him to hold off until Clinton left Russia.
Lieberman said he had not finished the speech anyway and would give
it later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he had considered calling for Congress to censure
Clinton, but backed off at Daschle's request. He said Daschle was
concerned that calling for a specific action by the Senate now _
before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr issues a report on his
investigation _ would be premature and might hamper Democrats'
re-election efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman worried that a call for censure would distract
attention from his main message about Clinton's corrosive effect on
family values.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he never considered not speaking at all, even as
some senators in the Democrats' weekly lunch Tuesday urged everyone
to ``stay on message'' and talk publicly only about policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an air of unreality to that, because we're not going
to get the public, let alone the media, focused back on those
genuine public problems until we deal more openly and better with
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he did not rule out that he may feel compelled in
the future to call for censure, adding that he hoped further
evidence would not force him to call for Clinton's resignation or
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, he hopes Clinton's presidency ``can be
repaired and concluded honorably.''

MURDER CHARGES AGAINST 2 YOUNG BOYS DROPPED AFTER DETECTION OF
SEMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an extraordinary turn of events in an equally
extraordinary murder case, prosecutors on Friday dropped charges
against two boys, ages 7 and 8, who had been accused of killing an
11-year-old girl by hitting her with rocks and suffocating her with
her panties so they could steal her bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The case was dismissed after a laboratory analysis found semen
on the girl's panties. Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine
said medical experts told prosecutors that ``the possibility of
semen coming from boys this age is at best remote.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against the boys brought national attention because
they were believed to have been the youngest children charged with
murder as younger and younger children are being charged with
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and police said Friday that they were now confronted
with reconciling the physical evidence of the semen with the
statements the boys made. Police refused to rule out the
possibility that the boys were still involved. Authorities said
they had not done genetic testing to date and declined to say
whether they planned any in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police had said the boys confessed to the July 27
killing of Ryan Harris, a fifth-grade honor student from a Chicago
suburb who was spending the summer with a godmother in the
impoverished Englewood neighborhood, where the boys lived. They
said the boys struck Ryan with a rock, causing her to fall off her
bicycle and knocking her unconscious. Then, police said, the
younger boy told them he put leaves in Ryan's nostrils and stuffed
her panties in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such apparently depraved actions by children so
young, commentators took to the airwaves and opinion pages
bemoaning the circumstances that could have led children to commit
such a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's dismissal is likely to raise a whole new debate _
about the ability of juvenile systems in Chicago and elsewhere to
be fair and accurate in its investigation of society's youngest
accused criminals.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the Ryan Harris case raised fundamental
questions about the way to handle young children charged with
crimes. Some experts questioned whether children so young could
waive their right to a lawyer or their right to remain silent. The
boys' defense lawyers had complained about the way their clients
were interrogated, saying that because their parents were not
allowed in the room and no juvenile advocate was president, police
could have coerced or teased the statements out of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, defense lawyers for the boys were already calling for
significant changes in juvenile proceedings in Chicago, the home of
the nation's first juvenile court. Their demands included a
requirement that police officers videotape confessions from
children, a rule stating that children under 13 must have a parent
present in the interview, and a policy that, as they do with
adults, police could not file felony charges against children until
prosecutors have reviewed the evidence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think there was a rush to judgment,'' said Elizabeth Tarzia,
a public defender for the 7-year-old. ``There were policies and
procedures that were not in place in juvenile court that led to
this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's dismissal also provoked an explosion of reactions from
the boys' families and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology is in order from everyone who convicted my child of
something that it should have obvious he had nothing to do with,''
said the 8-year-old's father. ``I tried to get them to help find
out who this monster was and instead the authorities became the
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and police defended their handling of the
investigation and their decision to bring charges against the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in new territory here with young people of these
tender years,'' said Devine. ``To say, in retrospect, you could
have done this differently, you could have done that differently _
obviously we can all do that.'' He added, ``This is a very
tragically unique case. We took the action we thought was
appropriate to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine said the boys were arrested based on their confessions, a
practice he said was very common. Tom Cronin, the commander of the
Chicago Police Department's crime laboratory, said that initial
swab tests of Ryan's underpants had turned up no traces of semen.
He said the panties were then sent to the Illinois State Police
crime laboratory for hair and fiber analysis, and also to be
retested for semen. Those tests took several weeks and were
discovered to be positive for semen late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hillard said the police
investigation was conducted properly and he refused to rule out the
possibility that the boys could be rearrested. He said that police
would likely interview the boys again, seeking to resolve the
contradictions between the semen evidence and their statements,
which he said revealed knowledge of details of the case that could
only be known be someone who was ``intimately involved'' in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no _ I repeat _ no misconduct on the part of
any member of the Chicago Police Department,'' Hillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Devine said prosecutors had dropped the charges ``in the
interest of justice,'' but he said investigators were now faced
with a gnawing puzzle. ``We have not resolved many of the questions
raised by the conflict or inconsistencies between the physical
evidence and the statements of the boys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Devine also said that, with respect to the broader procedural
issues in the case, his office had already been considering some of
the changes suggested by defense lawyers, including the videotaped
confessions and the policy of prosecutors reviewing felony cases
before charges are filed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan Harris case tested virtually every juvenile procedure
in Chicago, as judges wrestled with how to handle accused murderers
whose legs could not even reach the ground as they sat at the
defense table and who spent the hours in court playing with
coloring books and toy cars.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, faced with an Illinois law that prohibited
children under 10 from being locked up, a judge ordered the boys be
sent home with ankle monitoring devices and be kept indoors at all
times. Then, another judge decided that this arrangement also
qualified as confinement and ordered the monitoring devices
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered last week that the boys undergo about a
month of psychological testing to see if they were competent to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boys were not satisfied with the authorities'
account of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ferguson, a public defender representing the
7-year-old, disputed the children's confessions. ``Words were put
in their mouths, period,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferguson and R. Eugene Pincham, a private attorney
representing the 8-year-old, said they believed that the case would
not have been handled this way if it had involved suburban
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys this young would not have been arrested and questioned,''
Pincham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the police do business in the black community is
totally different,'' Ms. Ferguson said. ``In a white middle class
community,'' she said, ``parents would have broken down the door
and said `Let me in there'.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers also said there were witnesses who had seen Ryan
with a man on the afternoon or night of her death. Pincham had
earlier made reference to two teen-agers who said they saw Ryan
with a man, described by one of the teenagers as bearded and about
35 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferguson on Friday suggested the attacker might have been a
neighborhood man who was recently released from prison and who had
been bringing toys to the 7-year-old around the time of the
killing, but disappeared soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   She sought to explain the details the boys had told police by
saying, ``I think my little boy and maybe the other saw something
and they were frightened away by the real killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, who was on vacation Friday, issued a
statement saying that ``this case has caused great anguish for
everyone involved. But our focus should remain on Ryan Harris and
the tragic circumstances of her death.''
</P>
<P>
   For the people in the boys' Englewood neighborhood, where people
who knew the boys had instantly doubted they could commit such a
crime, the focus will be on other things, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be all we can do as a community to start
building these boys' trust back up,'' said Glenda Turner, a
neighbor. ``It's bad enough to falsely accuse an adult. These were
tiny children.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Nora Moore, said she was both happy and angry.
``I hope people in this city wake up and realize this is something
that happens every day,'' she said. ``The whole police department
needs redoing, especially in the Englewood area, because there is a
lack of respect and a lack of concern. There really is.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the 7-year-old said that she felt ``a little bit
disgusted. I'm empty, sad.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking outside his home, the 8-year-old's father said the
family would likely move to a new neighborhood ``so my child can
start over and maybe heal correctly.'' He said his boy ``was going
to come out of this all right, but it's a long road. They scarred
him for life.''

SUITS, SETTLEMENTS SHADOW SWISSAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite swift announcements of $20,000 payments to relatives of
those killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the specter of
protracted lawsuits and massive settlements loomed over the airline
Friday, as families began grappling with complex legal questions
and seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   A top aviation lawyer in New York said his ``telephone had been
ringing all day.'' Others said that, based on recent awards in
cases against airlines and manufacturers, the families of the
victims could easily expect a settlement of more than $1 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a far more impressive number than even the
Korean airlines case,'' said Aaron J. Broder, referring to the 1983
downing of Flight 007 after it strayed into Soviet airspace,
killing 269 people. Broder recently won a $19 million settlement
for the wife of a victim of Pan Am 103, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts interviewed interpreted the $20,000
compensation _ billed as a ``good-will gesture'' _ as an early ploy
to prevent further legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not done with any strings attached, and it sounds like
it is not, then I think it's really a nice gesture,'' said Jim
Burnett, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``It probably has some benefits to Swissair. But I'm not
going to be critical of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families can choose the court in which they sue, and
because they prefer courts that will favor their claim, they tend
to end up in the United States, preferably in an urban center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite plainly, we are trying to make a choice based on where
we think we'll get the most favorable results,'' said David
Rapoport, an aviation trial attorney in Chicago. He expects
families in the Swissair crash to file suit in the Southern
District in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have set such precedents for rewarding huge amounts to
victims' families that there is little chance these families will
not proceed in court, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport said the majority of awards are below $5 million. But
they are almost never lower than $200,000, and in some cases have
reached $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Warsaw Convention, airlines are limited to awards of
$75,000 per victim. But two years ago, Swissair, along with all of
the US carriers, waived that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a statement by Swissair acknowledged that the company
was prepared to pay damages. ``In concrete terms, Swissair will
compensate relatives of the victims for losses suffered in the
accident,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the damages are based on individual calculations,
particularly projections of what wages the victim would have
earned, the total cannot yet be determined, it continued.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing, which owns the original MD-11
manufacturing company, McDonnell Douglas, also declined to
speculate about specific damage amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course liability is an unavoidable consequence in
situations like this,'' Russ Young said. ``But particularly this
early on, our concerns are not about legal issues. They're about
technical issues, and understanding what happened, and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not discuss a final settlement until the cause of
the crash has been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the cases will soon be resolved. Lawsuits
resulting from two recent disasters, the crash of ValuJet in 1995
and of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, are still crawling through the
courts. The case of Korean Airline Flight 007 dragged on for more
than a decade.

complicated feelings. They are grateful for the sudden flood of
recognition being paid their cherished hero, but achingly aware it
is more of a requiem than a coronation. It's not just that Roger
Maris, who died in 1985 of lymphatic cancer, was one of their own.
It's also that people from this modest prairie town are moved by
some of the sadder particulars of the Maris story: that he felt

<TEXT>
<P>
   In reaching stomach-churning, sleep-depriving levels last week,
the gyrations of the stock market seemed to restore meaning to an
old Wall Street maxim: to invest is to chose between eating well or
sleeping well.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, their dreams disturbed, headed for the
sidelines. Some, accustomed to filets and refusing to concede that
the bull had snorted its last, rushed in to buy on what they hoped
was Monday's 512-point ``dip.''
</P>
<P>
   Most investors, with varying degrees of concern and confusion,
probably did nothing, amid gathering worry that a healthy market
correction might be turning into the first bear market in 25 years
and that global economic problems could tip the American economy
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   As maxims go, it's hard to beat ``first do no harm.'' But
paralysis in the face of change is another thing entirely. Whatever
your personal circumstances and the condition of your portfolio,
financial experts say there are a number of steps that every smart
household should at least consider in today's highly unsettled _
and sobering _ environment. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn Asset Allocation on Its Head  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the market boomed, brokers and other advisers kept cautioning
that particular stocks or industries _ perhaps computers or
cyberspace _ inevitably would prosper more than others, leaving
investors' portfolios overweighted in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, with stocks bounding upward at more than 20
percent a year, investors who did nothing but watch could quickly
find themselves more heavily into equities than they had intended.
The remedy, readily dispensed, was to pare back such positions,
reinvesting elsewhere to maintain a sensible degree of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a downdraft, the opposite may apply. If too
(italics)small(end italics) a proportion of your portfolio's value
is committed to an area you still favor, the right move would be to
bulk up. As Brian Grodman, a financial planner in Manchester, N.H.,
put it: ``This is the time to buy that Dell Computer. It's pure
common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing shares still selling at 52 times its anticipated
earnings may not seem sensible to every investor, of course. But if
your horizon is long term, your sleep sound and your portfolio
skewed by the market's retreat, you might want to raise your
exposure to stocks in general.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the indomitably bullish strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., increased her recommended stock allotment to
72 percent of assets from 65 percent last week, at the expense of
cash and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to buy a favored stock as it declines _ when it's
``on sale,'' to an optimist's eye _ is a form of dollar-cost
averaging, one of the more sound of investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   By putting a specified sum of money into a stock at regular
intervals, you get more shares for your money when prices are down.
And for any given period, your average cost per share is lower than
the stock's average price.
</P>
<P>
   For the strategy to work, however, the company must be strong
enough to ultimately prosper _ and you must be disciplined enough
to persist at times like these when it may seem dicey to buck the
market crowd. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Put Your Cash to Better Use &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sleeping-versus-eating test may send many investors in
search of the safest havens, rather than in pursuit of reasons for
buying more shares. And though Russians may have been driven lately
to stash even more money under the mattress, Americans have
numerous alternatives if fear or prudence dictates keeping more of
their savings in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The choices are different enough to be meaningful even for
relatively modest sums _ and of real significance when parking,
say, tens of thousands of dollars that you've pulled pulled out of
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bills _ government ious sold at a discount and redeemed
at face value at maturities that range up to a year _ are for the
belt-and-suspenders crowd who insist on maximum safety and who will
accept lower yields for this to avoid state and local income tax on
interest. The return on the one-year bill was 4.875 percent on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are a bit higher _ about 5 percent for two years
and five years _ on longer-term Treasury securities. But if you
don't expect to hold these until maturity, be prepared for market
prices to jump around: If you sell, you might get less than you
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds, including those that hold corporate issues, are
another possibility. Shorter-term funds yield lower returns but are
much less volatile. Whatever the length of the portfolio, experts
caution against buying bond funds on the basis of advertised
historical performance instead of current yields. You also need to
be alert to sales, management and redemption fees, which can slash
the return.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds with ultra-short-term holdings can offer higher
returns than money market funds with similar liquidity but costs
are typically higher, too. For many people, the best place for
stashing cash is likely a money market fund. These combine the
convenience of a checking account with near-perfect liquidity and
returns double or more those paid on savings accounts. Unlike money
market accounts at banks, however, money funds are not insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate in flexibility,'' said Bruce R. Bent,
president of the Reserve Funds, a mutual fund company based in
Manhattan. Bent and a partner devised the money market fund in the
early 1970s, creating what is now a $1.3 trillion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are averaging about 4.75 percent and, unlike bank
certificates of deposit, you don't have to lock up your money for a
set period.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little to distinguish most money funds, there are
some with high minimum balances or other restrictions, such as
limiting the number of checks that can be written against your
account. And note that, unless you're paying income taxes at the
highest rate _ currently 39.6 percent _ you will almost certainly
do better with a money fund invested in taxable short-term
securities than in tax-exempt municipals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people would be better served by putting
their money into taxable funds,'' said Bent, whose firm offers both
kinds. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Money Where You Can Find It &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the economy and the stock market were both barreling ahead,
some people got a bit carried away _ like those who thought it
reasonable to carry credit card balances with 18 percent interest
rates when they could make a more or less ``assured'' 30 percent a
year by keeping that money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Now the odds have clearly shifted, said Gerri Detweiler,
education adviser to Debt Counselors of America, an educational
group whose sponsors include lenders, in Rockville, Md. ``The stock
market is a risky place, while paying off your credit card is a
guaranteed high-return, tax-free proposition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true if you select the card wisely. Ms.
Detweiler recommends searching out one with a fixed, moderate rate
and ignoring those splashy offers of cards with low teaser rates
that jump after six months or a year to the high teens.

 &HT;    Two special prosecutors appointed to Ramsey case
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey
homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to
present evidence to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and
Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled
the Ramsey case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the recent questions ... public confidence demanded
absolutely that we have the most experienced prosecutor we could
get,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Morrissey together have 32 years of experience
prosecuting homicide cases. They work in Colorado counties outside
of Hunter's jurisdiction, but will answer to Hunter on the Ramsey
case. The grand jury will begin hearing evidence later this month,
Laurion said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer refused to appoint a
prosecutor who could have taken the case over from Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Romer made his decision after a police detective who
investigated the slaying of the 6-year-old girl resigned and
claimed Hunter bungled the Ramsey case.
</P>
<P>
   Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that
Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey
clouded his judgment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Fleet White, criticized the Ramseys, saying their
refusal to cooperate with detectives hurt the investigation of
their daughter's death. The Ramseys remain under suspicion in the
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and
strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home
Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.

 UNDATED: high teens.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even then, she says, make it a habit to pay your balance each
month _ and pay on time, she added, thereby avoiding card issuers'
growing practice of imposing fees as high as $29 for being just a
couple of days late with a payment, no matter how little you owe.
</P>
<P>
   There are other easy ways to trim debts and lower interest
payments if you've grown less sanguine about the performance of
your investments. For instance, making extra payments on your
mortgage can sharply reduce your interest payments over time,
effectively putting money in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof over your head is substantially more secure than
investing in the stock market,'' said Marc Eisenson, co-author of
the new book ``Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   The secrets are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your own life style decisions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put your family first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where ever you work, be in business for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the most of the money you bring home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn your debts into golden investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Map out your own financial future.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancing your mortgage is another possibility, though
mortgage interest rates hovering above 7 percent have not fallen as
sharply as might be expected, given the tumbling yields on
government bonds. One of the overarching principles here, of
course, is that any cost-cutting is more valuable than it appears
since, with state and federal taxes, a dollar saved is worth as
much as $1.50 earned.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle is to take money where you can find it. Even
if you are worried about the market's trajectory, for instance,
it's hard to make a case against accepting the company match on
your contributions to a 401(k) plan or other savings programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to continue to fund these plans,'' said
Grodman, the New Hampshire financial planner. Despite the current
unease, people should remember, he said, that ``this is just one
week or one month in the time horizon of their investment life.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make Your Job a Better Investment &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have a lot of faith in your company's prospects, even though the
stock has been beaten down? Maybe it's time to talk to the boss
about the makeup of your pay package.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the necessary clout. But some people whose
compensation includes stock or options might, in light of lower
share prices, succeed in arguing for an earlier or larger grant. Or
they might ask to renegotiate their package: instead of $300,000 in
cash, the arrangement could be $200,000 in cash plus some form of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not the career move of someone with a weak
stomach. Benefits consultants expect that employers, anticipating
queasiness to prevail among their staffs, may move in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies may start to look at performance-based cash plans,''
said Donald L. Lowman, managing director for compensation at Towers
Perrin, the management consulting firm. In other words,
old-fashioned bonuses could supplant stock-based incentive plans if
the markets continue to slide.
</P>
<P>
   This might also be a moment to reassess the broad range of
priorities in your life, some of which may have been shoved aside
in fin de siecle careerism and obsession with money. The stock
market's tumble could force a realization that there's more to life
than our work and its material rewards.
</P>
<P>
   To Eisenson and his co-authors, the idea is to find your own
balance of investments, ``a portfolio not just of stocks and bonds
but one that includes investments in yourself and in your family.''
</P>
<P>
   But this could prove an overly abrupt adjustment of outlook for
most people to make; after all, their job is their chief economic
asset. So even though the unemployment rate is at its lowest ebb
since the Nixon administration, some are bound to conclude that it
wouldn't hurt to make an extra effort at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, to think about some sideline work in case a
weakening economy brings renewed bouts of corporate downsizing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mine the Rubble for Gold &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although every experienced investor knows that markets nearly
always overreact, only a minority find the nerve to search out _
and actually buy _ the inevitable bargains. But sooner or later
solid stocks that have been indiscriminately tossed aside will be
uncovered, often by those value-oriented investors who concentrate
their hunt on a group that has been most thoroughly trashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for an asset class that's way down,'' said Cynthia
Meyers, a financial planner in Sacramento, Calif., _ so long as it
is something that fits the risk tolerance. One question she raises
with clients these days is ``could they stomach the gyrations of
technology stocks?''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Microsoft might qualify as would companies in
other industries, like makers of farm equipment and other heavy
machinery. Still other investors tend to shop for companies whose
stocks have more or less held up, like regional banks, figuring
they may take off when the market steadies.
</P>
<P>
   There is even value in losing money, especially painful as this
may be when the stock in question is one that very recently allowed
you to gloat over handsome paper profits.
</P>
<P>
   Losses, provided they are actually realized, can minimize your
taxes by offsetting profits from the sale of other assets. You can
even create such a loss without giving up on what you still think
is a good idea by switching from, say, Exxon to Mobil, or from one
growth mutual fund to a similar one.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're interested in passing on assets to children
without subjecting the transfer to the gift tax, a drop in stock
price means you can give them more shares before you and your
spouse reach your $20,000 a child annual limit.
</P>
<P>
   In these iffy days, though, it may be that the single smartest
thing to do is make a basic adjustment in thinking _ and then to
act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a kind of greedy attitude, a naive assumption
that we can invest in anything and it will go up,'' Ms. Meyers
said. ``It's good now that clients do see that downs come with the
ups.''

<P>
   For many investors, the choice of whether to sell or hold fast
as stocks swooned in the last two weeks felt like no choice at all:
For better or worse, they said, they were handcuffed to the market
by a need to avoid taking taxable gains or locking in devastating
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Matheson, 51, who does voice-overs for commercials in
Chicago, is one long-term investor whose resolve was severely
tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting on my ledge, thinking about jumping,'' joked
Matheson after last Monday's 512-point dive in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   But once Matheson considered his alternatives, he decided to
leave his stock investments _ about 60 percent of his portfolio _
where they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine locking in these losses,'' he said. ``If I
sold now, I'd be sitting here with a pile of cash and asking, `What
would I do with it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, a slide in major market indexes like the one
culminating in Monday's selloff would have sent Matheson and many
small investors like him stampeding for the exits, scrambling to
sell shares and seeking triage for their ailing portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, with a record number of Americans having a
record amount of their net worth in equities, many investors stayed
with their stocks, saying there was nowhere else to go for
double-digit returns. Indeed, there are few investments that will
yield such strong gains, said Dan Seto, senior economist at Nikko
Securities International. ``There aren't too many good
alternatives'' to the stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many investors, today's money and credit markets don't seem
to qualify. A flight to quality, brought on by the stock market's
gyrations and turmoil in foreign financial markets, has pushed
yields on Treasury bonds to their lowest levels in two decades.
Bank certificates of deposit are no better, with one-year CDs
yielding 4.94 percent, on average, in August.
</P>
<P>
   Commodities, too, are seen as unattractive. Commodity markets
are perceived as risky and forbidding for ordinary investors, while
prices of oil, gold and many other commodities are depressed, with
few signs that broad rallies are imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some investors point to low interest rates and cheap
oil as positive economic signs that should help stocks rebound
soon, resuscitating their battered stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But by clinging to such thinking, the investors may be whistling
in the wind, while whatever profits are left in their stocks
evaporate or their losses escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, in the last few years, they've been correct: Long-term
investing has proven to be beneficial and profitable,'' said Larry
Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. But history also
teaches that investor complacency about declines can be costly, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough fear yet; most of the investing public has
not seen a bear market,'' Rice said, adding that in such strong
downturns, investors usually wind up capitulating and selling very
close to the bottom. Then mutual funds that had been hoarding cash
start buying stocks anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can say is that this time it's going to be
different than every other cycle in history,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   But some investors think it is already too late to sell.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts say stocks still have further to slide, most
view the remaining downside as fairly limited. If so, selling now
could be a sure way for investors to maximize near-term losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late,'' asserted Duke Jupiter, 34, a stockbroker in
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``If you sold that first day, you could have rode
this out. But the losses would be too steep now and there's not
much more downside. If you get out now and it comes back, you're
going to miss out.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people who have been invested in stocks for a while,
losses are not the issue. Even after the market's fall from July's
record highs through Monday, a slide that erased more than $2
trillion in value from the 30 Dow companies and more than $588
billion from NASDAQ shares _ or nearly all the year's gains _ many
investors continue to have sizable, if smaller, gains in individual
stocks. And they are reluctant to sell now and take a hefty capital
gains tax hit.
</P>
<P>
   Helen G. Bradley, 66, of Jacksonville, Fla., said she was
``trying not to make any actual profits outside of my IRA.'' for
tax reasons. In other words, Ms. Bradley does not want to compound
the damage done by the market's slide by surrendering a big chunk
of her portfolio that is not in an individual retirement account to
the Internal Revenue Service through capital gains taxes on sales
of stock. Although prices have fallen, they are still higher than
the prices she paid for her shares years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some stocks, like Apple Computer and Dell Computer, are still up
more than 100 percent this year, while others, like Gap, Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Worldcom, are up more
than 50 percent. The short-term capital gains tax could _ at the
maximum rate _ slice a hefty 39.6 percent of that away.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the flat 20 percent long-term capital gains tax rate,
which now kicks in for stocks owned more than 12 months, a sizable
chunk of gains could be taken.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of recent tax law changes, which are retroactive
to Jan. 1, there is less that an investor can do to lock in stock
gains and avoid a big tax bite, said Robert Willens, a tax and
accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   An investor can still buy a put option to hedge against losses,
but buying one for a stock owned less than 12 months will erase all
of the accumulated time the stock has been owned before it can
qualify for the lower long-term capital gains rate, Willens said.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative strategy, called shorting against the box,
which is used to carry a profit into the next tax year, has become
more restrictive, he added.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the investors who are frozen in the market by
nothing more than ticker shock. ``It's been so bad, I don't even
want to know what I've lost,'' said Deborah Bernstein, head of
sales for the colored-stones division of Kimberly Created Emeralds
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw it go beyond something I could handle, I stopped
looking,'' Ms. Bernstein said. She made an ill-timed first foray
into the stock market two weeks before last October's decline of
500-plus points, buying individual shares of companies like Oracle,
Staten Island Bancorp and Atmel. Atmel, a specialty computer chip
maker, in particular has been routed since she bought it, falling
more than 60 percent this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it gets better, I think I'm going to sell everything and
start over,'' she said. But not now.

   Despite swift announcements of $20,000 payments to relatives of
those killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the specter of
protracted lawsuits and massive settlements loomed over the airline
Friday, as families began grappling with complex legal questions
and seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   A top aviation lawyer in New York said his ``telephone had been
ringing all day.'' Others said that, based on recent awards in
cases against airlines and manufacturers, the families of the
victims could easily expect a settlement of more than $1 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a far more impressive number than even the
Korean airlines case,'' said Aaron J. Broder, referring to the 1983
downing of Flight 007 after it strayed into Soviet airspace,
killing 269 people. Broder recently won a $19 million settlement
for the wife of a victim of Pan Am 103, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts interviewed interpreted the $20,000
compensation _ billed as a ``good-will gesture'' _ as an early ploy
to prevent further legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not done with any strings attached, and it sounds like
it is not, then I think it's really a nice gesture,'' said Jim
Burnett, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``It probably has some benefits to Swissair. But I'm not
going to be critical of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families can choose the court in which they sue, and
because they prefer courts that will favor their claim, they tend
to end up in the United States, preferably in an urban center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite plainly, we are trying to make a choice based on where
we think we'll get the most favorable results,'' said David
Rapoport, an aviation trial attorney in Chicago. He expects
families in the Swissair crash to file suit in the Southern
District in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have set such precedents for rewarding huge amounts to
victims' families that there is little chance these families will
not proceed in court, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport said the majority of awards are below $5 million. But
they are almost never lower than $200,000, and in some cases have
reached $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Warsaw Convention, airlines are limited to awards of
$75,000 per victim. But two years ago, Swissair, along with all of
the US carriers, waived that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a statement by Swissair acknowledged that the company
was prepared to pay damages. ``In concrete terms, Swissair will
compensate relatives of the victims for losses suffered in the
accident,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the damages are based on individual calculations,
particularly projections of what wages the victim would have
earned, the total cannot yet be determined, it continued.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing, which owns the original MD-11
manufacturing company, McDonnell Douglas, also declined to
speculate about specific damage amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course liability is an unavoidable consequence in
situations like this,'' Russ Young said. ``But particularly this
early on, our concerns are not about legal issues. They're about
technical issues, and understanding what happened, and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not discuss a final settlement until the cause of
the crash has been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the cases will soon be resolved. Lawsuits
resulting from two recent disasters, the crash of ValuJet in 1995
and of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, are still crawling through the
courts. The case of Korean Airline Flight 007 dragged on for more
than a decade.

SURVIVAL IN AN ERA OF UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Berger is a contrarian, no doubt about it. A pre-eminent
sociologist of religion, he has been undercutting conventional
assumptions since ``The Noise of Solemn Assemblies,'' his 1961
book, cast a cold eye on the postwar religious revival still in
full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   His latest salvo is in the current issue of The Christian
Century, the journal of liberal Protestantism. Berger, director of
the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture at Boston
University, began by confessing one big error in his early
thinking: that modernity necessarily leads to a decline in
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few locales like Western Europe and few highly
visible groups, like the humanistically educated intelligentsia,
most of the world, he said, is as religious as ever. But he remains
convinced that modern pluralism undermines the ``taken for
grantedness'' that has bolstered traditional religious beliefs and
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Pluralism, in sum, may not keep people from believing but it
influences how they believe _ namely, with a good deal less
certainty. There are, of course, people who thrive on this lack of
certainty. But most people find it disconcerting, especially when
it touches on life's most basic questions. That is why they are
drawn to various contemporary ``offers of certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   He identifies three of long standing within the Christian orbit.
One can seek certainty in the institution of the church, in an
absolute understanding of the biblical text or in one's own direct
religious experience. Catholicism has tended toward the first,
fundamentalist Protestantism toward the second, revivalism and
Pentecostalism toward the third.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argues that the modern human sciences have weakened all
three possibilities. Historical scholarship creates uncertainties
about the institution's trustworthiness. Biblical criticism raises
doubts about any certain interpretation of the texts. Psychology
and the sociology of knowledge undermine confidence in inner
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But is the person who rejects these offers of certainty thrown
into the alternative of a relativism that verges on nihilism?
</P>
<P>
   ``If one rejects the stark alternatives of an open-ended
relativism or some variant of absolutist retrenchment,'' Berger
wrote, ``one is faced with a simple but far-reaching question: How
is one to have religious beliefs and to lead a religious life in a
state of uncertainty?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer draws on classical Protestantism and its core
formula: ``By faith alone _ sola fide.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith is capable of providing what direct experience, pure logic
or the ``taken for granted'' knowledge that pluralism undermines
cannot. But Protestantism does not have a monopoly on this
religious posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mellow synthesis of skepticism and faith that, in
principle, can be found in any religious tradition,'' Berger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, words like ``faith,'' ``relativism,'' ``absolutism''
are red meat for voracious theologians and philosophers, and many
will be tempted to have a tasty meal at Berger's expense. But that
may be nothing like the free-for-all his article could provoke
among scholars of American religion.
</P>
<P>
   The new reigning wisdom in those circles has been that only
``strong religion'' is likely to prosper in contemporary America,
only religious groups, in other words, that demand substantial
commitments of time and resources from their adherents and firm
allegiance to beliefs and practices that differentiate the faithful
from the surrounding culture.
</P>
<P>
   This view gains support from the growth of conservative
Christian groups and from the decline or stagnation of ``weak''
liberal denominations that more readily tolerate modern
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's article is both a sociological and theological
challenge to that view, and he even supplies a text from Paul's
First Letter to the Corinthians: ``God chose what is weak in the
world to shame the strong.'' He cites some recent evidence that
``weak'' religious institutions can be remarkably vital.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives his article force is less the evidence it cites
than the changed attitude toward mainline Protestantism that it
expresses.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative, Berger has made many biting observations over
the years on the political and economic liberalism marking the
leadership of mainline Protestant bodies (and of American
Catholicism as well), reflective, he said, of a deeper
accommodation to the assumptions of modern culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tended to look on mainline Protestantism as a community very
much gone astray,'' he said in a telephone conversation Friday,
``one terribly vulnerable to fashionable ideas.'' That view is
``still correct,'' he said. ``But it has struck me increasingly
that there is a kind of blessing in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a pretty demoralized community,'' he added.
``I'm telling them don't be that demoralized.'' The ``era of
uncertainty'' created by modern pluralism has created believers of
a new sort ``who may be a majority of the population,'' he said,
``and need ministering.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus may not be found in ``the self-assured, triumphalist
institutions that merit the appellation of `strong churches,' ''
Berger wrote in his article, but ``in those `weak' places _ where
people are unsure of themselves, groping for a few glimpses of
truth to hold on to.''

PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT FORCED STATEMENTS FROM KENYA BOMBING SUSPECT,
LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BEN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The former lawyer for a defendant charged in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya said Friday that his client
was told, while under interrogation in Pakistan, that the
government of Pakistan wanted his confession in order to improve
relations with the United States, which have been complicated by
Pakistan's test of nuclear weapons earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by the lawyer, Jack Sachs, came on the day that a
federal judge in Manhattan removed him as the attorney for Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, one of two defendants charged in the embassy attacks
last month, which killed more than 250 people and wounded
thousands. Sachs said that he believed he was being removed because
he had been appointed to two potential death- penalty cases at the
same time: Odeh's and a second, unrelated case.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said his former client also had told him that Pakistani
authorities coerced him into making statements that are said to
have implicated him in the bombings. ``Three days and three nights
without food and without water, under bright lights, no sleep _
what would anybody say?'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani official in Washington rejected Odeh's contention
that he was coerced into making any statements, saying the
allegation ``is totally baseless and fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, Malik Zahoor Ahmad, the Pakistani embassy's
minister for information, said that he could not comment
specifically on the assertion that Pakistan sought to elicit Odeh's
confession to improve relations, but he said that ``Pakistan has
always cooperated with the United States in combating terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our track record is visible to the whole world,'' Ahmad said.
``We have always condemned terrorism in all its forms, and we
believe that terrorism is incompatible with civilized behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh's allegations could not be confirmed independently on
Friday. He has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder, use
of a weapon of mass destruction, and 12 counts of murder, one count
for each of the 12 Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing last
month. If convicted, Odeh could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was said to have admitted a role in the embassy bombings
during his interrogation by Pakistani authorities. But the
documents charging him in the attacks do not cite any statements to
Pakistani interrogators. The documents cited admissions to FBI
agents in Kenya, who questioned him after he was returned to that
country by the Pakistanis, in which Odeh said that he was a member
of al Qaeda, the terrorist organization suspected in the attacks,
and a follower of the group's leader, Osama bin Laden. He denied
any role in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a religious guy,'' Sachs said after court Friday. ``He
doesn't have what they want. He knows very little about bin
Laden.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sachs said that he had interviewed Odeh extensively in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in recent days, and his client had
given his account of his interrogation by Pakistani authorities.
One of his interrogators seemed ``to take pity on him,'' Sachs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy said to him, we're going to use you _ these
confessions _ to help us with the Americans on the nuclear
sanctions,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh sat quietly in the brief hearing in U.S. district court in
Manhattan Friday as Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox said that
he would be given a new lawyer. Sachs said both he and his client
were disappointed at the change of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset that I was not going to be his attorney because
he had grown to trust me,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh's new lawyer, Michael Young, did not return a call seeking
comment.

`MARCH' TO UNDERSCORE NEW GENERATION OF BLACK YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a stage set of Manhattan's night sky glittering
behind him, Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Asociation for
the Advancement of Colored People, laid out for a late night TV
audience his organization's agenda for the nation's black youth.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, a guest last week &UR;  &LR; on HBO's Chris Rock show, spoke about
youth chapters and youth councils and youth protests. He tried to
make a case for bold, new blood in the NAACP _ an organization that
once held the attention and passion of blacks in the millions, and
whose youngest members risked arrest, beatings and even death.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this was now. Rock, a young, irreverant,
black comedian, wasn't buying Mfume's line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on now, are you guys gonna start hittin' the streets? You
know what I mean?'' Rock said, his gravel voice cracking, his hands
waving in show-me-the-money gestures. ``I mean, you can't leave a
rap concert without the Nation of Islam holding out
stuff...Everybody hits the street. You guys ain't never out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of subtle truth wrapped in comic banter,
underscoring the growing gulf that many see dividing a generation
of hip-hop-influenced youth from their civil-rights-era elders.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, as some 50,000 young people were expected to converge
on a six-block stretch of Harlem for a rally flamboyantly labelled
the Million Youth March, many blacks here say that gulf will be on
vivid display. They say the crisis surrounding the event is not to
be found in the showdown between the march's controversial
organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, and the city's bulldog of a
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, who tried to derail the event. Nor is it
in the idea that a man like Muhammad, prone to wildly inflammatory
anti-Semitic remarks, could emerge as a leader of any kind. &UR;  &LR; Nor in
the notion that his march could upstage another youth march
Saturday, in Atlanta, which numbers among its sponsors the NAACP
and Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, they say, is in the widespread sense among the young
of a lack of black leadership attuned to their concerns. The gap
has grown so wide, and the prospects for future leaders seem so
bleak, some say, that a man like Muhammad can enter the void and
claim to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real searching among African-American youth for
leadership, for some kind of meaning and political direction,''
said Errol T. Louis, a community activist who helped start a credit
union for low-income families in Brooklyn and who cut his political
teeth in Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign. ``And that's the
shame of it, because anyone could have announced this need for a
march and any group could have organized it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harlem's prominent ministers and political leaders
continued to recruit volunteers to act as peace buffers between
youth and police. An ad hoc group calling itself the Interfaith
Coalition for Peace and Justice made plans to have lawyers standing
by at police precincts, to hand out leaflets with safety tips and
to turn churches along the route of the march into safe sanctuaries
for marchers.
</P>
<P>
   But as some black leaders voice fear of riots and continue to
denounce Muhammad as a spewer of hate, activists and would-be
marchers said they rarely see the same outrage aimed at the daily
wars they wage -- against drugs, unemployment, prison and police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying, 'We're afraid of you marching without a
permit. We're afraid for the young people getting hurt at the
march.' Why weren't you afraid for us when the police shot at a
child 16 times for holding a toy gun? Or getting shot by police for
holding a Three Musketeers bar?'' said 27-year-old Monifa Akinwole,
referring to two recent incidents of police gunfire aimed at
unarmed residents in Brooklyn and Queens. ``We're not afraid to
march. We're too busy worrying if our keys will be mistaken for a
gun on our way to work. That's the reality and that's what I think
this march is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of young people she works with as an activist at
the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement in Brooklyn, Akinwole said few of
them know about Muhammad or see him as an influence in their lives.
But she says many of them see him as one of the few black public
figures who has reached out to those young blacks who have fallen
and are on the fringe -- drug addicts and dealers, high school
dropouts and gang members. In their eyes, he has met them in their
world, not preached at them to enter his.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks, as Muhammad took the city to court and won
the right to hold the march in Harlem, he has shown them something
they do not see in the black leadership establishment in New York.
He has shown them he is unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many, he remains an uncertain influence. Asked if she
knew what Muhammad stood for or wether she understood his platform,
15-year-old Tyshell Cheatham said, ``That's a good question. Not
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham said she doesn't tend to identify with activists like
Muhammad; it is her mother and her psychiatrist who serve as role
models as she pursues a career in social work. But Cheatham does
dream of leaders who understand and act against the pitfalls that
could sidetrack her as they have sidetracked some of her friends:
pregnancy, drugs, too little money to pay for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the anger we feel comes from the police, but it also
comes from just people who are supposed to represent us, adults,
who are not listening to kids. It seems like maybe they've got
better things to do than listen to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Muhammad, she said, ``He's been in Harlem, and he's seen
what's been happening to us and he hasn't turned his back.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where incidents of police brutality, cuts in the
city's public college programs and disturbing statistics about
black men in prison often dominate the news, observers say some
leaders who rose up through civil rights activism and Democratic
Party politics fail to grasp the new burdens on young people or the
anger they express in lyrics or in real violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black church, the traditional black leaders from the old
guard have not taken up the charge. They don't have anything to say
to the so-called hip-hoppers and they have alienated them,'' said
Amy Alexander, a Boston author who edited ``The Farrakhan Factor,''
about Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of Farrakhan's most trusted confidantes, Muhammad was
expelled from the Nation of Islam by Farrakhan after anti-Semitic
remarks Muhammad made in a 1993 speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Muhammad (don't) have the answers to the problems,
but at least they recognize that something is wrong. They know the
old guard has dropped the ball and they see that a lot of these
kids are just free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Fela Johannes is one of those free agents. Standing at the
corner of 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard Friday, where the
march is supposed to begin, the 16-year-old high school senior from
the Bronx called the march an ``uprising'' that he hoped would make
leaders reckon with the daily struggles of young blacks that never
make the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the real leaders all died,'' Johannes. ``Back in the
day, you knew who they were. But that was like, decades ago.''

AIR PASSENGERS WHO LOOKED TOWARD FUTURE ARE NOW PART OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, whenever Janice Wallace closed her eyes, she could
still see her big sister laughing and blowing kisses through the
window of the taxi speeding toward New York's Kennedy International
Airport. For hours, she clung to that memory of Lori Moran, a
34-year-old figure-skating coach who had planned to toast her third
wedding anniversary in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, as Mrs. Wallace watched news flashes of rescue
workers pulling baby bottles, ripped clothing and seat cushions
from the choppy sea off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, she turned her
attention to the business of bringing her sister's body back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like reality now,'' said Ms. Wallace, 33, as she and her
family made plans to fly to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The dark waters swallowed 229 lives when Swissair Flight 111
plunged into the Atlantic on Wednesday night, and Friday many
grieving families began the painful process of trying to recover
their dead.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for information about the newlyweds, refugee workers,
retirees and others lost in the crash, dozens of families flew to
Nova Scotia from Kennedy Airport on a Swissair charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the relatives of Joseph La Motta, 49, the son of
boxer Jake La Motta, drove to the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy
Airport hoping for news from Swissair executives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many sought to give information that would help with
the identification process. John Dedes hunted for the medical
records of his cousin, Dr. Eugenia Spanopoulou, a cancer
researcher, who was killed flying her 18-month-old son to meet her
father in Greece for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   Elayne Shuster searched for the dental records of her sister,
Stephanie, a 32-year-old Manhattan corporate executive, who had
been on her way to business meetings in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest concern now is to find her,'' said Ms. Shuster,
35. ``That's the only thing that's going to give us, as a family, a
sense of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little news to comfort the families. Rescue
workers, who reported recovering about 60 bodies Thursday, stopped
estimating the body count Friday. And as relatives stayed glued to
their television screens, investigators reported only the recovery
of about 100 suitcases, saying they believed many bodies were
trapped in the wreckage below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this was just God's will,'' said Lynn Ross, the
fiancee of Joe La Motta, her voice choked with tears. She said she
could not bear to fly to Canada until his body is found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine standing there looking at that body of water
and being reminded all over again how Joe died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, the passengers stepped on the jetliner
looking forward to the future. Joe La Motta was thrilled about
traveling to Geneva to promote his company, LaMotta Foods Inc., and
its LaMotta Tomotta sauce, a family marinara recipe handed down
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hausman, 33, an Illinois farm boy whose love of agriculture
catapulted him to the top of the grain buying industry, was
preparing for a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Norman and Caroline DePledge of Concord, Mass., were
settling into their seats along with their grown children, Jane and
Michael, bound for a 10-day walking tour though Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so excited about Switzerland,'' said Alma Healy, a
neighbor who met the family 20 years ago. ``They were really each
others best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight included many passengers like the DePledeges, who
were fulfilling tightly-clasped dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Tahmoush, 77, the retired chief executive officer of
Frank B. Hill, an insurance brokerage house, was planning a
long-awaited reunion. During World War II, Mr. Tahmoush, then an
officer in the U.S. Army, was injured and cared for by a Belgian
couple. And he was on his way to visit that couple's 63-year-old
son for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spanopoulou, a scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital's Derald H.
Ruttenberg Cancer Center, and her husband, Andrew Hodtsev, an
immunologist, were taking their little boy, Platon, to be
christened in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a rising star in her field of molecular immunology
and cancer, Dr. Spanopolou was recently named an investigator for
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a prestigious competitive
award that goes to top young scientists conducting cutting-edge
work.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip was for pleasure. And she was looking forward to
presenting her new baby to her family when the plane fell from the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash traveled quickly. Mrs. Wallace, the sister of
Ms. Moran, the figure skating coach, was sleeping when her father
called with the news. She shook herself awake, insisting the news
could not be true.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moran and her husband, Michael Dichkus, an architect, had
been planning the trip for months. And Ms. Moran, who spent four
years coaching at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan before moving to the
Ice House in Hackensack, N.J., about a year ago, had spent long
evenings flipping through travel guides, dreaming about the Eifel
Tower, long walks in Paris and sightseeing in Grenoble, France.
</P>

   It was their third anniversary and the couple looked forward to
celebrating their happy lives. They had a new house, which Dichkus
fixed and fussed over until his hands got sore. They had a blooming
garden with red dahlias, sunny marigolds and ripe tomatoes. And
this year, after the trip, they planned to finally start a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of renovations in the house, and she loved that
garden,'' Mrs. Wallace said. ``Every moment she wasn't at the rink,
she was outside taking care of the garden, out there at six o'clock
in the morning, pulling weeds.''

<P>
   A peek at the Equity New Issue Calendar on a Bloomberg terminal
last week read like a departure monitor at a fogged-in airport.
``Postponed.'' ``Delayed.'' ``Canceled.'' Indeed, as stocks
struggled to climb back after Monday's selloff, not one company
ventured onto the public markets last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I would say the window is closed,'' said Andy
Kessler, a co-founder of Velocity Capital Management in Palo Alto,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Fitzgibbon Jr., editor of The IPO Reporter, a
newsletter, agreed. ``What's going on in this market?'' he asked.
``Nothing, absolutely nothing. The hurricane shutters are down.''
</P>
<P>
   Four companies that postponed planned stock or units offerings
last week were Datalink, a maker of data storage devices;
Galacticomm Technologies, an on-line communications software maker;
Gary Player Golf, a golf club marketer, and Sunbelt Automotive
Group, a car retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Datalink, Gary Player and Galacticomm said late last week that
they would wait until the second half of September before
considering an initial offering. A spokeswoman for Sunbelt did not
say when it would reapproach the market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last week's shutdown follows a month of dismal fortune
for IPOs. The Securities Data Co. said that only 19 came to market
in August, raising a total of $1.33 billion. By contrast, there
were 49 in August 1997, raising $2.86 billion. And even as recently
as July, 46 companies managed to break out of the gate, raising
$3.89 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for recent offerings are grounded, too. According to
Fitzgibbon, as of Aug. 31 only two of the IPOs in the month were
trading over their offering prices: Jenkon International, a
software concern, and Geocities, the Internet company that helps
individuals create their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbon said the 19 stocks that went public in August lost
20.4 percent of their value by month's end, on average, with the
worst performance turned in by Pilot Network Services. That
company, which provides secure Internet access services for on-line
businesses, was initially priced at $14 on Aug. 11, opened at $13
and closed on Friday at $6.875.
</P>
<P>
   ``August was a blood bath,'' Fitzgibbon said.
</P>
<P>
   And even those lucky holders of Geocities and Jenkon were put
through the wringer. Geocities jumped to $37.3125 from its offering
price of $17 on Aug. 11, peaked at $51.375 the next day and closed
on Friday at less than half that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkon rose to $5.53125 on Aug. 11 from its offering price of
$5, hit a high of $6.375 on Aug. 26 and closed at $5.75 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers in the current selloff are investors
who signed so-called lock-up agreements, agreeing that they will
not sell their holdings for 180 days. Many who did saw their
holdings rise and then were forced to sit on their hands as their
positions collapsed in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``All private-round investors are being asked to sign these
agreements these days,'' Kessler said. But when markets tumble, he
added, the lock-ups can cause newly issued stocks to sink out of
sight once anxious investors flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current market, anyone who's locked up is going to be
out of luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does September hold for prospective IPO investors? The
period after Labor Day has traditionally been popular for initial
offerings, and until recently, the calendar for the fall looked
full. At the end of August, for example, The IPO Reporter had more
than 70 offerings on its September list.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, however, said he believed half of those prospective
IPOs would be postponed. The current lineup, meanwhile, is weighted
heavily toward very small companies, with scant operating
histories, trying to take their stocks public without the backing
of large, well-known underwriters. Underwriters' support can be
crucial in determining an offering's success.
</P>
<P>
   IPO experts still see a number of high-profile, potentially
well-grounded deals on the horizon. But they say it is unlikely
that any one deal will lift the IPO market out of its doldrums. And
that includes the much-anticipated proposed offering by Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is expected to bring in $2.5 billion or more,
although details are still being worked out. A spokesman for
Goldman said the firm's plans remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbon predicted that Goldman, Sachs ``is going to be a
class act onto itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the market picks up significantly this month, the
IPO outlook will likely follow suit, regardless of what Goldman
does, analysts say. Fitzgibbon, for one, thinks a new round of
internet companies will be going public in the coming months.
Indeed, such offerings have fared better than those of other
companies in the market's downturn.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hold your breath. A survey of the top 15 underwriters
by Bloomberg Financial Markets showed that none of them planned
IPOs for this week.

THE FINNS FIND GLITTER IN RUSSIA'S SHADOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Four years ago, Finland established a
free-trade zone along its border to encourage business with Russia,
hoping to revive a relationship that had all but collapsed along
with the dissolution of the Soviet order.
</P>
<P>
   Acer, the computer company based in Taiwan, decided to test the
waters with a modest assembly operation at Lappeenranta, a small
outpost on the Finnish side of the border, about 620 miles from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Acer assembly plant can hardly cope with demand from
Russia. And the town of a few hundred people has grown into a city
of 50,000, dotted with large and small operations for wood
products, construction material, food, alcohol and trucking _ all
targeted for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best of both worlds _ the safety of operating this
side of the border and such close proximity to a huge market,''
said Natalya Kostina, 28, a Russian who is deputy operations
manager of the Acer plant. ``Our customers pay less by taking the
products assembled here and moving it themselves. They know how to
navigate the chaos of Russia, and we avoid the headache of insuring
security. It's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as anyone in Finland can remember, the 800-mile
border with Russia was viewed as a liability, an origin of
invasions and an entryway for refugees and crime. This nation of
five million people has had 10 wars with its huge neighbor over the
past 600 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the collapse of the Soviet Union has resulted in a bonanza
for the Finns. In a world tossed into economic turmoil by Russia's
dysfunction, Finland is cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a gold mine for Finland,'' Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen
said in a recent conversation here. And he expects the trade
between the nations to grow, despite the risks.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst here estimates that 20,000 Finnish businesses are
engaged in the Russian trade. There has also been a huge increase
in investment by American companies like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard,
Carrier and Sikorsky, and several American trucking companies have
bought into Finnish firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation was strong,'' explained Jukka Leinonen,
director of Hewlett-Packard's Baltic States operations here. ``The
Finns have known the Russians for a long time. You can drive a
train from Finland all the way to Moscow or the Baltics, and it is
difficult even for the Russian Mafia to harass a train.''
</P>
<P>
   Leinonen said that 20 percent of his $321 million in sales in
Eastern Europe goes to Russia and the Baltic states. ``It is the
fastest growth area for us,'' he said. ``There is not one year
since 1992 when our sales did not grow by at least 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with Russia via Finland enjoys significant if
low-key support in the United States. Strategists headed by Strobe
Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, have given their blessing,
diplomats say, to the ``Northern Dimension,'' as the projects tying
Northern Russia to the European Union are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to find Russian competitive exports that are
more attractive than energy,'' said Jaakko Ihamuotila, who heads
Neste, the big Finnish energy company that is merging with IVO
Group to form Fortum Corporation. ``Naturally, we are now looking
into developing'' Russian oil and gas holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, he said, the company's Russian work force has grown
from five or six people to 200, mostly operating gas stations. A
steadily growing share of Neste's $800 million in annual sales come
from Russia, and the company gets 40 percent of its crude oil from
Russian fields.
</P>
<P>
   Russia today may be in chaos, but that hasn't slowed Finland's
penetration of its markets.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Valio, a dairy products company that was close to going
under in 1990, when it discovered the rapacious Russian market next
door. Today, Valio controls some 20 percent of the market in its
field in St. Petersburg, whose population, at five million, rivals
that of all of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their per capita income may be much smaller than ours, but
their appetite and purchasing power for some foods _ cheese, for
example _ is huge,'' said Esa Luomanpera, a Valio vice president.
Sales to Russia amounted to 10 percent of the company's $1.8
billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things you just need,'' Luomanpera said of his company's
line of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Given the picture of a Russia tumbling out of control, its
currency effectively devalued, who in Russia is doing all the
buying?
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it,'' said Olavi Urvas, manager of Russian trade for
Outokumpu, a large mineral holding company that has six units doing
business with Russia. ``Retail trade, wholesale, banks, financial
institutions, private schools, health care, construction. They all
need expertise and are willing to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-time Finnish operators are doing just as well as larger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes six hours to drive to Russia from Helsinki,''
said Stephen Lowe, an independent exporter who operates in the
border region selling bananas and other food items. ``We are doing
a cash business. I stock my goods five minutes from the Russian
border and deliver as soon as they pay in rubles, which I convert
as soon as I collect, so there are no losses in exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finland,'' he said, ``is the last frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   Juhani Missonen has a brisk business flying rich Muscovites and
their families for weekends in Finland or Cyprus. ``I charge
$52,000 to fly a family of, say, five, to Kuusamo,'' he said,
referring to a Finnish winter resort. And there are enough rich
Russians who can pay such prices for a three-day vacation to make
his Euro-file Ltd. a very profitable venture, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Russian tourists are flocking to Finland. More people
visited from Russia last year than from anywhere else, accounting
for 232,000 nights' stays and spending an average of more than $600
a person, according to Pekka Korpinen, deputy mayor of Helsinki.
The Japanese came in second in numbers and spent less _ about $450
each.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that crime would spill over from Russia have not been
realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Mafia comes here, it seems they come to rest, not to
fight,'' said Oli Kivinen, foreign editor of Helsingin Sanomat, the
largest Finnish daily. ``We have got the Russians but not their
troubles. It is as if Finland has been declared a trouble-free
zone. The deal is you are welcome, but leave the guns at home. And
they respect it.''

</P>
<P>
   A Rough Ride in Chicago, Too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to stomach the roller-coaster summer of the
financial markets. Traders and clerks at the Chicago Board of Trade
collapsed on the trading floor on Tuesday after an exhausting
session in which investors tried to protect positions by trading in
Dow Jones stock index futures.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow climbed 288.36 points that day, making up more than half
the 512.61 points it lost on Monday. But over the rest of the week,
it gave most of that gain back, closing down 411.43 points at
7,640.25. With investors looking for a haven from the equity
markets' volatile swings, bond prices rose, pushing yields down to
a three-decade low. The 30-year Treasury bond ended the week at
5.28 percent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicine for the Market &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shares of pharmaceutical companies climbed, however, after the
FDA recommended approval of taxmoxifen as a means to reduce the
risk of breast cancer. Zeneca Group PLC, which makes the drug, and
Barr Laboratories, which sells its generic form, rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca ADRs ended the week down $1.25 at 37.0625. Barr shares
fared better, gaining 44.9375, to close at $33.3125. Barr also
benefited from FDA approval of its ``morning-after'' Preven
Emergency Contraceptive Kit.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech rose, but fell back, ending the week off 25 cents at
$66.75 after the FDA approved its Herceptin drug for metastatic
breast cancer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PILOTS' STRIKE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Rebuffs Plea &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the pilots' strike against Northwest Airlines snarled holiday
travel plans in the Midwest, President Clinton rejected a call on
Thursday by Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota to order the pilots back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   The White House called on the two sides to return to the
bargaining table, and they were to have met Saturday in Chicago
with a federal mediator. The pilots, who are demanding increased
job security and higher pay to make up for cuts they took in 1993
to save the airline from bankruptcy, turned down the carrier's
initial offer.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest says it cannot afford to meet the pilots' demands and
has laid off more than half its 51,000 workers, saying that it
could not afford to pay them while it was not operating. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gains for Retailers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American retailers had fairly strong sales for August, with
same-store sales _ those for stores open at least a year _ up 3.5
percent, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index.
Wal-Mart's gain was 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, retailers were counting on a strong September, as
tax-free shopping kicked off back-to-school sales. ... General
Motors, still struggling from July strikes, reported that car and
light-truck sales fell 36.4 percent in August, giving the industry
as a whole a decrease of 6.6 percent, despite an increase in
American sales for nearly all other auto companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was up 8.1 percent; Chrysler, 3.5 percent, and Toyota, 10.9
percent. American sales of Daimler-Benz's Mercedes cars surged 75.8
percent. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, as expected, held steady at a low 4.5 percent last
month. .. . The industrial economy continued to show vigor in July,
with new factory orders flowing in at the strongest pace in eight
months, growing 1.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $335.2
billion. ... Sales of new homes, however, fell 1.6 percent in July,
to 886,000 units at an annual rate, which was more than expected.
... Growth in workers' productivity posted the smallest gain in
nearly two years in the last quarter _ 0.1 percent, though that was
better than a preliminary estimate of a drop of 0.2 percent. &QL;

Russian people about the hard realities of capitalism and the price
of international support for relief from Russia's financial mess.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid and
caused the collapse of the government. He signaled, however, that
the West would step up its aid if the Kremlin pressed ahead with
tough economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Western banks and investment funds, particularly German
institutions, that bet on Russia disclosed losses that totaled in
the billions of dollars. Among the banks reporting sizable losses
were Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays

new jobs being added daily, lamented how the Asian and Russian
economic crises have battered stock prices in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with Mexico,'' he said of the outside
problems. ``There is a lack of differentiation'' among traders.
Asia's troubles were seen anew in South Korea, where nonperforming
bank loans surged 11.8 percent between March and June to $21.4
billion, and riot policemen were called in to quell strikers. In
Malaysia, the finance minister, Anway Ibrahim, was dismissed after
the government imposed currency controls. &QL;

its management employees. ... Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco agreed
to combine their European refining and marketing businesses, a step
toward cutting costs and capacity. ... Union Pacific, still
recovering from some of the worst congestion in railway history,
announced a plan to improve and, in some cases, ration its service.
... Delta Air Lines, after failing to reach an agreement with its

<P>
   Don't tell Chuck and Donna Gulland that last Monday's stock
selloff was just one of those market dips of no lasting
consequence. The couple were supposed to close last Tuesday on the
sale of their home in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``We had everything we
owned packed,'' said Mrs. Gulland, who expected to turn over the
keys of her three-bedroom, two-bath home to Antonitta and Joseph
Blazina of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked in expecting to sign the last papers,'' Mrs. Gulland
said, ``and we were told the deal was off.'' The 1,700-square-foot
home was to have sold for $489,900.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazinas balked, unnerved by the stock market's effect on
prospective buyers of their own five-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, those candidates were competing to meet the
Blazinas' asking price of $589,900 _ behavior in keeping with the
super-heated Silicon Valley real estate market, where home prices
have been appreciating at double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   But as the stock market continued to slide from the peaks set in
July, and after scores of prospects had walked through the home the
weekend before Monday's plunge, only a single offer _ $30,000 below
the asking price _ was still on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got scared,'' Ms. Blazina acknowledged. There could be
weeks of uncertainty in home prices, she said, fueled by the
stock-market turmoil. So the Blazinas chose to forfeit their
$15,000 deposit and scrapped the Gulland deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to take the sure loss than maybe gamble,'' Ms. Blazina
said, ``and it could be more then.''
</P>
<P>
   The good times aren't over in Silicon Valley, or other enclaves
whose affluence rose with the raging bull market. Expensive homes
are still being bought _ and cars and boats and baubles, too.
</P>
<P>
   But stories like those of the Gullands and Blazinas are popping
up in even the most comfortable circles, as big-ticket purchases
are reconsidered in light of the markets' tumble of the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some clients of Farid Saatchi, owner of F&AMP;S Jewelry
in Manhattan, were less enthusiastic than usual last week.
</P>
<P>
   He said one customer, who earns her living investing, changed
her mind about buying $15,000 of unset diamonds. ``She wanted to
wait and see what happens,'' Saatchi said. ``People slow down on
everything. They get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   And the market's whipsaw slowed the buying impulses of two
serious prospects for Business Jetsolutions, a Dallas company that
sells ownership shares in private jets. Michael Riegel, a vice
president, said both clients were executives in stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked to delay,'' said Riegel, who valued the now-dormant
deals at less than $500,000 apiece. ``I think they'll be back with
us in a number of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Riegel's optimistic outlook is widely shared in the ranks of the
affluent _ or even the reasonably comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, instead of putting the brakes on spending, some
Michigan consumers saw the stock market's weakness as a sign to buy
_ cars, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some longtime customers of the Pontiac-Olds-GMC
dealer in Frankenmuth, Mich., had neglected their annual rite of
selecting a new model. ``Most bought a new car every year,'' said
Michael Young, the owner of the dealership, adding that many
customers are former autoworkers, eligible for a manufacturer's
discount.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the customers explained his absence as a
consequence of the surging market. ``Why draw 20 grand out of the
market when it's earning 20 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   Within the last 10 days, though, four such customers came in
with cash in hand, ready to buy. ``They put it off because they
wanted to put their money in the market,'' Young said. ``When it
dropped, it put them over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Blumenthal, general manager of Fletcher Jones Motorcars, a
Mercedes-Benz dealership in Newport Beach, Calif., said it sold 90
new cars the last five days of August. ``It's a pretty typical or
better-than-average month-end,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   ``Our business isn't affected by Asia and Russia,'' he said,
referring to the regions whose financial crises may well have
prompted the market's decline. ``Interest rates play a very strong
role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those who left the market before the plunge.
Gary Clifford, a luxury yacht broker for Richard Bertram &AMP; Co. in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said his customers weren't troubled by
recent market turmoil because ``a lot of people are already
liquid.''
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers favoring Bertram's Italian boats were already in
cash, anticipating that the dollar would weaken against the euro,
Europe's new currency, when it is adopted next January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said he personally sold three yachts, for more than
$1.7 million each, in the last month, and overall sales at Bertram
have been normal. ``No one's canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertram's confidence is reflected in its inventory, which
includes an $8.8 million, 118-foot Benetti yacht that is to be
displayed at a boat show in January. ``For us to put these very
expensive products in stock means we are very aggressive,''
Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from Fort Lauderdale, Wayne Crosby, a real estate broker in
Midland, Mich., ignored any losses in his stock portfolio and was
set to complete the purchase sometime this week of a 40-foot
pleasure boat costing $300,000. ``With low interest rates, you
can't own it any cheaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Brennan, co-owner of Brennan Marine Sales in Bay City,
Mich., who is selling the boat to Crosby, said: ``I don't ever
recall it making a difference in our sales. People don't sell stock
to buy a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes do, though, to buy jewelry, according to Alfredo
Molina, a jeweler in Phoenix. ``My product is looked on as
diversification of assets,'' Molina said. ``We've had a record
year. A lot of people have been taking profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday and Tuesday, for example, Molina said, customers
bought a $60,000 five-carat emerald ring, a $450,000
ruby-and-sapphire bracelet and a $145,000 diamond necklace.
</P>
<P>
   While buying jewelry can be seen as a flight to hard assets
during uncertain times, Molina said he thinks his customers justify
their purchases for a different reason. ``They believe in enjoying
their money,'' he said. ``None that I've talked to are running for
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he. Molina is expanding his shop by 4,200 square feet and
adding Spanish jewelry by Carerra y Carerra, Chopard Swiss watches
and Cartier accessories. ``Finding merchandise is the biggest
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An equally bullish appraisal for luxury sales came from Anthony
D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau Inc., the Swiss
watch retailer whose line includes $3,000 Rolexes and $75,000 Patek
Philippe timepieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, the best products we can't get enough of,'' he
said from his Manhattan office, adding that Tourneau customers
enjoy showing off their financial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take your Van Gogh into the boardroom, or a
restaurant or to the beach,'' D'Ambrosio said. ``People who do well
in the market are people who are experienced; it doesn't affect
their spending.''

<P>
   SPRING HOUSE, Pa. _ The Pennsylvania Caveat Emptor Investment
Club has its routine: Members convene on the first Wednesday of
each month to review the club's stock holdings, analyze new
companies and vote on new stock purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot to shake this routine _ more, at least, than a
512-point selloff in the Dow Jones industrial average. Though the
plunge last Monday battered the club's portfolio, members still
waited until Wednesday evening to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we got wiped out,'' Tony Catanzaro, the club's
treasurer, said pleasantly. He explained to other members that
their 1998 gains of 13.5 percent were almost erased by the market's
fall. ``But that just means we've got some buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what the club focused on for the next two
hours at the Old York Road Country Club in Spring House, a suburb
of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the club's cool response to the market's
convulsions reflected its enthusiastic embrace of the principles of
the National Association of Investors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The association, a nonprofit group in Madison Heights, Mich.,
that promotes clubs as a way to educate consumers about the
benefits of long-term investing, has built its philosophy on four
core ideas: Investing regularly to take advantage of dollar-cost
averaging, reinvesting earnings to gain the benefits of
compounding, investing in growth companies, and diversifying to
spread risk.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has caught on. The association says the number of
clubs nationwide has jumped to more than 37,500 from 10,000 in
1993. The average club is 8{ years old, has 14 members who each
invest $58 a month and enjoys a 12.4 percent annual return.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat Emptor is somewhat newer _ just three years old;
otherwise, it seems to hew closely to the average. It has 16
members evenly split between men and women who must contribute at
least $50 a month, though they can contribute more. Club members
range in age from 27 to 48 and include a podiatrist, a research
biologist, a sign painter and a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   The club owns shares in Abbott Laboratories, Aflac, Callaway
Golf, Diebold, Halliburton, Halter Marine, Hannaford Brothers,
Invacare, Lucent Technologies, Paychex, Speedway Motorsports,
Synovus Financial, Trinity Industries, Vishay Intertechnology and
XXSYS Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Catanzaro, a purchasing manager for a pharmaceutical company,
said the club's portfolio outperformed the average for NAIC
investment clubs in 1996 and 1997, posting annual returns of 18
percent and 25 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The club's total assets, which peaked at the end of June at
$32,000, fell almost 19 percent, to $26,000, by Monday, though they
picked up a bit with the partial rebound on Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the members were investment novices when the group
started in 1995, said Paul Carbone, a medical sales representative
who organized the club. Now, all are comfortable using phrases like
``price-earnings ratio'' and ``combined estimated yield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're not nervous is that we're in it for the long
haul,'' Carbone said. ``When we see a stock that may be going south
for a couple of months, we're not going to turn around and sell it
off. As long as the company has good management and growth
potential, and there are no obvious problems, we'll stick with
it.'' Indeed, the club has yet to sell a stock.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lingering on their losses, members at the Wednesday
meeting focused on future moves. Sticking to the schedule,
individuals reported on stocks in the club's portfolio, leading to
a discussion about whether to buy more shares.
</P>
<P>
   The club also heard a presentation on three water companies
under consideration as new investments. ``Water as a natural
resource is going to be the liquid gold of the future,'' said
Catanzaro, citing several news reports on potential water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Carbone, who conducted the research, used detailed work sheets
the association provides to help compare and select the stocks by
analyzing each company's historical and projected sales growth,
earnings per share and estimated price-earnings ratios, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the three companies seemed worth investing in,
based on their historical performance, Carbone recommended looking
at desalination companies as possible investments.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's most controversial moment came near the end, when
the 10 members in attendance voted 8 to 2 to spend $300 on more
shares of XXSYS, a former military contractor that repairs bridges
using high-technology polymers.
</P>
<P>
   The club originally bought 100 shares at $4 each in November
1996. Since then, the price has dropped to 32 cents. With
dollar-cost averaging, the stock would have to reach 77 cents for
the club to break even.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get out of this company and not lose any money,''
said Walter Knapp, a research biologist, adding that even with the
$300 purchase, XXSYS would still make up just 1 percent of the
club's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that big of a risk, and it would be a real
coup if it works,'' agreed Randy Huber, a painter.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Tobin, a podiatrist, was livid. ``It's throwing good
money after bad,'' she said. ``It really upsets my confidence
level. It's gambling.''

<P>
   Emerging markets are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   After a decline that has seen the Morgan Stanley Capital
International index of emerging markets plummet 33 percent since
mid-July, even the ``attractive'' values that are peeking through
the wreckage are still too risky for some professional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Telebras, the Brazilian telephone company. In July, the
Brazilian government sold its controlling share to the public at a
price well above forecasts. Now the stock is down 52 percent since
July 30.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Sterling, the global strategist at BEA Associates, an
investment management firm, acknowledged that the plunge makes
Telebras tempting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuations are incredibly attractive now,'' he said.
``Typically, when markets have been this cheap, they have
outperformed over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, BEA is keeping its powder dry. ``The fundamentals are
so unsettling at the moment,'' Sterling said, ``it's easy to see
good values going down even more.''
</P>
<P>
   In an environment like this, tiptoeing through the next couple
of months will be tricky for American investors. ``It is difficult
to know whether this market is damaged permanently or just for the
next six months,'' said Desmond Lachman, the head of
emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors may not be panicking yet, but they are
pulling some money out of emerging markets, most recently in Latin
America. Many fled Asia long ago. If developments scare investors
even more, that will just add to the downward pressure on markets
from Thailand to Indonesia, Russia to Hungary and Mexico to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Total assets are down 25.5 percent this year for the
emerging-markets funds that supply information to AMG Data
Services. Of this decline, one-fifth is a result of investor
withdrawals. But the money is flowing out much faster from Latin
American funds, where the average rate of weekly withdrawals since
June is three times that from Asia and Pacific funds. And emerging
markets still face tremendous problems that could set off more
selling: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEVALUATION Columbia effectively devalued its currency last week
and other currencies from the Brazilian real to the Hong Kong
dollar are still under pressure. The threat of devaluation of these
currencies and the Chinese yuan, which does not trade freely, has
not disappeared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY CONTROLS Malaysia imposed such controls last week, and
restrictions could spread elsewhere. Paul Krugman, an economist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has argued that such
controls, although generally regarded as unworkable, may be the
only hope emerging-markets countries have of cutting interest rates
to stimulate their economies without the fear of a new run on their
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But restrictions also make emerging markets harder to exit and,
therefore, less attractive to outside investors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CREDIT SQUEEZE A surge in interest rates in emerging-markets
countries has already slowed economic growth significantly and will
keep it in check. These rates, now 20 percent or more, make it
harder for countries like Brazil to make interest payments or
refinance billions of dollars in debt. Moody's Investors Service
cut Brazil's debt rating last week sending stocks even lowe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE MALAISE The Japanese government still has not shown
that it will carry out the policy changes that economists say are
needed to revive the nation's economy, like a broad tax cut and a
revamped banking system. Without a turnaround in Japan, rebounds
are not likely soon in other Asian countries swamped by the cascade
of currency crises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   RESCUE DOUBTS Given the collapse of Russia's ruble and economy,
it is unclear how the United States and its allies, along with the
International Monetary Fund, would respond if a country like Brazil
found itself on the brink. And the United States Congress may not
approve the injection of money that the IMF needs to keep its
bailout fund flush. Without a reliable global backstop, the risk in
emerging markets is much higher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A COMMODITIES SLUMP Commodity prices are still weak, just above
21-year lows. Oil, copper, gold and other commodities are important
revenue sources for the governments of many emerging-markets
countries, from Russia to Mexico, South Africa to Chile and Zambia
to Indonesia. Low prices make it harder for these countries to
sustain growth and control spending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FEWER PLAYERS Many institutional investors in emerging markets,
including hedge funds that have lost millions in Russia and big
international mutual funds that had 10 percent to 30 percent of
their money there, have pulled out and ``will not return for some
time,'' said Stuart S. Brown, who is in charge of emerging-markets
research for Paribas in London. ``It will take an extended period
of time for the appetite to return in any significant way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Chapman, the head of international equities at the Dreyfus
Corp., who had trimmed his international fund's exposure to
emerging markets to zero, was sorry when he tried to identify a
market low this year. ``We tried a couple times and decided quickly
that we were wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This means investors need a new approach. Throwing money at
emerging markets as a broad group is not advisable, analysts say.
In fact, the Morgan Stanley emerging-markets index has fallen in
three of the last four years and is down 42 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing countries carefully will be important, especially those
that are not well-known, analysts say. This includes checking where
a mutual fund actually has invested, not just relying on the fund's
name.
</P>
<P>
   When emerging markets begin to turn around, the profits, several
analysts said, will come from owning the right companies, selected
not only by their strength at home but also by how they match up
with their competition around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is still the key to the overall outlook. Many
analysts fear that deepening problems in Russia and Asia will force
Brazil to devalue the real, which would probably set off another
wave of selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contagion has been savage,'' said Christopher D. Alderson,
who is in charge of emerging markets at Rowe Price Fleming in
London. Chapman of Dreyfus has been reluctant to test Brazil again
for just that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce Cornell, the lead portfolio manager of the Scudder
Emerging Market Growth fund, is guardedly optimistic. ``I think we
are going to look back on this period as a wonderful buying
opportunity,'' she said. But though she is doing some buying in
Mexico, including stocks like Fomento Economico Mexicana, the large
beverage company known as Femsa, she is avoiding riskier areas like
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is also off limits, in Mrs. Cornell's view. ``Asia is not
worthy of much serious investment for some time, and I mean a long
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A region that should do well, she said, is central Europe,
including Poland and Hungary, despite the fact that markets there
have all been down this year. Although the countries are situated
close to Russia, Mrs. Cornell said, their main trade links are with
the European Community.
</P>
<P>
   She also likes the Middle East, including Egypt (down sharply)
and Israel (off less), and some countries that get even less
attention, like Ghana and Morocco. The Moroccan stock market has
actually posted gains during the recent crisis, and Ghana has held
steady; each is up significantly in dollar terms for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you a lot to choose from,'' she said, even if her
list omits the big-name emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, times are tough, even for savvy investors who steer clear
of the craters. Mrs. Cornell never had any money in Russia, and she
made an early exit from Asia, meanwhile turning up winners in the
outback of emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   She got a lift from Portugal, which is up 31 percent this year
and is still classified as an emerging market for a few more months
even though it is joining Europe's single currency in January. But
with all that, Mrs. Cornell's emerging-markets fund, while outdoing
most of her competitors, is down 28.3 percent for the year.

ELOISE O. SPAETH, 96, COLLECTOR AND SUPPORTER OF AMERICAN ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eloise O. Spaeth, an art collector and booster of American art
in particular, died Friday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She
was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Over many years, Mrs. Spaeth and her husband, Otto Spaeth, an
industrialist and a vice president of the Whitney Museum of
American Art, put together a collection that concentrated on
European and American art between the two world wars, including
works by Picasso, Matisse, Alexander Calder, Edward Hopper, Georgia
O'Keeffe, Stuart Davis and Charles Sheeler. Spaeth, who died in
1966, founded Dayton Tool and Die Co., Metamold Aluminum of
Cedurburg, Wis., and several other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, the Spaeth collection was exhibited at several
museums, including the Gallery of Fine Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Most
of it has since been sold, and a few paintings were given to
museums, most notably Hopper's ``Carolina Morning,'' which went to
the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as a volunteer that Mrs. Spaeth, who was born in
Decatur, Ill., made her mark. She was active in the American
Federation of Art, where she served as traveling exhibitions
chairwoman, started a newsletter and sponsored a book on films
about art. In 1952, she was deputy commissioner of the American
Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, where Calder was the star of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, as a way to raise money for the Archives of
American Art Mrs. Spaeth started organizing art junkets to sites
around the world, a device since adopted by many museums. She also
helped get the archives accepted as a bureau of the Smithsonian
Institution, which later rewarded her work for the archives with
the Henry Medal, its highest honor. At her death, she was a board
member emeritus of the Archives of American Art and the Guildhall
of East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two children, Otto Spaeth Jr. of Rye, N.Y.,
and Mary Louise Koon of St. Louis; 16 grandchildren; and 15
great-grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Air Force helicopters crashed early Friday on a
nighttime training mission over a remote mountainous area in
Nevada, killing all 12 crew members on both crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the Air Force's most deadly accident since
September 1995, when 24 airmen died in the crash of an Airborne
Warning and Control System surveillance aircraft moments after
taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters, each of which had six
airmen aboard, crashed at roughly 1 a.m. local time while flying
together about 70 miles north of Nellis Air Force Base outside Las
Vegas. It appeared likely that the two craft collided, but
officials at Nellis and in Washington said they would not know for
certain until the Air Force completes an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, made by Sikorsky Aircraft of Connecticut at a
cost of more than $10 million each, are designed to carry out
search-and-rescue missions and belonged to the 66th Rescue Squadron
at Nellis. The squadron had recently returned from duty in the
Persian Gulf and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters were on a routine nighttime exercise inside the
sprawling 5,000-square-mile training range north of Las Vegas, the
Air Force's largest.
</P>
<P>
   They crashed in a mountainous area about 25 miles north of
Indian Springs, Nev., that is so rocky and remote that it took
about four hours for rescue crews from the base, as well as the
Bureau of Land Management and the Energy Department, to discover
the wreckage and recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first crash of an Air Force Pave Hawk helicopter
since 1995, when one from Osan Air Base in South Korea crashed,
killing five people. The Pave Hawk has been in operation since
1982.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite swift announcements of $20,000 payments to relatives of
those killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the specter of
protracted lawsuits and massive settlements loomed over the airline
Friday, as families began grappling with complex legal questions
and seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   A top aviation lawyer in New York said his ``telephone had been
ringing all day.'' Others said that, based on recent awards in
cases against airlines and manufacturers, the families of the
victims could easily expect a settlement of more than $1 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a far more impressive number than even the
Korean airlines case,'' said Aaron J. Broder, referring to the 1983
downing of Flight 007 after it strayed into Soviet airspace,
killing 269 people. Broder recently won a $19 million settlement
for the wife of a victim of Pan Am 103, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts interviewed interpreted the $20,000
compensation _ billed as a ``good-will gesture'' _ as an early ploy
to prevent further legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not done with any strings attached, and it sounds like
it is not, then I think it's really a nice gesture,'' said Jim
Burnett, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``It probably has some benefits to Swissair. But I'm not
going to be critical of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families can choose the court in which they sue, and
because they prefer courts that will favor their claim, they tend
to end up in the United States, preferably in an urban center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite plainly, we are trying to make a choice based on where
we think we'll get the most favorable results,'' said David
Rapoport, an aviation trial attorney in Chicago. He expects
families in the Swissair crash to file suit in the Southern
District in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have set such precedents for rewarding huge amounts to
victims' families that there is little chance these families will
not proceed in court, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport said the majority of awards are below $5 million. But
they are almost never lower than $200,000, and in some cases have
reached $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Warsaw Convention, airlines are limited to awards of
$75,000 per victim. But two years ago, Swissair, along with all of
the US carriers, waived that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a statement by Swissair acknowledged that the company
was prepared to pay damages. ``In concrete terms, Swissair will
compensate relatives of the victims for losses suffered in the
accident,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the damages are based on individual calculations,
particularly projections of what wages the victim would have
earned, the total cannot yet be determined, it continued.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing, which owns the original MD-11
manufacturing company, McDonnell Douglas, also declined to
speculate about specific damage amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course liability is an unavoidable consequence in
situations like this,'' Russ Young said. ``But particularly this
early on, our concerns are not about legal issues. They're about
technical issues, and understanding what happened, and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not discuss a final settlement until the cause of
the crash has been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, however, showed less restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Because it took about 15 minutes after smoke was reported on
board for the plane to tumble into the sea off the jagged Nova
Scotia coast, some attorneys predicted great rewards for the
``pre-impact terror'' of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, a jury in US District Court in New York awarded $10,000
to the family of a man who was aware of his impending doom for a
much shorter period, about 30 seconds, before he died, Broder said.
</P>
<P>
   By that calculation, ``there will be a greater allowance of
damages here,'' in the Swissair crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the cases will soon be resolved. Lawsuits
resulting from two recent disasters, the crash of ValuJet in 1995
and of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, are still crawling through the
courts. The case of Korean Airline Flight 007 dragged on for more
than a decade.

WAITING FOR JONAH
</HEADLINE>

By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; This is a story about a boy named Jonah.
</P>
<P>
   Manny and Damaris Munoz have been waiting for him for a long
time _ eight years, give or take a few days. They expected to see
him on Aug. 27. But the day came and went, and still, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Manny had Damaris' bag packed for three weeks before doctors
decided to induce labor.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't leaving anything to chance, because they considered
this their last chance to have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   They had yearned for one for so long. But they agreed, Damaris'
body already had gone through too much agony to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Her first three pregnancies were ectopic, a painful, dangerous
condition that occurs when the fertilized egg lodges in the
fallopian tube instead of implanting in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   She underwent three surgeries to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Still determined to have a child, they took out a loan, put
their car up as collateral, borrowed from family, used up their
savings and stopped taking vacations to pay for in vitro
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   They spent $25,000 to conceive Jonah. He would have to be their
final try.
</P>
<P>
   Manny, and Damaris, who goes by Dee, met when they were 14 in a
church called Fuente de Vida in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It means fountain of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned around in the pew, real seriously, stuck out his
hand and shook mine,'' Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   They became friends and started dating when they graduated high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always says I'm the one who made him come out of his
shell,'' Dee says.
</P>
<P>
   They married at 22 with a big, traditional wedding attended by
250 friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters and brothers who
feasted on fajitas, carnitas and frijoles.
</P>
<P>
   Now both 33, they have a wonderful marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts me on a pedestal,'' Dee says.
</P>
<P>
   Dee smiles when she talks about Manny. He's !ital!such!off! a
romantic, she says.
</P>
<P>
   He put her name on his license plate. He's written her dozens of
love letters and poems. One is in a frame on their mantle.
</P>
<P>
   !ital!If I was a great lover, I would make passionate love to
you day and night, but since I'm not, I will always love you by day
and hold you by night ...
</P>
<P>
   If I was a famous person, I would give you fame and glory, but
since I'm not, respect and honor is all you'll have ...
</P>
<P>
   If I was determined to gain power, I would show you my
accomplishments, but since I'm not, I will always share with you my
dreams ...!off!
</P>
<P>
   Their shared dream was building a family.
</P>
<P>
   They both grew up in large families _ a blessing, they say.
Every Sunday, several generations gather for dinner. On Christmas
Eve, a crinkled sea of wrapping paper covers the floor. The phone
is always ringing with a relative passing along family news: who's
getting married, who's having a birthday party (it seems there are
one of those every week), who's pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family like this, you don't need to be invited,'' Manny
said. ``They just show up at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee is one of eight siblings, who have 11 children among them.
Manny has three siblings; two of them have a child, and the third
is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Dee, a day-care teacher, helped in the delivery room when two of
her sisters gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   She and Manny, who does computer-assisted drafting for a
pharmaceutical equipment firm, love children, and they couldn't
wait to have their own. They discussed having six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a baby is an extension of our love,'' Manny said. ``We
couldn't imagine getting old without any kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Dee and Manny decided they'd better get started. Manny
joked that he needed to start stocking up on pampers and baby food.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Dee woke up with cramps so bad she fainted. Manny
rushed her to the hospital. The doctor said she was pregnant, but
she wasn't going to have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   The embryo had ruptured one of her fallopian tubes, which are
only about as thin as the tip of a pencil, causing life-threatening
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Dee underwent emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deathly scared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors reassured the couple that Dee still could get
pregnant, even though her tubes were damaged _ first from scar
tissue, then from surgery. Doctors still aren't sure why Dee's
fallopian tubes were scarred, but it could have been caused by an
infection she had years earlier, an infection she may not even have
known about.
</P>
<P>
   She recovered and began taking a fertility drug. Ten months
later, she again had cramps and bleeding. They went to the
hospital, where a doctor told the couple the words they wanted to
hear: ``Mrs. Munoz, you are pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he told them to wait while he did some tests. The doctor
came back and told them this pregnancy also was ectopic and would
require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up and you get married with the idea of having a
family, then somewhere along the line you realize you are an
unlucky couple that wants to and is not able to,'' Manny said.
</P>
<P>
   They finally turned to in vitro fertilization, a procedure in
which a doctor removes eggs from a woman and sperm from the man and
joins them in a solution outside of the woman's body. The resulting
embryo then is placed back into the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first ``test-tube'' baby was born in England on July
25, 1978, more than 45,000 babies have been born in the United
States as a result of in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the procedure, Dee injected herself daily with drugs
to stimulate ovulation. After thousands of dollars and several
attempts at implanting the fertilized eggs, Dee became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   And in a few weeks, the unthinkable happened. The fertilized egg
had traveled back up into her fallopian tube, resulting in a third
ectopic pregnancy, a third surgery and a third broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, she lost twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That of all people, this should happen to her makes you feel
so helpless,'' said Dr. Victor Zakari, Dee's
obstetrician-gynecologist. ``Sometimes it gives you a guilty
feeling, even if there is nothing you could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, they got a call from the fertility clinic
asking what they wanted to do with the remaining frozen eggs. Manny
wanted to ask Dee to try again, but he thought she would get upset.
He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dee wanted to try one final time. This time, she underwent a
tubal ligation to lessen the chance of another ectopic pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   She conceived, and the baby was firmly planted in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   They gave this baby a name: Jonah Isaiah Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the pregnancy normal, her vital signs normal, her
blood tests normal, her weight gain normal, Dee was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not going to believe it until I'm holding the baby
in my arms that I'm really a mom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manny couldn't contain his excitement. Just three months into
the pregnancy, he wanted her to start wearing pregnancy clothes.
Dee rolled her eyes at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait, honey,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, in a few months, the baby started to show. As the
months wore on, her belly didn't look like that airbrushed tummy
Demi Moore showed off on the cover of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   A long, red scar cuts a swath across her lower abdomen, the
reminder of four surgeries. Her husband thought she was just as
beautiful as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different attractiveness, but I think it looks
great,'' he says, holding her hand as she lay on an examination
table during one of her final visits to the ob-gyn's office. ``She
has my baby in there.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the sonogram told them she was carrying a boy, they
readied the baby's room with wallpaper of babies dressed in teddy
bear suits. She carefully arranged the baby clothes, furnishings
and other baby essentials received as shower gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Their excitement was contagious. When the Learning Channel asked
to film Jonah's birth for an upcoming weekly documentary called ``A
Baby Story,'' featuring 60 couples' experiences with pregnancy and
childbirth, they knew they had to share their difficult journey to
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of people of reproductive age, or about 6.1
million Americans, are infertile, according to statistics from the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The documentary, set to
be shown toward the end of the year, would be their way of
inspiring others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we see it, it's a miracle,'' Manny said. ``If it
wasn't for medical science, we couldn't have had a baby ... We feel
there's a lot of couples going through the same thing as us, and we
wanted to share with them. We feel if you keep trying, keep hoping,
you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors told Dee they would induce labor on Monday or
Tuesday, her choice. She chose Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a baby stays in the womb past the due date, the
greater the chances are of complications as the placenta
deteriorates and the amniotic fluids decrease. Anyway, her feet
were swollen, and lying down had gotten as uncomfortable as
standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of their 6 a.m. arrival at Providence Saint
Joseph Medical Center, nurses hooked Dee up to monitors and an IV
and administered the first dosages of the drugs that would cause
the contractions to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Manny, wearing a hat that said ``New Dad,'' held her hand. The
camera crew from the Learning Channel conducted interviews with the
medical staff. And the family began to assemble, ready for the long
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah's heartbeat was broadcast from a speaker on the monitor, a
rapid, rhythmic thump that was the most prominent sound in the
room. But with every contraction came a message from Jonah _ a drop
in his heart rate, a sign he might have problems during labor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zakari took no chances. Jonah would have to arrive by
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a billion-dollar baby,'' Zakari said. ``We want
everything to go smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee started to cry. Manny looked like he might, too, as they
rolled her down the hallway to prep her for surgery. In a half
hour, it would be over, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The family waited nervously in the waiting room. How many
minutes had passed?
</P>
<P>
   Then Manny turned the corner, pushing an incubator where little
scrunched-up, red-faced, adorable Jonah, weighing 7 pounds 10
ounces, lay wrapped in swaddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we dreamed about and prayed about and then it's
finally here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They took the baby to the neonatal nursery. The family pressed
up against the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Es perfecto.'' ``He looks good, huh?'' ``He's not even
wrinkled.'' ``He has Manny's nose.'' ``Es milagroso,'' miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Manny turned and gave them a thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my boy!'' he shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The excited father had given relatives copies of a book he
wrote, titled, simply, ``Jonah: Our Miracle Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jonah can read, he'll get one, too. He'll know then how
very much his parents wanted him, how much they went through to
bring him into this world.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could see his mother on his day of birth, at that
moment when nurses lay him on her chest.
</P>
<P>
   She was still groggy, so she didn't say much. Her smile said it
all.

A ROSIE OUTLOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first coup was Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Then she switched the set around to capture Barbra Streisand's
good side.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' are real stories about
real people.
</P>
<P>
   The third season of the hit daytime talk show starts at 3 p.m.
today on KNBC (Channel 4), and O'Donnell is looking for ways to
ward off celebrity saturation.
</P>
<P>
   With numerous talk shows being added to television, and plenty
of entertainment magazine shows on top of that, there are
practically more openings for star power than there are stars with
interesting stories. The result is more duplication than at Kinko's
on a busy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are really, really sick of celebrities,''
O'Donnell said. ``I can point to 14 different outlets for them.
Someone in our office figured out that it would take 230
celebrities a week to fill all the spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie hasn't totally forgotten how star power got her where she
is. If Tom wants to come back, she'll keep the seat warm. Same goes
for Babs and many others. Rest assured, there is no ban on movie
and TV stars, just a de-emphasis. Now more space will be kept open
for ordinary people who do extraordinary things _ from people who
make awesome chili cheese fries to real-life heroes. She will
expand do-it-yourself segments, such as ``Crafts Corner''; add a
segment for children to speak up, called ``Kids Chat''; and talk to
the experts for advice on child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   This, incidentally, sounds a lot like the strategy for
Roseanne's new talk show, which will debut next week. Rosie said
she had no idea what her friend had planned, but a high-level
person inside Roseanne's show characterized the shifts in Rosie's
format to be inspired by fear of the new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of want to make it fresh,'' O'Donnell said. ``The
audience embraced me out of the box because they felt it was
something new. It had a retro feel. It was the Merv Griffin and
Mike Douglas of the '90s. The success has challenged me to do
something that will be exciting and new for the audience as well.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's success has spawned a gaggle of happy talkers trying
to tap into her audience. The grinning siblings will return with a
new ``Donnie &AMP; Marie'' in the afternoons. Howie Mandel continues
with his silliness. Ricki Lake tried to soften her act, and even
Oprah tinkered with her format after Rosie made it big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the one who thought this up,'' O'Donnell said. ``Merv
and Mike didn't even think it up. They stole it from Steve Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those big names in talk-show history were O'Donnell's role
models. She used to watch daytime shows with her grandmother,
munching on a bucket of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   What struck O'Donnell then was how the hosts seemed to be good
friends with all of their guests. That inspiration has led to a
freewheeling talk show unconstrained by the conventional format.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards have been the top awards in the business.
</P>
<P>
   She has won the Emmy Award for best talk-show host for the past
two years, and her program is the reigning best-show Emmy winner.
She also won this year's Women in Radio and Television's Gracie
Allen Award for outstanding talk show and outstanding talk-show
host.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all too many talk shows where setups and punch lines are
conceived backstage, O'Donnell only wants directions from the
pre-interviews her producers conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``One celebrity guest told them he liked caviar and eggs, and
they wanted me to pull some out from under the desk,'' O'Donnell
said. ``I was like, `What am I, Kreskin?'''
</P>
<P>
   One of O'Donnell's favorite moments was an interview with Harvey
Keitel, who never does pre-interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pre-interview set up for the story and it was
like, `Oh my God where are we going?''' she said. ``He ended up
telling a story about shoes, and it was delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've been watching, you have been allowed into some unique
television. Madonna taught yoga, George Clooney competed in a
hamburger-eating contest, Hillary Rodham Clinton worked the Crafts
Corner with three 6-year-olds making a hand-print collage, and you
saw many angles of Tom Cruise's smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some big celebrities I never thought I would get,'' she
said. ``I never assumed Barbra Streisand would do a talk show. I've
interviewed everyone I've ever wanted to get. Now we are going to
look at how we can make it different.''

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Lynch has a thought about the global market meltdowns that
have been a consuming nightmare for many investors over the last
year. ``The world,'' he said last week, ``will be OK.'' Next topic,
please.
</P>
<P>
   Such a blithe dismissal of the woes of the world is a vintage
response from Lynch, the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan
fund who is widely viewed as one of the greatest stock-pickers on
the planet. And he has long maintained that if investors spend five
minutes a year trying to figure out the direction of the stock
market, that's about four and a half too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the headlines from 1990,'' he said in an interview,
proceeding to quote from a list of articles about the real estate
bust and America's competitive and banking woes. ``The year after
that,'' Lynch noted, ``the market went up 31 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So how does that add anything, responding to headlines?'' he
asked. ``These headlines are just noise. If you're going to be a
factual investor, and you say, `In my industry, I make widgets, and
in every recession since World War II, my demand has gone down
quickly, and I notice it quickly,' well, that's information. And if
you think a major recession's coming, then maybe you ought to sell
some of your stock funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Investing based on fact rather than feeling is not a new theme
for Lynch, but it's one that he is emphasizing again in a new
Fidelity advertising campaign in which he stars with the
entertainer Lily Tomlin. The message, a favorite of Lynch's, is
that individuals should spend at least as much time researching
their investments _ without wasting time trying to gauge the
overall direction of the economy _ as they do for a new-car
purchase or a vacation. And that they should ignore the predictions
of economists and market strategists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1953 to 1984, a period of 31 years, the stock market went
up 920 points,'' Lynch said. ``On Mondays, it was down 1,565. So on
non-Mondays, it was up 2,500 points. It wasn't a coincidence that
the big decline in 1987, last October and this week was on a
Monday. People on the weekend become economists. They become
portfolio strategists. But they don't look at their portfolios;
they're reading the newspapers. They're responding to all these
scary stories. After that, they're bold if they take their lunch to
work on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch reserves some special scorn for the dismal science. ``I'm
opposed to economic forecasts,'' he said, ``these people who say,
`The average economic recovery has been 6.8 years; therefore, we
have to have a recession.' I've read the Constitution. I've read
the Bill of Rights. I didn't see anywhere that every 6.8 years we
have to have a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits are what drive stock prices, Lynch said. And
as long as a company's earnings are rising, its stock will go up.
Sometimes, however, the market gets ahead of overall earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the corporate profits of the S&AMP;P 500 were up less
than 10 percent. The market was up 33 percent,'' he said. ``In the
first half of this year, the market was up 18 percent, but
corporate profits were down in the first half. I think most people
expect corporate profits to be up 5 to 7 percent this year. There's
an unbelievable correlation between corporate profits and stock
prices, but the lines started to separate.''
</P>
<P>
   What also matters, Lynch said, is the valuation of a company
compared with its earnings, and in that regard, there still are
some great imbalances in the stock market. ``Over the last three
years and eight months, the S&AMP;P is up 132 percent, while the
Russell 2000 is up 32 percent,'' he said. ``These are mind-boggling
divergences. Their earnings have both grown the same. It's not like
you've had huge disappointments in the Russell 2000. If their
earnings had fallen 40 percent, you could understand this
bifurcation. But the Russell 2000 is a lot of different companies.
</P>
<P>
   To Lynch, all that creates opportunities in small stocks. ``At
one point, Wal-Mart was not in the S&AMP;P 500,'' he noted. ``At one
point, Cisco wasn't there. Great stocks are usually small companies
or companies that really get slogged and they turn around. Masco
went up 500-fold, then it got in the S&AMP;P 500, and it hasn't been
that great a stock since then. Great stocks usually are really
small companies, or companies that are really depressed, as when
Lockheed was $4 a share, or Long Island Lighting fell to $3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, big companies don't have big moves,'' he added.
``Small- and medium-sized companies have the big moves. Look at the
great rollovers of all time. Polaroid was one of the biggest stocks
in the market at one time. Xerox was one of the biggest, then it
went down for the next 15 years. IBM went sideways for 15 years.
Avon Products went from 180 to 18. It's hard when every fourth
person in America was an Avon lady. Where were they going to go
with it? Size is not a positive. At some point, if you become 90
percent of the carpet industry, you're going to grow with the
carpet industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch confesses that he is primarily a stock investor, with 90
percent of his investment assets in equities. ``But I had 20
percent of my fund in bonds in '81 and '82,'' he said. ``Since
1926, there have been 20 down calendar years in the stock market.
In 18 of those 20 years, you'd have had a positive total return in
intermediate bonds. Not just better, you'd have been up. So there
really is a reason to own bonds.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite swift announcements of $20,000 payments to relatives of
those killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the specter of
protracted lawsuits and massive settlements loomed over the airline
Friday, as families began grappling with complex legal questions
and seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   A top aviation lawyer in New York said his ``telephone had been
ringing all day.'' Others said that, based on recent awards in
cases against airlines and manufacturers, the families of the
victims could easily expect a settlement of more than $1 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a far more impressive number than even the
Korean airlines case,'' said Aaron J. Broder, referring to the 1983
downing of Flight 007 after it strayed into Soviet airspace,
killing 269 people. Broder recently won a $19 million settlement
for the wife of a victim of Pan Am 103, which exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts interviewed interpreted the $20,000
compensation _ billed as a ``good-will gesture'' _ as an early ploy
to prevent further legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not done with any strings attached, and it sounds like
it is not, then I think it's really a nice gesture,'' said Jim
Burnett, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``It probably has some benefits to Swissair. But I'm not
going to be critical of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families can choose the court in which they sue, and
because they prefer courts that will favor their claim, they tend
to end up in the United States, preferably in an urban center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite plainly, we are trying to make a choice based on where
we think we'll get the most favorable results,'' said David
Rapoport, an aviation trial attorney in Chicago. He expects
families in the Swissair crash to file suit in the Southern
District in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have set such precedents for rewarding huge amounts to
victims' families that there is little chance these families will
not proceed in court, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport said the majority of awards are below $5 million. But
they are almost never lower than $200,000, and in some cases have
reached $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Warsaw Convention, airlines are limited to awards of
$75,000 per victim. But two years ago, Swissair, along with all of
the US carriers, waived that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a statement by Swissair acknowledged that the company
was prepared to pay damages. ``In concrete terms, Swissair will
compensate relatives of the victims for losses suffered in the
accident,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the damages are based on individual calculations,
particularly projections of what wages the victim would have
earned, the total cannot yet be determined, it continued.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing, which owns the original MD-11
manufacturing company, McDonnell Douglas, also declined to
speculate about specific damage amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course liability is an unavoidable consequence in
situations like this,'' Russ Young said. ``But particularly this
early on, our concerns are not about legal issues. They're about
technical issues, and understanding what happened, and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not discuss a final settlement until the cause of
the crash has been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, however, showed less restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Because it took about 15 minutes after smoke was reported on
board for the plane to tumble into the sea off the jagged Nova
Scotia coast, some attorneys predicted great rewards for the
``pre-impact terror'' of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, a jury in US District Court in New York awarded $10,000
to the family of a man who was aware of his impending doom for a
much shorter period, about 30 seconds, before he died, Broder said.
</P>
<P>
   By that calculation, ``there will be a greater allowance of
damages here,'' in the Swissair crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the cases will soon be resolved. Lawsuits
resulting from two recent disasters, the crash of ValuJet in 1995
and of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, are still crawling through the
courts. The case of Korean Airline Flight 007 dragged on for more
than a decade.

A MATTER OF BASEBALL INTEGRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ed Wiley's night was made before the game even
started.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was, in the company of his 3-year-old son, Mitchell,
attending his first Cardinals game ever. It would have been too
much to ask for anything else, and you know very well what I'm
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   But the next thing he knew, Mark McGwire was drilling a vicious
line drive that was clearly going to be a home run. ``I put my hand
up to shield the sun,'' recalled Wiley, who was standing about 10
feet fair and 12 rows up in the left-field upper deck. ``And then
I'm watching it and I'm thinking, `That's coming right at me!'''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Wiley was very happy that some nice person had
pointed out the fact that he had left Mitchell's glove on the
counter at the Cardinals' gift shop a few hours earlier, because
there was absolutely no way he could have fielded this scorcher of
a liner barehanded.
</P>
<P>
   But he did. Now he has a precious souvenir. Was it No. 60? No.
It happened to be No. 7 in a 17-swing batting practice. It was
enough to make the journey from Louisville worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I will treasure forever,'' said Wiley, who had
blown off work in order to plug into the traveling carnival known
as ``The Mark McGwire Show'' as the Cardinal strongman, who entered
last night's game with 59 homers, sought to eclipse Roger Maris's
37-year-old record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   Never has there been so much interest in batting practice. It is
no exaggeration to say that the entire Cincinnati Reds squad
watched every one of those 17 swings. And never has there been such
September interest in a game featuring a team 20 1/2 games out of
first place going up against a team 23 games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   It is an Event within an event, so big that it was deemed
necessary for Major League Baseball to assume control of the media
credentials. In a normal circumstance, there would be somewhere
between 20 and 50 people here covering the game. As long as Mark
McGwire is in pursuit of the record, there will be upward of 700
media people in attendance. It is bigger than big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything like it since I've been around,'' said
Rich Levin, the former UCLA basketball player and longtime
sportswriter who has worked for every baseball commissioner since
1985. ``It is similar to the (Cal) Ripken thing, but there we knew
exactly when it would happen (that Ripken would break Lou Gehrig's
record of 2,130 consecutive games). This is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparations have been in discussion since the All-Star
Game, when Levin contacted the Cardinals to ask if they might want
some help in September and they answered quite emphatically in the
affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   We have now arrived at the point where it is no longer a case of
``if'' for either McGwire or Sammy Sosa (who had banged out No. 57
before the Cardinals even took the field) but ``when'' each will
eclipse the record. If the Big Manager In The Sky has any sense of
history, he will arrange it so that both men are sitting on 60 when
Sosa and the Cubs arrive here for a two-game series Monday. Or
maybe give McGwire 61 and Sosa 60. That would be OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding pregame issue was propriety. Would the Reds pitch
to McGwire? This was the only team in the National League that had
managed to hold McGwire homerless this season, in part because it
was the team that had thrown him the fewest hittable pitches. In 25
plate appearances against the Reds, McGwire had been walked 11
times, five intentionally and six unintentionally, or at least
semi-intentionally. This spicy data has made crusty Cincinnati
skipper Jack McKeon Public Enemy No. 1 here in McGwireland.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa opted for the
high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Reds know if they'll pitch to him,'' La Russa said
before the game. ``I really believe, based on the box scores I saw
from Wrigley Field (in the Reds-Cubs series) _ Sosa had 12 at-bats
in three games _ that they will. I feel they will compete with him.
But let me say this: I don't mind writers second-guessing my
strategies but I don't do that with other teams. I can't profess to
get into their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, by all accounts, loves being the contrarian. ``He
wouldn't mind being the villain,'' said one Cincinnati observer.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if McKeon has the chutzpah to
repeat one maneuver he executed this season _ namely, walking
McGwire with the bases empty.
</P>
<P>
   One intrepid scribe brought the issue up to the Reds mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember the circumstance?'' he fired back. ``Twelfth
inning. Tie game. Two out, nobody on. A dangerous man who can beat
you with one swing and who won't be stealing second if you put him
on. That was the situation, and yes, I'd do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was in the middle of the summer. Now it's over. The
Reds have already been mathematically eliminated from playoff
contention. The Cardinals' big goal is to finish over .500. Would
there be any defense for McKeon intentionally walking McGwire in,
say, the ninth inning with the score tied, two out, and nobody on?
Is that necessary to protect the integrity of the game? On such
existential questions does baseball often turn.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say that no one man is bigger than the game
in the abstract, but in this case, that is simply not true. I
wouldn't be here if Mark McGwire weren't on the verge of breaking
the Maris record, and neither would 650 other scribes. The
Cardinals wouldn't be drawing sellout crowds for the remainder of
the season if not for Mark McGwire. For that matter, Jack McKeon
wouldn't be doing pregame press conferences as the skipper of a
team 23 games out if it weren't for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   For it to have any meaning, McGwire must break the record in a
proper game played with integrity. We all agree to that. But Ed
Wiley didn't drive his son here from Louisville to watch Mark
McGwire get walked intentionally with no one on base. If anyone is
going to be bigger than the game, let it be Mark McGwire, not Jack
McKeon.

CANADIAN SUB SEARCHES FOR FLIGHT RECORDERS OF DOOMED JUMBO JET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ An aging Canadian submarine Friday
prowled the ocean crash site of Swissair Flight 111 for flight-data
recorders that may yield clues as to what downed the jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Government search officials said the 200-foot, black-hulled HMCS
Okanogan initially picked up no sign of the recorder, which if
functioning properly would emit a signal that could be detected by
the submarine's sonar.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. and Canadian officials have expressed doubt that
terrorism played a role in the crash late Wednesday that killed all
229 people aboard, the issue was brought back to investigators'
minds by word that one of the victims was a member of the Saudi
royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyebrows went up,'' said a Canadian aviation source.
</P>
<P>
   The search for wreckage moved into its second day as relatives
of some of the 229 victims arrived in Halifax to attempt to
identify remains. Investigators said family members will not be
allowed, at least initially, to visit the temporary morgue set up
at a nearby Canadian military base but will be interviewed about
passengers' clothing and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for keeping the families away is that most of the
remains are gory fragments. Although Canadian authorities have
approached the issue delicately, Philippe Bruggiser, chief
executive of Swissair's parent company, said tearfully in
Switzerland: ``The condition of the bodies is such that the biggest
body part is (the size of) a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives were allowed to visit near the crash site. Government
workers erected tents on the rocky shore at Peggy's Cove to shield
the families from the mercurial weather and massed news media. The
picturesque point, with its much-photographed lighthouse, is about
seven miles from where the MD-11, bound from New York to Geneva,
went down in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first family members to arrive was a man whom
officials identified as a relative of victim Prince Bandar ibn Saud
ibn Abdel Rahman. Agence France Presse said the 42-year-old prince
was a Saudi businessman and that his presence on the plane was
confirmed by a Saudi aeronautics source. AFP said the prince was en
route to Geneva because his father was hospitalized in the Swiss
city.
</P>
<P>
   About 175 relatives of victims were flown to Halifax from New
York, and another 80 from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another air incident, a Royal Airlines charter flight from
Toronto to Glasgow, Scotland, made an unscheduled landing in
Labrador on Friday following the pilot's report that an oil warning
light in the cockpit began to blink after the Boeing 757 began its
trans-Atlantic crossing. The jumbo jet, with 225 people aboard,
made it back safely to the Canadian Forces Base near Goose Bay,
about 600 miles north of Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the submarine Okanogan during the night signaled
that the Canadian government had given up any hope of finding
Swissair survivors, a step the Zurich-based company had taken more
than 12 hours earlier in declaring that all aboard _ 215
passengers, 14 crewmembers _ had perished.
</P>
<P>
   The search for remains and debris continued at sea, where 12
government boats sailed slowly through a circular area with an
increasing perimeter, and on land, where 100 infantrymen combed a
15-mile stretch of shoreline where tides were expected to wash up
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 pieces of luggage, apparently from the plane's cargo
hold, were found Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After run-ins with some small boats in the search area,
investigators warned souvenir-hunters to keep out of the area or
risk being charged with obstruction of justice and having their
vessels seized.
</P>
<P>
   Although leaders of the crash inquiry knew victims' families
would want answers, government aviation specialists said few were
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board must work on the facts,'' said Benoit Bouchard,
chairman of Canada's Transport Safety Board. ``I will admit that so
far there's very scarce information. ... It's a question of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably not going to be quick,'' said a Canadian
aviation source. ``People are probably not going to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in the Atlantic off Long
Island, N.Y., it took a week to find the recorders that monitor
cockpit conversation and flight-instrument data. The recorders are
housed in waterproof containers, often called ``black boxes, that
are buried in the tail of commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In the TWA crash, the recorders were found by a remotely
controlled underwater camera in 104-feet of water. The Swissair
flight went down in water that is up to 150 feet with an ocean
floor that varies between rock, shale and gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenging bottom,'' said Lieutenant Commander D.K.
Agnew of the Canadian navy.
</P>
<P>
   Before being called out on the emergency assignment, the
submarine, only one of three in the Canadian navy, was due to be
decommissioned Friday, after a final sail-past in Halifax Harbor.
One of the nation's subs had already been taken out of service and
the other is being retrofitted as a training vessel for a new class
of submarines that have yet to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   A navy source said other ``submersibles,'' including a minisub,
could be called in but probably would not be until the Okanogan had
covered the prime search sight.
</P>
<P>
   As the search continued, second-guessing began, with some
aviation specialists questioning why Flight 111 had not been
directed to attempt an emergency landing at Yarmouth, which is on
the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. The Swissair pilot had wanted
to return to Boston, but air-traffic controllers in Moncton, New
Brunswick, said Halifax was closer, and emergency preparations were
made at the provincial capital's airport.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian aviation specialist said that Yarmouth may not have
been considered because although the runway would have been long
enough, emergency equipment, available at Halifax, was not on hand
at Yarmouth.
</P>
<P>
   On the safety front, Bruggiser said Swissair had made the
cockpit wiring changes requested in MD-11s by the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration two years ago. Without the changes, the FAA
said, the jumbo jets were subject to fires. The Swissair pilot
reported smoke in the cockpit before the crash.

 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ America's children, some as young as 7, are aware
that President Clinton was unfaithful to his wife, but they seem
less interested in the sexual details of the White House scandal
than the moral shortcomings of a man who would deceive and hurt his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and Monica Lewinsky had a thing even though he
was married to somebody else,'' said Chloe Carrano, who is about to
begin third grade in Hastings-on-Hudson. ``First he stood up and
said it wasn't true. But Monica Lewinsky was always near him, and
his wife saw them hugging and stuff. That was the wrong thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lynch, an 11-year-old in the Bronx, also thought Clinton
had lost moral authority. ``He's lying to people who love him and
trust him,'' the boy said. ``That's no president to me. He should
be ashamed of himself for teaching kids bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chloe's and Keith's observations came in the days before Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., stepped forward boldly to declare that
the president's conduct ``sends a message of what is acceptable
behavior'' to the children of America.
</P>
<P>
   The children's comments, and those of many more, from 8 to 18,
in well-to-do suburbs, inner-city neighborhoods, Bible Belt
communities and bastions of liberal thinking, seem to confirm
Lieberman's concern that a president cannot lie to and betray his
family and then claim these are private, not public, acts.
</P>
<P>
   Older children used different vocabulary but made the same
point. ``Why would you go around having fun with other women when
your wife's home cooking?'' asked Tyrone Strother, 15, at a Bronx
community center. Tyrone labeled the president a ``player,'' street
slang for a man who cheats on his wife, and also a ``professional
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to lie school, not law school,'' the teen-ager said.
</P>
<P>
   In a simpler time, before sex was a staple on television and
before adultery was acknowledged in family life, children were
sheltered from such matters. ``At these kids' age I couldn't have
defined oral sex,'' said Steve Collums, the principal of Briarcrest
Christian School in Memphis, Tenn. ``Now I think that it is more
likely they can't define chastity, because they are so surrounded
by all of this wherever they turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Such nostalgia is not limited by religion or region. Dr. Michael
Shannon, a pediatrician and father of two in Brookline, Mass.,
echoed the lament. ``Children are bombarded with adult concepts,''
he said. ``It's really bad for kids and very disturbing to
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, like Shannon and his wife, Elaine, spin the radio
dial to avoid X-rated news broadcasts. Others are like Margie Pena,
who runs a community center in Houston and uses developments in the
scandal to teach her 10 children and grandchildren about morals,
decision-making and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had like round-table discussions,'' Ms. Pena said,
citing provocative topics like fidelity, humility and machismo.
``We have to try to explain to our children that we are human, that
people make mistakes, that everyone has to take responsibility,
that eventually things can catch up to you. These are hard lessons
that we don't talk about enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents take a middle ground. ``I waver between turning off
the TV and explaining it in a watered-down way,'' said Allan
Harris, a high school math teacher, who was watching his
10-year-old daughter Rollerblade at a rink in Larchmont. ``I've
said to her: What if I kissed another woman? How would Mommy
feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Parents like these, many of them the swing voters who put
Clinton in office, inspired Lieberman's speech by telling him of
their struggle to explain current events to their children.
Lieberman said his constituents, already undermined by the sexual
content of movies and music, did not know how to answer the
youngsters' ``intimate and frequently unseemly'' questions or
whether to let them watch the ``sad and sordid'' spectacle on the
evening news.
</P>
<P>
   For months, parents have been braced for questions about the
specific sexual acts between the president and Ms. Lewinsky. But
children rarely walk this treacherous ground.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the wasted worry was the following scene in a
household in Greenwich, Conn., early in the chain of events, when
pundits were parsing which acts the president considered sex and
which he did not. Drew Colbert, 13, went home one day demanding
clarification from his mother, Catherine Clinton, a Civil War
historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really need to talk to you about this because there's
something I don't understand,'' the boy said. His mother paled and
stammered, she said, sure that euphemisms would no longer satisfy
him. Then came Drew's question. ``What is it when someone suborns
someone?'' the boy wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has produced moments worthy of Art Linkletter's
television show ``Kids Say the Darndest Things.''
</P>
<P>
   One 7-year-old told her father that Clinton should be forced to
``fire all his servants and bring his wife breakfast in bed for a
week.'' One 9-year-old said that he had no idea what DNA was but
was sure, without testing, that Ms. Lewinsky's dress was stained
with Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream. One 7-year-old boy guessed that oral
sex was ``when you talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But childish misunderstandings and adolescents' guffawing were
the exception in schools and community centers, which were filled
with words of wisdom, like the quotation by James Madison in a
Memphis social studies classroom: ``If men were angels no
government would be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The children seem to take these moral messages to heart.
</P>
<P>
   The younger ones, more often than not, pointed to the lies the
president told. Cory Hinojosa, a Houston 7-year-old, gets a
time-out if he does not tell the truth, and he thinks a similar
sanction is in order for Clinton. ``They should give a punishment
like not to be president the rest of the year,'' Cory said.
</P>
<P>
   The older ones question Clinton's decision-making. Kenneth
Meltin, a Houston 15-year-old, said it was ``inadvisable'' for the
president to have delivered a television address attacking the
special prosecutor, when he was tired after giving hours of grand
jury testimony. Robyn Beavers, a 17-year-old from the suburbs of
Boston, wondered if stress had led to the ``frantic'' decision to
bomb terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Children of all ages identified with the suffering of Hillary
Rodham Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, many having experienced
the wound of infidelity in their own families.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Ellis, a Memphis 17-year-old, said her father had had
an affair when she was a toddler and her parents had divorced.
Caroline guessed that Chelsea and her mother were riding ``an
emotional roller coaster.'' The president, in her opinion, was
``emotionally abusive.'' As she spoke, the girl fiddled with a
green macrame bracelet marked with the letters WWJD, which stands
for ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Prosper, a 14-year-old Bronx boy, said that his father
``played'' his mother many years ago, deserting the family and
sending them cascading into poverty and homelessness. If he were
Clinton's wife, Kenny said, ``I'd slap him silly.'' If he were the
president's daughter, ``I'd tell my mom to leave him, forget about
him. And I'd never think about him as an influence again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny and his mother, Naomi, a home health aide, have discussed
the Clinton family in the context of their own. That opportunity
for personal reflection is the lone benefit of the scandal, several
psychologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tubor, director of the clinical psychology doctoral
program at the City University of New York, cited photographs of
the Clinton family headed for their Martha's Vineyard vacation,
with Chelsea walking between her mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``That body language speaks to a lot of kids who think it's up
to them to repair things that go on with their parents,'' Tubor
said. ``It is a good opportunity to point out that Chelsea is
surviving, doing well in school, has her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such teaching moments are especially rich with teen-agers, said
Jill Schehr, a school psychologist and the mother of 17-year-old
twins. ``If you try to speak to a kid about an area in their life,
they shut down and say, `OK, Mom, OK,''' she said. ``But you can
talk about Clinton as a symbol. It's in this other zone, like
theater, and that distance lets you bring it into their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are fascinated by a powerful man who is
simultaneously charming, intelligent and crippled by
self-destructive behavior. ``That can have a lot of power in the
adolescent population, because they are in the process of bringing
together the different parts of their identity,'' Ms. Schehr said.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws of this president, so familiar to the young, dominated
conversation one recent afternoon in the courtyard at the Point, a
community development agency in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   First the children spoke of infidelity. ``He dissed his wife by
being a player,'' said Keith Lynch. ``What if he didn't have a
condom on? He could have got AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Ortiz, 12, focused on sorrow rather than disease. His
14-year-old brother betrays his girlfriends by carrying on with
more than one at a time. ``When they find out, they cry so much,''
Nick said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the subject turned to deceit. Keith bet that the president
was not so different from him. ``I lie when I'm trying to get out
of a whooping,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick quickly saw the flaw in that reasoning, for a sixth-grader
or a commander in chief. ``Once they find out you lied,'' the
12-year-old said, ``you just get a worse whooping.''

ANALYSTS WARN OF DANGERS TO BRAZIL'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With Brazil's stock market in a nose
dive and the central bank spending $1 billion a day to defend the
currency, economists warned that despite the strengths of Brazil's
economy, investor panic could plunge the region into decline.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's market fell by 5.8 percent Friday, following a decline
of 8.61 percent on Thursday, its second-worst in history,
triggered, in part, by a downgrading of Brazilian bonds and notes
by Moody's Investor service. The markets were not soothed by a
televised appeal by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Thursday
night for a ``national pact for fiscal adjustment'' or by criticism
of the Moody's assessment by Brazilian officials.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, stocks plunged further Friday as a low-ranking
U.S. Treasury official called the Brazilian currency ``unarguably
overvalued.'' The Treasury later disavowed the comments as a
personal opinion not reflecting the department's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worldwide have been fleeing emerging markets, and
Brazil has been caught in the crosscurrents. In the month of August
alone, Brazilian equities fell 40 percent, with similar losses in
stock exchanges around the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's current account deficit hovers at nearly 4 percent of
gross domestic product. The country's failure to cut government
operating expenses, particularly civil service costs, has put the
country in a difficult position as credit tightens for emerging
markets around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Citing these structural weaknesses, Moody's downgraded its
rating of Brazilian bonds and notes to B2 from B1 and the ceiling
for foreign currency bank deposits to Caa1. It also downgraded
three Brazilian banks to C from C plus.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Malan, in Washington for a
meeting of Latin finance ministers with the International Monetary
Fund that ended Friday, lashed out at Moody's analysts, saying they
were compensating for earlier optimistic ratings in Asia by turning
more cautious toward Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, said that many
of the problems faced by Brazil and Latin countries derived from
panic elsewhere in the world rather than lack of will to take tough
economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   But with markets throughout the region plummeting, Camdessus
acknowledged that the situation for Latin America was
``dangerous.'' He said that ``a degree of panic'' among investors
had led to ``an excessive and unfortunate pressure'' on many
countries in Latin America. ``It's true that if this persists a
number of countries will have to tighten their policies,''
Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday night, Cardoso, who is favored to win
re-election Oct. 4, did not announce any new initiatives. His talk
restated his government's commitment to Civil Service, social
security and tax reforms that stalled during his first term. ``We
have to continue a program of fiscal adjustment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly $58 billion reported in foreign reserves, Brazil
has substantial resources to stabilize its currency. Under Cardoso,
the country has made headway toward market-oriented reforms,
privatizing state industries and slaying chronic hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the central bank has been spending an average of
$1.3 billion a day since Sept. 1 to protect the Brazilian currency,
the real, while Friday's O Globo newspaper reported international
reserves had fallen $15.8 billion since August 1. A spokesman for
the central bank, usually forthcoming with information, would not
confirm the figures or provide others.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malan has ruled out a devaluation, but Brazilians are buying
dollars to cover themselves. The difference between the official
and informal rates of exchange has been widening, with exchange
houses offering 1.27 reais against the dollar, compared with an
official rate of 1.17 reais. Traditionally, the difference has run
about two or three cents.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mercosur, the customs union joining Brazil with Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina's exports to Brazil quadrupled, and
now represent more than 25 percent of its export business. With
Argentina's peso pegged to dollar reserves, a devaluation in Brazil
would send instant tremors through Buenos Aires. ``Safely and
securely, they would be in a deep crisis,'' said Alexandre Barros,
a Brasilia-based political consultant .
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Leme, economic research director of emerging markets at
Goldman, Sachs, argues that industrial nations must come up with
solutions, like a lowering of U.S. interest rates, replenishing the
International Monetary Fund's bailout capacity and restoring
stability to Japan, to help emerging markets. ``These are not
isolated viral cases, but an epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian firms are carrying a foreign debt of $108.5 billion,
up from $37.3 billion three years ago. Some $11 billion will come
due before next July, and if international lenders decline to renew
the loans, the companies will turn to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   One emerging-markets specialist, who requested anonymity, said
that while investment analysts pick over the differences between
developing markets, investors these days act on the similarities.
Underpinning the rage for emerging markets were assumptions _ that
currencies do not devalue, that countries do not default _ that
have been shattered with Russia's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real contagion is not something I'm worried about, it's
the financial contagion,'' the analyst said. ``Everybody agrees
that if the Hong Kong peg were to go, the attack on Brazil would be
relentless, until there were no international reserves left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because there's a real connection between the
economies,'' he added. ``It has everything to do with perceptions,
and the psychosis of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for that reason, a letter to the editor of The Wall
Street Journal from the lower-level Treasury Department official
was quickly disavowed. The official, Britta Hillstrom, wrote that
while ``Brazil's real is unarguably overvalued, a destructive
devaluation is not the only solution,'' and said the country could
move the exchange rate band. A spokeswoman for the Treasury
Department said those ``were absolutely not the views of the
Treasury Department.''

GREENSPAN WORRIES THAT GLOBAL CRISES COULD THREATEN U.S. ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER with RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
signaled Friday that the central bank is now less concerned about
inflation as a threat to the U.S. economy but is increasingly wary
that the spreading global financial crisis could harm the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments at the University of California at Berkeley
came just minutes before Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin met here
with Japan's new finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to hammer home
the message that the best hope of halting the international crisis
lies in quick action by Tokyo to stimulate its economy and shore up
its financial system.
</P>
<P>
   But with market volatility having spread to Latin America and
with Russia veering toward economic collapse, U.S. officials said
they feared that it would be increasingly difficult to contain the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a week in which Wall Street experienced a sharp
sell off, Greenspan said that even the United States was
increasingly vulnerable. ``It is just not credible that the United
States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that
is experiencing greatly increased stress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan stopped well short of suggesting that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates, a step being urged on him by a
growing chorus of economists and officials in other countries. An
interest-rate reduction in the United States would help reduce
borrowing costs around the world and could be a powerful
psychological boost to embattled investors at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's comments were a marked departure from his last
major policy statement, in July, when he told Congress that the
risks of inflation outweighed the possibility that the global
financial turmoil could push the otherwise strong U.S. economy into
recession. And in explaining the change in his speech on Friday,
Greenspan seemed to open the door to consideration of an interest
rate cut if the global financial situation continues to deteriorate
or if the U.S. economy shows signs of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The global turmoil that has robbed countries of prosperity and
growth has benefited the United States so far by helping to dampen
inflation and slow down an economy that was at risk of overheating,
Greenspan said in his speech Friday night. The downward pressure on
inflation is likely to intensify as the turmoil in other nations
mounts, a development that he said led Federal Reserve
policy-makers to rethink their strategy at their last meeting on
Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring and early summer, the Federal Open Market
Committee was concerned that a rise in inflation was the primary
threat to the continued expansion of the economy,'' Greenspan said.
``By the time of the committee's August meeting, the risks had
become balanced, and the committee will need to consider carefully
the potential ramifications of ongoing developments since that
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who always leaves himself an out when he makes public
pronouncements, went on to indicate that the central bank will not
rush into a decision about reducing rates just because of the sharp
fall in stock prices this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have relearned in recent weeks that just as a bull stock
market feels unending and secure as an economy and stock market
move forward, so it can feel when markets contract that recovery is
inconceivable,'' he said. ``Both, of course, are wrong. But because
of the difficulty imagining a turnabout when such emotions take
hold, periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was to join Rubin after his speech in meeting with
Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in Moscow, President Clinton termed Friday's
meeting with Miyazawa, who served as Japan's prime minister for two
years until a surprise fracturing of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party in 1993, as ``profoundly important.'' That statement
reflected a growing view in the administration that the best hope
of choking off the 14-month old Asian crisis is to bring about a
long-overdue turnaround in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury officials winced at Clinton's characterization
because they fear that Japan is still weeks or months away from
decisive action, at a time that markets are fraying around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   All the early indications from Tokyo were that Miyazawa was
arriving in San Francisco with few new ideas, no new plans and only
vague promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting was never designed or intended to address the
question of a plan,'' Rubin said Friday on a flight to San
Francisco. ``We'll be extremely interested in Miyazawa's discussion
of the banking system and fiscal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Rubin and his aides were seeking to play down
expectations was their fear that the world's jittery markets could
react badly to news of little progress from the meeting. But it is
also in part because Rubin and Summers have relatively little
leverage: Their explicit criticisms of Japan in recent months have
created a backlash in Tokyo, and the Japanese Parliament is
spinning its wheels as the ruling and opposition parties argue with
each other over what to do about the insolvency of some of the
world's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will propose anything new,'' a senior
Japanese official said before the meeting. ``It is just that for
the first time we have a finance minister who can explain what our
government is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The official was referring to Miyazawa's greatest attribute as
an international diplomat: He speaks fluent English, learned during
extensive travels in the United States before World War II, and for
half a century he has been cast into crisis situations and
negotiations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, he has relatively little to work with. Japan's
Parliament has been talking for months about passing legislation
that would address the country's deepening banking crisis. But the
debate has just begun, and it has been bogged down by the question
of whether billions of dollars in public funds should be used to
bail out banks that were so wildly mismanaged that they now have
upwards of a trillion dollars in bad loans on their books.
</P>
<P>
   The test case is how the government deals with the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, or LTCB, one of the country's largest
financial institutions. There is movement in Tokyo toward steps
that would essentially nationalize the bank, using taxpayer dollars
to rebuild its capital. U.S. officials clearly fear, however, that
Japan is not ready to accept the pain of closing the weakest
institutions _ and will further delay resolving the bad debts that
are freezing the Japanese economy.

AT HOME WITH L.A. OPERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like the Chicago Bulls or the latest Hollywood
blockbuster, professional opera relies heavily on a handful of
marquee players to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti. Domingo. Ramey. Fleming. Bartoli. These are the
Michael Jordans and Meryl Streeps of the opera world, and their
brand-name presence often can mean the difference between
box-office failure or success.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent decades a number of U.S. opera companies have
recognized that it takes more than a superstar in a clown suit or
horned helmet to create a consistently strong repertory ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   While most companies aren't above chasing high-priced free
agents, several &UR;  &LR; of them, including L.A. Opera, have been quietly
buttressing their ranks with up-and-coming home-grown talent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when the 12-year-old L.A. Opera opens its new season,
two graduates of its Resident Artist program, both closing in on
major international careers, will be making prominent homecoming
trips to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Bass-baritone Richard Bernstein, a University of Southern
California grad, will play the macho toreador Escamillo in Bizet's
effusive ``Carmen,'' opposite Placido Domingo as the lovesick
soldier Don Jose and Jennifer Larmore, making her highly
anticipated on-stage role debut, as the headstrong femme fatale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here on the stage of the L.A. Opera,'' says
Bernstein, 32, looking every inch the Latin Lothario in a black
shirt, black striped trousers and rakish goatee. Later this year,
he'll be returning to the Metropolitan Opera to play the title role
in ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' He'll also be the lead in Rossini's
``Semiramide'' at the Teatro Regio in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I began, this is where my roots are, this is
where I hope to sing for the rest of my career,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow ex-Trojan Paula Rasmussen also has been associated with
L.A. Opera for a decade while expanding her career to Paris;
Glyndebourne, England; and New York. In Massenet's ``Werther,''
which opens Wednesday, she'll be co-starring as Charlotte, the
young woman who obsesses Goethe's doomed Romantic hero, played by
Mexican tenor sensation Ramon Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bernstein, Rasmussen regards L.A. Opera as her artistic
family of origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going back to your parents' home,'' says the
California-born mezzo-soprano, familiar to local audiences as
Cherubino in ``The Marriage of Figaro'' and Minerva in ``The Return
of Ulysses.'' ``You've gone and seen the world and you want to
share that news. But you're still the baby. You could sell a
million CDs, but you're still the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this season, Greg Fedderly, another resident artist
alumni, will return to his alma mater as the wide-eyed suitor
Alfredo in Verdi's ``La Traviata.'' Last season, L.A. Opera
regulars got to see him in two hefty roles, as Rodolpho in ``La
Boheme'' and Tamino in ``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two women _ soprano Catherine Ireland and
mezzo-soprano Megan Dey-Toth _ have been added to the current crop
of resident artists, making a total of five. (The men are tenor
Charles Castronovo, baritone Malcolm MacKenzie and bass-baritone
Jamie Offenbach.) All will be seen frequently at the Dorothy
Chandler this season.
</P>
<P>
   For L.A. Opera's administrators, these reunions are gratifying
occasions. Besides helping young singers hone their careers, the
resident artist program has enabled a relatively young company to
acquire the patina, if not quite the polish, of older international
companies. By grafting top-drawer talent like Domingo and Larmore
onto a local ensemble, L.A. Opera has steadily increased its number
of performances, to 55 this season (up 10 from last year), and its
subscription base (up 2,000 from last year).
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of numbers help Peter Hemmings sleep better at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my colleagues go `shopping,''' says Hemmings, L.A.
Opera's dry-witted, London-born general director. ``They go on
trips to Europe and around the country.'' Hemmings says he finds it
``much more rewarding'' to recruit and nurture emerging talent,
particularly when it springs from native soil.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, launching a professional singing career in Los
Angeles was akin to launching a professional water polo career in
Death Valley. Locals like Carol Vaness, Marilyn Horne and the late
Arleen Auger all had to escape to New York and Europe to further
their ambitions. At the time, there was no professional opera
company closer than San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time in the '60s and '70s in Germany when 30
percent of the singers were American,'' says Hemmings. ``And many
of those singers came back with their voices in tatters and their
careers in ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   Following in the path of New York City's Metropolitan Opera, the
San Francisco Opera and a handful of older programs, L.A. Opera set
up its resident artist program in the late 1980s. Its purpose was
to give young singers a chance to earn a steady paycheck while
building up their repertory of roles.
</P>
<P>
   While the two-year program constitutes an apprenticeship of
sorts, it's hardly for novices. Selection is highly competitive,
and those chosen arrive bearing strong credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hahn, L.A. Opera's artistic administrator and former
head of the San Francisco Opera Center, describes the salaries as
``extremely competitive'' with those of comparable programs, which
typically run anywhere between $20,000 and $30,000 per season.
</P>
<P>
   While under contract, from mid-August to mid-June, resident
artists take master classes, understudy leading roles and are
assigned substantial parts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They also absorb plenty of avuncular advice, solicited and
otherwise, from Hemmings and his staff. Pace yourself. Don't try to
do too much too soon or you'll burn out. Save those five-hour
Wagnerian roles for midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   Though the West Coast still lacks an established musical
conservatory on a par with the Juilliard in New York, it does have
several respected university vocal programs at USC, UC Santa
Barbara and CSUN. These have become fertile recruiting grounds for
L.A. Opera talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to hear, between us, most of what's going on,''
Hemmings says. ``I think we haven't missed many real talents. Then
you see someone who turns up at the Met auditions and you say,
`Where the hell have they been?'!''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn says it's still not always easy persuading young singers
there's culture west of the Hudson River. But L.A.'s growing
cultural wealth has made the city a more attractive option for
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad fact that many singers in New York are often out of
work because the competition is so high,'' he says. ``Singers may
look askance at L.A., but once they get here they don't often
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen, who was born in Sacramento and grew up on the
Monterey Peninsula, appreciated having a safe L.A. harbor after
finishing college, rather than diving straight into the shark tank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of people tell me in semi-bitter tones that I
had it made,'' she says. ``Most of my friends in that position
don't sing very much anymore or sing infrequently. You can really
get beat up in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, resident artists say, it's a boon simply working around
world-class mentors. Bernstein remembers one of his first opening
nights, when he had to perform a big aria, how Domingo took him
into a dressing room and played piano while coaching Bernstein
through the score.
</P>
<P>
   Dey-Toth, who joined the program last month after spotting an ad
in a music trade publication, says she'll ``never be intimidated by
singing in a large theater'' after working in the cavernous Dorothy
Chandler. She's even getting paid enough to send extra money back
to her husband, a teaching assistant in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the most I've ever made,'' says the UC Santa Barbara
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Even failure is easier to absorb, as it was for Bernstein in his
first major role, filling in as a last-minute substitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very good, and the (newspapers) said so,'' he
remembers. ``I was terrified. I was 23 years old. But I went out
and performed it and I think that gave them some confidence in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for its investment, says Hahn, the singers ``down the
line will always have a `special relationship'' with the company,
in the way that England has a `special relationship' with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly that means is a bit hard to define. But within the
opera world, it seems, you can go home again.
</P>
<P>
   Says Rasmussen: ``I guess no matter how great your successes or
failures are outside this environment, you have people here who
feel a little bit more invested in your career because they had
something to do with it.''

`COSTELLO' TAKES ITS SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Sue Costello is blond, thin and a ball of energy.
But she's nothing like Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costello'' is the new sitcom loosely based on her life, living
and working in South Boston, but any comparisons to ``Good Will
Hunting'' would be like comparing ``Seinfeld'' to ``Serpico''
because they both took place in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She has her private conversations in the men's room, but can
never be confused with Fonzie of ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Her job is at a bar in Beantown. However, ``Cheers'' this is
not.
</P>
<P>
   This is Sue Murphy's (Costello) world and it is unlike any
you've seen on network television. Costello and ``Costello'' are
unique, all right _ maybe too unique for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   The show is often loud and shrill, and the language at times is
coarser than it is funny.
</P>
<P>
   The Southie (that's what they call locals of places like
Dorchester _ pronounced DAWchister _ in Massachusetts) works at a
pub called the Bulldog. She dumps her studly but dim-witted
boyfriend and shocks everyone by going to college.
</P>
<P>
   Sue's mother, Lottie (Jenny O'Hara), is a deeply religious woman
and dutiful wife who can't understand why her offspring would dump
such an eligible bachelor. After all he just got a job as a transit
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Spud (Dan Lauria), is a hard-working man. Her
brother is a lazy malingerer who would fake an injury to get on
worker's comp and have more drinking time.
</P>
<P>
   The executive producer of the project is Cheryl Holliday, who
was a bigwig at ``King of the Hill.'' There is no doubt that she
has the skills to put together a quality show depicting characters
who aren't from New York or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   South Boston is home to hard-hat-wearing, beer-swilling, former
high school hockey fans who are honest and gritty. That being the
reality, ``Costello'' is certainly genuine.
</P>
<P>
   It is the type of show in which people fall off bar stools and
fistfights are not a shocker.
</P>
<P>
   Still this show needs some work. Once Costello calms down, finds
the volume switch on her character, the sitcom may be able to
benefit from the gift of a ``King of the Hill'' lead-in.

A SONG FOR GRANDPARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who sneaked you a cookie when Mom said no? Who
bought that bike that Dad said was too expensive? Who cuddled and
coddled you when you needed it?
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents!
</P>
<P>
   To honor them on National Grandparents Day _ by presidential
proclamation, the first Sunday after Labor Day _ Symphony in the
Glen and a chorus of Los Angeles-area children will perform a
special song at Sunday's concert just for Grandma and Grandpa.
</P>
<P>
   And, since it's an all-Mozart event, ``The Grandparents Song''
is sung to the tune of one of Mozart's most famous arias, !ital!La
ci darem la mano!off! from ``Don Giovanni.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestra conductor and Emmy-winning composer Arthur B.
Rubinstein, a Hollywood Hills resident who penned the lyrics to the
commemorative tune, said he inherited his musical aptitude from his
grandfather and wanted to honor grandparents everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Orchestra manager) Barbara Ferris and I were sitting and
talking about it and I started singing, `Let's sing a song for
Grandma.' Barbara said, `What is that?' I said, `I'm not sure,' but
I kept working on it. The Mozart melody just seemed perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he had completed a lyric singing the praises of
grandparents' patience, wisdom and love, all valuable commodities
elders pass along to their grandchildren, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The song dubs Grandma ``the one we turn to when everything goes
wrong ... When she's away, I seem to get in trouble ... She'll kiss
away your tears.'' And Grandpa is ``the one we count on when no one
else will do. He knows all there is to know and teaches it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Grandparents Day Council has proclaimed
Rubinstein's composition its official song.
</P>
<P>
   A group of kids from a Montessori school in Glendale and others
who volunteered to join the chorus after a July 5 concert in the
park have been learning the lyrics from an audiotape Rubinstein
made. The kids rehearsed together for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song has a sweet simplicity,'' Rubinstein said. ``And kids
are very smart and they pick up on things like this very quickly.
So I think the concert's going to be wonderful, divine madness.''
</P>
<P>
   A special guest at Sunday's concert will be Jessica McQuade, 10,
the granddaughter of Marian McQuade of West Virginia, who persuaded
President Carter in 1978 to proclaim a special day to honor
grandparents. Jessica will sing with the local chorus of 9- to
13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour concert _ the third of four conducted this summer
by the nonprofit Symphony in the Glen _ begins at 3 p.m. in
Griffith Park. Admission and parking are free, but concertgoers are
asked to bring a canned food donation for the hungry families of
Los Angeles, to be distributed by the Salvation Army. The concert
area is a short walk up a little hill behind the park's
merry-go-round at 4800 Crystal Springs Drive; shuttle buses also
will be provided.
</P>
<P>
   From 1:30 to 2:30 p.m., before the concert, there'll be free
kids' activities, including music-related coloring books, KUSC
Classical Kids Micester Singers and Rubinstein's junior maestro
class, where kids can learn how to conduct an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth year for Symphony in the Glen, which is
supported by private and corporate donations and grants. The
group's final concert this year will be an Oct. 25 performance of
``Peter and the Wolf.''

   BC-POLITICAL-BRIEFS-NYT (moved on Thursday, August 14)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, August
14, misstated the involvement of the League of Conservation Voters
in the Idaho Congressional campaign of Dan Williams. While the
league has hired a full-time political consultant to promote Mr.
Williams's candidacy and plans to spend $200,000 to promote his
campaign, those actions are not directly connected to the Williams
campaign. Under Federal law, the league must work independently,
without coordination or contact with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   BC-BRODY-HEALTH-NYT (moved on Monday, August 17)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, August 17,
about unfounded health scares referred incompletely to Government
action on Alar, a chemical once used to make apples ripen
uniformly. In May 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency
announced steps to prohibit the use of Alar on apples and other
foods, but allowed the chemical to stay on the market for at least
15 months. In the announcement, the agency said the chemical might
pose an unacceptable risk of cancer in humans. Before the ban could
take effect, the chemical's maker, Uniroyal, voluntarily removed it
from the market. It is no longer used on food in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The article also omitted a description of the finances of the
American Council on Science and Health, which has criticized the
furor over Alar. It is a nonprofit organization that receives 60
percent of its financing from private foundations, individual
contributions and sales. The rest of its support comes from
corporations, including food manufacturers. This year Uniroyal
contributed $10,000, which is slightly more than one-half of 1
percent of the council's $1.6 million budget.

 &HT;    Bush, Brown inactive, leaving safety thin
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons must de-activate eight players for Sunday's
game at Carolina, four by the NFL's Friday deadline. The early
inactives are S Devin Bush, who hasn't recovered after spraining
his knee on Aug. 14 at Detroit, rookie S Omar Brown, rookie RB Ken
Oxendine and LB Ben Talley.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Brown and Bush, who will be the primary backup
safety when he returns to health, leaves just three active safeties
_ free safety Eugene Robinson, strong safety William White and
Chris Bayne, who has worked almost exclusively at strong safety in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think (Bush) needs another week,'' coach Dan Reeves
said. ``He's close, but I just think it's smart when you count on
someone that much that you don't put him out there until he's
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   CB Randy Fuller or Ronnie Bradford, the nickel safety, could
play back there if needed. Fuller is still a possible inactive
player with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four remaining inactives will be No. 3 quarterback
Tony Graziani. Under NFL rules, the No. 3 quarterback dresses out.
If he plays before the start of the fourth quarter, however, the
first two quarterbacks cannot re-enter the game under any
circumstances. The No. 3 quarterback can play in the fourth
quarter, though, and the first two QBs can be re-inserted if
coaches decide to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Byron's back
</P>
<P>
   Second-year running back Byron Hanspard was at practice Friday
morning, one week after suffering a season-ending knee injury.
Hanspard tore the anterior cruciate ligament and the patella tendon
in his left knee while being tackled on a 22-yard TD run last
Friday against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard faces a long rehabilitation, with the patella tendon
injury considered very serious. Team doctor Andrew Bishop said
there have been only a handful of instances in NFL history where a
player tore both the ACL and the patella tendon at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard was on crutches, wearing a brace from the top of his
left thigh to his ankle. His right knee was wrapped, too, because
doctors had to take part of the patella tendon in his left knee in
order to repair his shredded ACL in the left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons and Panthers will play on a new playing field at
Ericsson Stadium. ... Carolina tight end Wesley Walls, 32, is the
only offensive starter for the Panthers over 27. ... Former
first-round draft pick Tshimanga Biakabutuka had 104 yards against
the Falcons in the Panthers' victory in Charlotte last year, but he
remains under heavy scrutiny. In the preseason, he rushed 28 times
for 36 yards, 25 of them in the final preseason game. Fred Lane
will start at running back.

 &HT;    McLaughlin makes mark, wins Dura-Lube 200 pole
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister

<TEXT>
<P>
   Darlington, S.C. _ Mike McLaughlin has been coming to Darlington
Raceway for five years without fanfare, but all that changed Friday
when he won the pole for today's Busch Grand National Dura-Lube
200.
</P>
<P>
   In putting his Chevrolet up front with a speed of 164.661 mph,
McLaughlin became only the second Busch driver to start inside the
front row .
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin finished second here a year ago behind Winston Cup
regular Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car felt so good on the first lap that I was able to drive
it even harder on the second lap,'' McLaughlin said. ``We actually
picked up (speed) on the second lap, which a lot of people aren't
able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler was second fastest in 164.562 mph and Buckshot
Jones was just a tick slower in third at 164.551 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably one of the best laps I've had around here,''
said Jones, who is fifth among Busch Grand National series leaders.
``Being able to start that close to the front makes a big
difference. We've been successful testing here and the car has
gotten a lot better in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Series points leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified 34th and will
start on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Split up
</P>
<P>
   Randy Lajoie will not return in 1999 as driver of the No. 74
BACE Motorsports Monte Carlo. Lajoie joined the team in 1996 after
Johnny Benson moved to the Winston Cup cirucit in 1966. With Lajoie
behind the wheel, the team claimed two series championships, 11
victories, 33 top fives and 51 top 10 finishes. The team is fourth
in the points standings. Lajoie told owner Bill Baumgardner he
wants to explore other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler to the Woods
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler and the Wood Brothers made it official Friday.
Sadler will be in the Winston Cup No. 21 Citgo Ford Taurus in 1999.
The 23-year-old Virginian replaces Michael Waltrip. ``A tremendous
opportunity for me,'' Sadler said. ``And being with the Wood
Brothers can only jump start my transition into Winston Cup
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Minding the boss
</P>
<P>
   Prior to starting his qualifying lap for Sunday's Pepsi Southern
400, rookie Steve Park asked his boss, Dale Earnhardt, if he had
any advice. ``Yeah,'' Earnhardt said. ``Just keep the car out of
the wall.''

 &HT;    Jarrett out to foil bonus bunch
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darlington, S.C. _ The way Dale Jarrett sees it, you have to run
on the edge somewhat to win the pole at this egg-shaped 1.366-mile
track.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what he did Friday, running a near-perfect lap of
168.879 mph to qualify to start on the inside of the front row in
Sunday's Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton threw a scare into the Jarrett camp, however, when
he ran the second-fastest lap, 168.677, to grab the outside pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down here testing a few weeks ago and felt like we had
something that could get the pole,'' said Jarrett, whose last pole
came 21 races ago at Las Vegas. ``But when Ward put up that speed
up there, I wasn't sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace was third fastest, 168.642 mph; John Andretti
fourth, 168.573; and Jeff Gordon rounded out the top five at
168.261 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett will be trying to spoil five drivers' chances for a
million-dollar bonus. Gordon, Mark Martin, Bobby Labonte, Mike
Skinner and Dale Earnhardt could grab the prize by following their
top-five finishes at the Brickyard 400, the most recent race in the
No Bull 5 bonus program, with a win here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our job here, to keep anybody from winning a million
dollars, and for us to win the Southern 500 trophy ... and give
ourselves a chance to win a million at Talladega (Oct. 11),''
Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin qualified 10th, the first time he's started outside the
top seven in the last seven races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could run faster,'' he said. ``I don't know for
sure, but I felt like we were having an engine problem. We'll
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 25 qualifiers Friday included 15 Fords, six Chevrolets
and four Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a surprise in the top 10, it had to be Bill Elliott
in seventh. It will be his best start in the last 10 events, and
only his second top 10 in the past 15 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track is always a little tough every time I come back
here,'' Elliott said. ``In the spring, we really messed up here and
had a bad run. Today, I just wanted so bad to get a good, decent
run.''

 &HT;    Progress in talks may avert AirTran walkouts
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AirTran Airlines and its flight attendant union reported
progress in contract talks Friday, boosting hopes that Labor Day
weekend walkouts against the carrier will be averted or at least
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides faced a midnight deadline, after which, if there
was no deal, the union would be free to begin a campaign of spot
walkouts aimed at disrupting the carrier's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it expects no disruptions even if the union
follows through on the threat, because it has hired replacement
workers and taken other steps to counteract random walkouts.
</P>

 &HT;    Progress in talks may avert AirTran walkouts
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AirTran Airlines and its flight attendant union reported
progress in contract talks Friday, boosting hopes that Labor Day
weekend walkouts against the carrier will be averted or at least
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides faced a midnight deadline, after which, if there
was no deal, the union would be free to begin a campaign of spot
walkouts aimed at disrupting the carrier's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it expects no disruptions even if the union
follows through on the threat, because it has hired replacement
workers and taken other steps to counteract random walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making some headway'' toward a contract agreement that
would end the threat of walkouts, union spokesman Jeff Zack said
late Friday.

 &HT;    Latest goal for A. Jones: youngest in 30-30 club
 &HT;    ByJack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ He is already the youngest 20-20 player in
major-league history. With 25 home runs and 23 stolen bases and
three weeks left in the regular season, can Andruw Jones join the
30-30 club?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' the Braves center fielder said. ``We've got
22 games left and right now I'm feeling good, hitting the ball
good. Bobby (Cox) has given me opportunities to steal bases. That's
why I'm putting up those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's opener of a four-game series with the Mets,
Jones was batting .462 in his last 11 games, with five homers, 13
RBIs and seven steals. When he homered in the ninth inning
Wednesday against Houston, he became the second-youngest Brave in
franchise history to hit 25 homers in a season, at the age of 21
years, four months. Eddie Mathews remains the youngest, having hit
his 25th homer on Sept. 27, 1952, 16 days shy of his 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jones, in his first season as a regular, could go 30-30. ``I
had 18 homers last year and I didn't play every day,'' he said.
``You get a chance to play every day, you got a chance to put up
some numbers. I didn't start well (4-for-40, then a .204 average in
the first month) but I stayed focused and got better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the significance of 30-30, ``It's good to hit 30 homers,
steal 30 bases,'' ``I did those things in the minors,'' said Jones,
who also leads the NL with 17 outfield assists and is tied for
second with eight triples. ``It's a different level now but if you
do it in the minor leagues, some people might say you can do it in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely, I would be proud (to reach 30-30). My family
would be proud of me. They are already proud of me, the way I'm
playing. They know the way things started at the beginning of the
season, (people saying), `Oh, he has to go to the minors, he has a
bad attitude.' I don't worry about those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I reach both (30-30), I'll be fine. If I don't, I'll be
fine. To come off a bad start and get to 30 homers, or 25 homers,
is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mending
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista, on the disabled list since Aug. 25 with a
partial tear of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee,
is getting healthier but isn't ready to play yet. ``It's still
hurting me a little bit,'' said Bautista, who constantly wears a
knee brace and isn't eligible to come off the DL until Wednesday.
``The doctor told me I've got to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista, who hasn't run yet, said he's two or three days away
from doing so. ``I'm going to try to run, hit a little bit,'' he
said. ``It really bothers me when I turn, twist. I'll wait a couple
of more days and see how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Helms is technically back on the Braves roster. In a paper
shuffle, the backup third baseman, recalled from Richmond Aug. 27
to replace Bautista, was optioned Monday to Class A Eugene to make
room for Curtis Pride on the roster. But Helms never reported
(Eugene's season ended Wednesday) and was recalled Thursday once
rosters were expanded for September. ... Andres Galarraga sat out
the second game of his three-game suspension Friday. ... Bobby Cox
began the weekend with 1,403 career wins, needing four to pass
Jimmy Dykes for 20th place on the all-time managerial list.

 &HT;    Tech, new-look Dogs hit the field
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After an offseason of optimism and an August of anticipation,
Georgia and Georgia Tech will write the first chapters of their
1998 college football seasons today. Both have reasons to be
excited.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, No. 19 Georgia will unveil a new batch of skilled
players as the Bulldogs host Kent at Sanford Stadium (5 p.m., Media
One pay-per-view). Georgia, which finished the 1997 season with a
10-2 record and a No. 10 national ranking, will be out to prove it
can be a contender in the rugged SEC East despite having to replace
the talented trio of quarterback Mike Bobo, running back Robert
Edwards and receiver Hines Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were great players, but we feel like we've got some
talented people who have been waiting for a chance,'' said Georgia
coach Jim Donnan, who begins his third season in Athens. ``We're
excited to see how they will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the debut of freshman quarterback Quincy Carter, who
has returned to college football after two years playing
professional baseball. Carter, a Parade All-American at Southwest
DeKalb in 1995, was chosen Wednesday as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia must break in a new quarterback, Georgia Tech will
put one of the ACC's best on the field when the Yellow Jackets host
Boston College today at 3:30 p.m. (WSB). In the last half of the
1997 season, junior Joe Hamilton played as well as any quarterback
in the country, a major reason why the Yellow Jackets went 7-5 and
won their first bowl game since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the maturity and the leadership Joe has shown since
last year. But we know he can get better and more importantly, he
knows he can get better,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``I've
got a lot of confidence about Joe's ability to lead a team.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Georgia Tech is going to make some noise in the ACC this
season, it must improve on a defense that finished last in the
conference, giving up 429 yards per game.

 &HT;    `Getting harder all the time to get to the quarterback'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons managed 55 sacks last year, second in the
NFL and tops in franchise history. Nine of those sacks came in two
games against Carolina, both Falcons losses. Right end Chuck Smith
is the leader of the Bomb Squad, as he calls it, dropping the
quarterback 12 times last year, sixth in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Falcons are to win at Carolina for the first time
after three losses, they will need a better pass rush than in the
last two preseason games, when they didn't manage one. In fact,
Falcons starters Smith, right tackle Shane Dronett, left tackle
Travis Hall and left end Lester Archambeau were shut out in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution asked Smith about rushing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Can you explain the lack of sacks in the preseason?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: It seems like everybody is changing their style, keeping
(backs) in (to block), running shorter routes, (quarterbacks)
taking shorter drops. It's getting harder all the time to get to
the quarter- back.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What can you do to adapt?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: The days of the pure speed rush are going to be gone
soon. That's why you need to develop inside moves, power moves. The
guy I go against, (Carolina tackle) Blake Brockermeyer, is
aggressive. He's got a pretty good punch (initial blow after the
snap), good balance _ he's good. You got to go hard and mix things
up. Blocking balls (at the line) is going to be huge nowadays.
That's why you see so many guys getting their hands up.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What can the defense do in general to adapt?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: (Defensive backs have) got to hold receivers up, so we
can get some extra time. And it's great to get teams down (on the
scoreboard) so they have to throw downfield and take a deeper
(quarterback) drop. We've got to blitz some, too, because offenses
have gotten more creative.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Any other disadvantages work against you?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: We can't flinch anymore (to draw offensive linemen
offsides). It seems like every little advantage we once had is
gone. Man, it's tough.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins seems slow-footed; is he
one of the easier quarterbacks to catch?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: I can't say that Kerry is easy to get to. Over the years,
we've gotten back thereand not gotten him. Last year, Kerry made a
great play to get away from me and run for a first down. I was
running as hard as I could, and I couldn't catch him. I won't say
he's Steve Young, but he does a pretty good job sometimes avoiding
the rush.

BASEBALL COLUMN: HACK WILSON'S LESSON REMAINS A VALID ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Va., N.Y., Md.)   (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he died, in Baltimore on Nov. 23, 1948, he was 48 years
old, penniless, an alcoholic. He was also one of baseball's great
players, who would later be voted into the Hall of Fame. This was
Hack Wilson, whose National League record of 56 home runs in one
season stood for 68 years, or until Mark McGwire drew even and
passed him with two homers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Wilson's salary was $33,000, the highest in the
National League. He was said to have made more than a quarter of a
million dollars in his 12-year major league career. Yet some of the
expenses for Wilson's funeral were paid after some men in the bars
he frequented passed the hat. The gray suit he wore in his coffin
was donated by the undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   A week before his death, Wilson said his life should serve for
youngsters as an example of which road not to travel. ``There are
many kids in and out of baseball who think that just because they
have some natural talent, they have the world by the tail,'' Wilson
said on a ``We the People'' radio program over the Columbia
Broadcasting System. ``It isn't so. In life you need many more
things besides talent. Things like good advice and common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks on that radio show were printed and are framed in a
prominent place on a wall in the Chicago Cubs' clubhouse at Wrigley
Field, as a reminder to the players of today just how far a star
may fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's heart-wrenching story, which has been replayed by many
other athletes through the years, right up to this very moment,
began when he was a young, oddly shaped sensation playing for the
Martinsburg, Va., Blue Sox in the minor leagues. While he also
played for the Giants, the Dodgers and the Phillies in the majors,
his best years were with the Cubs, from 1926 to 1931.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own idol was always Hack Wilson,'' the baseball team owner
Bill Veeck wrote in his book, ``The Hustler's Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Veeck added, ``Having said that, I now have to admit that if any
player of exceptional ability ever drank himself out of baseball
long before his time, it was my boyhood idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Robert Wilson _ he was called Hack because he was said to
resemble a champion wrestler of his day named George Hackenschmidt
_ was built like a beer keg, on two thin sticks: he stood 5 feet 6
inches, weighed 200 pounds, had an 18-inch neck, a powerful chest,
short arms, short legs and child-size 5{ feet. In batting practice,
he would pick up a handful of dirt and wipe the sides of his pants.
``By the time the game started,'' Veeck wrote, ``Hack would always
look as if had just delivered a ton of coal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his size, the power he generated was stupendous. He led
the majors in home runs four out of five years. And in 1930 he not
only hit those 56 homers, he also drove in 190 runs, a major league
record that hasn't been threatened in decades. Yet four years
later, he was out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the low point of his career came when, playing center
field for the Cubs in the 1929 World Series against Philadelphia,
he lost two fly balls in the sun in the seventh inning of Game 4.
The Cubs entered the inning with an 8-0 lead, and they left losing
by 10-8. Wilson came to the dugout after the inning with tears in
his eyes. But he rebounded for his remarkable 1930 season, in which
he also had a .356 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   That winter, Wilson recalled in his radio broadcast: ``I drank
more heavily than ever, and I argued with my manager'' _ Rogers
Hornsby _ ``and with my teammates. I spent most of that off season
in tap rooms and I was in terrible condition the next spring, 20
pounds overweight, and I had a terrible year. They were expecting
me to break Babe Ruth's record, but I hit only 13.''
</P>
<P>
   In his short career with the Dodgers, Wilson played for manager
Casey Stengel. In a game against the Phillies in the compact Baker
Bowl in Philadelphia, Stengel had come to the mound to remove
pitcher Walter (Boom Boom) Beck. Wilson was in right field, his
hands on his knees, his head down, exhausted from chasing baseballs
hit off Beck. It was hot, and maybe Wilson had been out late the
night before. Beck didn't want to leave the game, argued with
Stengel and then flung the baseball that hit the tin fence behind
Wilson. Startled, Wilson leaped into action, raced to the fence,
picked up the ball and made a perfect throw to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best play Hack made all year,'' Stengel said.
</P>
<P>
   And soon after, Hack Wilson was gone. His seasons in the sun
ended quicker than he had ever imagined.

THE FACES OF CLINTON: WEARY TO SOMBER TO VIBRANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ President Reagan's advisers were fond of
saying that people never remember the words of a president, only
the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, President Clinton this week offered a
kaleidoscope of images played out on his face and in his gestures,
from the pained confession of his ``profound regret'' about the
Lewinsky matter to his compassion for the victims of the Omagh
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He was alternately engaged and distracted, buoyant and mournful.
At times his eyes were locked in the thousand-yard stare of the
soldier who has seen too much combat. His interactions with Hillary
Rodham Clinton lurched from apparent affection to icy distance.
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming impression was of a man exhausted and in
distress who was able, when necessary, to put aside his private
pain and reclaim the brave face of the practiced performer.
</P>
<P>
   The week has taken a dizzying trajectory for the president, from
the end of a restless 10-day vacation with his family on Martha's
Vineyard to a therapeutic round of golf scheduled for Saturday
afternoon on the ancient links at Ballybunion in southwest Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, what a ride.
</P>
<P>
   A somber president stepped off Air Force One into a cold drizzle
in Moscow on Tuesday morning after a 10-hour overnight flight from
Washington. He had the red, puffy eyes of the overnight traveler as
he walked hand in hand with Mrs. Clinton down the steps of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   He met that morning at the Kremlin with Boris Yeltsin, but there
was none of the ``Bill and Boris'' jocularity of past meetings. The
aging, ailing Russian leader moved with the awkward gestures of an
invalid; Clinton appeared ashen, almost funereal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was little better that afternoon in a speech in a Moscow
university auditorium, a familiar kind of setting for him and one
that he usually plays to advantage. But his delivery was
uncharacteristically flat, perhaps compounded by an impassive
audience that did not once interrupt his remarks with applause.
</P>
<P>
   Aides explained that Clinton was tired. Besides, one said,
Russia's political paralysis ``does not lend itself to laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Yeltsin was the host at a state dinner in the
Kremlin, but this was not the customary vodka-drenched, hours-long
Russian affair. Neither Clinton nor Yeltsin was in the mood for
hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared attentive, Clinton's mind was on Wall
Street, which the day before had suffered a 512-point nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, chief White House economic adviser, whispered in
the president's ear that the market was bouncing back. Clinton
grinned and gave him the thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   The American side had signaled to the Russians that the
president had had a long day, and asked that the dinner be
abbreviated. Barely an hour after the party sat down to eat, the
dinner broke up, an hour ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At some times the president's demeanor matched his words. At
others, they were strangely out of sync. Twice on this trip Clinton
took questions from reporters. The first occasion was in a joint
press conference in the Kremlin with Yeltsin. Clinton knew he would
face questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the
fallout from his bitter admission of Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin spoke, Clinton scanned the faces of reporters,
looking for a sympathetic smile and trying to gauge the level of
aggressiveness. Two of the three questions the president took were
about the Lewinsky issue. He said he had made a mistake and asked
for forgiveness. But he did not look as if he expected to get it.
Cameras caught him at one point cradling his chin in his palms,
looking like a weary businessman whose flight home had just been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded questions about the Lewinsky matter again Friday
morning, at a photo opportunity with Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime
minister. Reporters clamored for a response to a damaging statement
on Thursday from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a longtime ally of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he deserved all the criticism he got and said for
the first time that he was ``sorry'' about the affair. But his
manner appeared anything but penitent.
</P>
<P>
   He was oddly relaxed, almost jovial as he again admitted error
and called his behavior ``indefensible.'' If one watched the
statement on television with the sound off, one might have guessed
that Clinton was discussing Mark McGwire's chase for the home-run
record.
</P>
<P>
   The best day of the trip for Clinton was Wednesday, as he took a
victory lap around Northern Ireland, encouraging work on the peace
agreement he helped broker and comforting the families of the
victims of the bomb attack in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Bill Clinton of the 1992 campaign, with perfect
emotional pitch in his remarks and a soothing arm for the bereaved.
As he walked down Market Street in Omagh, scene of the deadly
blast, he was caught wiping away a tear in a picture that dominated
the front pages of several Irish newspapers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's spirits were raised by the closeness throughout
the day of Tony Blair, Britain's charismatic prime minister, a
younger version of Clinton, without the baggage of scandal.
</P>

   Clinton wandered back into the press compartment of Air Force
One on Friday night on his way to Limerick and his date with
Ballybunion on Saturday. He was somber but at ease, said the
reporters who saw him. He said he had had a ``wonderful time'' in
Ireland, but ducked substantive questions about policy or scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He grew animated in discussing his golf date. He said he had
been gathering tips from professionals on how to play the course
and had been looking forward for weeks to the challenges of the
wind-whipped links on an outcropping above the sea. ``I'm going to
be glad to get through it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip and the two weeks before it have taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said the president before returning to his cabin.

   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ As grieving families from several
countries began to converge on this tiny fishing village Friday,
officials looking for the cause of the crash of Swissair Flight 111
on Wednesday said that it appears that the crew was in control of
the jet and making rational decisions about how to land until the
plane abruptly disappeared from radar.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Canadian investigator said that the MD-11 jet changed
course only once, when the pilot was told he was closer to Halifax
than Boston. About 58 nautical miles from the Halifax runway, the
pilot began to make wide circles and dump fuel as he descended, a
procedure essential for the jet to make the extraordinarily rapid
descent from 33,000 feet above sea level to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The very end of the plane's radar track, just before it
disappeared from controllers' screens, shows erratic movement.
Asked if this could indicate that the plane or the cockpit crew was
disabled, Gerden said that ``it is unclear as to accuracy of the
information provided by radar at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerden did not elaborate, but experts said although that the
erratic movement that showed up on the radar might indicated that
the plane had dropped dropped suddenly out of the sky, it is also
possible that a radio on board that responds to radar signals,
called a transponder, might have failed. In normal operation, the
transponder listens for a query from radar and responds with a
short signal that gives the plane's identity and altitude. The
radar system calculates the direction by noting which way the radar
was pointed when it heard the answer, and calculates the distance
from the interval between the question and the answer. But the
transponder could have been disabled by a fire, or it could have
been intentionally shut down by the crew, which may have been
flipping circuit breakers, hoping to eliminate an electrical fire.
</P>
<P>
   Without the transponder, the controllers would have to rely on
``primary radar,'' microwave energy bounced off the plane's
aluminum skin, but this is far less accurate. And aircrafts'
primary radar blips sometimes disappear into clutter, caused by
birds or other interference.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, added that the crew's
communication with air-traffic controllers was ``professional
throughout.'' He said that the crew twice indicated that it had a
serious problem with the plane, but crew members offered no details
except that there was smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   On several fronts Friday, the recovery and investigation
frustrated both officials and grieving families eager for answers.
In choppy waters and thick fog, searchers were able to locate
almost no large parts of the plane, though debris that they did
find from the sea and shoreline showed no signs of fire damage or
other obvious clues.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise and frustration of many investigators, a
submarine equipped with sophisticated sonar and other underwater
listening devices caught no whisper from the ``pingers'' attached
to the jet's black boxes _ the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder. As a result, investigators had little to go on
beyond radar tapes and the tapes of the conversations between the
crew and the ground. Investigators were still pouring over this
information on Friday and said they would release a transcript of
the conversations and a radar map on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But other aspects of the investigation began to move forward. In
New York, the FBI joined the Federal Aviation Administration in
examining cargo manifests for the flight to determine whether any
hazardous materials were on board, either declared or undeclared.
The flight did not carry any materials owned by the airline,
investigators said Friday. That is significant, officials said,
because in the crash of a Valuejet DC9 in Florida two years ago,
the cause of a fire on board turned out to be hazardous oxygen
generators in boxes labeled ``comat,'' meaning company materials.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials also said they were looking closely at six
directives they have issued since 1994 regarding flaws that might
cause smoke or fire on MD-11s. Those are among several orders
issued by the agency for planes under U.S. jurisdiction after
scattered instances of fire or smoke on that type of jet. The
Swissair jet was registered in Switzerland and was not subject to
U.S. orders, but officials said that most European airlines
routinely adopt the FAA directives.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a military base several miles to the northeast, medical
examiners also joined the investigation, performing toxicology
tests on the victims' remains that may indicate whether passengers
had inhaled smoke or other fumes before the crash. The medical
examiners, working in a makeshift morgue in an airplane hangar,
began a second painstaking day of identifying the bodies, which are
stored in five refrigerated trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But they said late Friday afternoon that they had not been able
to positively identify a single body yet. The examiners also said
they were working to try to identify the bodies primarily using
dental records and other medical information so that they could
spare the families from having to view the bodies, most of which
are not intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a simple problem of visually identifying 299
people, it would take at the most three days,'' said Dr. John Butt,
Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner. ``This is not that kind of
task,'' he said and added, ``I have a certain sensitivity and
reluctance to discuss this further.''
</P>
<P>
   As searchers and investigators settled in for what they said
would likely be weeks of work, the families of the victims began to
arrive to be nearer to the place where the jet went down. Officials
said they expected as many as 800 relatives and friends, many of
which arrived in Halifax Friday afternoon on Swissair flights from
New York and Geneva.

IN HOUSE THAT YIELDED BODIES, AN UNEXPECTED ONE IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Surprised law enforcement authorities
revealed Friday that they had identified a woman they did not
expect to find among the bodies investigators have unearthed from
the tumbledown green home of an unemployed school aide and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the body of a 34-year-old missing Westchester
County woman, the authorities said, raised new possibilities: that
Kendall Francois, the 27-year-old unemployed school aide, secreted
more corpses than the eight he had he had previously told police
were hidden in the basement and attic, or that one of the eight
women may be buried elsewhere or is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, police arrested Francois, charged him with strangling
a prostitute and said they believed he was responsible for the
murders of seven more women, most of them prostitutes. Some had
been missing for as long as two years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Dutchess County District Attorney William Grady said
that a total of six bodies had been taken out of the house and the
skeletal remains of two others had been located and would be taken
out of the house once all surrounding evidence is scanned. Of the
six, he said, four have been positively identified. But one of
those four, he said, was someone who police did not expect to find:
Audrey Pugliese, a 34-year-old woman with a record of three minor
arrests, none for prostitution, who moved to Poughkeepsie six
months ago after living most of her life in Westchester County. She
was last seen three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Pugliese, the three other women positively
identified are Catina Newmaster, 25; Catherine Marsh, 31, and Gina
Barone, 29. The other women who police have said were most likely
buried in the house are Wendy Meyers, 30; Kathleen Hurley, 47;
Michelle Eason, 27; Mary Healey Giaccone, 29, and Sandra Jean
French, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Grady said the possibility that a ninth victim might be hidden
in the house or in the overgrown backyard had spurred the police to
call for special radar-controlled detection equipment that can
pinpoint human remains through earth, wood and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Grady also responded for a second day to criticism that the
county's officials did not respond seriously enough to at least two
earlier attacks on prostitutes. He revealed for the first time that
Francois had been under suspicion for a few months before he was
arrested. But he said the two prostitutes who told police that he
had tried to strangle them did not do so in time or produce enough
``legally sufficient'' evidence to allow the authorities to procure
a search warrant for his house, which is at 99 Fulton Avenue _ a
block from Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers continued to search the house Friday, new
details emerged about Francois.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his former teachers at Arlington High School in La
Grange, outside the town of Poughkeepsie, remembered a curious,
diligent and affable young man.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tornatore, a shop teacher, remembered how in metalworking
class Francois worked at a lathe for months and meticulously carved
castles, knights, bishops, pawns and other chess pieces out of
brass and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Grabowski, Francois' freshman social studies teacher,
remembered him as a solid ``B'' student who ``always had his
homework done,'' asked thoughtful questions about topics like
slavery, and took on extra credit assignments in history, a
favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   He said Francois was also very rational and reasoned matters
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty good at critical thinking,'' he said. ``I never
saw any sign of emotional disturbance.''

ROBERT HUEBNER, 84, VIRUS RESEARCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md., Ohio, Calif., Va., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Huebner, whose genius as a medical detective in
pursuit of viruses and other agents of disease became a major force
in the battle against cancer, died Aug. 26 at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Coatesville, Pa. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner, who had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 16 years
and had lived at the center since 1991, died of pneumonia, medical
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a colleague, Huebner correctly hypothesized that a
gene he named the oncogene was implicated in the cause of cancer.
His discoveries and the oncogene theories he put forth in his years
as chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., led to the development of
vaccines and treatments for a variety of widespread and deadly
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among his major accomplishments were the discovery of viruses
responsible for serious respiratory illnesses in children and the
identification of the notorious cytomegaloviruses, which cause
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner (pronounced HYOOB-ner) is credited with galvanizing
medical science in the late 1960s and 1970s into action on cancer
and predicting, contrary to the medical wisdom of the day, that
viruses would be linked to certain cancers in humans.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded the old Department of Health, Education and
Welfare, now Health and Human Services, to provide $60 million for
cancer studies, and young scientists all over the country joined
the crusade to conquer the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up on the farm,'' he told a Life
interviewer in 1965, ``I saw that land erosion was the result of
little individual drops of rain, all adding up finally to a gully.
Human erosion isn't a simple thing; it's the result of the
interplay of many factors, many raindrops, but I strongly suspect
that among them are the virus agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Murray Gardner, a virologist at the University of California
at Davis, said Huebner ``was just what we needed to get people
moving, a visionary who foresaw the importance of viruses, in
particular retroviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Retroviruses, little sacs of genetic material, put out a kind of
reverse code or defective blueprint causing cell overgrowth.
Huebner put together a team of scientists to study them, Gardner
said. ``And within 15 years it paid off,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   By then the existence of the oncogene was confirmed by others
and it was clear that vaccines could be developed to prevent
tumors. As a result of such vaccines, including one for hepatitis
B, rates of some viral cancers, like that of the liver, have been
sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent DeVita, director of the Yale Cancer Center and
former director of the National Cancer Institute, said, ``The guy
was brilliant and unconventional _ he opened up the whole field of
cancer viruses, looking at them in ways people had not looked at
before.''
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist, DeVita said, Huebner ``was something to
behold.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Joseph Huebner, the first of nine children of Joseph and
Philomena Brickner Huebner, was born on Feb. 23, 1914, in Cheviot,
Ohio, a farming town where his father ran a movie theater. He began
premedical studies at Xavier College in 1937, finished them at the
University of Cincinnati and enrolled in 1938 in the St. Louis
University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking money, he was forced to violate a prohibition against
outside jobs and was threatened with expulsion. The threat was not
carried out and he was permitted to graduate in 1942, when he
joined the U.S. Public Health Service and went to sea in World War
II as a medical officer aboard a Coast Guard vessel in Alaska. He
returned in 1944 to join the National Institutes of Health as a
researcher, still with the Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after V-J Day, he was the only Public Health Service
officer on duty in his institute (senior officers were taking their
first extended breaks in four years) when he received a call from
New York City authorities puzzled by a disease among residents of
crowded apartments in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. Victims
had violent, body-racking fevers and skin lesions.
</P>
<P>
   The cause could not be determined, but the disease had already
killed an 11-year-old boy. A local exterminator, Charles Pomerantz,
led Huebner to an apartment where the wallpaper appeared to be
moving before their eyes, set in motion by billions of mites
crawling around inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the discovery of the first known case of rickettsial
pox, a variety of the diseases caused by rickettsia, which are tiny
micro-organisms that in this case were spread by those billions of
mites. The mites, infected with the previously unknown variety of
rickettsia, were inadvertently brought to the United States in the
luggage of Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Once the findings were confirmed, Huebner called his new friend,
the exterminator. ``Well, Charlie,'' Huebner said. ``We've made it!
Bravo!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stricken dumb,'' Pomerantz told The New Yorker shortly
afterward. ``That `we' included me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that work, Huebner was sent to California on
a new case, the mystery of Q-fever, which normally strikes cows but
apparently had spread to people.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner found the villains hiding out in vats of unpasteurized
milk. Again they were members of the rickettsia family, rare
pathogens smaller than bacteria and larger than viruses. Once the
cause was found, the outbreak ended. But laying blame on dairy
farmers angered them, and they pressured state health authorities,
who politely invited Huebner to leave California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Huebner was working with a health-service colleague,
Dr. Wallace Rowe, to grow common-cold viruses in cultures of human
adenoid and tonsil tissue.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to inoculate the cultures with nasal secretions from
people who had colds, but before they could, the cultures began to
fall apart. They took what remained and injected it into a new,
more stable culture, one made of human tumor cells. There they
first detected a virus that was later called the adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 47 varieties of the virus have been discovered and
linked to human diseases, including acute respiratory illnesses.
They also found in the culture the human cytomegalovirus, since
identified as a great hazard for organ-transplant recipients and
people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were great moments in virology,'' said Dr. Robert
Chanock, Huebner's successor at the Laboratory of Infectious
Diseases, who added that the body of Huebner's work ``put him up
there with Sabin.'' It was Albert Sabin who developed the oral
polio vaccine in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner and Rowe concluded that the viruses could trigger
dangerous cell overgrowth _ that they could conspire with a
specific but ordinary gene to interact and produce cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Huebner proposed his oncogene hypothesis in the journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He later updated
and refined the theory, stating that a specific and normal human
gene may mutate and cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A gruff, warm hulk of a man, he and his wife Berdine and their
nine children lived in Frederick, Md., on a 300-acre farm he had
bought for $4,000. The farm had outdoor plumbing, but Huebner's
government salary as a lab director, he told colleagues, did not
permit him to house his large family in affluent Washington suburbs
like Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement their income, he and the children began raising
and breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle, with each child raising a bull
to help pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   The farm is still in the family and was being run by three of
the children at his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Huebner left the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases to
become chief of the Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis of the
National Cancer Institute, where he remained until 1982, when he
retired.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Presidential National Medal of Science, one of
medicine's highest honors, and the Rockefeller Public Service
Award, and he was a longtime member of the National Academy of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Berdine, who died seven years ago, ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Harriet, of Rockville, Md.,
whom he married in 1974; eight children, Kay Huebner of

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BABE Ruth trained on booze and bawdy behavior. Chances are he never
lifted a weight or swallowed a ``dietary supplement.'' And all
those day games left him with plenty of long nights to partake of
earthly delights.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Babe been in shape, I mean really in shape, he might
have hit 100 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, had he used creatine and ``andro,'' he might have belted
200.
</P>
<P>
   Moot point. Cripes, Mark McGwire stands on the brink of
surpassing Ruth's total of 60 home runs in 154 games before Labor
Day, an achievement than can only be termed, well, Ruthian. But
that doesn't mean he will eclipse Ruth's legend. No way. The
Bambino dwarfed his would-be peers to such an extent that he belted
more dingers in his greatest seasons than did a goodly number of
teams.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, on the other hand, trails even the pantywaist Twins and
Pirates (94 each) by a significant margin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, what he _ and, yes, Sammy Sosa, too _ is doing is
phenomenal. And regarding St. Mac, his feats are in no way made
bogus by what he puts in his body. Remember, Ruth and Roger Maris
had nicotine coursing through their veins.
</P>
<P>
   Maris was a multipack-per-day smoker. How juiced was he? His
hair was probably falling out because of all the cigs. The closer
he got to Ruth in '61, the more he lit up. Likewise, all those hot
dogs Ruth reportedly ate were probably full of steroids and God
only knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on androstenedione, a ``precursor'' molecule
that's a kissin' cousin of the male sex hormone testosterone, is
that it's as legal as soda pop and highly unlikely to be harmful.
Most doctors I have spoken with consider the more widely used, and
similarly unregulated, creatine to carry bigger baggage because of
how it dehydrates the muscles, causing cramps and stressing
tendons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McGwire uses both andro and creatine, as do more of
his buddies than you may realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compete at that level,'' says Dr. Walt Lowe, team physician
for the Rockets and the University of Houston, ``pretty much
requires a better-living-through-chemistry approach. You have to do
more than work out. Virtually every professional athlete has some
form of performance-enhancing substance in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that what McGwire has accomplished is tainted because
of andro is baloney. It's not a steroid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it have any of the negative side effects, the worst of
which can be to cause liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe suggests that smokeless tobacco, which many baseball
players continue to use, is ``a huge performance enhancer,''
noting: ``You take the heavy users off it, and they get sluggish
and lose their edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA, the NFL and the International Olympic Committee
have labeled andro a no-no. Why? Because its residue, what Lowe
calls its ``breakdown substances,'' resembles that of steroids,
meaning it can be used as a masking agent for steroids during urine
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Note that baseball does test, with just cause, for steroids, the
observable evidence of which happens to be shockingly apparent. See
a broad-shouldered twentysomething with severe acne on his back,
and you can bet he's on 'roids.
</P>
<P>
   Because andro is a natural substance produced by the body, the
FDA pays it no mind. What little data exist suggest that it helps
to boost testosterone levels by no more than 15 percent, and only
temporarily. If that correlates to McGwire's being 15 percent
stronger, then his home-run count probably isn't being positively
enhanced _ the balls are just traveling farther. Say, 475 feet
instead of 400.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-eye coordination required to jack them into the
hinterlands isn't being impacted by andro or creatine. As McGwire's
defenders are quick to point out, the guy did hit 49 home runs as a
rookie. Apparently, he just knows how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a large side of me that wishes McGwire wouldn't
erase the Babe's 154-game record of 60, one of sport's most sacred
numbers and _ Maris' 61 in 162 games notwithstanding _ most
enduring.
</P>
<P>
   How long ago was 1927? Charles Lindbergh completed the first
nonstop solo trans-Atlantic crossing that May. In September, when
Ruth socked 17 homers, the filming of the first-ever talking motion
picture, The Jazz Singer, was being completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty, count 'em, 60!'' Ruth roared when he returned to the
Yankees' clubhouse on the afternoon of his final shot. ``Let some
other s.o.b. match that!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, oddly, only weeks after the 50th anniversary of the Babe's
death, it's virtually certain to happen. But just as the years
haven't made the big man any less larger than life, McGwire's tear
won't, either.

GIANTS' FIRST OPTION: BIGGER RECEIVERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Giants are the youngest team in the
National Football League, just as they were last season. They will
also return 20 of 22 starters from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Giants, who open the season on Sunday against the
Washington Redskins at Giants Stadium, are not the same team that
made a late charge to the division title last season. This year's
Giants have been modified in important ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while the Redskins signed defensive tackles Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson in part to try to stop the Giant
running game, the Giants decided they had to get bigger receivers
if they were going to succeed against the league's top defensive
backs _ two of whom are Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington secondary, led by the All-Pro cornerbacks Darrell
Green and Cris Dishman, held Giants wide receivers to 10 catches
and 113 receiving yards in two games last season. In contrast,
Washington's wide receivers, led by the 6-foot-3-inch Michael
Westbrook, combined for 29 receptions and 371 yards in the two
games against the Giants _ and that was with Jason Sehorn shadowing
Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   The Giant secondary is smaller with 5-foot-10-inch Conrad
Hamilton replacing the injured Sehorn, and unavoidably, more
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But offensively, the Giants' receiving corps will benefit
greatly from the presence of rookie Joe Jurevicius, who is
6-foot-5, and from a rejuvenated Amani Toomer, who is 6-foot-3.
Expect both to see considerable time against Green and Dishman,
especially if Ike Hilliard, Chris Calloway and David Patten _ none
taller than 5-foot-11 _ fail to improve their production against
the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Hamilton's debut as a starting cornerback for
Sehorn will draw attention from quarterback Gus Frerotte. Marcus
Buckley also begins his tenure as the team's regular strongside
linebacker _ the position played for most of the last six seasons
by Corey Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley has started 13 games at linebacker in the last five
years, but he has never been able to hold a starting assignment.
Generally considered too small to disrupt an opponent's running
game at the point of attack, the 240-pound Buckley has been
relegated to backup duties. But with Miller in a forced retirement
because of a herniated neck disk, it is Buckley's job to keep now.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillips, a second-year player, is Buckley's only true
backup. Phillips, a college defensive end, was not switched to
linebacker until midseason a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other minor changes Giants fans might notice as
well. The diminutive Patten, who is listed as 5-foot-9 but appears
shorter, is almost 10 pounds heavier because of an off-season
weight program. Running back Tiki Barber is about five pounds
heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Barber may look different to Giant fans, too. He'll be playing
for the first time in the NFL without a black visor across his
eyes. The NFL no longer allows the use of a black shield that
attaches to a player's face mask. Team trainers complained that
when they attended to players who were knocked out or dazed during
a game, they could not see the players' eyes to determine if they
had concussions or other kinds of neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers did not want to have to take off players' helmets,
which could be risky, just to examine their eyes, or to shine a
light in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' Barber said of the new rule. ``Now everyone
can see where I'm looking.''
</P>
<P>
   With league permission, some players with special eye problems
will be allowed to use clear visors.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Scott Gragg, who would have become an unrestricted
free agent after this season, agreed to a renegotiated contract
that retains him through the 2001 season. It will reportedly pay
him more than $2 million annually. Gragg, who did not receive an
offer as a restricted free agent last winter, would have been paid
$397,000 this season had he chosen to wait and pursue free agency
after the 1998 season. ... The Redskins will ride a special
seven-car Amtrak train to the New York area on Saturday. For the
last 27 years, the team has flown to play its away games with the
Giants. It won 12 of those 27 games. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn block lined with auto repair shops becomes
an open-air rehearsal studio for three competing orchestras. As
dusk falls on Parkside Avenue, quick, trained hands strike rows
upon rows of carefully tuned oil barrels; mallets are beat on rusty
tire irons; and the warm August nights fill up with the syncopated
sounds of calypso.
</P>
<P>
   In the one corner of a shop where the roof has not yet collapsed
from rain, a man who makes his living as a security guard
constructs tall, baroque costumes out of cardboard and peacock
feathers. Nearby, teen-agers brought up on basketball and Biggie
Smalls spend the evening mastering the steel-band songs of their
Caribbean parents.
</P>
<P>
   A New World tradition is being remade once more in New York: the
Caribbean heart of Brooklyn is getting ready for its annual
late-summer Carnival, the city's biggest, most extravagant parade.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, in the 31st annual West Indian American Day
Carnival, schoolteachers and nannies will shed their workday
clothes for skimpy thongs and dreamy costumes. The grandchildren of
migrants from the American South will play steel drum with the
children of Trinidadian immigrants. In a distinctly Brooklyn mix,
Haitian ``rara'' bands with their goatskin drums will file among
the tassa drummers, and mammoth trucks will roll down the Parkway,
blasting soca and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a small, homespun celebration in Harlem in the
1930s has grown into a pageant surpassing older, better-known
processions like the St. Patrick's Day or the Puerto Rican Day
parades. Immigration from the islands has surged, and today, New
York City is home to an estimated 600,000 Caribbean-Americans, the
bulk of them in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth of the parade, and its dozens of attendant
parties, concerts and competitions, is more than a testament to
rising Caribbean immigration. It is also a reflection of how many
Caribbean immigrants who ignored, even snubbed, the rites of
Carnival in Trinidad or Grenada have embraced it here, both as a
way to recall the home they left behind and to keep their children
in the Caribbean fold.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's West Indian parade draws an estimated 2 million
spectators _ in comparison with the 1 million or so who come out
for the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan _ and 30 masquerade
bands with as many as 2,000 participants each. The city's
Convention and Visitors Bureau now includes it on its list of Labor
Day weekend attractions, and New Yorkers with no ties to the
islands come to watch and, increasingly, to don costumes in the
masquerade bands, to play ``mas,'' as it is called.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the political power of Caribbean New Yorkers, the
parade has become a mandatory campaign stop. Banners pitching beer
and long-distance telephone services now stretch along the parade
route. And for the last three years, the parade has been broadcast
live on local television.
</P>
<P>
   But even as all of this signals the growing importance of
Caribbean New York in the public culture of the city, the evolution
of the parade also speaks volumes for how old-country rituals are
reinvented, Brooklyn-style.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Barnes, 60, a transplanted Trinidadian whose children and
grandchildren now join her on Eastern Parkway, likened the Brooklyn
parade to a tasty fruit-flavored drink. ``With the grapyness of the
grapyness of the grapyness of it,'' was how she put it, ``but not
the grape.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnival scholars and revelers say the Brooklyn parade is in
many ways a different kind of concoction altogether. For one thing,
it is an American-style march, not a series of free-floating
processions as in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and
Tobago. To accommodate television, the parade must stick to a
schedule, and marshals keep dancers from veering off the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they used to be extremely careless about scheduling,''
recalled Major Owens, the U.S. representative from Crown Heights
who made his first appearance at the parade 18 years ago. ``It was
supposed to start at 11 o'clock, and it wouldn't start till 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, considerable effort has been made to bring the
parade in line, install portable toilets and police barricades, and
garner corporate donations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But the growth of the parade has also sown dissension between
the organizers and some of the band leaders, particularly over how
to pay for this phenomenally expensive affair. The West Indian Day
Carnival Association, the organizer, says the weekend-long
bacchanal now costs nearly a half-million dollars; for some of the
bigger masquerade bands, like the 1,000-member Hawks International,
a few hours on the Parkway costs $50,000, what with expenses for
costumes and loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   While the city does not estimate the parade's economic impact,
there are a few budding efforts to use it as an engine of economic
development. Una Clarke, the city councilwoman from Crown Heights,
for instance, has proposed a program to generate year-round jobs
for the Carnival costume-makers. Owens is seeking to build a
Caribbean-American cultural museum that would have an office for
the parade organizers.
</P>
<P>
   And corporations with an interest in the Caribbean-American
market have begun to capitalize on the parade, with companies like
Western Union, AT&AMP;T and Mobil sponsoring some of the larger
masquerade bands as well as the parade itself. ``It's relevant to
our target audience, and we want to be part of it,'' said Anthony
Smith, Mobil Corp's manager for diversity marketing and community
relations.
</P>
<P>
   As the parade has gained mainstream notice, it has also fueled
the resurgence of another Trinidadian rite. For the last several
years, Trinidadians hankering for less structure and more steel
bands _ which have all but disappeared from the Parkway, drowned
out by the loud sound-trucks of the mas bands _ have turned to
something called J'ouvert, a free-spirited predawn pageant that
since slavery times has been a venue for drums, dance and social
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, J'ouvert _ a French-derived term pronounced joo-VAY
and loosely translated as ``I open,'' as in the opening of Carnival
_ has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years. It now draws
about 50,000 people but, so far, no politicians. Amplified music is
barred, leaving only the peals of the steel pan to break the cool
silence of the night.
</P>
<P>
   For J'ouvert this year, Tricia Mayhew and her friends will
slather themselves from head to toe with red paint and dance under
the stars. Ms. Mayhew, a 27-year-old high school science teacher,
has joined the parade on the Parkway ever since she left Trinidad,
11 years ago. But she has not played J'ouvert like this since she
was a child.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``Catching all those faces and listening to the steel bands,
you get that original feeling,'' she said. ``We've gotten so
commercialized now. But to watch these musicians play these notes,
you just marvel. You feel a sense of more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If the growth of Carnival is a function of a conventional
immigrant narrative _ doing in this country what one did at home _
the opposite is also true. Many have delved into the rites of
Carnival only after leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   As a Catholic school student in Trinidad, Kathy Clarke was
allowed only a glimpse of the masquerading revelers at Carnival
time. She never covered herself in paint on J'ouvert morning. And
she would never have been caught in the neighborhood pan yard,
whiling away her evenings with the pan men _ and it once was only
men _ who were considered ``hooligans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both her college-age son and daughter play steel drum. And
Ms. Clarke, a middle school teacher from East Flatbush who moved to
New York in 1979, serves as sort of a den mother for their band,
the Invaders. She joins her children as they play pan on J'ouvert
morning and then rushes home to change into costume for the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me this _ you're lucky you can keep kids in the
culture,'' she said the other day, as her daughter, Dominique, 20,
practiced on a six-headed bass drum.
</P>
<P>
   Steel band music has also filled a void in neighborhoods where
sports, arts and other recreational programs for young people have
all but dried up.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday evening, the pan yard of the Sesame Flyers
steel band in Flatbush was bustling. Bass drums were spray-painted
gold. The chrome tenor drums were rubbed until they shone. A group
of girls practiced last- minute flourishes on their double-seconds,
the alto of the pan orchestra. Later in the evening, they would
play on Church Avenue, and men and women would pour out of their
hot apartments to stroll and listen.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers now form the core of many bands in Brooklyn.
Roots-seeking may be important to their parents, but the young
people are drawn to the pan yard by other things. They come so they
can stay out with friends long past their curfew. They come because
they feel safe, because the pan yard, they say, is like family.
Mostly, they come for the music.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Browne, 16, has been playing for nearly seven years,
often riding the bus for a half-hour each way to get his hands on a
tenor drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something got stuck on me,'' he said. ``Having something to
play, having fun, hanging out. In the end, it's worth it.''

   MASSA MARITTIMA, Italy _ The crocodile that may eat Massa
Marittima lives here.
</P>
<P>
   He's either three or nearly seven feet long, is dark brown or
greenish, eats fish and frogs in the lake or fasts for 30 to 40
days on end, lives deep in the bottom mud or hides in tall reeds
and is growing lonesome in this little vacation town where a lot of
people are not so sure he exists at all.
</P>
<P>
   Massa Marittima, a picture postcard hill town in southern
Tuscany with a population of 9,100, is not the kind of place where
people easily get started on stories of things in lakes. After all,
this is not the kind of place where there is early darkness or
swirling mists that can turn a protruding rock into a crocodile at
dusk. But it is a place that will seize upon any eccentricity, or
slice of fantasy if one should come along.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Massa Marittima is that the man who first spied
the crocodile in Lago dell'Accesa, outside town, was a vacationing
German obstetrician, Dr. Dieter Jag _ whose nationality is normally
a symbol among Italians of rationality and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he see the crocodile, but he also described it to
Capt. John Napolitano, commander of the local Carabinieri, with
enough clinical detail and accuracy to alarm the Carabinieri, and
the city fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano, whose father emigrated _ temporarily _ to the United
States and named his son John out of attachment to the country he
almost adopted, admires American accuracy. So he took careful notes
when Jag described how, on the morning of Aug. 10, he watched an
Italian couple carry the crocodile to the lake shore, where it
slithered into the greenish waters. The couple left in a car with
Milan license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Jag has since returned to Munich, but his testimony remains a
matter of official record and the stuff of newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, speculation about the nature of the animal _ was it
a crocodile, or perhaps an alligator, or a caiman? _ and its size,
color and relative fierceness eclipsed even discussions of the
weekend soccer scores.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Luca Sani, owner of the hotel Il Girafalco and thus a man
as interested in tourism as anyone, declared the lake off-limits to
tourists, mainly Germans who swim there, and convened a summit
meeting of the Carabinieri, the fire brigade, the civil defense
corps and the forest rangers to devise a plan to capture the
creature. Other townspeople found the story not only hard to
believe, but also less than amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there this crocodile or isn't there?'' asked Giacomo
Venaglia, 68, a retired miner who rides his bike to the lake almost
daily.
</P>
<P>
   When Gianluca Guidi, whose job as a member of the local civil
defense unit is to protect curious sightseers by keeping them from
the water's edge, replied, ``It seems there is,'' Venaglia snapped,
on behalf of all the town's skeptics. ``When I went to school we
were taught never to write, `It seems,' but to say, `Yes, there
is,' or `No, there isn't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Franco Tognarini, who owns a restaurant on a rise above the lake
and says he has lost 75 percent of his business since the lake was
closed to swimmers, takes the doubt with reasonable good humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provincial quaestor and the fire chief were out in a boat
recently, about 1 a.m., when they saw it,'' he said. ``The quaestor
shouted, `Mamma mia, but it's big! Let's get out of here!' It was
two meters long,'' or six and a half feet. ``It passed under the
boat and disappeared,'' Tognarini continued. ``It wasn't a fish. It
wasn't a beaver. What else could it have been?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, they should go in, capture the animal and bring
business back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   As Italians have fewer and fewer children, pets, including
exotic animals, have become increasingly popular. But when people
go off for their monthlong August vacations, they often abandon
them by dropping them by the roadside, or near a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Thus pythons are occasionally reported in urinals. Last year a
panther set free near Rome that had wandered the city's outskirts
for two years was captured unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the crocodile story shows that for all those who fear for
the safety of some unwitting swimmer, there are plenty who are
enjoying the visit of the unlikely reptile.
</P>
<P>
   After initial skepticism, Venaglia suggested that it might even
have something to do with the legend of the lake. In the Middle
Ages, he said, local farmers celebrated no feast day more
religiously than July 26, St. Ann's Day. There was no lake then,
and farmers who worked the fields where it now lies ignored the
celebration.
</P>

   ``One day a holy man, passing by, scolded the farmers,''
Venaglia said, ``but they only replied, `There's work to be done,
grain to be harvested,' and whipped their horses and labored on.
But as the holy man departed, the earth opened and swallowed the
farm, and in its place the lake appeared. Some nights, they say,
you can hear the whips, and the horses' neighing.''
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano tends, soberly, toward the abandoned-pet theory. Just
the other day, reports reached him of another abandoned panther,
this time in Tuscany. ``Fortunately it's in the Piombino area,'' he
said, struggling to control his exasperation. ``We only have this
pseudo-crocodile.''

   WASHINGTON _ Two Air Force helicopters crashed early Friday on a
nighttime training mission over a remote mountainous area in
Nevada, killing all 12 crew members on both helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the Air Force's deadliest accident since
September 1995, when 24 crew members died in the crash of a
surveillance plane moments after taking off from Elmendorf Air
Force Base in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the two helicopters, each with six crew members, crashed
about 1 a.m. while flying together 70 miles north of Nellis Air
Force Base, outside Las Vegas. Two helicopters apparently collided,
but officials at Nellis and in Washington said they would not know
for certain until the Air Force completed an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, HH-60 Pave Hawks, which cost more than $10
million each, were made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The two HH-60 Pave Hawks were designed for search-and-rescue
missions and were assigned to the 66th Rescue Squadron at Nellis.
The squadron had recently returned from duty in the Persian Gulf
and Turkey. The helicopters were taking part in a routine nighttime
exercise inside the 5,000-square-mile training range north of Las
Vegas, the Air Force's largest.
</P>
<P>
   They crashed in a mountainous area about 25 miles north of
Indian Springs, Nev., that is so rocky and remote that it took
about four hours for rescue crews from the base, as well as the
Bureau of Land Management and the Energy Department, to discover
the wreckage and recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first crash of an Air Force Pave Hawk helicopter
since 1995, when one from Osan Air Base in South Korea crashed,
killing five people. The Pave Hawk has been in operation since
1982.

DEMOCRATS AGREE WITH SENATOR'S CRITICISM OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., La., Minn., Calif., Colo., Ga., N.J., Mo.,
N.Y., Pa., Wash., Vt., Ohio, Fla.) (Eds: See also CLINTON-LIEBERMAN, CLINTON-APOLOGY)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats Friday began falling in
line behind an influential Democratic senator who on Thursday
excoriated President Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky scandal as
``immoral'' and ``disgraceful'' from the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats interviewed across the country stopped short of
calling for Clinton to resign or be impeached, concurring with the
senator, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, that such steps were
unwise and premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Sen. Lieberman that what the president did was
wrong and that what the president did hurt the country and the
presidency,'' Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., said through a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., issued a statement saying, ``I
commend Sen. Lieberman for his appropriate and timely remarks and
the dignified way in which he delivered this difficult but right
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other Democrats echoed similar sentiments in interviews
or statements, including Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, Richard
Durbin of Illinois, Barbara Boxer of California and Max Cleland of
Georgia, and Reps. Robert Andrews of New Jersey and Diana DeGette
of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats stepped up their criticism of Clinton, Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House
minority leader, agreed Friday to meet on Wednesday to discuss the
procedures for dealing with the report that the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is expected to file in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has complained that the House Republican leadership is
drafting the framework for the inquiry into possible impeachable
offenses and the handling of the report without consulting
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., who heads the House Rules
Committee, said Friday that if the House approved a procedural
resolution, Starr's report would go to the House Judiciary
Committee with instructions to make an executive summary available
to all House members. If the committee finds that sufficient
evidence exists to proceed with an impeachment proceeding, Solomon
said he would recommend that the full report be made available to
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., started gathering signatures Friday
on a letter to Gingrich asking that lawmakers either give up
campaign time this fall and stay in session ``for as long as it
takes'' or return after the Nov. 3 elections to deal quickly with
any accusations of impeachable offenses by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate are in recess for the Labor Day weekend, so
most lawmakers were out of town Friday. Many Democrats, including
Gephardt and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader,
declined to comment beyond their earlier criticisms of Clinton's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until Lieberman's scathing 24-minute speech, most
Democrats had confined their comments on the matter. Last month
Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., who is retiring, called on Clinton to
resign. And this week Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., facing a tough
re-election, said the president's behavior ``repulses'' him.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic incumbents who are women have come under attack
from Republican challengers who accuse them of having a double
standard on sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., the leading Republican challenger to
Sen. Patty Murray, has criticized her Democratic rival's muted
response to the scandal, saying the senator ``seems to have traded
in her tennis shoes for a pair of Hush Puppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats Friday chose to associate themselves with
Lieberman's remarks, and not say much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman's comments demonstrate that no one is more
disappointed about what's happened than the president's friends,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeGette said, ``For Democrats, there's just a sense of deep
disappointment, and it just doesn't seem to be going away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But not all Democrats agreed with Lieberman's remarks or their
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech was the wrong speech at the wrong time,'' said Rep.
Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. ``Frankly, I think it plays into the hands of
the Republicans who are trying to fan the fires of this whole
Monica Lewinsky situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel said Lieberman's speech was putting pressure on other
Democrats to be more critical of Clinton. ``This has a snowball
effect,'' Engel said. ``It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J., said, ``Members of Congress have
a legitimate right to address their concerns and opinions, but I
don't believe this is the time to pile on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said Lieberman's remarks violated an unwritten rule on
Capitol Hill to refrain from criticizing the president when he was
abroad, in this case Northern Ireland, where he has played in
important role in brokering a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern about it was the timing,'' Leahy said. ``Save
the criticism for when the president's plane takes off, or for
Monday or Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Lieberman suggested that there be some sort of
public rebuke of Clinton, a sentiment expressed earlier this week
by many Democrats, including Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need something else,'' Ms. Kaptur said. ``He doesn't have
to resign, or he could resign and then do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said, ``On the basis of the
information we now have, we cannot let the impression prevail that
the president's behavior is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton and other senior Democrats urged restraint until
lawmakers reviewed Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Democrats said they were not swayed by
Clinton's latest effort at contrition Friday. The president told
reporters in Dublin that he was ``very sorry'' for what he did, but
added that ``there's nothing else I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said, ``The obvious question is whether people believe
that this apology is genuine,'' and added, ``I believe it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats disagreed. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said through
a spokeswoman that the president's statements were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. DeGette said: ``At this point, most people feel there
should have been an apology. I still don't hear an apology.''

 EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S DESPERATE ECONOMIC PLAN  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Desperate political circumstances help explain the contradictory
economic program proposed Friday by Russia's acting prime minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin. But it is hard to imagine how its successive
phases of hyperinflationary expansion and ironclad austerity could
possibly work. Russia needs daring economic boldness. But this plan
comes dangerously close to incoherence.
</P>
<P>
   The initial, expansionary measures reflect Chernomyrdin's urgent
need for support from Communist and other anti-reform members of
Russia's Parliament when his nomination as prime minister comes up
for a second confirmation vote next week. In a first test, on
Monday, he was defeated 253-94. If Chernomyrdin loses three times,
Parliament must be dissolved and new elections called. That is a
risk most Russian politicians, including President Boris Yeltsin
and Chernomyrdin, would prefer to avoid right now. The economy is
close to imploding and, after two weeks with no government at all,
Russia desperately requires some political stability.
</P>
<P>
   But if Chernomyrdin's new program is the price he has to pay for
that stability, it is alarmingly high. Urgently needed reform
measures are pushed back for at least four months, until next
January. There can be no confidence he will be able to muster
sufficient political support to proceed even then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government presses will print worthless new rubles,
guaranteeing a period of hyperinflation that will wipe out personal
savings and make any payment of back wages worthless. Public anger
at the politicians responsible for the financial ruin of ordinary
Russians will be fierce. Further, it is hard to imagine that any
new money would be forthcoming from foreign governments, the
International Monetary Fund or private investors during this first,
hyperinflationary phase.
</P>
<P>
   If, and when, the second phase of the program kicks in, Russia's
central bank will yield control of monetary policy to a currency
board that, if it works, would tie the ruble to either the dollar
or the new euro at the cost of surrendering control of Russian
monetary policy to a foreign central bank. The program also
promises that inefficient companies will be forced into bankruptcy
and that the tax system will be reformed. These are exactly the
kind of measures that could do a lot of good right now. What will
happen in January is anybody's guess. &QL;

for Sunday, Sept. 6, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RISK-TAKERS-REVIEW _ Risk was a great thing when new worlds and
new frontiers beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now
millions of people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive
properties built more shoddily than a generation ago, and more
vulnerable to oceans and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's
borders, in the world's financial markets, people are also living
nearer to the edge, in riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising
storms. As prosperity has grown, risk has grown with it. By Tim
Weiner. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE-LEAGUE-REVIEW _ Roughly 80 percent of today's major
leaguers played Little League baseball _ including players from
places outside the United States, like Panama (Mariano Rivera of
the Yankees) and even tiny Curacao (Andruw Jones of the Atlanta
Braves). Eight played in the Little League World Series. By Alan
Schwarz. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMERS-REVIEW _ What consumer confidence is and isn't. By
Sylvia Nasar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ECON-REVIEW _ Life in Russia is hard _ harder still,
because so many expected better this time. But this is the nation
that coped with the Golden Horde, Ivan the Terrible, the siege of
Leningrad and communism, and outlived them all. Coping is in the
national genetic code, a source of humor and pride and even song:
``Anything but the war,'' goes a refrain from a popular Soviet-era
tune. In a nation where workers go months without pay, basic
services are spotty and the currency is losing its worth, it may be
Boris Yeltsin's salvation, too. By Michael Wines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-REVIEW _ Thinking like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. By
Nicholas D. Kristof. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Ever since the Lewinsky scandal broke in
January, Washington pundits have been saying that the time might
come when Democratic elders went down to the White House to tell
Clinton that, for the party's sake, he should begin to pack. One
difficulty with this vision is that there is only a handful of
Democrats on whom the president relies, and from whom he might take
such a message seriously. By Adam Clymer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BABY-LITERACY-REVIEW _ For baby's literary enlightenment, the
hand that rocks the cradle should also be turning the the pages of
``Good Night Moon'' or ``The Poky Little Puppy.'' At least that's
the hope of an assortment of major publishers seeking to raise a
new generation of book buyers. It's also the goal of a growing
number of charities and foundations that have brought together
pediatricians, volunteers and librarians in a less commercial quest
to promote the notion that reading aloud to toddlers, babies _ even
newborns _ is a child-care ritual as vital as mother's milk. By
Doreen Carvajal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX-RUMORS-REVIEW _ Everybody here is whispering about everybody
else's sex life. No one, of course, is recommending such talk.
Heaven forbid. No one wants the president's troubles to unleash a
squinty-eyed inquisition into the sexual mores of a publicly dull,
prudish city with a history of smeared lipstick behind closed
office doors. But in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in
political consultancies and law firms, people say it will happen.
By James Bennet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS-MOOD-REVIEW _ Americans are far from depressed. News
about falling currencies, market fluctuations and sexual
peccadilloes seem less harbingers of bad times than distractions
from the steak and hot dogs on the grill. While a few polls
indicate that some Americans are concerned about the distant
future, the reigning sentiment out there now is one of relative
satisfaction. By Jennifer Steinhauer. &QL;

AIR PASSENGERS WHO LOOKED TOWARD FUTURE ARE NOW PART OF THE PAST

 (SUBS to add 3 grafs at end)  (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, whenever Janice Wallace closed her eyes, she could
still see her big sister laughing and blowing kisses through the
window of the taxi speeding toward New York's Kennedy International
Airport. For hours, she clung to that memory of Lori Moran, a
34-year-old figure-skating coach who had planned to toast her third
wedding anniversary in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, as Mrs. Wallace watched news flashes of rescue
workers pulling baby bottles, ripped clothing and seat cushions
from the choppy sea off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, she turned her
attention to the business of bringing her sister's body back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like reality now,'' said Ms. Wallace, 33, as she and her
family made plans to fly to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The dark waters swallowed 229 lives when Swissair Flight 111
plunged into the Atlantic on Wednesday night, and Friday many
grieving families began the painful process of trying to recover
their dead.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for information about the newlyweds, refugee workers,
retirees and others lost in the crash, dozens of families flew to
Nova Scotia from Kennedy Airport on a Swissair charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the relatives of Joseph La Motta, 49, the son of
boxer Jake La Motta, drove to the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy
Airport hoping for news from Swissair executives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many sought to give information that would help with
the identification process. John Dedes hunted for the medical
records of his cousin, Dr. Eugenia Spanopoulou, a cancer
researcher, who was killed flying her 18-month-old son to meet her
father in Greece for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   Elayne Shuster searched for the dental records of her sister,
Stephanie, a 32-year-old Manhattan corporate executive, who had
been on her way to business meetings in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest concern now is to find her,'' said Ms. Shuster,
35. ``That's the only thing that's going to give us, as a family, a
sense of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little news to comfort the families. Rescue
workers, who reported recovering about 60 bodies Thursday, stopped
estimating the body count Friday. And as relatives stayed glued to
their television screens, investigators reported only the recovery
of about 100 suitcases, saying they believed many bodies were
trapped in the wreckage below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this was just God's will,'' said Lynn Ross, the
fiancee of Joe La Motta, her voice choked with tears. She said she
could not bear to fly to Canada until his body is found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine standing there looking at that body of water
and being reminded all over again how Joe died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, the passengers stepped on the jetliner
looking forward to the future. Joe La Motta was thrilled about
traveling to Geneva to promote his company, LaMotta Foods Inc., and
its LaMotta Tomotta sauce, a family marinara recipe handed down
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hausman, 33, an Illinois farm boy whose love of agriculture
catapulted him to the top of the grain buying industry, was
preparing for a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Norman and Caroline DePledge of Concord, Mass., were
settling into their seats along with their grown children, Jane and
Michael, bound for a 10-day walking tour though Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so excited about Switzerland,'' said Alma Healy, a
neighbor who met the family 20 years ago. ``They were really each
others best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight included many passengers like the DePledeges, who
were fulfilling tightly-clasped dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Tahmoush, 77, the retired chief executive officer of
Frank B. Hill, an insurance brokerage house, was planning a
long-awaited reunion. During World War II, Mr. Tahmoush, then an
officer in the U.S. Army, was injured and cared for by a Belgian
couple. And he was on his way to visit that couple's 63-year-old
son for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spanopoulou, a scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital's Derald H.
Ruttenberg Cancer Center, and her husband, Andrew Hodtsev, an
immunologist, were taking their little boy, Platon, to be
christened in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a rising star in her field of molecular immunology
and cancer, Dr. Spanopolou was recently named an investigator for
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a prestigious competitive
award that goes to top young scientists conducting cutting-edge
work.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip was for pleasure. And she was looking forward to
presenting her new baby to her family when the plane fell from the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash traveled quickly. Mrs. Wallace, the sister of
Ms. Moran, the figure skating coach, was sleeping when her father
called with the news. She shook herself awake, insisting the news
could not be true.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moran and her husband, Michael Dichkus, an architect, had
been planning the trip for months. And Ms. Moran, who spent four
years coaching at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan before moving to the
Ice House in Hackensack, N.J., about a year ago, had spent long
evenings flipping through travel guides, dreaming about the Eifel
Tower, long walks in Paris and sightseeing in Grenoble, France.
</P>
<P>
   It was their third anniversary and the couple looked forward to
celebrating their happy lives. They had a new house, which Dichkus
fixed and fussed over until his hands got sore. They had a blooming
garden with red dahlias, sunny marigolds and ripe tomatoes. And
this year, after the trip, they planned to finally start a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of renovations in the house, and she loved that
garden,'' Mrs. Wallace said. ``Every moment she wasn't at the rink,
she was outside taking care of the garden, out there at six o'clock
in the morning, pulling weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But reality set in as divers pulled wreckage and bodies from the
ocean and Swissair executives announced that no one had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, overwhelmed by the grim sight of the broken plane and
the debris, Mrs. Wallace turned off the television set and started
making arrangements for the trip to Canada with her family. She
planned to take flowers from the garden and to hold tight to those
last images of her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying `Bon voyage' and she was blowing kisses out
the window,'' said Mrs. Wallace, weeping. ``She had her arm out the
window waving as she went down the street.''

   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ As grieving families from several
countries began to converge on this tiny fishing village on Friday,
officials looking for the cause of the crash of Swissair Flight 111
on Wednesday said that it appeared that the crew was in control of
the jet and making rational decisions about how to land the
stricken plane until it abruptly disappeared from radar.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Canadian investigator said that aside from the smoky
condition the pilots reported in seeking permission for an
emergency landing, the crew reported no specific problems with the
operation of the jumbo jet, an MD-11 built by McDonnell Douglas in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, from the Canadian National Safety
Board, said that contrary to earlier reports, the jetliner changed
course only once, when the pilot was told that he should attempt to
land in Halifax rather than in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the plane, carrying 215 passengers and a crew of
14, was about 58 nautical miles from the runway in Halifax. Gerden
said the pilot began to make wide circles to both reduce altitude
and dump fuel as he descended in preparation for a landing.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden added that the crews' communication with Canadian air
traffic controllers was ``professional throughout.'' He said that
the crew twice indicated that they had a serious problem with the
plane, which was only described as smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators analyzed the tapes, several relatives of the
victims made solemn journeys to the rocky Nova Scotia coastline.
Peter Gerety, the brother of Pierce Gerety, a U.N. official who was
aboard Flight 111, picked up two rocks there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like having a memento,'' said Gerety. ``It's such
a beautiful place; that's the irony of it.'' Gerety said he would
keep one of the stones and deliver the other to his brother's
widow.
</P>
<P>
   On several fronts Friday, the recovery and investigation
frustrated both officials and grieving families eager for answers.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise and frustration of many investigators, a
submarine equipped with sophisticated sonar and other underwater
listening devices caught no whisper from the ``pingers'' attached
to the jet's black boxes _ the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder. As a result, investigators had little to go on
beyond radar tapes and the tapes of the conversations between the
crew and the ground. Investigators were still poring over this
information Friday and said they would release a transcript of the
conversations and a radar map on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact searchers have so far found no large pieces of wreckage,
although what has turned up has shown no signs of fire or other
obvious clues. Sgt. Andre Guertin of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police said the most significant discovery Friday was about 100
mostly intact pieces of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   But other aspects of the investigation began to move forward. In
New York, the FBI joined the Federal Aviation Administration in
examining cargo manifests for the flight to determine whether any
hazardous materials were on board, either declared or undeclared.
The flight did not carry any materials owned by the airline,
investigators said Friday; that is significant, officials said,
because in the crash of a Valuejet DC9 in Florida two years ago,
the cause of a fire on board turned out to be hazardous oxygen
generators in boxes labeled ``comat,'' meaning company materials.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials also said they were looking closely at six
directives they had issued since 1994 regarding flaws that might
cause smoke or fire on MD-11s. Those are among several orders
issued by the agency for planes under U.S. jurisdiction after
scattered instances of fire or smoke on that type of jet. The
Swissair jet was registered in Switzerland and was not subject to
U.S. orders, but officials said that most European airlines
routinely adopt the FAA directives.

</P>
<P>
   At a military base several miles to the northeast, medical
examiners also joined the investigation, performing toxicology
tests on the victims' remains that may indicate whether passengers
had inhaled smoke or other fumes before the crash. The medical
examiners, working in a makeshift morgue in an airplane hangar,
began a second painstaking day of identifying the bodies, which are
stored in five refrigerated trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But they said late Friday afternoon that they had not been able
to positively identify a single body yet. The examiners also said
they were working to try to identify the bodies primarily using
dental records and other medical information so that they could
spare the families from having to view the bodies, most of which
are not intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a simple problem of visually identifying 229
people, it would take at the most three days,'' said Dr. John Butt,
Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner. ``This is not that kind of
task,'' he said and added, ``I have a certain sensitivity and
reluctance to discuss this further.''
</P>
<P>
   As searchers and investigators settled in for what they said
would likely be weeks of work, the families of the victims began to
arrive to be nearer to the place where the jet went down. Officials
said they expected as many as 800 relatives and friends, many of
which arrived in Halifax Friday afternoon on Swissair flights from
New York and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives made their way to Peggy's Cove, a fishing
village and tourist haven that is nearest point of land to the
crash site. One man, who did not give his name, arrived in the late
afternoon as the fog grew so thick that the lighthouse at the edge
of the cove became invisible. He slowly made his way around a rocky
inlet near where searchers were loading debris and human remains
into a truck. Before leaving a van, he bent down quickly to the
water, wet his hands and touched them to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Four large green military tents have been set up along the shore
so relatives they can look out toward the site of the crash five
miles out. ``I would want to see the last resting place of my loved
ones,'' said Murielle Provost, a Red Cross official assisting the
families. ``I would want to be at that place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Provost added that many were probably in shock, not only
from the death of loved ones but also from traveling here on the
same airline on which their family members were lost. Most of the
families gathered at the Lord Nelson Hotel in Halifax, where the
ornate brown marble lobby was filled this evening with clergy
members, Red Cross workers and Canadian Royal Mounted police.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes elevator doors would open and grim-faced
groups of people would slowly make their way around the lobby,
seeking information about the crash and the recovery effort.
</P>
<P>
   Though searchers on the water had already given up hope of
finding survivors long before, Canadian Navy and Royal Mounted
Police officially changed the mission from a search and rescue
effort to one of simply recovery of debris and remains Friday
morning, beginning in earnest the search for the jet's flight data
recorder and large sunken pieces of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scanned, rescanned, and scanned again,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Jacques Fauteux, a spokesman for the Rescue Command Center of the
Canadian navy and coast guard. ``We looked up and down; we used our
eyes and ears and everything we had, and there just aren't any
survivors.

   GREENSPAN HINTS AT EASED STANCE ON RATE INCREASE
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the
central bankers were growing more concerned about the effect of the
global financial crisis on the U.S. economy, and he seemed to open
the door to consideration of a rate cut if the global situation
continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring and early summer, Federal Reserve policy-makers
were more concerned about the threat of renewed inflation,
Greenspan said, and they adopted a policy stance signaling they
stood ready to raise rates at the first sign of any significant
inflation. But he said policy-makers decided last month that the
global turmoil posed a growing threat to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   CHERNOMYRDIN DETAILS FINANCIAL PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Russia's acting prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, detailed a
series of economic remedies that would shore up the nation's
banking system and ease the country into an ``economic
dictatorship'' where the money supply would be rigidly controlled
and failing factories could face bankruptcy for the first time. The
Parliament put off a vote on the new government until Monday,
buying more time for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   GM AND UNION REACH SATURN PACT
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached an
accord at the automaker's Saturn assembly plant in Spring Hill,
Tenn., averting another strike. Details of the agreement were not
disclosed, but both sides said it affirmed the plant's partnership
between management and labor.
</P>
<P>
   TWO CARRIERS ORDERED BACK IN AIR
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of transportation, Rodney Slater, ordered Mesaba
Aviation and Express Airlines I, commuter carriers that suspended

Airlines, to resume flights to 17 small cities no later than
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   DOW RALLIES LATE BUT LOSES GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 186 points
before it and other market measures recovered, cutting their losses
by two-thirds and more. The Dow closed down 41.97 points, or
five-tenths of 1 percent, at 7,640,25. It is now down 3.4 percent
for the year. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
8.37 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 973.89, and the Nasdaq
composite index dropped 5.34 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent,
to 1,566.52.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities traded mostly higher. The yield of the
30-year bond dropped to 5.28 percent from 5.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURES EXCHANGE WINS APPROVAL
</P>
<P>
   Cantor Fitzgerald won approval from the Commodity Futures

EDITORIAL: COMING SOON: THE BICOASTAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The California state Legislature voted this week to move its
presidential primary from June to the first Tuesday in March. If
Gov. Pete Wilson signs the bill into law, it will virtually
guarantee that the national presidential primary system becomes a
compressed melee in which nominations are awarded to the candidates
with the most money and highest profile.
</P>
<P>
   New York has already scheduled its year 2000 primary for the
week of March 7, as have most of the New England states. California
hopes to persuade Washington and Oregon to create a West Coast
regional primary on the same day. That means candidates coming out
of the New Hampshire race in February will immediately be forced
into a massive, bicoastal campaign. Huge advertising budgets will
be essential, and any candidate without a private jet might as well
call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to blame the Californians for wanting to hold their
primary early. The days when candidates were tested over a long
primary season and the final decision was not made until June are
gone. Given the way other states have been leapfrogging to the head
of the line, the next presidential nominees may be set in concrete
even before the Super Tuesday primaries in mid-March. In 1996,
California tried moving its presidential primary to the end of
March as an experiment and found that even then it was little more
than an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Like most lawmakers who are now scheduling their primaries too
soon and too close together, Californians say they would happily
join in any system that made things more rational. ``If we just
make the parties realize the system's broken, that will be great,''
said one of the early-primary backers. But the parties have so far
shown little interest beyond protecting New Hampshire's status as
the only February primary.
</P>
<P>
   A long, deliberative primary season is in the interest of
everyone, except perhaps well-financed names like Vice President Al
Gore, who might benefit from a race decided too fast for people to
become familiar with his competition. The National Association of
Secretaries of State has been working on a plan that would create
five regional primaries, each to be held a month apart.
California's vote makes it clear that the secretaries of state
should act quickly if the next primary season is to be saved. Party
activists interested in opening up the 2000 presidential race to as
many candidates as possible should press their leaders to get
involved.

McGWIRE HAS ALWAYS HAD POWER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Long home runs have always been Mark
McGwire's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has natural power,'' says former USC coach Rod Dedeaux.
``It isn't anything that comes out of bottle or from a pill you can
take. It's a gift from the good Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was known for his long home runs, even while playing in
the American Little League in Claremont, Calif. That reputation
grew in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest home run I saw Mark hit at Damien, and maybe the
longest home run I ever saw period, was one he hit at Ganesha High
in Pomona,'' said Tom Carroll, McGwire's varsity coach at Damien
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit one over the fence in left field, which is only about
300 feet away, but is about 30 feet high. It then cleared the
backyard of a house, landed in the middle of the roof, bounced off
the roof and out into the street beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the highlight of Mark's baseball career at Damien was
the 1981 Pomona Elks Baseball Tournament. Damien made it all the
way to the finals, in which it played Covina on a chilly spring
night at Ralph Welch Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we had a huge crowd for the game,'' Carroll said.
``And I remember Mark pitched very well, but we made a couple
errors and Covina finally beat us, 6-5, in nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what most folks remember about that game is that Mark hit
two long, long drives. Both were caught by Covina outfielders who
were playing him about as deep as you could play and still be in
the same zip code. At any other park, those two drives would have
been home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing for Jack Helber's Claremont American Legion team,
the legend continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, he hit one into the next county,'' Helber said.
``Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field we played on at Claremont-McKenna College is in Los
Angeles County, but there is a service road out behind the left
field fence and a ways beyond that is the L.A.-San Bernardino
County line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark hit one that cleared the left field fence, cleared the
service road and landed in the next county. I don't know how far
that is, but I do know I never saw anyone else come close to doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit several tape-measure home runs at USC, but his
longest may have been hit in Memphis when he was a member of the
U.S. Olympic team in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit one that must have gone 600 feet,'' said former Cal
Poly Pomona coach John Scolinos, who was an assistant coach on that
U.S. team. ``It left the ballpark and landed on a highway out
beyond left field. I've been around baseball a long time, but I
have never seen a longer home run. I was just amazed. I turned to
Rod Dedeaux and said I couldn't believe what I just saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod just said, `Oh, that's Mark. He does that all the time.'''

MOSCOW PLANS TO SPEND, THEN SAVE

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Viktor Chernomyrdin has battled to become prime
minister, critics have wondered how he could placate the Communists
and still take tough steps to rescue Russia from its deepening
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin gave his answer Friday: by turns.
</P>
<P>
   In a major address to Russia's upper house of Parliament,
Chernomyrdin outlined a two-stage plan that would begin with the
easiest and most popular step: turning on the money-printing
presses so the government could pay workers back wages and prop up
ailing banks.
</P>
<P>
   Only later would the government impose an iron discipline on its
tumbling currency by rigidly linking it to gold and hard-currency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that Chernomyrdin's decision to put off the day
of reckoning just might get him through the Communist-dominated
lower house of Parliament, which has balked at his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It may also help the Kremlin defuse the strikes and mass
demonstrations that the Communists have planned for early October.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the strategy would also escalate Russia's
roaring inflation and further depress its collapsing currency
before corrective action is finally taken. As Chernomyrdin
acknowledged Friday, ``We will get a growth of prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A growth of prices'' was a rather pallid euphemism for what is
happening in Russia now. Inflation shot up 15 percent for the last
two weeks of August _ an annual rate of more than 2,000 percent.
The ruble has tumbled over that period from 6.2 rubles to the
dollar to about 17 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the wreckage that once was the Russian economy,
Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's former economics minister who emerged
this week as one of the Kremlin's most influential advisers, made a
plea for fast action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of going to hyperinflation is very high if they do
not act quickly,'' he said in an interview. ``There are no economic
grounds to say that it is premature. When you have to prevent
hyperinflation, the quicker you act, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo helped conquer sky-high inflation in Argentina by
establishing a currency board _ a system that establishes a fixed
exchange rate linked to a hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, the pro-free-market Kremlin aide, who was
reappointed first deputy prime minister this week, has embraced the
concept and made it a central feature of Chernomyrdin's economic
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chernomyrdin nor Fyodorov, however, spelled out when
their new currency policy would take effect. And only the broad
strokes of the strategy were clear.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it would work. Heeding the Parliament's call for a
looser monetary policy, the government would print more money.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable the government to pay back wages to the Army,
civil servants and defense workers, soothing popular discontent.
Pensions would also be paid, and the new infusion of rubles would
also help prop up teetering banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to settle accounts with the past,'' Fyodorov told
Russian television. ``Because otherwise everybody will tell us,
`Look, you owe us this and that.'''
</P>
<P>
   But sometime after that populist splurge, Fyodorov explained,
the purse strings would be drawn tight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, the government would get tough by
bankrupting unprofitable companies, trying to balance the budget,
beefing up tax collection and imposing a flat tax of 20 percent on
personal income.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to convey the sternness of the future measures,
Chernomyrdin dubbed it an ``economic dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country will have to live according to strict, absolutely
clear rules,'' he said. ``All these measures will need new
legislative support, and new legislation should come into force
starting in January of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Russia would be like a chronic drinker who would go
out for a final binge before swearing off alcohol once and for all.
Thus the plan has raised some troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia lacks the political consensus to undertake painful
reforms and currency stabilization measures now, will there be
sufficient support in the depths of winter, when inflation is
raging, shortages plague the nation and the 2000 presidential vote
is even nearer? Or will Russia again put off taking the tough
medicine?
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's approach also poses difficult choices for
Russia's friends in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, said Russia has a ``very urgent''
agenda of economic and financial improvements that have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton indicated during his summit meeting here this
week that he was prepared to lead a new effort to expand Western
assistance if Russia kept on the reform path.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a senior Clinton administration official expressed
frustration with the outlines of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some important details of the plan remained to be spelled out,
such as how much money would be printed. Until the Parliament
approves a new prime minister and his team is fully in place there
is no government to make those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question is whether the plan signaled that the
shock waves of the economic crisis had finally impelled Russian
leaders to act.
</P>
<P>
   Some were skeptical. ``It is not a program,'' said Mikhail
Berger, the economic specialist and editor of the newspaper
Segodnya. ``It is a statement of intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the specter of empty store shelves, hungry soldiers and
a worthless currency, Chernomyrdin insisted he would press ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time has run out,'' Chernomyrdin said. ``Each lost day takes
months, years to make up.''

 &HT;    Former Georgia Tech coach's son killed in helicopter crash
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The son of a former ECU and Georgia Tech head football coach was
aboard one of two helicopters that collided above the Nevada desert
early Friday morning, and possibly piloted one of the crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Lewis, 28, an Air Force captain stationed at Nellis Air
Force Base, was one of 12 crew members on copters that crashed over
rugged terrain near the mysterious Area 51, an Air Force
spokeswoman said Friday from the base.
</P>
<P>
   No one survived the crash. Reports said they were believed to be
navigating through the desert darkness with night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the son of former ECU coach Bill Lewis, who coached the
Pirates to a Peach Bowl victory over N.C. State and an 11-1 season
in 1991. He coached Georgia Tech for three seasons from 1992-1994
and currently is a defensive coach with the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Lewis was one of two pilots on his helicopter, along with
co-pilot Capt. Phillip Miller. Air Force officials don't know who
was at the controls at the time of the collision. He was a student
at the Air Force Academy while his dad coached in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery crews struggled through the arid peaks and ravines in
Nevada Friday, looking for the remains and clues to the cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for survivors,'' said Brig. Gen. Theodore Lay,
commander of the 57th Wing at this base.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, part of a
rescue squadron from this base outside Las Vegas, were found at 2
a.m. Friday, 90 minutes after the choppers were due back.
</P>
<P>
   A family support center was set up at Nellis for grieving
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis learned of the collision Friday morning while working
at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, said Neal Gulkis, the
team's media relations coordinator. He flew from Miami to Georgia
where his sons Mark and Geoff live. The family then was to travel
to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The choppers were flying through the rugged Pintwater Mountain
range, an area of 6,000-foot peaks and mountainsides plunging 3,000
feet to desert valley floors. It was overcast, with light rain and
visibility of 7,000 to 9,000 feet, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known if the helicopters crashed into each other or
went down separately, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The crews were on a standard mission to practice recovering
downed pilots. Normally that involves recovering either a crew
member or a dummy from the ground, he said, adding that it was too
soon to say exactly how the fatal mission was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The crew is supposed to wear night-vision goggles on such
missions, Lay said, but he would not speculate on the possible role
of the goggles in the crash. Normally the helicopters are in radio
communication with each other, but have very little communication
with the base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the crews were on the outbound leg of the
flight, Lay said. Some live ammunition was on board the choppers,
as is normal, and that was recovered, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters are with the 66th Rescue Squadron, which
specializes in rescuing downed pilots and others from behind enemy
lines. Units recently returned from duty in Turkey and Southeast
Asia, and have seen action in the no-fly zone over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site is in the Nellis Range, 5,200 square miles of
mountain and desert northwest of Las Vegas that's used for training
and test flights.
</P>
<P>
   The site is southeast of Area 51, a top-secret section of the
range where the F-117 Stealth fighter and other classified aircraft
have been tested. The Air Force won't officially acknowledge the
existence of the area, shown on some maps as Groom Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Area 51 is a staple of science fiction; UFO enthusiasts and
conspiracy buffs are convinced the wreckage of a flying saucer they
believe crashed near Roswell, N.M., in 1947 was taken there to be
studied. The 1996 blockbuster movie ``Independence Day'' showed a
secret underground installation at Area 51 where scientists
conducted alien autopsies and probed the secrets of an
extraterrestrial space ship.
</P>
<P>
   Previous air disasters at Nellis include the January 1982 crash
in which four Air Force Thunderbird pilots slammed their jets into
the ground while practicing at Indian Springs. All four were killed
when a stabilizer stuck in the lead plane and the three others
followed him into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The HH-60G helicopter, built by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
normally carry a crew of four people, two pilots, a flight engineer
and a gunner. Some, including the two that crashed, also carry two
rescue crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said it has 99 HH-60G helicopters in use at 12
bases in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the 22nd major aviation accident in the Air Force
in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, with ``major'' defined as
causing a death or $1 million damage. That has been one of the best
records in the military, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 11-month span last year, the Air Force logged 25
major accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the 12 people killed in a helicopter crash early Friday
morning as provided by Nellis Air Force Base. Ages and hometowns
were not provided.

 &HT;    Eagles strong test of Jackets' progress
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Georgia Tech opens its season today against Boston College,
the Yellow Jackets will learn exactly how much has changed for
Boston College and how much has stayed the same for Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Yellow Jackets are back from their 42-14 blowout of
Boston College last October, a game in which they rolled up 303
yards rushing and looked bad for about the length of time it took
Quinton Lee to rush 76 yards for a touchdown on the second play of
the game. After that, it was all Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Wiley, the senior member of Tech's running-back
unit, says the Yellow Jackets have washed those memories from their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting a great game out of Boston College,'' Wiley
said. ``We're not underestimating them. I know they're a better
team. ... When we saw them, they didn't play their best game. We're
not using last year as any kind of indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two met last season, the Eagles were playing without
starting quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and Mike McCloud, their best
running back, because of injuries. Hasselbeck is gone, but Cloud is
back and healthy and the focal point of Boston College's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mutryn, who got his only start of the season against Tech,
has won the starting quarterback job and is secure in his progress
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Brian Maye, who missed last season with a neck
injury, has returned, and coach Tom O'Brien, a former George Welsh
assistant at Virginia, has established his program in his second
year.
</P>
<P>
   He knows Boston College has to be a different team against the
run this year than the one that gave up 200 yards rushing per game
last season and had a free safety, Pedro Cirino, leading the team
in tackles (130).
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a good challenge for our defenders to play
(quarterback) Joe Hamilton, (fullback Ed) Wilder and Wiley,''
O'Brien said. ``They ran all over us last year. ... We didn't stop
the run last year against anybody. George (O'Leary) was kind and
took his quarterback out midway through the third quarter. That's
something we have to concentrate on and are concerned about at
BC.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets expect Boston College to crowd the line of
scrimmage and will counter by testing their new group of receivers.
Gone is Harvey Middleton, who had two catches against the Eagles,
including a 28-yard touchdown, and Mike Sheridan, who had two
catches for 26 yards, is out with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   One area Tech wants to look different this season is on defense,
where new coordinator Randy Edsall will test his aggressive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Tech would enjoy another 42-14 win and another bowl
trip, Wiley said this team is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a feeling now, (that) we know we can (win) if we do
the things we need to do, go out and play to the best of our
ability,'' he said. ``Last year we thought maybe if we play 100
percent we'll get a win. This year it's a little different.''

 &HT;    Dogs inquisitive about QB Quincy
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens _ Perhaps no place has its finger on the pulse of Athens
sports as much as Loco's Deli &AMP; Pub on Harris Street. For months,
bartenders and patrons alike have projected that freshman
quarterback Quincy Carter would bring magic to the Bulldogs this
season.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter's almost three-year layoff from football, Georgia
fans will finally get a look at the former Parade All-American from
Southwest DeKalb High when he starts against Kent in today's opener
at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for months,'' Loco's manager Dave Bruno
said. ``All you've been hearing about is how great this guy is.
Now, we finally get to see if it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   When Georgia opened preseason camp more than a month ago, the
team's biggest question was whether Carter, who spent the past two
years playing baseball in the Chicago Cubs' minor-league system,
could learn the Bulldogs' thick playbook fast enough to earn the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   He did, enough to satisfy Georgia coach Jim Donnan, who picked
the 20-year-old rookie to start over veterans Jon England and Mike
Usry and freshman Nate Hybl. Now, Carter continues his on-the-job
training against the Golden Flashes _ and in front of Georgia's
first sellout crowd for a non-SEC home opener since the Bulldogs
opened against UCLA in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to go out and do your job,'' Carter said.
``We've got some great fans. Fortunately, they've been behind me
since I stepped on campus. They want me to do this and that, but
I'm not trying to go overboard and be Superman. I'm just trying to
do the job and not make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter assumes the position of Mike Bobo, the SEC's top-rated
passer a year ago, and he's charged with continuing the momentum of
last season's turnaround: a 10-2 record, No. 10 national ranking
and a 33-6 demolition of Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can keep that roller-coaster thing from going up
and down, so we're consistent every year,'' Donnan said. ``We've
got the capabilities of being very good. But if things don't go
right early, we've got to be careful we don't hit the panic button
and just hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, which has a 13-74-1 record this decade, probably won't be
much of a measuring stick for Carter. Georgia opens its SEC slate
at South Carolina next week, so don't expect Donnan to reveal much
of his offense. Donnan says he's installed some option offense, but
``you probably won't see much of it (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Donnan undoubtedly will want to test Carter, who gives
the Bulldogs perhaps their most mobile quarterback since James
Jackson started from 1985-87. Carter rushed for 1,489 yards and 32
touchdowns during his three years as a starter at Southwest Dekalb.
He also threw for 4,450 yards and 37 scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that he'll succeed,'' Southwest
DeKalb coach Buck Godfrey said. ``You're talking about someone that
was mature enough to start when he left here (in 1996). And then
you add those two years spent playing baseball and you've got a
prototypical quarterback. ... The only thing that Georgia has to
worry about is that the NFL will come calling in a couple of
years.''

HOMETOWN FEELING MCGWIRE MANIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ McGwire-mania is sweeping the nation, and those
feeling the brunt of the media storm are here in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many phone calls are we getting? Only about 20 million,''
said a harried receptionist at Dr. John McGwire's dental office in
Pomona. ``It's unbelievable. It's hard to get any work done around
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. McGwire has been gone most of the summer, and he isn't
giving any interviews anyway. And don't try to tell me you're one
of his patients ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mentioned in a USA Today article about Mark, and then
went away for a few days,'' said Jack Helber, who coached McGwire's
American Legion team. ``When I came back, my phone message tape was
completely filled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just about flat run out of things to say about Mark.
And while I'm at it, no, I can't get anyone tickets to Cardinals
games, or Mark's autograph. If it's that bad for me, you can
imagine what's it like for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Former USC coach Rod Dedeaux knows the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're calling for Rod Dedeaux, I'm sure you want to talk
about Mark McGwire,'' said Heidi, a receptionist at Dedeaux's
company, Dart Transportation in Los Angeles. ``I don't even have to
ask anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the McGwires, the unusual spelling of their
last name makes their listings stand out in the Pomona phone book.
Fans and the media have been relentless, especially in the past
month. Anyone with a connection to Mark McGwire is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh gosh yes, I've gotten calls from all over the country,''
said Tom Carroll, the athletic director at Damien High. ``New York
Times, USA Today, Associated Press, you name 'em, I've talked to
'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have had a bunch of photographers at the school. Most
of them aren't too happy, when they find we don't have a shrine to
Mark in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to talk about Mark, but classes are in session here now
and, at some point, we need to get things back to normal.''

 &HT;    Former Georgia Tech coach's son killed in helicopter crash
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The son of a former ECU and Georgia Tech head football coach was
aboard one of two helicopters that collided above the Nevada desert
early Friday morning, and possibly piloted one of the crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Lewis, 28, an Air Force captain stationed at Nellis Air
Force Base, was one of 12 crew members on copters that crashed over
rugged terrain near the mysterious Area 51, an Air Force
spokeswoman said Friday from the base.
</P>
<P>
   No one survived the crash. Reports said they were believed to be
navigating through the desert darkness with night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the son of former ECU coach Bill Lewis, who coached the
Pirates to a Peach Bowl victory over N.C. State and an 11-1 season
in 1991. He coached Georgia Tech for three seasons from 1992-1994
and currently is a defensive coach with the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Lewis was one of two pilots on his helicopter, along with
co-pilot Capt. Phillip Miller. Air Force officials don't know who
was at the controls at the time of the collision. He was a student
at the Air Force Academy while his dad coached in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery crews struggled through the arid peaks and ravines in
Nevada Friday, looking for the remains and clues to the cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for survivors,'' said Brig. Gen. Theodore Lay,
commander of the 57th Wing at this base.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, part of a
rescue squadron from this base outside Las Vegas, were found at 2
a.m. Friday, 90 minutes after the choppers were due back.
</P>
<P>
   A family support center was set up at Nellis for grieving
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis learned of the collision Friday morning while working
at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, said Neal Gulkis, the
team's media relations coordinator. He flew from Miami to Georgia
where his sons Mark and Geoff live. The family then was to travel
to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The choppers were flying through the rugged Pintwater Mountain
range, an area of 6,000-foot peaks and mountainsides plunging 3,000
feet to desert valley floors. It was overcast, with light rain and
visibility of 7,000 to 9,000 feet, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known if the helicopters crashed into each other or
went down separately, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The crews were on a standard mission to practice recovering
downed pilots. Normally that involves recovering either a crew
member or a dummy from the ground, he said, adding that it was too
soon to say exactly how the fatal mission was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The crew is supposed to wear night-vision goggles on such
missions, Lay said, but he would not speculate on the possible role
of the goggles in the crash. Normally the helicopters are in radio
communication with each other, but have very little communication
with the base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the crews were on the outbound leg of the
flight, Lay said. Some live ammunition was on board the choppers,
as is normal, and that was recovered, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters are with the 66th Rescue Squadron, which
specializes in rescuing downed pilots and others from behind enemy
lines. Units recently returned from duty in Turkey and Southeast
Asia, and have seen action in the no-fly zone over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site is in the Nellis Range, 5,200 square miles of
mountain and desert northwest of Las Vegas that's used for training
and test flights.
</P>
<P>
   The site is southeast of Area 51, a top-secret section of the
range where the F-117 Stealth fighter and other classified aircraft
have been tested. The Air Force won't officially acknowledge the
existence of the area, shown on some maps as Groom Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Area 51 is a staple of science fiction; UFO enthusiasts and
conspiracy buffs are convinced the wreckage of a flying saucer they
believe crashed near Roswell, N.M., in 1947 was taken there to be
studied. The 1996 blockbuster movie ``Independence Day'' showed a
secret underground installation at Area 51 where scientists
conducted alien autopsies and probed the secrets of an
extraterrestrial space ship.
</P>
<P>
   Previous air disasters at Nellis include the January 1982 crash
in which four Air Force Thunderbird pilots slammed their jets into
the ground while practicing at Indian Springs. All four were killed
when a stabilizer stuck in the lead plane and the three others
followed him into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The HH-60G helicopter, built by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
normally carry a crew of four people, two pilots, a flight engineer
and a gunner. Some, including the two that crashed, also carry two
rescue crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said it has 99 HH-60G helicopters in use at 12
bases in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the 22nd major aviation accident in the Air Force
in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, with ``major'' defined as
causing a death or $1 million damage. That has been one of the best
records in the military, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 11-month span last year, the Air Force logged 25
major accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the 12 people killed in a helicopter crash early Friday
morning as provided by Nellis Air Force Base. Ages and hometowns
were not provided.

 &HT;    Opening day means there's nowhere to go but up
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing more humbling _ and perhaps sillier _ than
predicting the stock market is picking college football games. So
given the events of the past week on Wall Street, this seems like
the perfect time to start this weekly effort. Like our portfolio,
there's no way to go but up _ we hope.
</P>
<P>
   We'll predict final scores because it's fun. We'll keep a record
of wins and losses each week in order to chart the true lack of
knowledge of your humble scribe. But be advised: we will never,
ever discuss point spreads. If you're dumb enough to bet on college
football, a game played by overdeveloped 19- and 20-year olds, you
deserve your misery.
</P>
<P>
   This first week will be particularly intriguing, as there are
more games matching nationally-ranked teams than any opening
Saturday we can remember. With that cautionary note, let us begin.
</P>
<P>
   Kent at No. 19 Georgia, 5 p.m.: Bulldog coach Jim Donnan
actually has been holding freshman quarterback Quincy Carter back
in practice because he didn't want folks to know how good this kid
really is. Today he turns him loose against the Golden Flashes, who
will be but a 25-watt bulb Between the Hedges. Georgia 52, Kent 14.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College at Georgia Tech, 3:30 p.m. (ABC): The Yellow
Jackets can be a Top 25 team if they can figure out a way to stop
somebody. Randy Edsall was hired as defensive coordinator to do
just that. The Eagles are a second-division team in a bad
conference (Big East). Georgia Tech 28, Boston College 14
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Ohio State at No. 11 West Virginia, 8 p.m. (CBS): Buckeye
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer is eligible after passing Golf and Aids
Awareness. He should be the perfect antidote for Mountaineer
running back Amos Zereoue, who hopes to use this game as a
springboard to a serious Heisman Trophy candidacy. Sorry, Amos. You
won't be famous today. Ohio State 24, West Virginia 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel at No. 3 Florida, 6 p.m.: Jesse Palmer starts at
quarterback for the Gators, who can pick their number in the Swamp.
Florida 82, Citadel 0.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Birmingham at No. 4 Nebraska. 1:30: Ditto. Nebraska 62,
UAB 6.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Michigan at No. 22 Notre Dame, 2:30 p.m. (NBC): Michigan,
the defending AP national champions, returns nine starters from the
nation's No. 2 defense. The Irish have improved, but not enough.
Still, it will be closer than most people think. Michigan 17, Notre
Dame 10.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Tennessee at No. 17 Syracuse, Noon (ESPN): Tee Martin
gets his first start at quarterback in what will be a loud, hot
Carrier Dome. The Vols can move the ball, but so can Syracuse with
quarterback Donovan McNabb. Better bring lunch and dinner to this
one. It will be a shootout. Tennessee 38, Syracuse 31.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Southern Miss at No. 13 Penn State, 2:30 p.m.: Southern
Miss has a history of going into hostile stadiums and scaring the
home team. The Golden Eagles will do it again on Saturday but come
up short. Penn State 17, Southern Miss 13.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Colorado State vs. Colorado at Denver, 10 p.m. (ESPN):
The Rams, which opened the season by winning at Michigan State last
Saturday, have been looking forward to this game for more than over
a year. Colorado is the underdog after struggling last season, and
with good reason. Colorado State 24, Colorado 20.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida at Louisiana Tech, 7 p.m.: This game would have
been on television, but the network brass was afraid it would last
too long. La. Tech's Tim Rattay threw for 590 yards against
Nebraska last week. Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper may be the
best quarterback in the country. La. Tech 45, Central Florida 42.
</P>
<P>
   The rest: Ole MIss 24, Memphis 10; Kentucky 34, Louisville 17.;
Miss. State 17, Vanderbilt 7; BYU 28, Alabama 21; South Carolina
17, Ball State 7; Clemson 31, Furman 14; North Carolina 45, Miami
(Ohio) 17.

One of the biggest draws, and biggest expenses, of the annual West
Indian American Day Carnival are the elaborate costumes like this
one being assembled by Mitch Phillips. Masquerade bands will spend
as much as $50,000 to march on Monday, the parade's 31st
anniversary. (Chester Higgins Jr./New York Times Photo)

At the Decoy Museum in Havre de Grace, duck decoys surround a
likeness of R. Madison Mitchell, a well-known local carver. This
area was duck hunter's nirvana until a series of laws during the
1930s and '40s curtailed hunting. (Marty Katz/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT18) NEW YORK -- Sept. 4, 1998 -- CLINTON-KIDS-2, 9-4 --
Kenny Prosper, a 14-year-old Bronx boy, says that his father
``played'' his mother many years ago, deserting the family and
sending them cascading into poverty and homelessness. If he were
Clinton's wife, Kenny says, ``I'd slap him silly.'' If he were the
president's daughter, ``I'd tell my mom to leave him, forget about
him. And I'd never think about him as an influence again.'' (Vic

<P>
   (NYT17) HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. -- Sept. 4, 1998 --
CLINTON-KIDS-1, 9-4 -- ``The president and Monica Lewinsky had a
thing even though he was married to somebody else,'' says Chloe
Carrano, who is about to begin third grade in Hastings-on-Hudson.
America's children are aware that President Clinton was unfaithful
to his wife, but they seem less interested in the sexual details of
the White House scandal than the moral shortcomings of a man who
would deceive and hurt his family. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times

Third-seeded Jana Novotna during her 6-2, 6-3, defeat of France's

the second round. (Vic Delucia/New York Times Photo) *LITE

   (NYT15) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 4, 1998 -- CLINTON-LIEBERMAN, 9-4 --
``I felt lonely out there,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman says of
delivering his recent speech critical of President Clinton.
Lieberman, a Democrat and longtime political ally of Clinton's,
says he was furious with the president - first for bad behavior,
second for behavior that he says undercut the theme of ``personal
responsibility'' that Clinton and Lieberman had advocated over the
years. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

Lurie's latest novel is set in Key West, Fla., where she has a
home. Lurie is a transoceanic novelist, equally at home on both
sides of the Atlantic, but with an even greater following in
England than in the United States. Although she lives most of the
year in Ithaca, N.Y., where she teaches children's literature at
Cornell University, she keeps an apartment in London. (Sara

INVEST-ALTERNATIVES, 9-4 -- Michael Matheson, 51, an investor in
Chicago, says he will keep his money in stocks. ``I was sitting on
my ledge, thinking about jumping,'' jokes Matheson after last
Monday's 512-point dive in the Dow Jones industrial average. But he
decided to leave his stock investments - about 60 percent of his
portfolio - where they were. ``If I sold now, I'd be sitting here
with a pile of cash and asking, 'What would I do with it?' `` (Todd

can track his investments over the Internet, even while watching
his sons, Eli, left, and Zachary. Most investors who track the
movements of their stocks on the Internet - about three million now
have on-line brokerage accounts - are enthusiastic about the

Pennsylvania Caveat Emptor Investment Club, giving a report on a
prospect. The club gets together on the first Wednesday of every
month to review its holdings, analyze new companies, check the
status of its ``fantasy stock game,'' and vote on new stock
purchases. This month was no different, even though the club's
portfolio got clobbered by the recent stock market swing. (Tim

waste a lot of time analyzing the big picture at the expense of
weighing business fundamentals. He and entertainer Lily Tomlin are
starring in a new series of Fidelity commercials. (Librado

CANCER-FUND-RAISERS, 9-4 -- Elizabeth Tilberis, editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar. Because of the advocacy of the socially prominent
and well-connected Ms. Tilberis and a handful of grass-roots
organizations, along with recent developments in diagnosis and
treatment, ovarian cancer has finally begun to make inroads into
the charitable arena dominated by more easily marketed diseases
like breast cancer and AIDS. (Librado Romero/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT3) NEW YORK -- Sept. 4, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT. 6 --
WALLPAPER-MAGAZINE-3, 9-4 -- A1956 George Nelson chaise at Form and
Function in SoHo. A wave of downtowners who once embodied the
``Rent'' life style, partial to thrift-store fashions and long
hours at coffee houses, has been transformed into an upwardly
mobile crowd. They can be described as the Wallpaper Generation,
after the two-year-old design and life-style magazine that has
given an ultra-hip spin to the retro-future look of the postwar
decades. (David Corio/New York Times Photo)

WALLPAPER-MAGAZINE-2, 9-4 -- Frankie Inglese, a downtown deejay, at
home with his collection of vintage electronics. He traces his love
of space age design to mid-'60s album covers. ``It's nearly the
year 2000,'' he says. ``We have great technology, like cell phones,
the Internet and digital cameras. But we're still sitting on
eyesores by Ikea. This is not what the future was supposed to look
like.'' (Boyd Hagen/New York Times Photo)

WALLPAPER-MAGAZINE-1, 9-4 -- Ed Briggs and Kelly Galligan, in their
Chelsea apartment, are among the grunge slackers cleaning up their
acts and turning to mid-century modern furnishings like those
featured in Wallpaper magazine. ``We call it the Change,'' Briggs,
46, says. ``A lot of our friends have gone through it, too.'' Their

age lamps. (Boyd Hagen/New York Times Photo) *LITE

Kenny Prosper, a 14-year-old Bronx boy, says that his father
``played'' his mother many years ago, deserting the family and
sending them cascading into poverty and homelessness. If he were
Clinton's wife, Kenny says, ``I'd slap him silly.'' If he were the
president's daughter, ``I'd tell my mom to leave him, forget about
him. And I'd never think about him as an influence again.'' (Vic

Carrano, who is about to begin third grade in Hastings-on-Hudson.
America's children are aware that President Clinton was unfaithful

the White House scandal than the moral shortcomings of a man who
would deceive and hurt his family. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Every day was St. Patrick's Day at Sue Basso's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was green,'' recalled Richard Charlesworth, who
lived with Basso's family after losing his job in 1996. He
remembered green streamers and Irish-theme decorations that were
never taken down. There were fine Irish whiskeys and an ample
collection of Irish music on compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``She even had a shamrock-shaped telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   This Celtic obsession had started long before. In 1990, she
convinced her family to legally adopt an Irish surname, despite a
lack of evidence that any of them were Irish. In a holiday picture
from around that time, Sue and her husband beam as they show off a
shamrock-applique photo album.
</P>
<P>
   But if Basso could be charmingly eccentric, she also struggled
her whole life with a dark side that alienated her family and
spooked the people she befriended. She told lies for no apparent
reason, they said, and had a violent temper. Once, she was accused
of sexually abusing her son.
</P>
<P>
   Today she, that same son and four family friends are in the
Harris County Jail, held without bond on charges of capital murder
in the savage beating death of Louis ``Buddy'' Musso, a 59-year-old
mentally impaired man Basso had taken in.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police are looking into whether Basso, 44, had a hand in
the May 1997 demise of Carmine Joseph Basso, whose name Sue had
adopted a couple of years earlier when she started telling people
they were married. Carmine was 47 when he died, and the cause of
his death was listed at the time as natural.
</P>
<P>
   And authorities in the Houston area and New Jersey, where
Carmine was from, are investigating whether there are other
mentally impaired people who accepted the woman's kindness and
became victims.
</P>
<P>
   The truth will be difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   With Suzanne Burns Peek O'Malley Basso, it always is.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Basso was a pack rat.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her arrest, her tiny rent house in Jacinto City,
a community of 10,000 just west of Houston, was stuffed with
plastic storage boxes, clothes, records and CDs, stereos and
television equipment. A bedroom had been converted into a cramped
office. There were a dog, a cat and two ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   But Basso collected people as well, usually folks she could keep
under her thumb. Homeless people, mentally ill and retarded, the
outcast. Her daughter, Christi Hardy of Houston, recalls that her
parents always had somebody living with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would pick almost anyone up off the street,'' Hardy said.
``They were weird like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said Hardy's husband, the couple would then brag on
themselves for their good-heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, after he lost his job at Home Depot,
Charlesworth gladly accepted this generosity. Basso, who worked as
a security guard at an apartment complex in southwest Houston,
offered to let him stay in their two-story apartment rather than
see him homeless.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, noticed many strange things.
</P>
<P>
   The grown son _ James David O'Malley Jr., whom he knew as
``J.D.'' _ was forced to eat on the floor, for instance, and
Charlesworth was quietly assigned the role of baby sitter. The
young man frightened him somewhat, he said, because of his quick
temper.
</P>
<P>
   Sue sometimes would lock the two in the house before going out.
</P>
<P>
   But the oddest thing was the mystery over whom Sue was married
to.
</P>
<P>
   She lived with James O'Malley Sr., but introduced Carmine Basso
as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Carmine, a wiry man with a thick mop of hair who liked to
chain-smoke Kools cigarettes, and Sue got into some terrible
fights.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, Sue had taken out an elaborate wedding
announcement in the Houston Chronicle. Most of the claims in the ad
_ that Sue was heir to a Nova Scotian oil dynasty and that Carmine
had won the Medal of Honor, that they had a young ``very
exceptional'' daughter together, for instance _ were shown to be
fabricated. And the $1,372.50 bill was never paid.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Harris County Clerk's Office has no marriage license
on record for them. Court records show that while Suzanne O'Malley
filed for divorce from James O'Malle Sr. on April 12, 1996, the
proceedings were dropped the following Jan. 7 because no one
pursued it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy thinks the wedding story was yet another product of her
mother's hyperactive imagination. She noted that her parents were
never apart and that Sue kept O'Malley on a tight leash, ordering
him to work overtime in his security guard job against his will and
refusing to let him get a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   (The elder O'Malley, now serving time in the Harris County Jail
for assaulting his wife, declined to be interviewed for this
article. So, too, did Basso, her son and each of their
co-defendants.)
</P>
<P>
   Charlesworth, now 44 and living in an apartment in northwest
Houston, said he also was puzzled when Sue introduced him to
Carmine as her ``long-lost brother,'' a psychologist. The only time
she ever got really angry with him, he said, was when she found out
he had admitted to Carmine that he was actually a hardware store
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Charlesworth declined an offer to accompany Sue,
O'Malley Sr., J.D. and Carmine to New Jersey. When he saw J.D. a
few months later, after the group had returned to Houston, the
young man had news: Carmine was dead.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only reason he turned down their offer to move
back in, opting to remain on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like living with the Addams Family,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A HISTORY OF TROUBLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sue Basso's troubles began early, in Schenectady, N.Y., when she
was the youngest and cutest of three daughters in a family of eight
children. An older sister described an abusive childhood that
seemed to take its heaviest emotional toll on Sue. She skipped
school, sneaked out of the house late at night and, after being
sent to a school for troubled girls, got caught stealing a car.
</P>
<P>
   Sue's now-grown daughter, who has cut all ties with her, said
Sue's life as a married woman was equally erratic, marked by a
series of affairs. She also remembered her mother throwing her out
of the house after walking in to find O'Malley Sr. molesting her.
</P>
<P>
   Always an attractive woman, Sue began putting on weight in the
late 1970s and, as her daughter said, ``letting herself go.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have known her over the years don't seem surprised
that Sue Basso is in trouble, but they are shocked to learn she is
charged with murder. Her most serious charge to date was for
forging a check in 1989, and she received deferred adjudication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suzanne has always had a troubled life, but I never, ever
thought she would do anything like this,'' said Carol LeRoy, her
oldest sister, who still lives in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in a fantasy world. It's not like she's disconnected
from reality or anything. She just has a different way of looking
at things.''
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy has not seen her sister in more than a decade and is
hesitant to talk in detail about their childhood, describing it
generally as ``dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was physical abuse. There was sexual abuse,'' she said.
``Suzanne was a victim of both.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the other children in the family grew up with no major
problems, Sue suffered through more than the typical teen-age
rebelliousness. At 14, she was sent by the courts to St. Anne's
Institute, a Catholic school for troubled girls in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   (Years later, in the bogus wedding announcement in the
Chronicle, Sue Basso described herself as a ``valedictorian
graduate of Saint Anne's Institute of Yorkshire, England.'' Friends
and family say it was a typical twisting of the truth.)
</P>
<P>
   After school, she married a Marine named James David Peek. Said
her sister, ``They seemed like they were going to lead a pretty
normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage was far from normal. Hardy, the older of the
Peeks' two children, said that when she was a child, her mother
brought home a procession of lovers. Sometimes she would send her
children to their rooms or her husband out onto the porch while she
had sex with the men.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' said Hardy, 25, who today
attends classes for medical transcription and lives in a
working-class neighborhood with a husband and children of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, when you're brought up around that, it's just
part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The family moved from New York to North Carolina when Christi _
known then by her birth name, Mary Anne Margaret Peek _ was 5. They
then moved briefly to Houston, then returned to a trailer park in
North Carolina in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Her paternal grandparents, Hardy recalled, bought the kids most
of their Christmas presents. Of her parents, she remembers chaos.
Her mom was temperamental, she said, ``never the pleasant mother.''
There were drunken rages, wild accusations, visits by the police.
</P>
<P>
   And sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said she and her brother were sent to foster homes after
their father was convicted in August 1982 in Onslow County, N.C.,
of taking indecent liberties with a child and sentenced to three
years in prison. According to the North Carolina Department of
Corrections, Peek served less than a year before being paroled.
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy took the children for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got involved and probably shouldn't have,'' she said. ``It
got Suzanne a little more involved in my life than I was able to
deal with at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw her sister, she said, was in 1987 when Sue
returned to New York ``because she had problems psychologically and
she thought she could come into New York state and could take the
children back to Texas with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents didn't regain custody, however, and young Mary Anne
(Christi) went to live with her maternal grandmother elsewhere in
New York. The boy, Harold John Peek _ now 23 and known as James
O'Malley Jr. _ was sent to live with an aunt in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The pair gravitated back to their mother when they were young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, James and Sue Peek had their names legally changed to
O'Malley and began referring to their son as James David O'Malley
Jr. _ ``J.D.'' for short. The reason Sue gave was that some
ancestor had declared in a will that he wanted the family to take
the O'Malley name. But as with many of her mother's stories, Hardy
could find no truth in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shortly before she married Scott Hardy in 1992, Mary Anne
Margaret Peek moved to Houston and changed her name to Christianna
Dianna O'Malley. She goes by Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two children, they were so bonded to her it was a
foregone conclusion they were going to end up with her,'' LeRoy
said of Sue's pull on her son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But again, it was a turbulent relationship. Hardy's husband, who
worked as a security guard with James Peek/O'Malley and knew the
family before he met Christi, said he once had to step in when Sue
cuffed J.D. repeatedly for breaking an Irish figurine.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hardy also recalled that Sue nailed windows shut to keep
her son from leaving the apartment while she was away. He said she
ordered her son to a local mall to shoplift and to beg for leftover
rolls from Cinnabon. He said J.D. repeatedly complained that his
mother was forcing him to have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hay, spokeswoman for Harris County Children's Protective
Services, said her agency and Houston police investigated
allegations made by James O'Malley Jr. when he was 17 that he was
being sexually abused. Neither found the allegations to be valid,
Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that Sue Basso was manipulative and domineering.
Scott Hardy said the O'Malleys would serve guests on the few pieces
of fine china they owned, then warn them not to break it because of
how much it cost. They subscribed to magazines like the New Yorker
simply to impress visitors.
</P>
<P>
   For many who knew her, the strain of a relationship with Sue
Basso ultimately proved too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have a close relationship with her because, quite
frankly, I couldn't trust her,'' said LeRoy, recounting the lost
years with her sister. ``I just realized I had to put distance
between her and I if I was going to be able to function. It's very
painful to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   They feel guilty, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy repeatedly expressed a desire to apologize to the family
of the victim in the slaying case, Buddy Musso. A jogger discovered
Musso's body on the morning of Aug. 26 near a ditch in Galena Park,
a community of 11,000 just west of Houston. He had been savagely
beaten _ for breaking a Mickey Mouse ornament, police were told.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think Musso was killed the night before in the
home of the four other defendants, an apartment in southwest
Houston. They say the attackers stripped him after the beating and
threw him into a bathtub filled with bleach and pine-scented
kitchen cleaner, possibly while he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still dealing with this,'' said LeRoy. ``Part of my
problem is being the oldest child. It's like a second mother. I've
always had this sense of responsibility. It feels for me, just
thinking about this, that maybe if I had had more influence or time
trying to get through to her it wouldn't have been this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Also charged, along with Sue Basso and her son, are Bernice
Ahrens, 54; her son, Craig Ahrens, 25; her daughter, Hope Ahrens,
22; and the daughter's fiance, Terence Singleton, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Ahrens, a file clerk for a health-care business, had
moved into the apartment with her two children in late 1996.
Singleton moved in later.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment manager Donna Higgins said the family paid their rent
on time and never caused problems, but little more information
about them has emerged. Ahrens' employer called her a dedicated
worker who had never missed a day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A TYPE OF SERVITUDE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Musso, a widower described by a niece as having the mind
of a child, was the last person to live with Sue and her family. By
all accounts, it was not a pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Musso had been in an assisted-living home in Cliffside Park,
N.J., before boarding a Greyhound bus for Texas in June. He
received monthly Social Security checks and bagged groceries at a
local store. His son, Antonio, told The (Bergen County, N.J.)
Record that Musso had told him he had purchased an engagement ring
for Sue Basso, whom he had met at a church bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he had been led to believe they were going to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Musso was forced into a type of servitude, ordered to
sleep on a mattress in the living room of Basso's cluttered home.
Their landlord saw Basso order Musso around, having him carry in
groceries and take out the trash. A neighbor recalled seeing Musso
a few days before his death, beaten and bloody but afraid to call
police.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief Robert Pruett of the Galena Park police said the
man had been deprived of food as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 26, Sue Basso was asking people who lived
nearby if they had seen Buddy. ``He's missing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett said she reported the same to police before a jogger
found the body along Main Street. It didn't take long, he said, to
find inconsistencies in Basso's story.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has since found a ``so-called last will and
testament'' of questionable legality for Musso. He said it
specifies that Sue Basso receive all insurance benefits, but that
police have been unable to find any life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the death of Carmine Basso is being investigated as
well. He was found dead in his Latin Security office, but an
autopsy listed the manner of death as natural and the cause to be
erosive esophagitis, complicated by malnourishment. (Esophagitis,
sometimes referred to as gastroesophagal reflux disease, is marked
by severe heartburn caused by the backflow of stomach acid into the
esophagus.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going to look at it,'' said Houston police
Sgt. Tom Ladd. ``I've got to get with the medical examiner and go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett said Sue Basso claimed at the time to be in New Jersey
when she called Houston police last year to report she had not
heard from her ``husband,'' Carmine. But he said he now has a
witness who claims she actually was in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So Pruett is learning what many others already know: With Sue,
the truth is often hard to figure.

Kenny Prosper, a 14-year-old Bronx boy, says that his father
``played'' his mother many years ago, deserting the family and
sending them cascading into poverty and homelessness. If he were
Clinton's wife, Kenny says, ``I'd slap him silly.'' If he were the
president's daughter, ``I'd tell my mom to leave him, forget about
him. And I'd never think about him as an influence again.'' (Vic

CLINTON-KIDS-1, 9-4 -- ``The president and Monica Lewinsky had a

Carrano, who is about to begin third grade in Hastings-on-Hudson.
America's children are aware that President Clinton was unfaithful
to his wife, but they seem less interested in the sexual details of
the White House scandal than the moral shortcomings of a man who
would deceive and hurt his family. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times

``I felt lonely out there,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman says of
delivering his recent speech critical of President Clinton.
Lieberman, a Democrat and longtime political ally of Clinton's,
says he was furious with the president - first for bad behavior,
second for behavior that he says undercut the theme of ``personal
responsibility'' that Clinton and Lieberman had advocated over the
years. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

Lurie's latest novel is set in Key West, Fla., where she has a

sides of the Atlantic, but with an even greater following in
England than in the United States. Although she lives most of the

Cornell University, she keeps an apartment in London. (Sara

Exchange messenger, takes a break last Tuesday in the Trinity

INVEST-ALTERNATIVES, 9-4 -- Michael Matheson, 51, an investor in
Chicago, says he will keep his money in stocks. ``I was sitting on
my ledge, thinking about jumping,'' jokes Matheson after last
Monday's 512-point dive in the Dow Jones industrial average. But he
decided to leave his stock investments - about 60 percent of his

the charitable arena dominated by more easily marketed diseases
like breast cancer and AIDS. (Librado Romero/New York Times Photo)

WALLPAPER-MAGAZINE-3, 9-4 -- A1956 George Nelson chaise at Form and
Function in SoHo. A wave of downtowners who once embodied the
``Rent'' life style, partial to thrift-store fashions and long
hours at coffee houses, has been transformed into an upwardly
mobile crowd. They can be described as the Wallpaper Generation,
after the two-year-old design and life-style magazine that has
given an ultra-hip spin to the retro-future look of the postwar
decades. (David Corio/New York Times Photo)

of space age design to mid-'60s album covers. ``It's nearly the

the Internet and digital cameras. But we're still sitting on

</P>
<P>
   The market for heroin in Dallas-Fort Worth began to heat up two
years ago as young people began using it not just in the suburbs
but in inner-city Fort Worth and Dallas, where young addicts left
crack to the ``old people,'' according to dealers and law
enforcement experts.
</P>
<P>
   Lemarcus Tyrone ``T-Dog'' Williams, 25, said he sold more heroin
than crack in the years he was dealing out of a house in the Stop
Six neighborhood of Fort Worth. Only four of his 20 friends did not
use heroin, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   He increasingly sold to white youths from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These white kids come and buy double and triple what people in
my neighborhood buy,'' Williams said. ``They're scared to come to
my neighborhood, so they buy more.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was arrested last year on heroin and cocaine
charges, is serving nine years in prison for possession with intent
to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin has been in my neighborhood ever since I can
remember,'' he said. ``Where were the feds before? As long as you
stay in your own neighborhood, they leave you alone. They just came
after us because a bunch of white people started coming to my
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade of law enforcement crackdowns in South Florida and in
California helped push heroin traffickers to develop routes into
Texas, drug agents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the Pillsbury Dough Boy effect. You punch them in
the tummy and it sticks out somewhere else,'' said U.S. Senior
District Judge John Kane in Denver, a critic of the national drug
strategy on interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, traffickers began flooding North Texas
neighborhoods with highly potent forms of black tar heroin that can
be snorted, and major dealers began moving into the area, the DEA's
Lunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first was Juan Nieves Mendoza-Villanueva of Fort
Worth, who operated a cocaine distribution ring dating to the
mid-1980s, then began selling heroin, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mendoza-Villanueva was arrested in 1997, his organization
was smuggling 2 pounds of black tar heroin _ almost $1 million
worth _ each month, Lunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza-Villanueva, 44, a distant relative of jailed Mexican
drug kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego, is serving a 191/2-year federal
sentence in Fort Worth. After Mendoza-Villanueva's arrest, DEA
officials say another Fort Worth dealer moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Nieves Mendoza was down, Jose Vega right after that gets
arrested in just a matter of months with 3 pounds of Mexican black
tar heroin,'' Lunt said. ``There are organizations out there ready
to take another organization's place.''
</P>
<P>
   Vega, 36, has been indicted on heroin charges and is scheduled
to go on trial Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican heroin traffickers control 90 percent of the Texas
market, but smugglers from Colombia, Nigeria, Russia and Turkey
have also set up shop here and throughout the United States,
looking for a piece of the lucrative action, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of entrepreneurs out there who have targeted
the U.S. market,'' said Don Ferrarone, a retired DEA special agent
who was in charge of the Houston office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Turkish drug ring wrapped 163 pounds of heroin in
wax, placed it in water softener containers and shipped it on a
commercial flight from Istanbul to D/FW Airport, said Paul Coggins,
U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas. The heroin, worth
an estimated $46 million on the street, was then trucked to Lubbock
in West Texas, where the drug ring wanted to test the North
American market by pushing heroin in Dallas-Fort Worth as well as
in large Northern cities, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The ring was discovered after a tip from European authorities,
Coggins said. Investigators found an estimated 50 pounds of heroin
in a shed at the importer's residence. He led authorities to the
rest of the stash, the largest seizure of Southwest Asian heroin in
the United States and the sixth-largest of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the last of five men was convicted of setting
up the organization. The convictions put a dent in the ring,
Coggins said.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary dent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be naive to think that we shut that organization down
completely,'' he said. ``It's more accurate to say that we've stung
them, but they may move to another town like Wichita Falls or San
Angelo.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers are armed with all the high-tech gadgetry that
enormous drug profits can buy. They use night-vision goggles,
automatic weapons, cellular telephones that have been ``cloned''
with stolen phone numbers that are impossible to trace, encrypted
phones that scramble conversations, and portable radios that are
readily available in Army surplus stores or on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Area distributors sometimes use computers to organize their
highly profitable enterprises and remote video cameras to track the
movements of law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers also rely on years of accumulated information about
law enforcement strategies to stay a step ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Nestoroff, the DPS airplane smuggling expert, distributed
brochures listing the ``signs of a smuggler'' to small Texas
airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they posted the brochures up on the board at the airport
and they (the traffickers) were right there, writing down what it
said and learning what to be careful about,'' Nestoroff said.
</P>
<P>
   To elude authorities who rely on such profiles, traffickers
became equal opportunity employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would see a lone man headed to San
Antonio and you would say, `Ah ha, there's our heroin smuggler,' ''
said Robert Gonzalez, a U.S. customs inspector at the Hidalgo
international bridge, about seven miles from McAllen in far South
Texas. ``Now we catch all types _ men and women, old and young, one
man or a whole family.''

   UNDATED: xxx whole family.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers also use a multitude of smuggling methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffickers become smarter in time,'' the DEA's
Villaescusa said. ``You have three seizures at the airport and,
boom, they will adjust and won't use the airport for a while and
use another way to get it here.''
</P>
<P>
   When smugglers saw that U.S. officials were getting more
sophisticated at stopping small airplanes hauling drugs, they
started using trucks, which are virtually camouflaged among the
thousands of trucks crossing the border each day _ traffic that
continues to grow as the North American Free Trade Agreement
eliminates trade barriers at U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   To elude Texas highway patrol officers who monitor the area's
drug pipeline roads _ Interstates 35, 30 and 20 and U.S. 59 and 75
_ smugglers divide large shipments of heroin into multiple
vehicles, making it more difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what these guys doing interdiction stops are
facing,'' the DPS' Caley said. ``They are looking for the mother
lode, but the mother's babies are getting by. There are smaller
loads that are going by in pickups and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers exploit the increased air routes to Central and
South America from D/FW Airport. They ship drugs in the cargo holds
of airliners and hide their stashes behind walls in toilets.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines intensified its anti-drug efforts, including
use of drug-sniffing dogs, when it added flights to Latin America
in 1990, spokesman Tim Smith said. But there are no machines that
can screen for drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers, on the other hand, have their own drug dogs to
``sniff-proof'' drug cargo. They also buy into established
companies to help disguise their illicit trade, federal officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of new money-laundering laws requiring banks to
report deposits larger than $10,000, drug organizations changed
their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we got more sophisticated, they got even better at money
laundering,'' the Customs Service's Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   With huge profits at stake, heroin traffickers have become more
violent.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation can be swift and deadly for dealers and couriers who
break rank. ``There's cases up and down Texas of someone losing a
load and turning up in a car, gagged, with their hands tied and
shot execution-style,'' said Roberto Medina, U.S. Customs Service
associate agent in charge in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those on the front lines of the drug war say that law
enforcement efforts against the heroin flow can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrarone recommends persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this takes a total commitment that doesn't go away
every time we have a new administration,'' he said. ``You get a
bunch of smart people together, devise a plan and turn up the heat
and cause the organizations to basically run out of fuel. But it
doesn't happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-coordinated, hardball efforts such as the investigation in
Plano can reinforce the message that a community won't stand for
drug trafficking, said Mike Bradford, U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District of Texas. The indictments were the result of cooperation
among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the drugs go elsewhere, then we'll worry about that another
time, because we need help right now here,'' U.S. Attorney Coggins
said.

SPORTS COLUMN: EVERYBODY CELEBRATES THE NEXT ONE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Everybody has been making a fuss over the natural,
mechanical and pharmaceutical wonder of Mark McGwire's
ever-thickening forearms.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking in the wrong place, according to the man who
managed him in Oakland and now here on McGwire's incessant home run
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the power emanating from his mind,'' said Tony La
Russa, a law-school graduate who is entitled to use four-syllable
words. ``Forget his rippling muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   With history ahead of him and Sammy Sosa right on his back,
McGwire and his rippling mind and muscles went back to work Friday
night. The effervescent Senor Sosa had already sent out his 57th
homer in the first inning in Pittsburgh, a little reminder that he
is not going away, and that the home run race may not be decided
until the final Sunday, 22 days from now.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came into Friday night's game with 59 homers. The next
one would tie the old record of Babe Ruth, still the greatest
slugger of all. The 61st homer would tie the baseball record set by
the vastly undervalued Roger Maris in 1961. And the third home run
would make at least two people rich _ McGwire and whoever caught
the ball (or the next of kin).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire skipped a pre-game news conference that had been
organized by Major League Baseball. The word was that he needed
time to prepare for the game in his own way. So far, that approach
has served him well this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great spring training, a great April, a great May, a
great June, a great July,'' La Russa said with what actually
sounded like awe.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the baseball-loving world has become enchanted with
the mano-a-mano being staged by these two sluggers. Even their
opponents can admit to a bit of a thrill when McGwire or Sosa hits
one out.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa, however, must control his reaction as judiciously as a
man with legal training can do. There are times when La Russa has
not been able to celebrate one of McGwire's moon shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunc and I were talking about this in spring training,'' La
Russa said, referring to his longtime pitching coach, Dave Duncan.
``We said we just hope we can enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season, McGwire had a better chance of passing
Ruth and Maris than the Cardinals did of winning the World Series.
Nobody thought they were a powerhouse, which raised the question:
Tell me, Miss Manners, what does a manager do when his big boy
blasts one halfway to the Cahokia Indian Mounds, but the Cardinals
are trailing, 10-2? Does he jump up (and possibly skull himself on
the concrete dugout roof?) and scream and shout? Or does he glower
and mutter, ``Way to go''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we don't have a winning record,'' La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals went into last night's game with a 67-72 record,
but they also had a 27-22 record in games in which McGwire homered,
so La Russa and his players have been able to smile after the
majority of those games.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa recalled last night how, when he managed in Oakland, he
felt privileged to watch Jose Canseco hit 40 homers and steal 40
bases, and Dave Stewart win the Cy Young Award, and Bob Welch win
27 games, and Rickey Henderson hit homers or steal bases as a
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no disrespect to any of them, this is just thrilling,''
La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa watched Sosa run out and mix viscerally with the fans
after games and suggested to McGwire that he do the same thing, but
he knew the answer: ``Mark said it wasn't his style.'' However, La
Russa passes on the word that McGwire loves and respects Sosa, and
so does La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps Player A if Player B and Player C are having great
years,'' La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa and McGwire go back to 1986, and were reunited last
season when McGwire came over in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was set up to fail,'' La Russa said, meaning the
expectations were so high that some players might slip back a
level.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire is still growing in body and mind at 34, passing
Johnny Mize as the oldest player ever to hit 50 or more home runs
in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate how difficult this is,'' La Russa said,
adding: ``I feel we've all been privileged. We see it. Mark is in a
zone. I'll admit it. I get goose pimples.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has had to pretend his skin was not quivering from
pride and respect. On the next three homers, Miss Manners would
surely say, it is cool to exult, no matter what the score.

HOUSTON'S STOCKS HIT EARLY, HARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Area investors lamenting this week's stock market
carnage would have felt a lot more pain if they heavily invested in
local companies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's market swoon pummeled Houston stocks earlier and
harder than stocks elsewhere. Once again, the city's dependence on
energy businesses and other commodities is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil-service stocks, in particular, have suffered severely
in this market and I think it's somewhat overdone,'' said money
manager Richard J. Fruth of Richard J. Fruth &AMP; Associates in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A look at 50 of Houston's biggest publicly traded companies
showed the average stock was down 18.8 percent for the year through
last Friday. &UR;  &LR; That compares to a 0.36 percent rise in Standard &AMP;
Poor's benchmark of 500 large companies through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 losers, all of which lost more than 50 percent, were
all businesses in oil and gas, and oil-field services, according to
the list.
</P>
<P>
   The list was compiled by Chase Bank of Texas, with updated
calculations by the Houston Chronicle using information from
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston companies were definitely hit harder than the overall
stock market because of the concentration of energy companies in
the population,'' said Henry Lartigue, Chase's chief investment
officer. ``It's the energy stocks that are pulling this average
down.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some notable winners on the list. The top 10 companies
were in a variety of industries and included American General Corp.
(financial services), Compaq Computer Corp., NL Industries
(pigments and specialty chemicals), BMC Software and Waste
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer stocks in general this year have done pretty well,''
Lartigue said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Houston stocks makes a strong case that while
it's good for an investor who knows local companies well to invest
in some hometown favorites, it's also important to diversify by
looking outside this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have such a concentration of energy companies that in
the boom times, we tend to overperform and in the lean times, we
tend to take it on the chin more than others,'' said David Lapin,
president of Lapin &AMP; Wigginton Asset Management in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices for commodities, ranging from grains to gas, also
has hit mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   In precious metals, gold prices have been dismal, and that's
stung the stock of Battle Mountain Gold Co., a Houston gold-mining
company.
</P>
<P>
   Battle Mountain stock, which was down 16 percent last year, has
slid even further, falling 19.6 percent for the year through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold has lost its status over about the past decade as an
inflation hedge, primarily because if you're scared of inflation or
some sort of political problem in your country, it's a lot easier
to move into another country's currency,'' said Lynn Bernard Jr.,
executive vice president of global investment strategies at
Pinnacle Management &AMP; Trust in Houston, a money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of gold by central banks around the world also have
depressed gold prices, said portfolio manager B.J. Willingham,
president of Willingham Asset Management in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The problems locally are not just related to falling commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies in the consolidation business _ buying
smaller operators and building national operations _ have also been
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the consolidators have been hit pretty hard
recently,'' said Mel Cody, an analyst at Sanders Morris Mundy in
Houston, an investment bank that has advised many consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Falling share prices are particularly bad news for these
companies because they use their shares for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   So when stock prices fall, ``that means the currency you use for
acquisitions is being devalued,'' Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   While Houston's economy is more diversified than it was before
the Oil Bust, commodity prices still matter most.
</P>
<P>
   While the value of oil company stocks moved up late this week _
reacting to oil prices moving above $14 a barrel and moves by
companies to buy back shares _ they still are depressed for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the commodity price comes down, the market will start to
mark down the value of companies that have reserves in the ground
because it makes proven reserves worth less,'' Lartigue said.
``Since the price has come down so hard, a lot of the exploration
companies will simply delay doing further exploration, and that is
even worse on the companies in the service business that provide
the drilling pipe, the rig.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in oil and gas prices is part of a general decline that
had pushed commodity prices to 21-year lows. This is explained by
an oversupply of some commodities, according to Goldman Sachs, a
New York investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Houston energy stocks started feeling the pain earlier than the
rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because oil prices started to come under pressure earlier in
the year, the energy stocks have been weak since the beginning of
the year,'' Lartigue said. ``Most of these energy stocks peaked
last year and started down.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices haven't fallen as much as crude oil prices,
but they have suffered because of a glut that had its roots in last
year's warm winter and a seasonal downturn that always hits between
the hot summer months and the winter heating season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop in energy stocks, Lartigue argues they're still
a good investment long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hiccup that we've gone through is simply a pullback in
the price of oil,'' he said. ``Overall, the demand for energy
should rise over the next five years because developing countries
are growing and they will have greater demand for energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian troubles also figure into the declines here in several
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many commodities, including oil, are priced in U.S.
dollars, the dollar's strength against Asian currencies has made
them more expensive for overseas customers, Goldman Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's financial crisis has shut down the region's construction
projects, cutting demand for such industrial metals as aluminum,
copper, nickel and zinc, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Coach USA, a company that operates bus lines, saw its stock
plummet from a high of 52 in July to 27 3/4 Friday. Investors are
worried that a reduction in Asian tourists will hurt Coach's West
Coast operations, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   Falling stock prices have made companies skittish about going
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of capital raised in Houston over the last
several years in energy and it's pretty tough to do that now,''
Willingham said.

MD-11 HAS GOOD SAFETY RECORD, BUT SOME FLAWS THAT COULD POSE FIRE
HAZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs `hours' for `miles' in description of jet's history; adds
details on Swissair's performance and reputation; polishing and
rewriting throughout.) (See also CRASH-RDP, CRASH-VICTIMS, CRASH-DITCH and
CRASH-SWISSAIR) 
(js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The widebodied MD-11 jet designed by McDonnell
Douglas has been in service since 1990 and is widely regarded as
safe and reliable, but Federal Aviation Administration records show
that the plane has had a number of mechanical problems _including
some that posed fire hazards _ and several accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts and analysts also say that Swissair has had a
solid safety record and is considered one of the world's top
airlines, particularly in the maintenance of its fleet of 62
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair plane that crashed Wednesday night near Halifax,
Nova Scotia, was 7 years old _ fairly young by aviation standards _
and had flown 35,000 hours in 6,400 flights. The pilot reported
smoke _ but not fire _ in the cockpit before the MD-11 was lost
from radar.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 is a longer, wider and more efficient version of the
DC-10, which is still flown by many airlines throughout the world.
As with other models, there have been several instances in the past
of flaws in the MD-11 leading the manufacturer and the FAA to call
for inspections, repairs or alterations to prevent electrical
short-circuits, fuel spills, overheating or other potential fire
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those actions were taken after reports of smoke or fire
in a plane while it was in service, or by the discovery during
maintenance of electrical wires that were chafed or charred or of
some other tell-tale sign of damage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, FAA records show a potential fire hazard from
arcing in electrical contacts between a cable and a generator;
smoke in a cargo compartment during loading, caused by damaged
cables feeding power into the plane; damage to fuel conduits in the
fuselage; a malfunction in a vacuum waste exhaust heater that could
ignite insulation in the cargo hold, and several instances of
chafing of various wire bundles that posed the threat of electrical
fires.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Transportation Safety Board, there
have been several accidents involving MD-11s. But the plane's
safety record is on a par with other airplanes in widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   The only other major accident involving an MD-11 occurred in
1997 when a Federal Express jet landing at Newark International
Airport bounced, rolled and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The main wing slats on an Eastern Airlines plane en route to
China deployed improperly in 1993, causing the plane to buck
violently in the air over Alaska. Two people died and several dozen
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   A fire on an American Airlines MD-11 at New York's Kennedy
Airport in 1995 forced the plane's evacuation, in which two people
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issues airworthiness directives mandating that U.S.
airlines fix flaws as they are discovered, but the directives are
not binding on foreign airlines unless the aviation agencies in
those countries issue similar orders. Most developed countries and
large airlines, however, especially those flying into the United
States, comply with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also generally comply with safety and mechanical
recommendations from airplane manufacturers, known as alert service
bulletins, which normally form the basis for any FAA directives.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Breitler, a Swissair spokesman, said Friday that the
airline routinely complies with all directives, mandatory or not.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair's last fatal accident was in 1979, when a DC-8 landing
in Athens overshot the runway. The plane caught fire, and 14 people
aboard were killed. The crash of Swissair Flight 111 was the
company's worst disaster since its founding in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you have heard about the Swiss, you can apply to
Swissair,'' said Stuart Matthews of the Flight Safety Institute, a
nonprofit group based in Arlington, Va., that monitors safety
issues. ``It is known throughout the industry for meticulous care
and the quality of its maintenance and its crews.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other European carriers, Swissair has faced an increasingly
competitive business environment as governments increasingly allow
deregulation and airlines struggle for passengers in an area
densely packed with major airports. The company has already taken
some steps to cut costs and increase efficiency, closing
nonproductive hubs and making personnel changes. It has also sought
links with other airlines to expand its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company hired Jeffrey Katz, a former American
Airlines executive, to run its daily operations. While some
analysts said it was not unheard of for airlines, including
American carriers, to hire foreign chief executives, others said
the company was trying to bring in experience from the deregulated
U.S. market. The theory, analysts said, was that an executive who
could survive in the cutthroat world of U.S. airline competition
would be better able to guide the company as Europe became more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign airlines flying to and from airports in the United
States are required to meet international safety standards set by
the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency,
although in some cases these rules are not identical to regulations
issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The international rules are meant to provide a common level of
protection while preserving each nation's right to regulate and
inspect its own airlines. The FAA, in turn, reviews each foreign
nation's enforcement practices before allowing airlines from that
country to operate here.
</P>
<P>
   But many important safety regulations issued by the FAA apply to
all airlines operating in this country, agency officials said.
Among these are rules governing hazardous cargo, including
materials that might cause fires.
</P>
<P>
   After oxygen generators carried in the cargo hold of a Valujet
Airlines DC-9 in Florida in 1996 started a fire that caused the
plane to crash, killing all 110 people on board, the FAA issued a
regulation prohibiting both foreign and domestic airlines from
transporting them on passenger flights with at least one stop in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the FAA disclosed that both domestic and foreign
airlines may have unwittingly violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   After Boeing acquired the manufacturer in 1990, it announced
that it would stop making the three-engined MD-11, which is a
larger and more efficient variant of the DC-10, in the year 2000.

UT RESIDENCY PROGRAM MAY LOSE ITS ACCREDITATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The University of Texas-Houston Health Science
Center's 5-year-old program in emergency medicine _ the only such
program in the region _ faces losing its accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still an accredited residency program,'' said Dr.
Maximillian Buja, dean of the UT Medical School at Houston. ``But
we have received a notice of the intent to withdraw accreditation,
which would be effective July 1, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the accrediting body is most concerned about the
leadership of the program, which is now under its fourth chairman
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The notice came from the Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education, which oversees the qualifications of medical
residency programs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Residency programs train medical school graduates in various
medical specialties, such as pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology,
surgery and emergency medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Such training programs in emergency medicine are reviewed
regularly by a special committee of the accreditation council to
ensure that they meet the agency's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The notice does not mean that the training program definitely
will lose its accreditation, Buja said. The UT Medical School now
is trying to determine whether it should appeal the accrediting
body's decision or simply try to start a new program after the
accreditation is withdrawn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If UT decides to appeal, it must file its rationale as to why
the accreditation should not be withdrawn by November, Buja said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that because this emergency medicine program is the
only one in the Houston-Galveston area, it is a critical community
need,'' he said. ``We have every intention of successfully
appealing this or resurrecting a program after that. We intend to
have an emergency medicine residency program.''
</P>
<P>
   The program started as a new department about five years ago,
under its first chairman, Dr. David Olson. But Olson resigned and
was replaced by Dr. Michael McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum, however, became ill shortly after he was named and he
later died, Buja said. Then Dr. Norberto Adame was named acting
chief, and the department was made a division of the surgery
department to give it more administrative stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Adame stepped down as chairman, though remaining on the
staff, and is now director of emergency medicine at Hermann
Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Adame was replaced by the present acting chief, Dr. John Harris,
a radiologist. Buja said, ``Dr. Harris is one of our senior
faculty, and he has a lot of administrative experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Buja said a nationwide search is under way for a new person to
head the emergency medicine division.
</P>
<P>
   Eight new emergency medicine residents enter the program every
year. There are now 24 residents in the three-year program, Buja
said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, who are physicians undergoing additional training in
the specifics of emergency medicine, practice in the Hermann
Hospital emergency room, Buja said.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation is important because most residents must train in
an accredited program before they are qualified to take exams that
would certify them as emergency medicine doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the existing students could finish before the
accreditation is taken away _ if it is _ but the others would have
to transfer or risk graduating from a non-accredited program.
</P>
<P>
   The American Board of Emergency Medicine is an official
certifying body for emergency medicine physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shortage of emergency medicine physicians in Texas
and nationwide,'' Buja said.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that managed care would reduce emergency department
visits and thus the need for emergency physicians have proved
false, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial-Hermann system will have 200,000 emergency room

   In the May issue of the Annals of Emergency Medicine, John
Moorhead, the next president of the American College of Emergency
Physicians &UR; , &LR;  and some colleagues documented the need for emergency
medicine physicians by pointing out that many of those now staffing
emergency rooms are not board-certified.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, he found that 58 percent of physicians practicing
the nation's nearly 5,000 emergency departments were emergency
medicine-residency trained and 53 percent were board-certified in
emergency medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One candidate says the other is a hypocrite without a
vision for leading the state. His opponent has responded in kind,
calling his rival disingenuous and, in what he considers the
ultimate insult, a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Do you get the feeling that Paul Cellucci and Joe Malone don't
like each other very much?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damned if I'm going to let him attack my character
without responding,'' Malone said forcefully this week after
watching a new Cellucci attack ad. ``Everything is on the table in
next week's debate.'' That, said Malone, includes Cellucci's
reported $700,000 personal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci fired back: ``He's been pounding me for eight months,
and I decide to give him a little taste of his own medicine, and he
melts down. It's stunning. Stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, the acting governor, and Malone, the state treasurer _
candidates for the Republican nomination for governor _ have had an
increasingly strained relationship since they took office in the
executive branch in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have only worsened in recent days, and the hostility
is sure to be loud and noticeable Wednesday night when the two men
meet again in Worcester for their last televised debate before the
Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their two camps have split the GOP in Massachusetts. On one side
are Malone's supporters, who believe they are the heirs of Ronald
Reagan's legacy, true antigovernment conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side &UR;  &LR; are the Cellucci people, disciples of former
Governor William F. Weld and the torch-bearers for a balanced
budget, lower taxes, and social liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci people say Malone is destroying the Republican party by
waging a negative campaign against the acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem with Joe Malone is he just rolls around in the mud
all the time and never seems able to say anything good about anyone
other than himself,'' said Senator Brian P. Lees, an East
Longmeadow Republican who is close to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The Malone people imply that Cellucci is intimidated by Malone's
political skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has never been comfortable with Joe,'' said Tom Trimarco,
Malone's first deputy treasurer. ``He has always seen Joe as a
looming presence.''
</P>
<P>
   History is full of political rivalries. George Bush accused
Ronald Reagan of practicing voodoo economics. Bob Dole snarled at
Bush to ``stop lying about my record.'' In the 1990 Massachusetts
GOP primary campaign, Bill Weld portrayed Steven Pierce as an
out-of-touch ``right-wing ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   The interesting twist to the Cellucci-Malone fight is that the
two men may have more similarities than differences. Both are
Italian, both are Republicans. Cellucci, 50, attended his local
high school, Hudson Catholic; his family ran a car sales business.
Malone, 44, went to his local high school, Waltham High; his family
ran a trucking business.
</P>
<P>
   Both entered politics at a relatively young age. Cellucci was 29
when he was elected a state representative; Malone ran against US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1990 at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences. Cellucci reached the executive branch
by first serving in the Legislature for 14 years; Malone has no
legislative experience. Cellucci studied accounting at Boston
College; Malone played football at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cellucci nor Malone will admit to feelings of enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, I like him,'' Malone said. ``I think he's a nice
fellow. I plan on winning this race, but if it turns out I don't,
I'll say, `Let's go to work electing some Republicans, including
Paul Cellucci.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the two used to go out for lunch twice a year in
the Italian North End, and they've been to New Orleans to watch the
Super Bowl with Weld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always gotten along great with Joe Malone,'' said
Cellucci, who had once suggested through intermediaries that Malone
become his running mate. Malone declined.
</P>
<P>
   But the Malone camp says that during the Weld years, Cellucci
jealously guarded access to the popular governor, shutting Malone
out. And the only time the pair went to lunch was in 1995, after
they had both won reelection and a showdown in the race for
governor looked to be inevitable. Over pasta at Filippo's, the two
tried to reach detente.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci says he is surprised that Malone felt locked out of the
corner office. ``I was the one, quite often, saying we ought to
invite Joe Malone to this or to that,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   If Cellucci is angry, it's at the tenor of the campaign. ``My
complaint is that since January, he has run a very negative
campaign,'' he said. ``I think the Republican party has done a good
job of bringing Massachusetts back. I think we've got a remarkable
story to tell, and he seems to be trying to tear that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, on the other hand, says their differences are deep and
philosophical, not personal. ``We come from two different
approaches. He comes up from inside (the State House), and I come
from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure began building at last week's Republican debate in
Springfield, as Malone nearly called Cellucci a liar, using the
words ``disingenuous'' and ``unfair and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, on the other hand, called Malone a hypocrite, in a
slightly nicer manner. ``The campaign of Joe Malone is do as I say,
not as I do,'' Cellucci said, asserting improper patronage in the
Treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Cellucci unveiled ``Chocolate or Glazed,'' also
known as the donut ad. The ad refers to a ``secret slush fund _
paid for with your tax dollars'' for Christmas parties, rock
concerts, golf fees, and donuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Joe Malone wants his hands on the $19.5 billion state
budget,'' the ad says. ``No wonder. At $3.50 a dozen, that's over
65 billion donuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone responded sharply, promising to dredge up Cellucci's very
large, and largely unexplained, debts.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was incredulous at Malone's reaction. The
intent of the ad, he said, is not to impugn Malone's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the reformer he says he is,'' Cellucci said. ``He's
not the fiscal conservative he says he is. That's the intent of the
ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as history is filled with political rivalries, so, too, is
it replete with stories of mended fences. Bush forgot about voodoo
economics long enough to become Reagan's vice president. The
snarling Dole carried Bush's legislative agenda through Congress.
And Weld put the out-of-touch Steve Pierce in charge of human
services.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Malone say their enmity will end the day after the
primary. Malone says the two men will share a bowl of pasta and
move on; Cellucci said the specter of a big-spending Democrat in
the corner office will bring the campaigns together.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after all the name-calling and venom, the pasta
get-together will be one closely watched political meal.

THE OTHER SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 06, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disparity between elite and popular opinion of Bill Clinton
has never been greater. Congressional Democrats have begun taking
potshots at the president; it's hard to find a pundit who hasn't
called for his head. Meanwhile, the public puts its approval of
Clinton's conduct of the presidency in the vicinity of 70 percent.
They cannot both be right.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the prestige press which has lost its way? A
suggestive piece of evidence that it &UR;  &LR; has is to be found in the
treatment that television, magazines and newspapers have accorded
Clinton's second speech about the Lewinsky matter _ the one he made
in a little church on Martha's Vinyard at Oak Bluffs. It has been
all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   I obviously cannot prove it, but my conviction has only grown
that the heart of it was among the most remarkable political
speeches in self-defense of the last half century _ comparable to
John F. Kennedy's address on the subject of his catholicism
delivered to protestant ministers in Houston, or Martin Luther
King's ``I've been to the mountaintop'' speech in Memphis, on a par
certainly with Nixon's ``Checkers'' speech _ and light years apart
from it in tone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the press has treated it as if it had little or no
significance. Nor have the newspapers supplied the background
necessary to understand the difference between the two speeches,
and the distance that the president travelled between them. They
have not yet been able to pin down what transpired in the course of
Clinton's testimony that fateful Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's second take on Monica Lewinsky comprised only three
paragraphs at the end of a lengthy speech to a small congrgation in
Union Chapel on the 35th anniversary of Martin Luther King's ``I
have a dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   The president apparently wrote the speech longhand that morning,
without the aid of lawyers or speechwriters. He delivered it with
an umistakable transparency. There was no biting of the lower lip,
though his blink-rate escalated sharply at one point, and his eyes
bulged with emotion at another. I quote the end of the speech here
in full, though a transcript is a poor substitute for seeing and
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know that I'm having to become quite an expert in
this business of asking forgiveness. And I ... It gets a little
easier the more you do it. &UR;  &LR; And if you have a family, an
Administration, a Congress and a whole country to ask, you're going
to get a lot of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to tell you in these last days it's come home to me
again, something I first learned as President, but it wasn't burned
in my bones _ and that is, in order to get it you've got to be
willing to give it. And all of us _ the anger, the resentment, the
bitterness, the desire for recrimination against people you believe
have wronged you _ they harden the heart and deaden the spirit and
lead to self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we
believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from those
we have wronged. And I heard that first _ first _ in the civil
rights movement. `Love thy neighbor as thyself.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is here that a little exegesis will help.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton muffed the speech he made Monday night, August 17,
after testifying before a grand jury for four hours, it apparently
was because he was so furious he could barely contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   Why furious? Starr's prosecutors are reported to have pressed
the president for extremely intimate details of the
relationship. &UR;  &LR; According to one account, Clinton is said to have
interrupted his testimony for an hour in rage over graphic
questions. (There were five interruptions in all, according to
Newsweek.) By all accounts, he is said to have left the questioning
in high dudgeon _ and immediately reinstated in his address the
attack on Starr that so many persons found inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of some details of the testimony purporting to be
dependable story emerged slowly. First Newsweek reported that a
``knowledgeable source'' close to Starr had said, ``When people
read his report, they'll want to throw up.'' Then, citing
``multiple sources close to the case,'' web reporter Matt Drudge
ventured some salacious details. Next the New York Post and several
British papers followed. And soon it all boiled over on talk radio
_ from whence it moved into the nation's high schools and junior
highs and onto late-night television including Jay Leno. Then the
web-zine Slate undertook an inventory of the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't made it into the prestige press. Renewed court
strictures against leaks of grand jury testimony have prevented
mainstream news reporters from obtaining the kind of multiple
source corroboration required to ascribe the rumor to genuinely
knowledgable sources.
</P>
<P>
   (Clinton's problems began on the business pages with the saga of
Whitewater; perhaps it is only fitting they should return there
when they become so excessively personal that there is no appetite
for them on the front page.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the alleged practice was undignified. The
grossly unequal relationship between the chief executive and the
intern was inappropriate, even Clinton has admitted. But to many
persons, including the president, it was the line of questioning
about the detail of the relationship that was truly disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Clinton had already admitted a sexual affair to the
grand jury; it was the first thing he did when he sat down that
day. And his sexual conduct has little or no bearing on the conduct
of his other duties in the minds of most Americans. In pressing for
the details _ if that is what they did _ the prosecutors may have
revealed an interest so prurient, a self-righteousness so great and
a malice so keen as to deeply violate the trust that had been
placed in them. No wonder Clinton walked out. No wonder he made the
angry speech he did that night.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of roasting from friends and foes alike for having
lashed out at his foe that Monday evening, Clinton returned to the
subject on Friday, August 28 with his meditation on his
``self-inflicted wounds'' at Oak Bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that the speech was not teed up for networks'
convenience in prime-time. Granted also that the president is such
a virtuoso talker that it is difficult to tell whether you are
getting the real thing. Still, the speech seemed to do several
much-needed things at once, deftly and economically.
</P>
<P>
   It repeated the apology _ at least as much apology as Clinton
apparently intends to make. It laid out the situation as he sees
it, juxtaposing his sexual misconduct with his enemies' political
vendetta. And it underscored the fundamental truth of forgiveness _
that it must be mutual _ which makes it so unlikely that it will be
forthcoming in this situation. More likely the Hatfields should
forgive the McCoys. The nation eventually will change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that the true test of a chief executive's ability is
the willingness to endlessly repeat himself, and generally speaking
that is true. But this was a rare moment of genuine political
theater _ a man attempting to serve as the chief defender of
civility in public life _ even while admitting his contemptible
behavior that permitted the assault on it to commence in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   If there were another Democrat of any stature on the scene, this
responsibility might be divided. He or she might tackle Starr and
his supporters: for their attempt to infuse the civil realm with
religiosity, the legal realm with political purpose. As it is,
Clinton must defend himself _ and the Republic as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr's report will be presented to the Congress. We
will have access to the details of his investigation. Then it will
be reasonable to make up our minds as to whose conduct has been
more offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it makes sense to remember that we have been
listening to a one-sided conversation. ``There is a tidal feeling
of betrayal and embarrassment running across the country today,''
thundered the New York Times on the day after Starr apparently
pressed Clinton about the details of his sex life. By the time
Starr's report gets to Congress, that tide may well be running the
other way.

 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steffi Graf and Jana Novotna won with surprising
ease; Martina Hingis and Patty Schnyder triumphed, but with
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first Friday of this eerily calm U.S. Open, two women
who made the strongest impressions were not stars or even rising
stars. They were Americans Kimberly Po and Annie Miller, who can
roam the stalls and halls of the National Tennis Center with little
fear of getting swarmed for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Po, a 26-year-old Californian, recorded the only upset of the
day session, defeating 14th-seeded Dominique Van Roost of Belgium,
6-4, 6-2. Miller, a 21-year-old from Michigan, lost to Monica
Seles, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But if Po's and Miller's fortunes differed on the hardcourts
Friday, their futures may take them in similar directions: away
from their sport and toward lifestyles where the scenery and the
computer rankings are not updated at such dizzying and disorienting
paces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been struggling a bit, wavering with what I want to
do,'' Po said, after reaching the fourth round at the Open for the
first time in eight tries. ``But it hasn't been hard here to be
motivated and to know what I want to do these two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining forces with her coach Donnie Young in early 1996,
Po went from a journeyman baseliner to a legitimate threat,
reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 1997 and a
career-high ranking of 14. But last November she had surgery to
remove some cartilage in her right shoulder. ``I didn't hit a ball
from November until April,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Po resumed roaming the globe with Young in May. After struggling
throughout the summer, she has won three matches in a row at
Flushing Meadows in straight sets. The discouraging news for Po is
that she must now face Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller reached the third round in a Grand Slam event for the
first time, but despite her ability to sustain baseline exchanges
with Seles, Miller is no longer prepared to make the same
commitment to tennis as Seles. Barring a last-minute change of
heart, she will begin the fall semester as a student in Michigan,
studying Spanish, statistics and geography instead of opponents'
groundstrokes and serving tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my three-year career so far, I've been known to be so tough
on myself that I go on the court and kind of suffer because I'm so
negative,'' she said. ``I really think going to school this fall
will help me gain some perspective into my life and what I want out
of it a little more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graf, who has had her own travails in recent years, both
physical and psychological, is clearly on the upswing. But her
lopsided 6-1, 6-1 victory over the 16-year-old Croatian Mirjana
Lucic was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Lucic made her Grand Slam debut at the Open and
pushed Novotna to three sets on Arthur Ashe Stadium in the third
round, demonstrating precocious poise, power and potential. But a
year later, in the same round and on the same court, she showed
little more than stage fright, shanking groundstrokes,
double-faulting eight times, and at one point late in the second
set, swinging at a Graf serve with her forehand and missing the
ball entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had nothing inside me,'' said Lucic, who has
often cited Graf as her role model and who has sought advice and
support from Graf this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic needs that support because in July, after accusing her
father, Marinko, of beating her, she left Croatia for Nick
Bollettieri's Academy in Florida with her mother and siblings. Her
father has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi was great from the beginning, helping me, telling me
what to do,'' Lucic said.
</P>
<P>
   For a set, it appeared that Hingis, the seeded No. 1, might not
make it through to the fourth round, but she eventually righted her
listing game and solved the riddle of Amelie Mauresmo's big serve
and backhand, winning by 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. In July, Mauresmo, an
athletic 19-year-old and former world junior champion, won the
first set against Hingis and led by 4-1 in the second in a Fed Cup
match on clay in Switzerland. Hingis managed to prevail then, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I lost the first set, I was like, hey girl, kind of wake
up,'' Hingis said of Friday's match. ``You don't want to go back
home after this match.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women struggled less to remain on the road. Schnyder,
seeded 11th, defeated Mary Joe Fernandez in straight sets and will
face Graf. Novotna beat the normally daunting Sandrine Testud of
France, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, second-seeded Marcelo Rios dropped a set but
not the match, 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-2, against the Italian
qualifier Giorgio Galimberti to reach the third round. No. 7 Alex
Corretja defeated the French qualifier Jean-Baptiste Perlant, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (8-10), 6-1, 6-0. And No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov topped
Tommy Haas of Germany, 7-5, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jan-Michael Gambill defeated Magnus Norman of
Sweden, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, and then confirmed that he
expects to make his Davis Cup debut against Italy in the semifinals
later this month. With Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang
abstaining and Jim Courier injured, Gambill expects to play singles
along with Todd Martin.

McGWIRE'S ROOTS REACH TO CLAREMONT, CALIF. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of a disastrous work stoppage in 1994-95, major
league baseball was in dire need of a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has one. His name is Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The man you see every night on TV is the real McGwire, a modest
young man enjoying the wave of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But what the public doesn't see is a man with whom family comes
first, and to whom nothing came easy. His path to baseball
greatness was the path less traveled, a steep road littered with
the rocks of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is about failure,'' McGwire said earlier this year.
``Even the best hitters make out seven out of every 10 at-bats.
Anyone can handle success. To play in the major leagues, you have
to be able to handle failure.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in omens, here's one for you: McGwire, at age 10,
hit a home run in his first at-bat in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in reality, here's a big dose: McGwire has
suffered seven career-threatening injuries, a couple of serious
illnesses and a host of bumps and bruises. He's learned to accept
failure and to play in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he closed in on Roger Maris's single-season home run
record, back when he was a youngster growing up in Claremont,
McGwire learned to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised more has not been written about all that Mark
has overcome,'' said Jack Helber, one of several local coaches who
influenced the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Helber, a teacher at Claremont High in Claremont, Calif.,
coached McGwire in 1980 and '81 with the Claremont Cardinals
American Legion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was ever given to him,'' Helber said. ``He's worked so
hard for success that you have to admire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's suffered a string of injuries, ever since he was a
freshman in high school. But he's battled back, every time. He
changed positions -- from pitcher to first base -- very late in his
baseball life, but still made the majors. Through it all, he hasn't
changed a bit. He's a genuine person, a super nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's taking some sort of supplement, it's not to get
stronger. It's to stay healthy. I'm sure, right now, his worst
nightmare is suffering a season-ending injury.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire transferred from Claremont High to Damien in 1977, in
the middle of his freshman year. At Damien, he played basketball
and baseball. His athletic accomplishments in both sports were
limited by a series of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most serious injury Mark had, while he was at Damien, was
a back injury,'' said Tom Carroll, the school's athletic director
and Mark's baseball coach. ``That was when he was a freshman, and
it really set him back. In fact, for a time there was some question
as to whether he would be able to play any sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, he was able to return to basketball and baseball.
Then, he hurt a knee as a junior and that was another setback for
him. People tend to forget that Mark was a very good basketball
player. If he had stayed healthy, who knows? He might have gotten
some scholarship offers in basketball and chosen that over
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire chose not to play football -- a decision that labeled
him as ``soft'' in some minds. Coming out of high school, one major
league scouting report on McGwire carried the notation: ``Injury
prone. Lacks toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are two labels McGwire has spent the past 20 years trying
to shed.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was a good player for Damien, but not a great one. He
was the Spartans' co-Most Valuable Player as a senior, sharing the
award with another pitcher, Mike Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good ballclub in Mark's senior season,'' Carroll
said. ``Mark and Alexander were our top two pitchers. We had a good
catcher in Mike Dorning, who went to Notre Dame, and a good center
fielder in David Turney, who played at Mt. San Antonio College and
then at the University of Nebraska. So, I can't really say Mark was
the best player on that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Mark was a pro prospect. But he was a long way from
being a polished player.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire played well enough, however, to impress Marcel
Lachemann, then the pitching coach at USC. Lachemann convinced USC
head coach Rod Dedeaux to take a look at the young pitcher, and
McGwire was offered a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two games I saw him (at Damien), he hit two homers in each
game,'' Lachemann said. ``I thought he was definitely a pitching
prospect. And, obviously, he could swing the bat, too. He was big
then for a high school senior, but obviously, not as big as
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos drafted McGwire in June 1981, in the ninth
round. Ninth-round picks don't attract big money, and the Expos had
precious little to throw around anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran scout Jack Papke took the less-thanoverwhelming Expos'
contract offer to the McGwire residence in Claremont, but later
admitted, ``I kept the car motor running.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, it was a short visit. The McGwires said thanks, but
no thanks. Mark was officially a Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if his time at Damien made him a better baseball
player,'' Carroll said. ``I like to think we did make him a better
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, Mark really developed after he left Damien. I
think it helped that he was able to concentrate just on baseball at
USC. And I know it helped him to play on the Claremont American
Legion team. When he was successful there, it really seemed to lift
his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire played for his hometown Claremont Cardinals in 1980 and
'81. He hit .318 in 1980 and .426 in 1981, with a team-record 13
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like at Damien, Mark started out with us as a pitcher,''
Helber said. ``But I liked his power and liked the idea of getting
his bat in the lineup on an every-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mark worked out at first base. I remember telling my
infielders that if they threw the ball in the dirt when Mark was at
first, I would fine them. High throws were fine because Big Mark
would go up and get 'em. Eventually, Mark became a very good first
baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire almost missed the 1981 season with Helber's Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came down with mononucleosis,'' Helber said. ``For a while,
it looked like he would have to sit out the entire summer.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire returned, however, and hit 13 home runs in 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was 6-4 as a pitcher in 1980, but only 3-3 in 1981. With
Randy Robertson and Scott Campbell carrying the load for the
Cardinals in 1981, McGwire was able to concentrate more on playing
first base, and his hitting improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   That '81 team went 39-19 and reached the state American Legion
tournament at Yountville. McGwire showed his tenacity one night
during the tournament, during which the team stayed in an old Army
barracks at the Veterans Administration hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys settled in about 10 p.m., but these Fullerton guys
had the radio blaring and were having a party,'' Helber said. ``It
was keeping our guys awake. Finally, about 1 a.m., Mark had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He marched to the next room, turned the radio off, and
announced to the Fullerton team, `Good night, gentlemen!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody knows Mark's game face. At 6-foot-5, when he's
unhappy, it's a pretty scary sight. And that's the Mark McGwire
that Fullerton bunch saw that night. After Mark went over there, we
never heard another peep out of 'em the rest of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has always said his two seasons spent with the Legion
team were happy times, and that he and Helber have stayed in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably going to be mad at me for telling you this, but
a couple times now, he's purchased new uniforms for the team,''
Helber said. ``But I guess the nicest thing he ever did for the
Claremont Cardinals was in 1988, when he was playing for the
Oakland A's. We had once again made the state playoffs, and had an
off-day at Yountville. So Mark arranged for tickets to an A's game
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, it turned out that he brought us all down on the field
before the game, had his photo taken with the team, shook
everybody's hand, wished us luck and was just a super neat guy. Our
kids never forgot the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was a pitcher at USC in 1982 and '83, and a very
promising one. But Dedeaux thought there might be more to McGwire
than just a big kid who threw hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first of all, I think you need to know that big guys
usually are late bloomers,'' Dedeaux said. ``It takes a while for
them to get the mechanics of baseball down. A guy on those same USC
teams as McGwire, Randy Johnson, is a classic example.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mark, I knew he was a very good athlete and a
hard-working kid, who had a great work ethic. I was also thinking
back to a guy we had at USC, named Dave Kingman. Kingman came to us
as a pitcher, but we gradually worked him into the every-day lineup
and he went on to a very successful major league career. So I
started to experiment with Mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mark, the more he played at first base, the more I liked
him. And, of course, even then he had great power. Awesome power.
But the interesting thing is, he really worked at becoming a good
hitter, not just a power hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also at USC that McGwire met his future wife. It's common
knowledge now that the marriage didn't work out. But for McGwire,
raised on family values, the subject of the broken relationship is
extremely painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, he and his ex-wife have handled the split very
well,'' Helber said. ``There's no fighting over money, or the kid.
Mentally, well, it was a very difficult thing for Mark, something
he'll never get over. For him, it's a lot easier to accept failure
as a baseball player than failure as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, by nature, a quiet, introspective person. So, all this
attention is tough on him. But I think he's handled himself just
great. That is a tribute to his upbringing, and the fact he's
overcome a lot of adversity to get where he's at. For a young man,
he has a very mature perspective on things. And fame isn't going to
change him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Mark, family will always come first. When he was a rookie
with the A's, he had a chance to hit 50 home runs, but instead went
home to witness the birth of his son, Matthew. And he would do the
same thing today -- even if it meant missing out on 62 home runs.''

GREENSPAN SAYS RATES MAY FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sharp reversal from previous upbeat assessments
of the US economy, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said
Friday that America is in danger of being drawn into the maelstrom
of the global financial crisis, an event that could damage or end
its long economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not credible that the United States can remain an
oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing
greatly increased stress,'' he said in a speech at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   As he always does, Greenspan avoided saying what the central
bank might do about the problem, especially whether it might lower
interest rates to try to keep US growth going in the face of
overseas trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprising departure from the Fed's taciturn ways, he
revealed that the central bank policymakers meeting behind closed
doors last month concluded that global turmoil already posed such a
threat to US prosperity that they needed to alter bank policy. They
shifted the Fed's policy stance from one of being ready to raise
interest rates at the first serious sign of inflation to one of
being as likely as not to cut them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Greenspan's remarks were widely interpreted as signalling
that the Fed is preparing to make a growth-spurring rate cut,
perhaps as early as its late September meeting. The remarks were
also seen as a critical gauge of how quickly and how far the
nation's and world's economic outlook has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a dramatic change from where we were only eight weeks
ago when the chairman was waxing poetic that this was the best
economy he had seen in 50 years,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief
economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deepening global economic crisis and selloff in the
financial markets significantly increases the chances of an
interest rate cut,'' Zandi said.
</P>
<P>
   In his last public comments in late July, Greenspan hinted that
the Fed was more worried about the economy overheating than
slipping into recessions and was therefore more likely to raise
rates. With consumer spending strong and unemployment low, ``the
potential for accelerating inflation is probably greater than the
risk of protracted, excessive weakness in the economy,'' he said in
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's benchmark federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other for loans, has been at 5.5 percent since March,
1997. For much of last year and the early part of this year, many
economists had expected the central bank to raise the rate to
perhaps 6 percent to dampen overly fast economic growth and choke
off renewed inflation. But the Fed did not act largely because it
believed that the collapse of Asian economies that began last year
would do the dampening for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now however, the central bank appears to have concluded that the
Asian crisis has gone too far, spreading from the Far East to
Russia, Latin America and elsewhere, and could pose a serious
threat to the US.
</P>
<P>
   The spread showed up with a vengence in the stock market where
the Dow Jone industrial average and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index
have lost almost 20 percent of their value since their mid-July
peaks. But analysts were uncertain before Greenspan's remarks
whether the Fed believed the stock selloff was a signal of
impending economic trouble or simply the bursting of a troubling
fincnancial bubble.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Greenspan counseled investors to be cautious,
saying ``we have relearned in recent weeks that just as a bull
stock market feels unending and secure... so it can feel when
markets contract that recovery is inconceivable... Both, of course,
are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Greenspan's remarks indicate the Fed has
concluded that more is at work in the markets and the economy than
a case of nerves and is prepared to act to ensure that it does not
slip into a downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was scheduled to meet late Friday with US Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and senior Japanese officials to discuss
Tokyo's so far unsuccessful efforts to pull itself out of a severe
recession. US officials believe that Japan must start growing again
in order for the rest of Asia to pull itself out of crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steffi Graf and Jana Novotna won with surprising
ease; Martina Hingis and Patty Schnyder triumphed, but with
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first Friday of this eerily calm U.S. Open, two women
who made the strongest impressions were not stars or even rising
stars. They were Americans Kimberly Po and Annie Miller, who can
roam the stalls and halls of the National Tennis Center with little
fear of getting swarmed for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Po, a 26-year-old Californian, recorded the only upset of the
day session, defeating 14th-seeded Dominique Van Roost of Belgium,
6-4, 6-2. Miller, a 21-year-old from Michigan, lost to Monica
Seles, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But if Po's and Miller's fortunes differed on the hardcourts
Friday, their futures may take them in similar directions: away
from their sport and toward lifestyles where the scenery and the
computer rankings are not updated at such dizzying and disorienting
paces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been struggling a bit, wavering with what I want to
do,'' Po said, after reaching the fourth round at the Open for the
first time in eight tries. ``But it hasn't been hard here to be
motivated and to know what I want to do these two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining forces with her coach Donnie Young in early 1996,
Po went from a journeyman baseliner to a legitimate threat,
reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 1997 and a
career-high ranking of 14. But last November she had surgery to
remove some cartilage in her right shoulder. ``I didn't hit a ball
from November until April,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Po resumed roaming the globe with Young in May. After struggling
throughout the summer, she has won three matches in a row at
Flushing Meadows in straight sets. The discouraging news for Po is
that she must now face Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller reached the third round in a Grand Slam event for the
first time, but despite her ability to sustain baseline exchanges
with Seles, Miller is no longer prepared to make the same
commitment to tennis as Seles. Barring a last-minute change of
heart, she will begin the fall semester as a student in Michigan,
studying Spanish, statistics and geography instead of opponents'
groundstrokes and serving tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my three-year career so far, I've been known to be so tough
on myself that I go on the court and kind of suffer because I'm so
negative,'' she said. ``I really think going to school this fall
will help me gain some perspective into my life and what I want out
of it a little more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graf, who has had her own travails in recent years, both
physical and psychological, is clearly on the upswing. But her
lopsided 6-1, 6-1 victory over the 16-year-old Croatian Mirjana
Lucic was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Lucic made her Grand Slam debut at the Open and
pushed Novotna to three sets on Arthur Ashe Stadium in the third
round, demonstrating precocious poise, power and potential. But a
year later, in the same round and on the same court, she showed
little more than stage fright, shanking groundstrokes,
double-faulting eight times, and at one point late in the second
set, swinging at a Graf serve with her forehand and missing the
ball entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had nothing inside me,'' said Lucic, who has
often cited Graf as her role model and who has sought advice and
support from Graf this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic needs that support because in July, after accusing her
father, Marinko, of beating her, she left Croatia for Nick
Bollettieri's Academy in Florida with her mother and siblings. Her
father has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi was great from the beginning, helping me, telling me
what to do,'' Lucic said.
</P>
<P>
   For a set, it appeared that Hingis, the seeded No. 1, might not
make it through to the fourth round, but she eventually righted her
listing game and solved the riddle of Amelie Mauresmo's big serve
and backhand, winning by 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. In July, Mauresmo, an
athletic 19-year-old and former world junior champion, won the
first set against Hingis and led by 4-1 in the second in a Fed Cup
match on clay in Switzerland. Hingis managed to prevail then, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I lost the first set, I was like, hey girl, kind of wake
up,'' Hingis said of Friday's match. ``You don't want to go back
home after this match.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women struggled less to remain on the road. Schnyder,
seeded 11th, defeated Mary Joe Fernandez in straight sets and will
face Graf. Novotna beat the normally daunting Sandrine Testud of
France, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, second-seeded Marcelo Rios dropped a set but
not the match, 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-2, against the Italian
qualifier Giorgio Galimberti to reach the third round. No. 7 Alex
Corretja defeated the French qualifier Jean-Baptiste Perlant, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (8-10), 6-1, 6-0. And No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov topped
Tommy Haas of Germany, 7-5, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jan-Michael Gambill defeated Magnus Norman of
Sweden, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, and then confirmed that he
expects to make his Davis Cup debut against Italy in the semifinals
later this month. With Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang
abstaining and Jim Courier injured, Gambill expects to play singles
along with Todd Martin.

SOSA STAYS LOOSE ... AND BLASTS NO. 57 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The third pitch he saw of the night was really a
ball. Well, it would have been a ball if he hadn't swung at it. But
Sammy Sosa swings bats very well. So well that last night he was
able to send a baseball 401 feet at Three Rivers Stadium and wipe
out a 68-year-old Cubs record in one motion.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to know the Cubs right fielder to understand the
items that go into his daily diary. You are living his diary with
him. He now has 57 home runs, one more than Chicago's Hack Wilson
had in 1930 _ which was both the club and National League record
until Sosa and Mark McGwire started playing home run derby this
summer. The only person who wasn't happy about that was a young man
named Jason Schmidt, the Pirate who gave up the homer during the
Cubs' 5-2 win. Everyone else? Happy. Especially Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   He moved within two home runs of season leader McGwire and is
now only five away from breaking the record set by Roger Maris in
1961. With each homer, Sosa knows the crowds will grow. He knows
some of the fans will boo, as many among the 36,000 (the Pirates
drew just over 8,000 Thursday) did last night in the fourth inning,
when he did something silly _ hitting a single. He doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is giddy about his daily routine. It usually begins
with a glance at the highlight shows, a prayer, a chat with the
media, a home run or two during the game, and, by nigtfall, a
summary of his previous 20 hours or so. We hope you're having fun
during this season. Sosa is. You said something about pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure?'' he said. ``This isn't pressure. Pressure for me
was when I was back home, a shoeshine boy. Yeah, I was a shoeshine
boy. Trying to make money for my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the Dominican Republic, where Sosa's bats were tree
branches or slabs of wood. Baseballs were actually socks with
rubber taped in the middle of them. Word is that the stroke was
good even then. He said he dreamed of coming to the United States
back then, and since coming here, he hasn't stopped saying, ``I
love this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The serious baseball portion of Sosa's Friday began at about
4:30 p.m. He walked through the stadium's quiet corridors, talking
with public relations officials, teammates, and stadium personnel.
He was told that a crowd of anxious media awaited on the field,
already forming a semicircle that had only a glimmer of light at
the center. That was the space the crowd was reserving for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes later, the player emerged from the dugout and
slipped into the crowd. Behind him, two stadium workers smiled and
snapped photograph after photograph. Sosa couldn't stop smiling.
And joking.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked him if he would be disappointed if, say, he
finished the season with 64 home runs and McGwire had 66 or 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he said. ``I love this country. Whatever happens
now, I'll take anything I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why he keeps referring to McGwire as ``The Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has 59 home runs,'' Sosa replied.
</P>
<P>
   More laughs. Sosa was told that he sounds like boxing promoter
Don King with his constant reverie about America.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sosa said, smiling again. ``I say, `God bless America.'
He says, `Only in America.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that he enjoys the publicity. He knows no one
expected him to be in this race. Know how many home runs he had on
May 24? Nine. By that time, McGwire had 24. But the next day, Sosa
hit two home runs and hasn't stopped swatting balls into the skies
of Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles, New York ...
</P>
<P>
   Since May 25, Sosa has hit 48 home runs. So when someone
brazenly mentioned that McGwire has hit all his homers with ``no
one behind him'' in St. Louis, Sosa quickly replied, ``I don't have
anyone behind me.'' Maybe he shouldn't have said it. But ask
yourself: Would you disagree with him?
</P>
<P>
   On and on, the questions came at Sosa. He connected with many of
them as if they were waist-high pitches such as the one Schmidt
threw him that he sent over the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   How many home runs will McGwire hit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 70 before,'' he said. ``Probably 69 or 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Whom have you talked to about maintaining your focus?
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' he said. ``I pray before the game. I believe in God.
I'll pray for you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed again. He said he told McGwire to do the same thing,
to not let the attention become a negative. Now, he promises, when
he goes to St. Louis Monday, he is definitely going to get an
autographed bat from McGwire. And in case you were wondering, no,
he doesn't mind that the country he loves so much _ the United
States _ seems to be rooting a little harder for McGwire. Big deal.
Leonel Fernandez, the president of the Dominican Republic, called
him after he hit his 56th home run to tie Wilson's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is the man here, but I'm the man over there,''
Sosa said. ``If he goes there, I'll pass my uh, my crown to him for
the day he's going to be there. And after he leaves, I'll take it
back.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KATZENMOYER PLAYS; OHIO STATE TAKES A HIT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Katzenmoyer is eligible to play; all's well in the world.
All is certainly well in Columbus, Ohio, where Ohio State football
is stronger than ever, now that Katzenmoyer and two teammates have
been declared academically eligible to play in Saturday night's
game at West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   And so a new college football season begins on a fitting and
familiar tone of skepticism and doubt, with borderline academic
fraud and the age-old question of what a semiprofessional,
on-campus entertainment is doing on a campus in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just good to be playing a football game,'' Andy Geiger,
the Ohio State athletic director, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks have certainly been an orgy of punishment for
the Ohio State family ever since Katzenmoyer, a junior linebacker,
revealed what summer school courses he was taking in an effort to
pull up his grade-point average: Music, AIDS Awareness and Golf.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger, entering his fifth year as the athletic director, is in
the middle of the maelstrom surrounding the Buckeyes' middle
linebacker. He has had tours of duty at Brown, Penn and Maryland,
but this is the nastiest swirl he has been involved with. ``This
has been very strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, the 1997 Butkus award winner, needed to lift his
grade-point average after last year and needed six credit hours in
the summer. ``It was a situation where he got into his major, then
struggled in terms of the g.p.a. and needed to take electives to
boost it,'' Geiger said. ``He needed to take courses he could be
successful in.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of academic counselors, the linebacker maneuvered
around the academic minefield. They scoured the university catalog
and came up with three classes that would work. Then one day,
Katzenmoyer told a reporter what courses he was taking.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger is planning to have a meeting soon with the advisers and
the players. ``We will talk about the mistakes _ the perceived
mistakes _ the grown-ups have made,'' Geiger said, ``and we'll talk
to the athletes about keeping quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not the ideal solution. The major problem is
that Katzenmoyer is an academic square peg in a round hole. Like a
large number athletes, he is forced to go to a school he might not
otherwise bother attending simply because the road to the pro ranks
dictates he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger was candid in what was essentially a defense and
explanation of his all-America linebacker. ``He is not the most
articulate guy, he's shy,'' Geiger said. ``He's never been
especially intellectually curious. He's a football player, not a
bad kid, and he's been hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   But this business of shortcuts and entitlement didn't begin with
summer school. Katzenmoyer had an inkling he owned a piece of the
campus three summers ago as a freshman when he boldly requested No.
45, which was last worn by Archie Griffin, the two-time Heisman
Trophy winner and a Columbus icon.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger was in his second year at Ohio State and admits being
intimidated by the school's sports machinery, which wanted to sign
the high school defensive player of the year. ``Intimidated might
be the right word,'' he said. ``I was trying to help the coaches
and the school; we said yes. I think he would have been better
served had we said no. I was trying to help as many people as
possible and wound up not helping anyone. That may not have been
the smartest thing we ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ohio State is in a mess it hopes will be forgotten
after a few easy victories. Geiger says the long-term problem is
that until the liberal arts curriculum expands to embrace the
sports culture, there will always be a Katzenmoyer variation:
athletes whose primary purpose is to play basketball, baseball,
tennis or football.
</P>
<P>
   ``A musician who plays the tenor sax and wanted to be a jazz
player had to learn in clubs and bars,'' Geiger said. ``Now they
can go to a school of music and get a degree in jazz, jazz theory.
We've never accepted sports that same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher education has a long-standing, long-range problem, but
Ohio State has an immediate one: Every time Katzenmoyer makes a
tackle or gives an interview, every time the Ohio State president
surveys his packed stadium, he'll be reminded of this dirty little
problem in higher education's closet.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the university, the Buckeyes won't be reminded
for too much longer. Geiger doubts that Katzenmoyer will be around
after this year. Columbus is a tough place to play. The full weight
of the state sits on the athletic department, in particular the
football program. When it's great, it's great. When it's bad, it's
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a double-edged sword,'' Geiger said. And when it
cuts, a lot of folks bleed.

COURT BARS BELLS FROM OFFERING LONG-DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Texas)  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dashing the main hope of the Bell local telephone giants for
quick entry into the $80 billion long-distance business, a federal
appeals court in New Orleans on Friday reversed a lower court's
decision that would have removed the main barrier between the Bells
and the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   In a split decision, a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals restored the cornerstone of the Telecommunications Act of
1996. That provision requires the Bells to convince federal
regulators that they have opened their local networks to potential
competitors before they are allowed into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   No Bell has yet passed that test.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling, issued after major financial markets closed,
handed an important victory to the big long-distance carriers in
their regulatory struggle against the Bells. The Bells, which
dominate the $100 billion local telephone business, are trying to
get into the long-distance market while the existing long-distance
carriers, including AT&AMP;T Corp., are trying to keep the Bells out.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, Judge Joe Kendall of U.S. District Court in
Wichita Falls, Texas, ruled that the act's main provision
unconstitutionally singled out the Bells for punishment. The
Constitution bars Congress from passing what are known as ``bills
of attainder'' _ laws that impose punishment without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's decision stunned almost everyone involved with the
telecommunications industry except the Bells themselves. In the
ensuing months, many experts predicted that the ruling would be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against the government was originally filed by SBC
Communications Inc., the parent company of Pacific Bell and
Southwestern Bell, and was joined by Bell Atlantic Corp. and U S
West Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells contend that the act treats them unfairly because
non-Bell local phone companies, such as GTE Corp., have been
allowed into the long-distance market without having to pass the
rigorous regulatory review imposed on the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   The court in New Orleans did not agree. Referring to the Bells,
the court said that ``the Act does not declare them monsters or
otherwise seek to punish them on the basis of past conduct, and
thus does not run afoul of the Bill of Attainder Clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Grady Jolly wrote the majority opinion, which was joined
by Judge Rhesa Barksdale. Judge Jerry Smith dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Had it held up, Kendall's decision would have allowed the Bells
into the long-distance market immediately. The ruling never went
into effect, however, because Kendall stayed its implementation
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   SBC said Friday that it had not decided whether to appeal
Friday's decision to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday night, William Kennard, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, said: ``The real winners in today's
decision are America's consumers. This means more choice and lower
rates for telephone service.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard was joined in praising the decision by Jamie DePeau, a
spokeswoman for MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a clear victory for competition,'' she said.
``Maybe now the Bell monopolies will put their efforts toward
opening local markets to competition rather than obstructing
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC contended that consumers were hurt by the ruling because it
would keep them from using the Bell companies for both local and
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the benefits of full and effective
competition are being delayed,'' the company said in a statement.
``As long as the `Special Provisions' of the act prohibit SBC and
other Bell companies from entering legitimate lines of business,
including long-distance, consumers will continue to be handicapped
in their choice of providers and services.''

SOX HELP KEEP TORONTO ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ If the Red Sox want to inspire hope where there is
none, this is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   With Nomar Garciaparra's 23d error of the season and seventh in
the last 14 games setting the tone in the first inning, the Sox
went down to their worst loss of the season, a 12-1 beating at the
hands of the Toronto Blue Jays under a full moon and open SkyDome
roof.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the second in a row over the Red Sox and eighth
straight overall for the Blue Jays, who broke the game open with a
seven-run seventh inning fueled by Jose Canseco's three-run home
run off Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who have Roger Clemens on deck this afternoon,
are a season-high nine games over .500 and within seven games of
the Red Sox in the American League wild-card chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who have lost six of their last nine and haven't won
consecutive games since Aug. 26, managed just six hits off Pat
Hentgen and 40-year-old relic Dave Stieb.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green had four hits, including his 30th home run off
reliever Carlos Reyes, making him the first Blue Jay player to have
30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Only White Sox rookie Mike Caruso has a lower fielding
percentage among AL regulars at shortstop than Garciaparra, who has
made more errors than any big league shortstop except Caruso (33)
and Colorado's Mark Grudzielanek (28) in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Garciaparra staggered fill-in first baseman
Mike Benjamin with a hard sinker that Benjamin barely held on to.
Friday night, with plenty of time to throw out Canseco, who is not
known for overexerting himself down the line, Garciaparra bounced
one past Mo Vaughn at first, an error that directly led to the Blue
Jays' first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had singled and taken third on the error, scored on a
passed ball, Canseco advancing to third, and Canseco scored on
Carlos Delgado's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley halved that lead with a two-out home run in the
second, the 28th of the season for the onetime Blue Jay, but Darrin
Fletcher answered with an opposite-field homer in the bottom of the
inning to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays went ahead, 4-1, in the third when Green's drive
hit the base of the left-field wall and caromed past Troy O'Leary.
By the time O'Leary ran the ball down, Shannon Stewart, who had
been hit by a pitch, scored, and Green took third when O'Leary
overthrew two cutoff men.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco took a pathetic half-swing at a knuckler to strike out
and Green was out in a rundown on Delgado's comebacker to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg dropped Green's foul popup with two out in the
fifth, and Green hit the next pitch for a double, but the Blue Jays
didn't make the Sox pay for that error as Canseco grounded out to
short.
</P>
<P>
   There was no getting off the hook the next time, however, when
the Blue Jays broke the game open in the seventh. Craig Grebeck
doubled and scored on Stewart's single to make it 5-1. The Sox
pitched out on the next play, correctly guessing that Stewart would
be stealing, but Jason Varitek was unable to get a good grip on the
ball and never made a throw.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly annoyed Wakefield snatched Hatteberg's toss back to
the mound, then intentionally walked Green. He then hung a
knuckleball over the middle of the plate that Canseco promptly
turned into an hors d'ouevre for someone dining in the Windows
Restaurant, his blast crashing off the glassed-in restaurant
located in the second deck of SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was the 38th of the season and 389th of his career
for Canseco, tying him with Hall of Famer Johnny Bench for 32d on
the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   That was all for Wakefield, whose yield of eight runs was one
run more than his previous high this season. There was still more
agony for the Red Sox to endure, however. Lefthanded reliever David
West, proving to be no more effective for the Sox this time than he
had on his previous go-around, gave up a single to Delgado and
walked Jose Cruz. When he went ball one on Tony Fernandez, Jimy
Williams yanked him for Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez hit Reyes's first pitch over the head of center
fielder Darren Lewis for a two-run double, and Fletcher singled
home Fernandez to make it 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position in
Thursday night's loss, came up empty in their only four chances
through eight innings Friday night. Garciaparra flied to right with
the bases loaded in the third off Hentgen, whose streak of 183
consecutive starts ended Aug. 29 because of shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen showed no signs of soreness Friday night, holding the
Sox to four hits in 6 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Replacement medals return pride
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ His original war medals may be at the
bottom of a canal somewhere, but Dan Roy says the replacement
medals he received Friday remind him why he served his country in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, whose Purple Heart, Bronze Star and five other Vietnam War
medals were stolen from his home Aug. 2, was ambivalent when he
first learned police were trying to find new medals to replace the
priceless ones stolen.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling gave way to exuberance on Friday when a Lake Worth
collector of military antiques presented the Port St. Lucie veteran
with seven original-issue medals mounted on black velvet and
encased in glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they would mean as much as my originals, but
they do,'' said Roy, flanked by his 16-year-old son Brent and
12-year-old daughter Whitney. ``I really wanted them back so I
could give them to my children one day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fravel, a veteran and collector of military antiques in
Lake Worth, read about the police department's efforts to replace
Roy's medals in a newspaper and scoured his collection to see if he
had original-issue medals of the same kind. He estimates the seven
medals are worth about $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to have the original medals, not replacements
that were issued years later,'' Fravel said. ``The replacements
have a lacquer finish and you can't see as much detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who served in the Marine Corps from 1967 to 1969, received
the medals during a short ceremony at the police department Friday.
When asked about his most vivid memories of Vietnam, Roy said
``getting wounded kind of stuck out.'' He earned the Purple Heart
after an enemy grenade exploded beneath his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked out shrapnel for the next 10 years,'' the 51-year-old
machinist said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy thanked police for catching the teenagers who broke into his
home and said he hopes they turn away from crime after the episode.
Police recovered Roy's pellet gun, compact disc player and
hand-held TV from the youths, but they told officers they couldn't
remember where they had discarded the medals.
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Chuck Johnson said the three suspects still are
awaiting trial in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   As for Roy, he promises to keep his new medals locked up in a
safe and make sure he quickly repairs any faulty windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel very good that the community cared enough to
do this for me,'' said Roy, who moved to Port St. Lucie from
Okeechobee a year ago. ``We were shunned when we came home from
Vietnam and even though we shouldn't have been there, we were and I
have to remember the 50,000 men who lost their lives there.''

USC'S BIG MAC DELIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC special teams coach Shawn Slocum said he wasn't worried when
freshman punter Mike MacGillivray averaged less than 33 yards per
kick in the Trojans' final preseason scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that scrimmage was scripted situations where he was
supposed to kick short,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivray allayed any fears about his lack of experience
against Purdue, averaging 44.1 yards in seven kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The punter was outstanding. Mike MacGillivray really exceeded
my expectations,'' Slocum said. ``A 44-yard average, we'll take
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There were concerns about MacGillivray heading into the game,
but it had more to do with his finger than foot. MacGillivray
jammed a finger when it got caught in a car door, and Slocum was
worried he might have problems holding on to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got it wrapped up and didn't have any problems,'' Slocum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum looked like a genius against Purdue in his first game as
special teams coach. Besides MacGillivray's impressive performance,
USC blocked a field goal, returned a kickoff for a touchdown and
converted two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being a coach, Slocum did find some areas that need
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the little details on things like punt pressure,'' Slocum
said. ``We have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful surgery: Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie underwent
surgery at USC University Hospital on Friday to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie will redshirt this season and have three years of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet weekend: USC will take today off, hold a light practice
Sunday and take Monday off before resuming full-contact practices
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Soward to return kickoffs: USC coach Paul Hackett said wide
receiver R. Jay Soward will work his way back into returning
kickoffs against San Diego State, even though Chad Morton is
considered the No.1 kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``(R. Jay's) going to have to earn his spurs,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who has returned three kickoffs for touchdowns in his
career, will start at wide receiver.

6 CHILDREN FOUND STRANGLED AFTER MOTHER CONFESSES TO 911
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ A mother of six, living in poverty and
estranged from her husband, called 911 on Thursday night, police
said, and made a shocking statement: she had killed her children.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramedics rushed to her apartment and found the
bodies of three girls and three boys, aged 5 to 11. The woman,
Khoua Her, 24, was lying inside the doorway wearing a fancy red
dress. The body of one of the children was behind her. The woman
was in custody at Region's Hospital here. The medical examiner's
office said the children were strangled.
</P>
<P>
   In the call to 911, the woman had spoken about suicide. But it
was unclear whether she had harmed herself.
</P>
<P>
   As a 13-year-old girl, Khoua Her was paired with her husband in
an arranged marriage in her native Laos, neighbors said. When her
babies started to arrive, they came almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is a center for the Hmong, refugees from Laos who have
long struggled economically. But police and civic officials were
careful to play down any notion that such a horrific event had any
cultural underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been called to the apartment at least 15 times in the
last 18 months for domestic turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the deaths ``very, very tragic,'' Chief William Finney
of the St. Paul Police said, ``We see this across cultures _ it
doesn't matter what culture you're from, American or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the two-story housing project, a racially and ethnically
mixed community, there was a hush and a somberness among adults and
children who could not quite believe what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the deaths, more than 150 people had gathered
outside. A voice called out for respect, pleading, ``Can we get a
moment of silence for these six angels that's gone?'' The
Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the woman's husband, Tou Hang, had left the
apartment, and she had been dating another man, neighbors said. One
neighbor said she saw Ms. Her ``scoop up the kids'' and chase them
inside when he came to call recently.
</P>
<P>
   Finney acknowledged the many police visits to the apartment for
domestic violence, but said, ``There was never any indication the
children were in this kind of danger.'' Police records show at
least eight calls to the apartment since January.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Xiong, a friend of the woman's new boyfriend, told reporters
that the mother loved her children, but that she had regretted
marrying so young. The friend said Ms. Her was ``depressed over the
amount of responsibility she had.''

   The friend told The Star Tribune: ``She basically missed out on
all her teen-age years. She wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of her as kind of odd,'' the friend added,
``but I didn't think this would ever happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Christopher Yang, said the parents had taken turns
taking care of the children. He described the mother as ``someone
who was not really taking care of her kids,'' saying that she would
sometimes leave the apartment without taking them.
</P>
<P>
   The children were scheduled to return to school next week.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has long been a center of resettlement for refugees,
largely because of the work of Lutheran Social Services and other
religious organizations. Thousands of refugees from Sudan have
settled in Minneapolis in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong have had a difficult time in America. Most are poor
and illiterate, and street gangs have been growing among their
young people. Arranged marriages are common in the Hmong culture.
In general, the Hmong people do not mix very much among other
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the family had been living in St. Paul for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul described the deaths as ``a
tragedy of overwhelming proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all shaken,'' he said, ``the community is shaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the dead children as Kouaeai Hang, 11; Samson
Hang, 9; Nali Hang, 9; Tang Lung Hang, 7; Aee Hang, 6; and Tang Ke
Hang, 5.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment building was roped off with yellow police tape on
Friday, and few of the neighborhood children played in the
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a lot of kids playing,'' said Sade Kelly, 12.
``Now it's kind of empty.''

RUSSIA POSTPONES VOTE ON NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete rewrite, emphasizing Chernomydrin's economic
program at the top; expands by 225 words)  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Hours after Russia's acting prime minister finally laid
out his program to pull the country out of its economic crisis,
Parliament Friday put off a crucial vote on the new government
until Monday, buying more time for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Battling for support from reluctant lawmakers, the appointee,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, spelled out a series of economic remedies for
the next four months. Initially the plan would risk soaring
inflation by printing money to shore up Russia's troubled banking
system, then shift course by pushing the country into what
Chernomyrdin called an ``economic dictatorship,'' where the money
supply would be rigidly controlled and failing factories could face
bankruptcy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that this may be the last chance to build a normal
economy in Russia,'' he told members of Parliament's upper house
Friday. ``Yes, our actions will not be popular ones. Yes, the
authorities will be cursed from bottom to top.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's program, presented before he has the mandate to
carry it out, would satisfy those who want to see the government do
something to reverse the country's painful shortage of cash with a
new infusion of rubles. But it is likely to anger lenders like the
International Monetary Fund, which wants to see budget cuts and a
tight money policy. The hard part _ which might reassure the fund
and other international creditors _ comes only in January 1999,
with a harsh regime that would tie the supply of rubles to Russia's
foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The economic plan was announced as Parliament's lower house
Friday accepted President Boris Yeltsin's last-minute offer to
reopen talks on a power-sharing agreement, and delay its second
vote on Chernomyrdin's confirmation until Monday. Chernomyrdin was
rejected in a first vote last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Russia Friday, his plan drew a frosty reception. A
senior Clinton administration official expressed frustration with
the outlines of the plan, and at the IMF, Michel Camdessus, the
managing director, implored Russia to ``stop printing money for the
wrong purposes and put the budget in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Yeltsin's peace offering and the description of the
economic plan, hopes for an easy breakthrough in Russia's
12-day-long political deadlock flickered when the leader of the
Communist Party _ which holds the biggest bloc of votes in the
lower house _ said he would refuse to sign any political agreement
and would continue to oppose Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to consider any agreement on Monday,''
Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said. ``We won't sign
anything. It's pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Although opposition leaders have said they will present Yeltsin
on Monday with their own list of prime minister candidates, the
president _ as yet _ has shown no signs of backing off
Chernomyrdin's nomination. A third rejection of his nominee by
Parliament would require Yeltsin to disband Parliament and call for
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bad economic news kept piling up. With the
Central Bank unable to summon up the foreign currency reserves to
defend it, the value of the Russian ruble _ set at 6.2 to the
dollar three weeks ago _ again fell sharply, to 16.9, and stores
and currency offices around the city were trading at even weaker
rates.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the widening crack in Russia's financial
system, another major bank, Inkombank, was taken under the
temporary supervision of the Central Bank, following similar orders
imposed last week on SBS-Agro, the country's second-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation for the month of August was reported at 15 percent, an
official figure that paled next to the spiraling price rises
Russian citizens saw this week as they scoured stores for vanishing
supplies of domestic staples and imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   The country's mounting frustration and impatience with its
dawdling political leaders Friday finally penetrated the halls of
the giant building where the Duma, the lower house of Parliament,
meets.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of striking miners, who have been camped for
several months outside the Russian government building in a nonstop
protest against unpaid wages, flashed guest passes at the security
guards at the Duma building and briefly occupied its grand
staircase, rhythmically banging their miners' helmets against the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant ultranationalist leader who
announced on Thursday that he would swing his 51 parliamentary
deputies behind Chernomyrdin's candidacy, also staged an eruption
from the floor of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar rate is already almost 20 rubles and there are
lines at food stores even in Moscow,'' he shouted into the
microphone. ``Everything is being swept away, and then we will be
blamed. Either we will be disbanded, or we approve Chernomyrdin,
but we will be accused of exploding the ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address Friday, Chernomyrdin urged legislators to end the
political name-calling and come to grips with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no joke,'' he said. ``A couple of weeks from now
rivers will begin to freeze in Siberia. The delivery of supplies
there will be paralyzed or has already been paralyzed. Even in
prosperous Moscow, consumers are clearing out store shelves. Are
you treating this as a joking matter?''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup against Chernomyrdin in the lower house did not
change Friday, even after he picked up an endorsement from a
majority in Parliament's upper house, which is made up of leaders
from Russia's 89 regions. But the upper house does not have a vote
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Chernomyrdin's speech, outlining the economic measures
to bring Russia out of its crisis, seem to sway anyone. If
anything, the program was largely ignored Friday as the debate
focused on the search for a political compromise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Chernomyrdin and his supporters said Friday that
they thought his chances for confirmation on Monday had improved.
As the days go by, deputies from small left-wing parties, pressed
by an increasingly unhappy electorate and by regional bosses who
want to see a government move into the widening political void, may
choose a face-saving way out. They could also be swayed by promises
of ministerial portfolios, although such offers have less value
than usual, given the difficulties any government would face.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's offer to restart talks that had collapsed last weekend
signaled that he is still looking for ways to avoid the kind of
confrontation that could come with a disbanding of the lower house.
In 1993, such a confrontation led to an aborted mutiny and
Yeltsin's order to shell the Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   On the table on Monday, when Yeltsin meets with leaders from
both houses of Parliament, will be a political agreement that calls
for a redistribution of the considerable powers conferred on the
president under the 1993 constitution, which he himself drew up.
The agreement would also impose a political cease-fire on both
Parliament and the president, designed to stop the brinkmanship
that has brought Russia to a crisis point so many times in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   To back up his peace offer, the president Friday submitted a law
that would give Parliament more say in the appointment of cabinets
_ a point that the Communists had pressed in negotiations last
weekend. Other parts of the political agreement call for a
moratorium on no-confidence votes against the government and a halt
to impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party backed out of a similar agreement last
Sunday, preparing the ground for the rejection of Chernomyrdin the
next day. Their reasons for backtracking remain unclear, but most
experts say they probably see greater advantage in staying clear of
an unpopular government and an increasingly unpopular president. In
a recent poll of 1,500 citizens taken by the Social Opinion
research group, 66 percent said Yeltsin should resign.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment proceedings are begun next week in the lower
house, as the Communists have threatened, another confrontation
could explode. The constitution does not allow a president to
disband the lower house once it has begun impeachment proceedings,
while it compels the president to disband the lower house if it
rejects his choice for prime minister three times. If both events
happen at once, the issue is referred to the courts _ a recipe for
either more paralysis or more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Had the lower house held its second vote on Chernomyrdin's
candidacy Friday, as was planned, he would have surely been
defeated, setting the stage for a third vote in another week. Given
the urgency of the economic crisis, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin have
tried to raise the stakes for the second vote, in order to avoiding
dragging the political battle on for another week.

6 CHILDREN FOUND STRANGLED AFTER MOTHER CONFESSES TO 911
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ A mother of six, living in poverty and
estranged from her husband, called 911 on Thursday night, police
said, and made a shocking statement: she had killed her children.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramedics rushed to her apartment and found the
bodies of three girls and three boys, ages 5 to 11. The woman,
Khoua Her, 24, was lying inside the doorway wearing a fancy red
dress. The body of one of the children was behind her. The woman
was in custody at Region's Hospital here. The medical examiner's
office said the children had been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   In the call to 911, the woman had spoken about suicide. But it
was unclear whether she had harmed herself.
</P>
<P>
   As a 13-year-old girl, Khoua Her was paired with her husband in
an arranged marriage in her native Laos, neighbors said. When her
babies started to arrive, they came almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is a center for the Hmong, refugees from Laos who have
long struggled economically. But police and civic officials were
careful to play down any notion that such a horrific event had any
cultural underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been called to the apartment at least 15 times in the
last 18 months for domestic turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the deaths ``very, very tragic,'' Chief William Finney
of the St. Paul Police said: ``We see this across cultures. It
doesn't matter what culture you're from, American or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The family live in a two-story housing project in a racially and
ethnically mixed community. There was a hush and a somberness among
adults and children who could not quite believe what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the deaths, more than 150 people had gathered
outside. A voice called out for respect, pleading, ``Can we get a
moment of silence for these six angels that's gone?'' The
Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the woman's husband, Tou Hang, had left the
apartment, and she had been dating another man, neighbors said. One
neighbor said she saw Ms. Her ``scoop up the kids'' and chase them
inside when he came to call recently.
</P>
<P>
   Finney acknowledged the many police visits to the apartment for
domestic violence, but said, ``There was never any indication the
children were in this kind of danger.'' Police records show at
least eight calls to the apartment since January.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Xiong, a friend of the woman's new boyfriend, told reporters
that the mother loved her children, but that she had regretted
marrying so young. The friend said Ms. Her was ``depressed over the
amount of responsibility she had.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend told The Star Tribune: ``She basically missed out on
all her teen-age years. She wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of her as kind of odd,'' the friend added,
``but I didn't think this would ever happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Christopher Yang, said the parents had taken turns
taking care of the children. He described the mother as ``someone
who was not really taking care of her kids,'' saying that she would
sometimes leave the apartment without taking them.
</P>
<P>
   The children were scheduled to return to school next week.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has long been a center of resettlement for refugees,
largely because of the work of Lutheran Social Services and other
religious organizations. Thousands of refugees have settled in
Minneapolis in recent years.
</P>

and illiterate, and street gangs have been growing among their
young people. Arranged marriages are common in the Hmong culture.
In general, the Hmong people do not mix very much among other

several years.

   Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul described the deaths as ``a
tragedy of overwhelming proportion.

Friday, and few of the neighborhood children played in the

CRASH VICTIM ROGER WILLIAMS, 54, FOUND WAY TO SPOT HEART RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, N.C.)  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Williams, a physician who pioneered the use of genetic
data to identify people at risk for cholesterol-related heart
disease, was among the 229 people who died in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 on Wednesday. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lived in Salt Lake City and conducted his research
there, at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He was on his
way to Geneva to lead an international meeting of scientists
engaged in finding genetic diseases through extensive genealogical
research.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman Starke, the executive vice president of the American
Heart Association, said Williams' death was ``a huge loss to the
preventative cardiovascular effort in the United States.'' He said
Williams had done much to shape the preventive approach to heart
disease by ``finding ways to identify the people who are most
likely to get in trouble before they actually do get into any
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' work in this field concentrated on genetic familial
hypercholesterolemia, an inherited form of high cholesterol that
contributes to heart attack and stroke among people under the age
of 55. Some young and seemingly healthy athletes have actually had
the condition and have suddenly collapsed and died of heart
attacks. In fact, about 100,000 deaths a year are attributed to
this genetically triggered sudden rise in cholesterol, with about 5
percent of American families carrying the genetic variations that
can lead to premature heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic marker associated with this condition was identified
in the late 1970s by Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, who in
1985 won the Nobel Prize in physiology for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was quick to realize that, aside from advancing
molecular biology, the discovery provided a powerful diagnostic
tool. Moreover, he realized that his home state of Utah offered an
ideal social environment for tracing the genetic predisposition for
heart disease. Not only did Utah have large families, but because
of the Mormons' collection of genealogical data, an abundance of
family trees existed. Williams was able to use this information,
involving 1.3 million people, to seek out those who had the trait
and to analyze the ways the risk was distributed within the
population. Once identified, those whose family histories indicated
vulnerability could be notified and treated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Williams observed that although scientists had
succeeded in pinpointing the genetic factors that put many people
at high risk, ``we're still having great difficulty in alerting
both the public and the health care profession to the need for
screening and treatment for people with a family history of early
cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that about one-third of those with genetic
hypercholesterolemia had been diagnosed, while the ``other
two-thirds are unaware of their potentially lethal condition.''
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Williams was a professor of internal medicine at
the University of Utah School of Medicine and the director of the
university's Cardiovascular Genetics Research Clinic, which he
founded. After graduating from Weber State University in Ogden,
Utah, in 1971, he completed medical school at the University of
Utah and served his residency at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Linda, and seven children.

SWITZER SEES NO TUNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of his first fall without a football job since 1993,
Barry Switzer isn't backing down from his belief that there aren't
enough differences between last year's 6-10 Cowboys and this year's
edition to leave room for great optimism.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the Cowboys' 1998 season opener tomorrow
against the Arizona Cardinals, Switzer does not offer any
second-guessing of owner Jerry Jones, coach Chan Gailey, the
Cowboys and their winless, action-packed preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer said he remains best-buddy close with Jones, possesses a
rather guileless affection for even the Cowboys players who never
respected him, and feels comfortable enough with successor Gailey
to be host of a dinner honoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThursday night\S I invited Chan and all the Cowboys coaches
to join me over at my restaurant \RYvette in Addison\S,'' Switzer
says. ``There's nothing but good feelings there. I'd never do
anything to hurt the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   But, that doesn't mean Switzer thinks the Cowboys are much
better than the 6-10 team of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, they haven't helped themselves at the skill
positions on offense, and that defensive line is going to really
have to improve quickly, or the same things that happened last year
_ a defense that got worn down _ is going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Switzer see happening for some of the key Cowboys
season?
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman: ``I made mistakes with Troy. I didn't handle it
right. They were innocent, but I regret them. I could have handled
things differently, but understand something: I didn't make the
mistakes on purpose. I hear people accuse me of that, and it's the
dumbest thing I ever heard of! Why would I sabotage one of the keys
to my team's success? Ridiculous!
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy will need a supporting cast. Brett Favre might not need
one. He might improvise his way to a touchdown. You give Troy a
supporting cast though, and he's as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin: ``We went back and looked at
films of '92, four films. Saw Emmitt and Michael, with a burst that
neither of them have anymore. But they can still win. It's not
about want-to with those guys, I'll promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Johnston: ``D.J., the punishment he takes, the nature of
that neck injury, I'm surprised he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nate Newton: ``I said all along, big Nate gets himself in shape,
if he wants to make that last hurrah, he's got such good feet, he
can be as good as any guard they run out there. With all the talk
of the Cowboys needing to go get a free-agent guard, I said, when
Nate's in shape, he's as good as any guard that was in free
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Switzer, who by reputation is the reason the Cowboys eroded
in both on- and off-field performance, feel vindicated by the
continued turmoil after his departure?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I don't care about vindication,'' he said. ``I worked
at my job, just as much as \RJimmy Johnson\S did. And that's
according to guys who were assistants to both of us. But I don't
take any satisfaction is seeing people do the wrong thing. People
have sometimes done the wrong thing since the beginning of time.
That's predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Switzer, the right thing now has little to do with sports.
Oh, he'll go to the Oklahoma-North Texas game today. He's
fascinated by Mark McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' home-run
record. He's saddened by news of Charles Haley's comeback attempt.
And one of these days he'll probably accept one of many invitations
to watch a Cowboys game from a Texas Stadium suite.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately, Switzer keeps getting calls from Hollywood.
Director Oliver Stone has seen Switzer's cameo performances in
three sports-related projects _ (''Arliss'' on HBO, ``Possums''
starring Mac Davis and ``Varsity Blues'' starring Jon Voight) _ and
is finding on-camera time for him in a major release, ``On Any
Given Sunday'', a Stone project that stars Al Pacino and Dennis
Quaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've decided there isn't going to be a movie based on my
``Bootlegger's Boy'' book,'' says Switzer, co-author of the
best-selling autobiography. ``There's probably some money to be
made, and it'd be a good movie. But I'm turning \RHollywood\S down
there. It'd just be a vanity project. What do I need that for?''
</P>
<P>
   Seems to be his feeling about a few things these days.

PIAZZA GIVES LEITER ALL THE HELP HE NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK Before the start of Friday night's game at Shea
Stadium, fans flocked behind the New York Mets' dugout, waving
signs wishing Mike Piazza a happy birthday. The well-wishers were
not totally selfless because many of the signs also bore messages
begging the slugging catcher to stay in New York after this
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the game, a banner in the bleachers skipped the birthday
greetings and simply said, ``N.Y. Mike.'' The fans raised it, and
Piazza nearly put a hole through it in the fourth inning, ripping a
two-run home run, estimated at 485 feet, just to the left and
beyond it to put the Mets in front for good in a 2-1 victory over
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone got a great souvenir if they were out there on the
highway with the window open,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Mets one game behind the Chicago Cubs, who
beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-2 Friday night, in the National
League's wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza celebrated with a line single to center in his
first at-bat, a walk on four pitches after the home run, and
another bullet to right for a single in the eighth inning, what the
Mets got on his 30th birthday was a masterful five-hit, complete
game performance by Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish for Leiter came in the top of the seventh
inning when he retired the first two batters but allowed the
Braves' only run. Greg Colbrunn reached on an infield single and
Ryan Klesko ripped a line drive to center. Brian McRae started in,
but the ball sailed over his left shoulder and rolled to the wall,
scoring Colbrunn from first.
</P>
<P>
   While Leiter was sharp, Piazza was overpowering. He homered for
the third consecutive game and has eight home runs and 20 runs
batted in over his last 10 games, with 18 hits in 31 at-bats. It
was the red-hot Piazza who carried the Mets to a 5-4 mark on their
West Coast trip, hitting .536 during the nine games. No wonder the
home fans greeted him with a standing ovation in his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   After the home run, Piazza, who has been booed soundly at home,
was treated to another ovation by most of the 36,617 fans. And
after his single in the eighth, the fans sang ``Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honored, not only by the cheers, but by the nice calls
and gifts,'' Piazza said later. ``I was honored at the response.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fans had much to cheer about as the Mets defeated the Braves
for the first time in six games this season. While the Mets may
harbor no hopes of catching the division-leading Braves, who still
hold a 13-game lead on the Mets, they did need to put a dent in
Atlanta's dominance, since this was the first of seven games the
Mets have with the Braves in their final 22 games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's home run provided the margin that Leiter needed in a
duel of left-handers with Tom Glavine, who entered the game with an
18-5 record, including an 11-1 mark and a 1.81 earned run average
on the road. Glavine was equally sharp, allowing just five hits in
seven innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter, who improved to 14-5, won for the fourth time in his
last five outings. He retired the first six batters, and when he
walked Klesko leading off the third, he promptly erased him with a
double play. Leiter allowed a pair of singles in the fourth inning,
but again got out of trouble by getting Andruw Jones to ground to
second. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leiter survived a scare in the ninth when Chipper Jones, leading
off, drilled a shot into the third deck in left field that curved
foul. Jones then reached on a walk. But Javy Lopez grounded to
third baseman Edgardo Alfonso, who rifled a throw to second baseman
Luis Lopez, who turned the double play, the Mets' third of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter threw only 112 pitches, a low number for him. But because
he had to bear down on every pitch in a game of such importance, he
said, the ``mental pain'' made the outing seem more strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey started the game in right field for the Mets, his
first appearance since Aug. 2 when he strained his left hamstring.
But after playing four innings and grounding out to the mound in
the fourth, he was removed and replaced by Brian McRAE. ``I don't
want to baby it,'' Huskey said before the game. ``I have to find
out if it's good or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton made his first major-league start, in left field.
Payton, who underwent two major surgeries on his right elbow in the
last three years, entered the game on Tuesday in San Diego on a
double-switch and was 2-for-2. Friday night he went 0-for-3 and had
an uneventful game in the field, catching the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley caught his first game Friday night since last
September, working behind the plate at Norfolk for the first five
innings of the first game of a doubleheader. No runners tried to
steal on him, and he was 1-for-2 at the plate with a walk. He
played left field in the second game.

NORTH KOREA SAYS IT WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED OF TESTING A MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Adds info on Russia's possible detection of a new satellite
and on the possibility that both a missile and satellite were
launched; polishing throughout.)  
(js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea said Friday that the purpose of its
launching on Monday of a two-stage rocket was to carry a satellite
into orbit, not to test a missile. It denounced Japan and other
countries for jumping to the conclusion that it was launching a new
class of missile.
</P>
<P>
   Military and scientific experts in the United States, Japan and
South Korea immediately began reviewing their data, but their
initial reaction to the North Korean announcement was deep
skepticism. Officials said that they had not detected any new
satellite and that they were reasonably sure that what they had
monitored was a missile test.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, however, a tracking station run by the military said
it had detected an object in space that might be the satellite the
North Koreans say they have launched, Agence France-Presse
reported. But Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, said that
Japanese technology should have picked up a satellite if one had
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we cannot consider that this was a launch of a
satellite,'' a Japanese National Defense Agency official told NHK
television in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it is possible that both sides are right. North
Korea could have launched a Taepodong-1 ballistic missile as a test
and used the missile's flight to place a small satellite into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of the two-stage rocket caused deep alarm in Japan
and provoked a chorus of denunciation in Tokyo and Washington. The
rocket passed over Japan, with the first stage dropping into the
sea before reaching Japan and the second stage dropping in the
ocean on the other side, and the idea of a North Korean rocket
whizzing overhead gave the Japanese people a new and more immediate
sense of their vulnerability to enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missiles are not considered particularly useful
militarily, because they are quite inaccurate and could not
dependably hit their targets. But the test provoked concern among
some experts because it suggested that the missiles could now, for
the first time, reach any part of Japan, including Tokyo, and
because it indicated that North Korea had worked out the technology
for multi-stage rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean an initial range of about 1,000 miles for a
one-ton payload, but by improving the technology and lightening the
load, North Korea might in the coming years develop
intercontinental ballistic missiles and threaten U.S. soil. Since
North Korea is believed to have some nuclear weapons and huge
stocks of chemical weapons, the missile technology has aroused
fears of the payload that the missiles could carry.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket launching on Monday came at a time of growing
international exasperation with North Korea, and politicians in
Tokyo and Washington alike seemed ready to put more pressure on the
North Korean government. North Korea had not previously commented
on the launching, although it had complained that Japanese critics
did not know what they were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in launching the
first artificial satellite aboard a multi-stage rocket into
orbit,'' the official Korean Central News Agency declared in
Friday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal
revolutionary hymns Song of General Kim Il Sung and Song of General
Kim Jong Il,'' the dispatch said. Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994,
was North Korea's longtime ruler. His son, Kim Jong Il, now rules
the country and is expected to be appointed president soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The successful launching of the first artificial satellite in
the DPRK,'' the wire said, referring to North Korea, ``greatly
encourages the Korean people in the efforts to build a powerful
socialist state under the wise leadership of the Great Leader Kim
Jong Il.''
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea has almost no credibility among neighboring
countries, officials did not quite rule out the possibility that
North Korea was telling the truth about a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to verify whether North Korea fired its
missile for satellite purposes,'' said Kim Young Min, a spokesman
for South Korea's Unification Ministry. ``I don't think we will be
able to verify that fact in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. Space Command was
searching the skies for evidence of a new satellite in orbit.A
senior government official said there was no question that North
Korea fired a Taepodong-1 missile on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that even if the missile did
carry a satellite, the launching remained a grave concern for the
administration because of the technological advances it
demonstrated. ``No matter the purpose, it demonstrated the
capability to deliver a weapons payload against surface targets at
medium ranges,'' the official said.

MAN CHARGED IN DRAWING OF SWASTIKAS IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a week he was a busy man, the police said: He
roamed through the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, leaving symbols of Nazi Germany in his
wake.
</P>
<P>
   But the string of hits with a felt-tip marker ended Friday
morning, when two transit bureau police officers took notice of a
man rendering a swastika on an elevated subway platform and slapped
the cuffs on him, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came with a twist: The man, identified by the police
as Christopher Maldonado, 31, was dressed in Hasidic clothing,
complete with a skull cap on his head and a prayer shawl under his
black suit. He wore a full beard, the police said, but he had gone
on his spree without the distinctive side curls worn by the
Hasidim.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado professed to being a practicing Hasidic Jew, and to
prove it he opened his bag; along with the markers and a German
tour book, he was lugging around 15 Hebrew books, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was Puerto Rican but converted to Judaism in
1985,'' said Capt. John Ward, the executive officer at the 90th
Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado faces charges of possession of graffiti tools and at
least eight counts of aggravated harassment, Ward said. Each
harassment charge carries up to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said: ``We spoke in Yiddish, and he admitted it.'' When I
asked him why, he just said that the people who usually bothered
him were other Jewish people and he wanted to get back at them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police said Maldonado had been busy with retribution Friday.
Shortly after 1 a.m., a man told the police that he had yelled at
Maldonado while the suspect was drawing swastikas on aluminum light
poles on the street. Just before 9 a.m., a member of the
neighborhood's safety patrol reported seeing Maldonado drawing
swastikas on a telephone booth. Maldonado later said he had been
angered by a nearby candy store owner who had kicked him out of the
store, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Maldonado was caught drawing a final swastika, 6
inches by 6 inches, on the wall of the subway platform at 9:10 a.m.
Then he told the authorities about the weeklong spree, giving them
precise locations, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps remembering more, and so far, he's been right about
every location,'' Ward said. ``It's not like he's the Green River
Killer, but he keeps unearthing swastikas for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado, who was also wanted on a 1993 menacing charge,
appears to have otherwise kept a low profile over the last five
years. The police said he had no convictions on record and seemed
to live on welfare payments. When not living on the street, he kept
a room at a $9-a-night hotel on Broadway in Williamsburg, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working in the Hasidic community for 13 years and
I've never seen anything like this guy,'' Ward said. ``At this
point, I really haven't been able to figure him out.''

COMMENTARY: YOUTHS' VOICES AREN'T SILENT, JUST IGNORED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crossfire is an appropriate starting point for a
discussion with the Rev. Anthony Nathaniel Lucas. Break the word
down to its components and you have symbols of faith, suffering and
redemption. Taken as one word, it is something that has touched
Lucas' life when he has had to pray over the bodies of young people
who died violently.
</P>
<P>
   He saw an added meaning to the metaphor of the middle as he
talked about Saturday's youth rally in Harlem. The volleys of
denunciations and fears of violence that have accompanied the
so-called Million Youth March since it was announced have almost
obliterated the rally's stated goal of reaching out to urban youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a power problem with Khallid Muhammad and Mayor
Giuliani battling,'' Lucas said. ``They're not focused on the youth
because they're focused on their own agendas, whatever that may be.
But the youth are always caught in the crossfire. They are
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas seems youthful himself, even though at 32 he has a newly
minted doctorate in theology. He credits whatever trace of youth he
possesses to a career spent working with young people, especially
in southeast Queens. For seven years he ran a youth ministry at
Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, before deciding this
summer to broaden his scope and ambition and strike out on his own
with the Joel Deliverance Church, a congregation that he hopes will
unite children and adults as they confront problems in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas favors strategies, not slogans, which can seem to be in
short supply in the arguments of those who have eagerly stepped
into the rally's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone asked me what's the purpose of this march, other
than to raise self-esteem, I wouldn't know what it was,'' he said.
``I'd like to see people march to the schools in southeast Queens
or the Bronx and protest for the kids who are in school. March to
the stock market or wherever the jobs are and get them jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lost opportunity here, he said, one that has informed
his work with young people around the country, where he has
listened to their concerns about sex, drugs, violence and peer
pressure. The most important thing he has learned is that young
people want to be heard. Sounds simple, but he said it has eluded
even preachers with good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to listen to youth,'' he said. ``They are
the real thermostat for what's happening in the community. They
know what others feel. They may even have some answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The young people he works with do have questions. David
Latimore, a lanky 14-year-old, wonders why he sees so many
teen-agers cutting classes. He is also puzzled about why schools
are crumbling and overcrowded while the public is in the grip of
Lotto mania. Weren't those dollars supposed to support education?
He feels as if he is part of an invisible generation, especially
when he sees what has dominated the public debate lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see what young people think,'' David said. ``The
news is about what's going on in the president's life. Who wants to
know about his sex life? There are more important things. Young
people have problems, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' 14-year-old brother, Hurron, raised another issue. He was
curious about summer jobs, since he couldn't get one this year.
Instead, he saw day camp jobs filled by ``old people'' in their
20s. Fortunately, he kept himself busy at home and church. He has
good morals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also vexed him that despite his upbringing, he still gets
followed by store clerks when he goes shopping. It happened last on
Tuesday at a sneaker store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stare at you,'' he said. ``A lot. And they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers hate the idea of being judged by skin color or
clothing. They insist that adults could learn from them, even from
those written off as hoodlums. Lucas recounted how in his previous
ministry he was able to reach troubled youths through several new
strategies, like letting them preach in church, and one very old
one: listening to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be heard,'' he said. ``When you talk of black and
Latino kids, they're a forgotten generation. It's a fear that has
to do with ignorance and negative hype. We're taught to fear them
without giving them the chance to tell us what they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is evident. ``If we don't deal with them now and
let them become monsters, once they're through with each other,
who's next?'' he said. ``We are.''

DEL RIO, TEXAS, TRIES TO RECAPTURE NORMALCY THROUGH FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Stacy Feducia 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ They played football at Ram Stadium here last
night.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the portable toilets dotting the corners of the
historic San Felipe neighborhood. In spite of the search-and-rescue
spray-painted Xs on the three-walled houses scheduled for
bulldozers. In spite of the flood waters that swallowed part of
their town.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, the first Friday night of football, and
this was their archrival Eagle Pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the eyes of Del Rio are on you tonight _ they want to come
here and have fun and watch their football team play,'' Rams head
coach Joe George said in the locker room before kickoff. ``They
have seen a lot of tragedy. They have seen a lot of heroes. We can
be heroes tonight. We can be 60 men who give them everything we
have. This can be our finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be our finest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many. Though Eagle Pass won, 28-21, the Del Rio
Rams were heroes long before they walked through the Ram Stadium
gate.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Aug. 23, rain began to fall from the leftovers of
Tropical Storm Charley. Twenty-four hours later, more than 600
homes had been destroyed, nine people were dead, and an estimated
1,500 people were sleeping on aluminum camping cots at the Red
Cross shelter in the Del Rio Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   That Tuesday, they had football practice.
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio is the only high school in town. It is 54 miles from the
nearest Class 5A school in Eagle Pass and three hours in a school
bus from its District 26-5A opponents in southwest San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a Del Rio coffee mug 140 miles from nowhere and
three feet from hell,'' Rams trainer Brad Dixon joked. ``Not many
of these folks are here by choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many of them return after going away to college either,
school board member Lewis Nunley said. The town has about 34,000
people; the high school, about 2,100. The varsity has won one game
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thinks we're going to win this game,''
junior free safety Chris Villarreal said. ``But we're gonna prove
them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio had beaten Eagle Pass for 13 consecutive years before
losing in 1996, and they were beating them again last season until
the Eagles scored in the last minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All summer we worked so hard,'' senior team captain Justin
Henegar said. ``Everyone was in the weight room. This was the most
important game. We were completely focused on Eagle Pass, and then
this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That first football practice began with hopeful phone calls and
tentative drives to the homes of some 80 players. It began with
helmets and shorts and only half a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what had happened to the others,'' said senior
John Alexaitis, who volunteered to serve meals at the civic center.
``Maybe a day or two later, they started coming back, but a lot of
people were sick from the water and a lot of people still had to
help clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   The second day of practice, Brackett High School, 24 miles away,
offered its showers and practice field for a morning. One parent
laughed at the irony of 78 football players getting cleaned up and
showered, while the rest of the town smelled bad because the water
wasn't running.
</P>
<P>
   The failed water system has kept school closed for two weeks,
and Tuesday is the earliest it could reopen.
</P>
<P>
   Only one player on the team lost everything. Others sustained
varying degrees of water damage, none too severe. A spaghetti
dinner benefit is planned for a freshman volleyball player whose
house was washed away, coach Val Warrior said.
</P>
<P>
   No school-aged children were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the spaces between two-a-days, the players found their finest
hours, sharing in the camaraderie of trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Villarreal removed branches from the living room of his elderly
neighbor's home. A few nights before, he and his father had carried
her four grandchildren from the overwhelmed house to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Henegar and eight other players helped the National Guard unload
a semi-trailer sent from Dickinson High School last week and filled
a funeral tent with canned goods, bottled water and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, they gave us these pins that said `I Love DHS' and
told us to wear them the next day at school,'' said Herman Flores,
a junior quick guard. ``We haven't had school yet, but I've got
that pin in my Jeep. I'm gonna wear it when we get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong side guard Baldemar Briones lives on a ranch adjacent to
the creek and missed the first week of practice as he helped his
father recover their damaged property.
</P>
<P>
   Briones found two of his goats hanging dead from their horns in
mesquite trees. A round bale of hay clung to a fence post four feet
off the ground. Railroad cross ties poked from pecan branches like
windmill blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to come back to practice,'' Briones said. ``I
don't think we should have had it. We needed some time to get over
the main stuff, and get things back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Normalcy will wean the 73 remaining refugees from the civic
center and give it back to BINGO night and Chamber of Commerce
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Normalcy came yesterday with the arrival of the first mobile
homes for displaced families at the American Campground. Normalcy
will be permanent when American Red Cross volunteers, FEMA workers
and supply trucks recede like the journalists and camera vans and
rains before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal is what we want,'' said Red Cross volunteer Patricia
Zawlocki of Indiana. ``The numbers of people in the shelter drop
every night. For their mental health, we want them to get back to
their normal lifestyle, like watching movies, cooking dinner,
attending church.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight players formed a matrix across the practice field
Thursday morning at 9 o'clock. His hands clasped behind his back,
George gave an order for push-ups and shouted ``Down! _ Down! _
Down!'' as their bodies rose and fell to his command, just as they
had in every practice for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot next to Ram Stadium, the 230-member Ram Band
_ the pride of Del Rio _ marched with empty spaces in formation for
the 20 or so flood-stricken students who haven't yet returned
because ``they are still a part of this band,'' director Juan Nanez
said.
</P>
<P>
   And last night, they returned to normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   They played football because they wanted to keep score on
something less significant than persons missing, bodies recovered,
families displaced.
</P>
<P>
   They played football because it was the first game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It was, indeed, their finest hour.
